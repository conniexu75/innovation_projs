https://openalex.org/W2119438916,"Biological invasions are a pervasive and costly environmental problem1,2 that has been the focus of intense management and research activities over the past half century. Yet accurate predictions of community susceptibility to invasion remain elusive. The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion3,4,5, is supported by both theory6 and experimental studies7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales3,11,15,16. Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies17,18,19, we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods. Both the establishment (number of invaders) and success (proportion of invaders that are large) of invading plants are reduced. These results suggest that local biodiversity represents an important line of defence against the spread of invaders."

For example, morphologically abnormal mitochondria and impaired mitochondrial histoenzymatic respiratory chain activities have been described in motor neurons of patients with sporadic ALS. To investigate further the role of mitochondrial alterations in the pathogenesis of ALS, we studied mitochondria from transgenic mice expressing wild type and G93A mutated hSOD1. We found that a significant proportion of enzymatically active SOD1 was localized in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Mitochondrial respiration, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were severely defective in G93A mice at the time of onset of the disease. We also found evidence of oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins and lipids. On the other hand, presymptomatic G93A transgenic mice and mice expressing the wild type form of hSOD1 did not show significant mitochondrial abnormalities. Our findings suggest that G93A-mutated hSOD1 in mitochondria may cause mitochondrial defects, which contribute to precipitating the neurodegenerative process in motor neurons.

The onset of the disease is generally in the 4th and 5th decade, and it progresses over an average of 5 years leading to progressive paralysis and premature death (1Adams R.D. Victor M. Ropper A.H. Principles of Neurology. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1997: 1089-1094Google Scholar). Although the majority of the cases are sporadic and due to unknown causes, about 5–10% are familial (FALS), of which ∼25% are associated with mutations in the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) (2Esteban J.

The symptoms and pathology of FALS patients resemble those of patients with the sporadic form of ALS, suggesting that the mechanisms of neurodegeneration share common pathways. Since the initial report (7Shaw C.E. Enayat Z.E. Chioza B.A., Al- Chalabi A. Radunovic A. Powell J.F. Leigh P.N. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 43: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) of mutant SOD1, more than 90 different mutations of the SOD1gene have been found in FALS patients. Because these mutations do not always affect the dismutase activity (8Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M., Xu, Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown R.H., Jr. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc.

Genet. 1999; 8: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a toxic gain of function of the mutated protein has been postulated, possibly causing enhanced reactive oxygen species generation (10Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In the motor neurons of transgenic mice expressing the G93A-mutated SOD1 (11Gurney M.E., Pu, H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X. et al.Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar), among other pathological features is the presence of membrane-bound vacuoles deriving from mitochondrial degeneration. In these mice, the onset of the paralysis is immediately preceded by an increase in degenerating mitochondria (12Kong J. Xu Z. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that mitochondrial alterations might represent a triggering factor in precipitating the degeneration of motor neurons. A decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and disturbed mitochondrial calcium homeostasis have also been reported (13Kruman I.I. Pedersen W.A. Springer J.E. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 160: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) in cultured primary motor neurons from G93A mice. Reduced respiratory chain activities were found in the spinal cord of G93A mice (14Browne S.E. Bowling A.C. Baik M.J. Gurney M. Brown R.H., Jr. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These mice also showed increased vulnerability to the mitochondrial toxins 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, a complex I inhibitor, and 3-nitropropionic acid, a complex II inhibitor (15Andreassen O.A.

Another indication of mitochondrial dysfunction in FALS mice comes from the observation that supplementation of creatine, which takes part in the mitochondrial energy buffering and transfer system, improves motor performance and extends survival in G93A SOD1 mutant mice (16Klivenyi P.

Abstr. 2001; 31: 580-585Google Scholar), a substantial amount of SOD1 is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. SOD1 might have a role in protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage as suggested by an increase of oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins in yeast lacking SOD1 (18Sturtz L.A. Diekert K.

In the present study we further investigated the mitochondrial localization of wild type and mutated hSOD1 in transgenic mice and its role in the development of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction in mice expressing G93A-mutated hSOD1. Mice transgenic for the G93A-mutated hSOD1 (11Gurney M.E., Pu, H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X. et al.Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar) and wild type hSOD1 (N1029 (11Gurney M.E., Pu, H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X. et al.Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar)) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University animal facility. Transgenic mice were identified by PCR of tail DNA as described (11Gurney M.E., Pu, H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X. et al.Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). G93A mice started to show signs of paralysis at age 14–16 weeks. The average age of death for G93A hSOD1 transgenic mice was 19 ± 1 weeks. N1029 mice were phenotypically normal even at 1 year of life. Mice were sacrificed, and brain, liver, and spinal cord were promptly removed and mitochondria freshly isolated. For respiration, ATP synthesis assays, the whole liver was homogenized with 8 ml of buffer H, containing 0.22m d-mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2, in a glass-Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in a small volume (250 μl) of buffer H and kept on ice. The final protein concentration was 40–60 mg/ml. Mitochondria from a whole mouse brain were extracted by homogenization in 2 ml of buffer H. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was kept on ice, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer H and subjected to a second centrifugation at 1,500 × g. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 13,500 ×g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 50–100 μl of buffer H and kept on ice. The final protein concentration was 20–40 mg/ml. All centrifugation steps were performed at 4 °C. Mitochondria from a whole spinal cord were extracted by homogenization in 1 ml of buffer H as described above, and the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer. For Western blot and activity gel analyses, mitochondria were purified in a 1–1.7 m sucrose gradient, and mitoplasts were obtained by digitonin treatment as described (23Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Aliquots of purified mitochondria and mitoplasts were treated with 250 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min on ice, after which 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. To estimate the degree of purity of the post-mitochondrial supernatant, mitochondria, and mitoplasts, the residual activities of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the mitochondrial outer membrane monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), and the mitochondrial matrix citrate synthase (CS) were measured as described (24Greenawalt J.W. Schnaitman C. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For biochemical assays of respiratory chain enzyme activities, mitochondria and synaptosomes from brain and spinal cord were purified in a Ficoll gradient as described (25Pallotti F. Lenaz G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, post-mitochondrial supernatants, mitochondria, and mitoplasts were electrophoresed through a 15% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransfered to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was immunostained with sheep anti-human SOD1 antibodies (that recognize both human and mouse SOD1) and then with donkey anti-sheep IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of immunostained fragments was performed by densitometry using a Fluor-S MultiImager System (Bio-Rad). SOD1 activity was detected on post-mitochondrial fractions, and isolated purified mitochondria were treated with proteinase K by activity assays in polyacrylamide gels (9Ratovitski T. Corson L.B. Strain J. Wong P. Cleveland D.W. Culotta V.C. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) as described (8Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M., Xu, Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown R.H., Jr. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 26Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9524) Google Scholar). SOD1 activity was also determined by spectrophotometry as the ability to inhibit the reduction of tetrazolium salt induced by xanthine-xanthine oxidase as described (26Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9524) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-human SOD1 antibodies were also performed on post-mitochondrial supernatants and isolated purified mitochondria treated with proteinase K. Mitochondria were solubilized for 15–30 min on ice in 750 mm6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bistris, pH 7.0, with 5% lauryl maltoside for brain and spinal cord and 3% for liver plus protease inhibitors. Solubilized fractions were centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 min, and supernatants were used for non-denaturing (i.e. without β-mercaptoethanol and SDS) native gel electrophoresis in 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotting. Bands were detected as described above. For measurements of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ∼600 μg of liver, 400 μg of brain, and 250 μg of spinal cord mitochondrial proteins were resuspended in 0.3 ml of buffer R containing 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4. Oxygen consumption was measured in a Clark-type electrode oxygraph (Hansatech Inc., UK) with either 20 mm succinate or 30 mmglutamate plus 30 mm malate in the absence of exogenous ADP (state 2 respiration) and after addition of 300 mm ADP (state 3 respiration). Respiratory control ratios (RCR) were calculated as the ratios between state 3 and state 2 respiration. The ATPase inhibitor oligomycin (100 μg/ml) was then added to inhibit mitochondrial respiration. In normally coupled mitochondria the addition of oligomycin slows respiration to a rate similar to that of state 2, whereas in uncoupled mitochondria oligomycin inhibition is reduced. Thirty μg of liver, 100 μg of brain, and 50 μg of spinal cord mitochondrial proteins were utilized to measure ATP synthesis with a luciferase/luciferin-based system as described elsewhere (27Manfredi G. Spinazzola A. Checcarelli N. Naini A. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 133-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The digitonin treatment step in the described procedure was omitted, because purified mitochondria do not require permeabilization for substrates uptake. Mitochondrial carbonylated proteins were detected using an OxyBlot Kit (Intergen, Portland, OR). Twenty μg of post-mitochondrial supernatants and proteinase K-treated purified mitochondria were reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were electrophoresed through a 15% SDS-PAGE, electrotransfered to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and immunodetected with anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antibodies. For lipid peroxidation measurements, isolated brain mitochondria (0.8–1.7 mg of mitochondrial proteins) were resuspended in 90 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and pretreated with a combination of respiratory chain inhibitors (1.3 μm rotenone, 1.8 μm antimycin, 2 mm KCN, 10 mmmalonate). Lipid hydroperoxides were measured using an LPO-560 Kit (OxisResearch, Portland, OR) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Respiratory chain activity assays were performed on purified mitochondria and synaptosomes from brain and spinal cord. Complexes I + III (NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase), II + III (succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase), IV (cytochromec oxidase, COX), and CS activities were measured as described elsewhere (28Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For histoenzymatic staining, spinal cords were dissected and immediately frozen in dry ice-cooled isopentane. Ten-μm-thick cryosections were obtained from the lumbar portion of the spinal cord. Sections were histochemically stained for COX and SDH as described (29Tritschler H.J. Bonilla E. Lombes A. Andreetta F. Servidei S. Schneyder B. Miranda A.F. Schon E.A. Kadenbach B. DiMauro S. Neurology. 1991; 41: 300-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analyses for SOD1 were performed on mitochondrial fractions isolated from liver and brain and on post-mitochondrial supernatants (i.e. cytosolic fractions) of 13-week-old heterozygote G93A, age-matched non-transgenic controls, and 1-year-old heterozygote N1029 mice expressing wild type hSOD1. Mitoplasts were obtained by removal of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The purity of mitochondrial and mitoplast fractions was assessed by measuring residual activities of LDH (a cytosolic enzyme), MAO-B (an enzyme of the outer membrane of mitochondria), and CS (a soluble mitochondrial matrix enzyme). The purified mitochondrial fraction was virtually devoid of LDH but rich in MAO-B activity, whereas MAO-B was reduced to ∼7% in mitoplast fractions. CS was preserved in both mitochondrial and mitoplast fractions, indicating that the integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane was preserved (Fig. 1C). Aliquots of both mitochondria and mitoplasts were treated with proteinase K to digest all proteins localized on the outside of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively. Although the antibody used for the Western blots recognized both human and mouse SOD1, due to different gel mobility, mouse SOD1 migrated faster in the gel than the human form and was recognizable on the membrane as a lower band. In liver (Fig. 1A) and to a larger extent in brain (Fig.1B), a considerably large proportion of SOD1 appeared to be localized into mitochondria. Based on the amounts of mitochondrial proteins loaded in the gel and because in our preparation the mitochondrial fraction amounted to about 1% of total liver proteins, we estimated that ∼0.5% of total liver hSOD1 actually localized to mitochondria. After proteinase K treatment of purified mitochondria, the absolute amount of SOD1 was decreased severalfold, suggesting that a large proportion of the protein was localized on the external side of the outer membrane. In proteinase K-treated mitochondria, the proportion of hSOD1 was almost 3-fold higher than mouse SOD1. This proportion of mitochondrial SOD1 was mostly preserved in mitoplasts, but it almost totally disappeared after mitoplasts were treated with proteinase K (Fig. 1A), suggesting that SOD1 localized in mitochondria actually resided in the intermembrane space and was therefore sensitive to proteinase K digestion of the mitoplast fraction. The fact that SOD1 was still present in the mitoplasts after mild washes and that proteinase K treatment was necessary to entirely degrade it indicates that SOD1 is physically associated with components of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In brain mitochondria, the proportion of hSOD1 relative to the endogenous mouse SOD1 was far greater than in liver. The amount of SOD1 in mitochondria was estimated to represent 2–5% of total brain hSOD1. Also in brain most of the mitochondrial hSOD1 was contained in the intermembrane space, as demonstrated by resistance to proteinase K treatment of purified mitochondria. Again, hSOD1 in brain largely persisted after mitoplast preparation but totally disappeared when mitoplasts were treated with proteinase K (Fig. 1B). Native gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-SOD1 antibodies showed a band of immunoreactive material of ∼40–50 kDa, presumably corresponding to SOD1 dimers, in brain post-mitochondrial fraction, mitochondria, and mitochondria treated with proteinase K (Fig.2). Although equal amounts of proteins were loaded in the gel, the intensity of these bands was noticeably higher in the G93A sample. Moreover, in post-mitochondrial and mitochondrial fractions of G93A mice there were high molecular mass bands of ∼140 kDa, presumably corresponding to aggregated forms of mutated hSOD1 (Fig. 2). Aggregated forms of high molecular weight were not detected in N1029 and in non-transgenic mice, probably because wild type hSOD1 and endogenous mouse SOD1 have a lower tendency to aggregate. Proteinase K-treated mitochondria showed virtually no aggregated SOD1, suggesting that aggregation might occur predominantly in the cytosol and that the high molecular forms may not be able to penetrate the outer mitochondrial membrane. A similar pattern of aggregation was found in liver post-mitochondrial fractions and isolated mitochondria; however, no aggregated forms were detected in the mitochondrial fraction after proteinase K treatment (not shown). In liver, the intensities of the bands presumably corresponding to SOD1 were rather faint compared with those observed in brain. These findings were in agreement with the results obtained by denaturing Western blot showing higher SOD1 content in brain mitochondria (Fig. 1). The enzymatic activity of SOD1 was tested by gel assays of liver, brain, and spinal cord in post-mitochondrial and mitochondrial fractions treated with proteinase K. In the latter only the portion of SOD1 contained in the intermembrane space was left after proteinase K digestion. Dismutase activity was found in the post-mitochondrial fractions of liver, brain, and spinal cord of 17-week-old heterozygote G93A, age-matched non-transgenic littermate controls, and 1-year-old homozygote N1029 mice (Fig. 3, A and C). As expected, in all tissues tested SOD1 activities were higher in transgenic mice as compared with non-transgenic ones. In agreement with the results obtained by denaturing and native Western blots (Figs. 1 and 2), proteinase K-treated brain and spinal cord mitochondria showed high levels of SOD1 activity, whereas SOD1 activity was low in liver mitochondria (Fig. 3, B and C). These data confirmed that enzymatically active SOD1 was present in mitochondria and that the levels of active mitochondrial SOD1 were higher in the central nervous system. Moreover, despite the fact that the expression levels of SOD1 as determined by Western blot were similar, the activity of wild type hSOD1 in N1029 mice was clearly higher than in G93A mice both in post-mitochondrial supernatant and in mitochondria. This suggested that G93A-mutated hSOD1 has decreased dismutase activity. In the activity gel the high molecular weight forms of SOD1 observed in brain by native electrophoresis and immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 2) were not detected (Fig. 3A) and therefore did not appear to be enzymatically active. To confirm that G93A SOD1 had lower dismutase activity, SOD1 activity was also measured by spectrophotometry in brain post-mitochondrial fractions and in mitochondria treated with proteinase K. In G9A mice, SOD1 activity was reduced by ∼40% in post-mitochondrial fractions as compared with N1029 mice (188.2 ± 53.7 and 112.6 ± 31.6 units/mg, respectively; n = 8, p < 0.006) and by 34% in mitochondrial fractions (14.2 ± 5.5 and 9.5 ± 5.5 units/mg; n = 10, p < 0.06). Protein carbonylation, a marker of protein oxidative damage, was measured on mitochondria treated with proteinase K from brain and spinal cords of G93A, N1029, and non-transgenic littermate controls. Protein carbonyls of the mitochondrial fractions were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, and proteins were subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Bands corresponding to carbonylated proteins were detected with anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antibodies. In brain and to a lesser extent in spinal cord from 17-week-old G93A mice proteins showed higher levels of oxidative damage as compared with age-matched non-transgenic controls and 1-year-old N1029 mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, 1-year-old N1029 mice showed less protein oxidative damage both in brain and spinal cord mitochondria, not only compared with age-matched non-transgenic controls but also compared with 17-week-old non-transgenic animals (Fig. 4, A and B). These results were replicated on three different sets of animals and strongly suggested that in the central nervous system of this strain of mice expression of G93A-mutated hSOD1 enhanced oxidative damage of mitochondrial proteins, whereas expression of wild type hSOD1 seemed to have a protective effect. Mice expressing G93A-mutated hSOD1 also exhibited a marked increase in the content of brain mitochondrial lipid hydroperoxides, a product of lipid oxidative damage. Lipid hydroperoxides in 13-week-old G93A mice were 1.37 ± 0.4 nmol/mg mitochondrial proteins (mean ± S.D.), whereas in non-transgenic controls they were 0.66 ± 0.28 nmol/mg mitochondrial proteins (n = 6;p < 0.006). The increase in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation was even more pronounced at 17 weeks of age, when lipid hydroperoxides were 1.99 ± 0.82 and 0.71 ± 0.31 nmol/mg mitochondrial proteins in G93A and control brains, respectively (n = 10; p < 0.0006). Mitochondrial respiration was assayed by oxygen consumption on freshly isolated intact mitochondria from liver, brain, and spinal cord. Oxygen consumption was measured in a Clark-type electrode oxygraph using as substrates either succinate or glutamate plus malate in the absence of exogenous ADP (state 2 respiration) and after addition of ADP (state 3 respiration). We found no significant difference in state 2 respiration between G93A and non-transgenic age-matched control mice (not shown). However, in all three tissues, state 3 respiration, indicating the maximal rate at which oxygen can be utilized by the respiratory chain in coupled mitochondria, was significantly reduced in 17-week-old G93A mice as compared with non-transgenic age-matched controls (Fig.5A). The RCR, defined as the ratio between state 3 and state 2 respiration, was also significantly reduced in G93A mice (Fig. 5B). Upon addition of the ATPase inhibitor oligomycin, respiratory rates were decreased to levels similar to those of state 2 respiration (not shown), suggesting that respiration and ADP phosphorylation in mitochondria of G93A animals were still coupled. Therefore, we concluded that the decrease in RCR was to be attributed mainly to lower respiratory capacity rather than to uncoupling of mitochondria. ATP synthesis rate in 17-week-old G93A mice mitochondria was also significantly reduced in liver and brain using both succinate and glutamate plus malate and in spinal cord using glutamate plus malate as substrates (Fig. 5C). In 1-year-old N1029 mice expressing wild type hSOD1 state 3 respiration and RCR were unchanged as compared with their age-matched controls and to 17-week-old non-transgenic animals (Fig. 5, A and B). Despite normal respiration, ATP synthesis was reduced in liver, brain, and spinal cord mitochondria from 1-year-old N1029 animals compared with younger non-transgenic controls. However, there was no difference in ATP synthesis between transgenic N1029 and age-matched non-transgenic controls (Fig. 5C). Therefore, we concluded that the reduction in mitochondrial ATP synthesis in these mice was related to aging and not to the expression of wild type hSOD1. We found no significant change in state 3 respiration, RCR, and ATP synthesis in brain, spinal cord, and liver of 13-week-old mice, as compared with age-matched non-transgenic controls (not shown). These results demonstrated that the expression of G93A mutated hSOD1, but not wild type hSOD1, caused impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and that this impairment became detectable by functional assays on isolated mitochondria only in the advanced stages of the disease (i.e. when the animals start becoming symptomatic).

Water-borne spread of the diarrhoeal disease cholera occurs rapidly in nature, whereas infection of human volunteers with bacteria grown in vitro is difficult in the absence of stomach acid buffering. It is unclear, however, whether stomach acidity is a principal factor contributing to epidemic spread. Here we report that characterization of Vibrio cholerae from human stools supports a model whereby human colonization creates a hyperinfectious bacterial state that is maintained after dissemination and that may contribute to epidemic spread of cholera. Transcriptional profiling of V. cholerae from stool samples revealed a unique physiological and behavioural state characterized by high expression levels of genes required for nutrient acquisition and motility, and low expression levels of genes required for bacterial chemotaxis."

https://openalex.org/W2019098045,"Accretion of gas onto black holes is thought to power the relativistic jets of material ejected from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the ‘microquasars’ located in our Galaxy1,2,3. In microquasars, superluminal radio-emitting features appear and propagate along the jet shortly after sudden decreases in the X-ray fluxes1. This establishes a direct observational link between the black hole and the jet: the X-ray dip is probably caused by the disappearance of a section of the inner accretion disk4 as it falls past the event horizon, while the remainder of the disk section is ejected into the jet, creating the appearance of a superluminal bright spot5. No such connection has hitherto been established for AGN, because of insufficient multi-frequency data. Here we report the results of three years of monitoring the X-ray and radio emission of the galaxy 3C120. As has been observed for microquasars, we find that dips in the X-ray emission are followed by ejections of bright superluminal knots in the radio jet. The mean time between X-ray dips appears to scale roughly with the mass of the black hole, although there are at present only a few data points."

Phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 116 has been observed in intact endothelial cells subjected to hemodynamic shear stress (2Gallis B. Corthals G.L. Goodlett D.R. Ueba H. Kim F. Presnell S.R.

In these studies, we will show that the eNOS agonist vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes eNOS activation associated with the dephosphorylation of eNOS at serine 116 in a pathway blocked by the phosphatase inhibitor cyclosporin A. The principal molecular target of cyclosporin A is the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which is also known as protein phosphatase PP2B (10Graef I.A. Chen F. Chen L. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Calcineurin promotes the dephosphorylation of a restricted range of protein substrates of which the best characterized is the transcription factor NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) (11Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A is in widespread clinical use as an immunosuppressant but frequently causes hypertension; this principal side effect represents an important dose-limiting toxicity (12Cifkova R. Hallen H. J. Hypertens. 2001; 19: 2283-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that cyclosporin A attenuates endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (13Cairns H.S. Fairbanks L.D. Westwick J. Neild G.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Auch-Schwelk W. Bossaller C. Gotze S. Thelen J. Fleck E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but a clear relationship between calcineurin action and eNOS regulation has not yet been clearly established. One agonist known to activate calcineurin in endothelial cells is VEGF (15Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which is also one of the key activators of eNOS in the vessel wall. VEGF treatment of endothelial cells leads to a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ (16He H. Venema V.J., Gu, X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) as well as the activation of diverse protein tyrosine kinase and serine/threonine kinase pathways (17Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). VEGF promotes the activation of eNOS by Ca2+/calmodulin and also stimulates the protein kinase Akt, which directly phosphorylates eNOS on serine 1179 and increases enzyme activity (3Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar, 7Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-R75Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Because VEGF also activates the phosphatase calcineurin in endothelial cells (15Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), in the present studies we explored the hypothesis that VEGF modulates eNOS phosphorylation pathways involving calcineurin, and we have therefore analyzed patterns of VEGF-dependent eNOS activation and phosphorylation as modified by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT); all other cell culture reagents and media were from Invitrogen. VEGF, BAPTA (bis(O-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid), and wortmannin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and the MAP kinase pathway inhibitor U0126 was from Cell Signaling Technologies(Beverly, MA). Cyclosporin A was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-phospho-Ser116-eNOS and anti-phospho-Thr495-eNOS antisera were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-Ser1177-eNOS antiserum (Ser1177 in the human eNOS sequence corresponds to Ser1179 in bovine eNOS), anti-phospho-Akt antibody, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The Super Signal chemiluminescence detection reagents were from Pierce. l-[3H]arginine was fromAmersham Biosciences. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. FuGENE 6 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were from Sigma. The eNOS S116A mutant was constructed by standard PCR-based mutagenesis methods using cDNA encoding wild-type bovine eNOS (18Robinson L.J. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) as template, with flanking primers at the EcoRI and BglII sites located in the upstream polylinker and theBglII site in the middle of the eNOS-coding sequence, respectively. Following amplification, purification, restriction digestion, and molecular cloning of the PCR-generated fragment containing the mutation, the nucleotide sequence of the amplified region of the cDNA was validated by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using standard techniques. For construction of the S116A mutant, the upstream primer pair was comprised of the forward primer 5′-CGCGAATTCGAAGGAGCCACCATGGGCAACTTGAAGAG-3′ and the reverse (mutated) primer 5′-AGGTCCCGGGGCGGGCCGGGT-3′; the second primer pair was comprised of the forward primer 5′-ACCCGGCCCGCCCCGGGACCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCGAGATCTTCACCGCGTTG-3′ (the bold character notes the base pair that was altered to change Ser to Ala). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were obtained from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA) and maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) as described (19Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto gelatin-coated culture dishes and studied prior to cell confluence between passage 5 and 9; cells were serum-starved overnight prior to experimental treatments. COS-7 cells were maintained in culture, transfected with various cDNA constructs using FuGENE6 as described previously (19Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and studied 48 h following transfection. Cell lysates were prepared using a cell lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40, and the degree of protein expression and phosphorylation were assessed as we previously described in detail (19Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). eNOS activity in intact cultured cells was quantified as the formation ofl-[3H]citrulline froml-[3H]arginine as described previously (19Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times. Mean values for individual experiments were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were assessed by analysis of variance followed by Student's t test. A pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The fact that VEGF treatment of endothelial cells leads to the activation of calcineurin (15Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) led us to explore the effects of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A on VEGF-induced eNOS phosphorylation and enzyme activity. We found that pretreatment of BAEC with cyclosporin for 30 min completely blocked the robust increase in eNOS enzyme activity that was seen in response to VEGF treatment in control BAEC (Fig. 1). There was no substantive change in basal eNOS activity seen in BAEC treated with cyclosporin (Fig. 1), and cyclosporin pretreatment failed to block eNOS activation elicited by several other well known eNOS agonists including bradykinin (data not shown). We and others have extensively characterized the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of eNOS on serine 1179, and we have found that in immunoblots probed with phosphorylation state-specific antisera cyclosporin pretreatment had no effect on VEGF-induced phosphorylation at serine 1179 (Fig.2) or at threonine 497 (data not shown). By contrast, VEGF dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of eNOS on serine 116, assessed using an antiserum directed against eNOS phosphorylated at serine 116 (Fig. 2). VEGF-induced eNOS serine 116 dephosphorylation was completely blocked by pretreatment of BAEC with cyclosporin, with no change in the total eNOS protein recovered following these treatments (Fig. 2). As seen in Fig. 2, cyclosporin also markedly reduced VEGF-induced phosphorylation of kinase Akt and also attenuated VEGF-promoted ERK activation.FIG. 2Attenuation by cyclosporin A of VEGF-induced eNOS dephosphorylation in endothelial cells. A, representative immunoblot prepared from BAEC cells pretreated with cyclosporin A (100 nm) for 30 min and then treated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed in immunoblots (IB) probed separately, as indicated, with specific antibodies directed against Ser116-phospho-eNOS, Ser1179-phospho-eNOS, phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, and total eNOS. B, data pooled from six similar independent experiments exploring the VEGF-induced change in Ser116-phospho-eNOS in cells pretreated with cyclosporin A or vehicle (control) as indicated and then analyzed in immunoblots probed with the Ser116-phospho-eNOS antibody, which were quantitated by measuring the chemiluminescence (ChemiImager, Alpha Innotech) of the Ser116-phospho-eNOS immunoreactive band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next performed a more detailed pharmacological characterization of VEGF-induced eNOS dephosphorylation at serine 116. The time course of VEGF-induced eNOS dephosphorylation at serine 116 showed a maximal effect at 30 min and did not return to basal levels even 1 h after adding VEGF. This response is considerably slower than that seen with the VEGF-promoted phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 1179, which has a maximal response at 5 min and returns to basal levels by 30 min (Fig.3; see Ref. 16He H. Venema V.J., Gu, X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The dose response to VEGF showed an EC50 of 2 ng/ml (Fig. 3B), consistent with the EC50 observed with other biological responses elicited by VEGF (20Verheul H.M. Jorna A.S. Hoekman K. Broxterman H.J.

To more fully understand the consequences of eNOS phosphorylation at serine 116 on enzyme activity, we mutated serine 116 to alanine in the eNOS cDNA (to yield the plasmid S116A-eNOS) and transfected this construct into COS-7 cells. Immunoblots probed with the serine 116-phospho-eNOS antiserum detected a band corresponding to eNOS in COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type eNOS but not in cells transfected with the phosphorylation-deficient S116A eNOS mutant (Fig.4). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the wild-type and S116A mutant constructs yielded a similar amount of total eNOS expression, with no substantive difference in the level of eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation between the wild-type and S116A mutant eNOS (Fig. 4) or in the level of phosphorylation at threonine 497 (data not shown). There was no substantive difference in the basal eNOS enzyme activity in COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type eNOS or the S116A mutant, both of which had eNOS activity measured at ∼12 fmoll-[3H]citrulline formed/min/mg of protein. However, in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 (Fig. 4), the eNOS enzyme activity of the phosphorylation-deficient S116A mutant was significantly higher than that of the wild-type eNOS at equivalent levels of recombinant protein expression (5.3 ± 0.4-fold increase in eNOS activity for the S116A mutant compared with a 3.2 ± 0.3-fold increase seen with wild-type eNOS; mean ± S.E. ofn = 5 experiments performed in duplicate, p < 0.01). We next sought to explore the protein kinase pathways that might be involved in the phosphorylation of eNOS on serine 116. The kinase consensus sequence around serine 116 suggests that this residue might represent a site for phosphorylation by ERK1/2 MAP kinases. However, the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor U1026 had no effect on eNOS serine 116 phosphorylation under conditions in which ERK1/2 activation was completely blocked by this inhibitor treatment (Fig.5A). The phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin similarly had no effect on eNOS serine 116 phosphorylation under conditions in which phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase downstream kinase Akt was completely blocked (Fig. 5A). Of a wide range of kinase inhibitors, we found that the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin was distinct in its ability to completely block phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 116, accompanied by a significant attenuation in phosphorylation at serine 1179 (Fig. 5B). VEGF has been extensively characterized as a key agonist for eNOS activation in the vascular wall and only more recently has been identified as a potent activator of the phosphoprotein phosphatase calcineurin in endothelial cells (15Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Treatment of endothelial cells with VEGF promotes the dephosphorylation of the transcription factor NF-AT; this response is blocked by cyclosporin A (11Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The major phosphoprotein phosphatase involved in NF-AT dephosphorylation is the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme calcineurin, a phosphatase that is inhibited by immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506. The arterial hypertension that accompanies the systemic administration of cyclosporin A represents an important limitation to the use of this clinically important immunosuppressant drug. Our results provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis that cyclosporin A-induced hypertension involves, at least in part, the attenuation of endothelium-derived NO production through a calcineurin-sensitive pathway involving eNOS phosphorylation. A role for cyclosporin and FK506 in nitric-oxide synthase regulation is consistent with observations reported in several prior studies, although the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Dawson et al. (22Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Dawson V.L. Dinerman J.L. Uhl G.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Animal models of cyclosporin treatment have suggested that the drug attenuates endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (13Cairns H.S. Fairbanks L.D. Westwick J. Neild G.H. Br. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16587-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) found that cyclosporin blocks the bradykinin-induced dephosphorylation of eNOS at threonine 497, associated with a reduction in bradykinin-induced eNOS activation. This finding stands in direct contrast to the results of Fleming et al. (7Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-R75Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), who found no effect of cyclosporin on bradykinin-induced eNOS activation. Furthermore, a recent study that implicated protein phosphatase PP1, rather than calcineurin, as the relevant phosphatase at phosphothreonine 497 (6Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of calcineurin-modulated pathways in regulating eNOS dephosphorylation at threonine 497 remains controversial. In the present studies, we did not see any effect of bradykinin on eNOS dephosphorylation at serine 116; conversely, VEGF did not affect phosphorylation at threonine 497. Therefore, the principal locus of inhibitory effect of cyclosporin on VEGF-induced eNOS activation appears to reflect the ability of the drug to inhibit VEGF-induced serine 116 dephosphorylation. Indeed, it is possible that the robust activation of eNOS elicited by VEGF reflects its additive effect to promote serine 116 dephosphorylation, a response not elicited by other eNOS agonists such as bradykinin and sphingosine 1-phosphate, which are less efficacious activators of eNOS in BAEC (23Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36281-36288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that different eNOS agonists activate distinct protein kinase pathways and differentially modulate eNOS phosphorylation at specific sites (23Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36281-36288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Seen in this context, the converse also appears to be true, that different agonists may also promote the activation of distinct phosphoprotein phosphatases that differentially modulate eNOS dephosphorylation at discrete sites on the enzyme. The time course of VEGF-induced eNOS dephosphorylation is considerably slower than the transient increase in intracellular Ca2+and the rapid activation of eNOS enzyme activity seen in response to this agonist (16He H. Venema V.J., Gu, X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Moreover, the dephosphorylation of eNOS at serine 116 lags behind the time course of VEGF-induced eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1179. It is plausible that the dephosphorylation of eNOS at serine 116 represents a longer term control mechanism for establishing the level of eNOS activity rather than reflecting a pathway involved in rapid responses to extracellular signals. The mechanisms whereby serine 116 phosphorylation attenuates eNOS enzyme activity remain to be determined. Some clues may be derived from inspecting the crystal structure of eNOS (9Raman C.S., Li, H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) in the vicinity of serine 116; this region includes the sites for Zn2+ ligation (cysteine 101) and pterin binding (serine 104) and also forms part of the eNOS homodimer interface. Which, if any, of these eNOS structural features are perturbed by the phosphorylation of serine 116 remains to be determined in enzymological studies of the purified enzyme. It should be emphasized that the fact that cyclosporin inhibits VEGF-induced eNOS serine 116 dephosphorylation does not establish that calcineurin directly dephosphorylates eNOS any more than the inhibitory effects of calphostin on serine 116 phosphorylation establish protein kinase C as the enzyme directly responsible for eNOS phosphorylation at this site. As shown in Fig. 5, we found that calphostin, a protein kinase C inhibitor, also blocks phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 1179, an observation more consistent with a role for protein kinase C in kinase Akt activation (Fig. 5B) than with the hypothesis that the protein kinase C itself directly modifies this eNOS residue. Thus, we may only interpret the effects of the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin and the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin on phosphorylation of serine 116 as providing evidence that protein kinase C- and calcineurin-modulated pathways importantly influence eNOS phosphorylation at this residue. Indeed, the amino acid sequence surrounding serine 116 does not represent a particularly robust consensus sequence either for protein kinase C-induced phosphorylation or for calcineurin-promoted dephosphorylation. A broadly based experimental approach will be required in order to identify the specific molecular targets that are modulated by protein kinase C and calcineurin in endothelial cells. The major findings of this study are that VEGF, a key eNOS agonist, promotes the dephosphorylation of eNOS at serine 116, that this VEGF response is blocked by cyclosporin A, and that serine 116 phosphorylation is associated with eNOS inhibition. These observations may have interesting implications for our understanding of the hypertensive effects of systemic cyclosporin treatment. The level of eNOS phosphorylation at serine 116 may represent an important determinant of vascular tone, and the dynamic modulation of kinase and phosphatase pathways that regulate phosphorylation at this site may influence NO-dependent signaling pathways in the vascular wall. A deeper understanding of calcineurin-modulated signaling pathways in the vascular endothelium may lead to the identification of points for pharmacological intervention that might mitigate the dose-limiting hypertension seen with administration of the widely used immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. We thank Drs. Lisa Robinson and Prakash Prabhakar for contributions in some of the early studies of serine 116 phosphorylation and Dr. Junsuke Igarashi for a critical reading of the manuscript and many helpful discussions."

NOV associates with the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of Notch1 by the CT (C-terminal cysteine knot) domain. The promoters of HES1and HES5, which are the downstream transducers of Notch signaling, were activated by NOV. Expressions of NOV and Notch1 were concomitant in the presomitic mesoderm and later in the myocytes and chondrocytes, suggesting their synergistic effects in mesenchymal cell differentiation. In C2/4 myogenic cells, elevated expression of NOV led to down-regulation of MyoDand myogenin, resulting in inhibition of myotube formation. These results indicate that NOV-Notch1 association exerts a positive effect on Notch signaling and consequently suppresses myogenesis.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). CCN genes have not been found in invertebrates as yet, and each domain is encoded by a separate exon, implying that the CCN genes might arise from exon shuffling in the course of vertebrate evolution. These modular structural domains are shared among the CCN family members, except for WISP-2/rCOP-1, which lacks the CT module (13Delmolino L.M. Castellot J.J., Jr. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and WISP1v, which lacks the von Willebrand type C module (14Tanaka S. Sugimachi K. Saeki H. Kinoshita J. Ohga T. Shimada M. Maehara Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5525-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The CCN gene family and a number of related genes now appear to constitute an emerging multigene superfamily. Some CCN proteins have been demonstrated to possess a growth factor-like activity and regulate cell growth and tissue formation. For example, CTGF is a matrix-associated, heparin-binding protein that mediates cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion. CTGF also functions as a downstream mediator of TGF-β and stimulates proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis of fibroblasts (15Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar,16Moussad E.E. Brigstock D.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 276-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Compared with CTGF, the biological activity of NOV remains poorly understood. Overexpression of NOV inhibits the proliferation of chicken embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting its negative properties on cell growth. On the contrary, human NOV protein stimulates the proliferation of fibroblasts and also induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation, implying its positive effect on cell proliferation (5Liu C. Liu X.J.

N-terminal truncated form of NOV can transform chicken embryonic fibroblasts by its oncogenic activity, and aberrant expression of NOV is associated with the development of several tumors of different origins including Wilms' tumor, renal cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and musculoskeletal tumors (17Manara M.C.

During normal development, NOV is expressed in a wide variety of tissues. The major sites of NOV expression include the notochord, central nervous system, kidney, adrenal cortex, muscle, and cartilage (21Burren C.P. Wilson E.M. Hwa V., Oh, Y. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin.

Dyn. 2000; 219: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although a growing body of evidence suggests that NOV plays an important role in the development of various tissues, the mechanisms of its function remain unclear. A search has been undertaken for molecules that interact with NOV. Two proteins were confirmed to physically associate with NOV. One is fibulin-1C, an extracellular matrix protein that mediates cell adhesion, which suggests the involvement of NOV in cell adhesion signaling (29Perbal B. Martinerie C. Sainson R. Werner M., He, B. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The other is rpb7, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, implying that NOV might regulate transcription in nucleus (30Perbal B. Mol. Pathol. 1999; 52: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). More recently, NOV was shown to co-localize with connexin 43, suggesting that they might also interact and influence the formation of gap junction (18Gupta N. Wang H. McLeod T.L. Naus C.C. Kyurkchiev S. Advani S., Yu, J. Perbal B. Weichselbaum R.R. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the biological activities of NOV are attributed to interactions with these molecules to some extent, two-hybrid system analysis has indicated that other factors may interact with NOV 3B. Perbal and C. L. Li, unpublished results.3B. Perbal and C. L. Li, unpublished results. and would likely regulate its downstream events. We recently demonstrated that NOV is expressed in Hensen's node, notochord, and the floor plate in early chick embryogenesis (31Katsube K. Chuai M.L. Liu Y.C. Kabasawa Y. Takagi M. Perbal B. Sakamoto K. Gene Expression Patterns. 2001; 1: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The expression of NOV is also detected in the dermomyotome (28Natarajan D. Andermarcher E. Schofield P.N. Boulter C.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression in the dermomyotome coincides with that of transmembrane receptor, Notch and its ligand, Delta. The Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation and fate determination in various tissues. The expression ofNotch frequently overlaps with NOV expression. For example, both genes are expressed in chondrocytes and are supposed to participate in cartilage formation (26Perbal B. Mol Pathol. 2001; 54: 57-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 32Crowe R. Zikherman J. Niswander L. Development. 1999; 126: 987-998PubMed Google Scholar). NOV is also involved in vascular formation (33Kocialkowski S. Yeger H. Kingdom J. Perbal B. Schofield P.N. Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 2001; 203: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and its role in response to injury has been postulated, in which prominent up-regulation of NOVwas observed in smooth muscle cells after balloon catheter injury of rat carotid artery (34Ellis P.D. Chen Q. Barker P.J. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1912-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this type of experimental model, remarkable up-regulation of Notch and its ligands has also been observed (35Lindner V. Booth C. Prudovsky I. Small D. Maciag T. Liaw L. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 875-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In vitro studies revealed that both NOV and Notch signaling mediate cell adhesion, suggesting their crucial roles in tissue remodeling (34Ellis P.D. Chen Q. Barker P.J. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R.

These observations encouraged us to test the hypothesis that NOV may exert some of its function through the Notch signaling pathway. In this study, we show that NOV associates with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat region of Notch1 by its CT domain. We further demonstrate that NOV-Notch association poses a positive effect on the Notch signaling pathway and suppresses the differentiation of C2/4 myogenic cells. Possible mechanisms of Notch signal modification by NOV-Notch association are discussed. Murine Notch1 was a gift from J. Nye (Northwestern University, Chicago). NICD(Notch-d4) was a gift from E. Robey (University of California, Berkeley). Delta1, Delta-d1, and Serrate1 were previously described (36Sakamoto K. Ohara O. Takagi M. Takeda S. Katsube K. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The C terminus ofNOV was tagged with a Flag or an HA epitope by ligating theEcoRI-StuI fragment of the originalNOV clone into pCMV-Tag4 (Stratagene) orpTagHA (personal product), respectively. The restriction digestion by StuI removes the C-terminal sequence encoding 12 amino acids that are out of the CT domain and show poor homologies among species and the CCN family genes (see Fig. 2A).NOV-d1, NOV-d2, NOV-d3, and NOV-d4 fragments were amplified from the HA-tagged NOV by PCR and ligated topTagHA or pSecTag2 (Invitrogen) in such a manner as to have a signal sequence at their 5′ ends and the HA epitope at their 3′ ends. The full-length Notch1 that was C-terminally tagged with a Flag epitope was described previously (36Sakamoto K. Ohara O. Takagi M. Takeda S. Katsube K. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Notch-d1 was made by removing the ScaI fragment from the full-length Notch1. Notch-d2 was made by ligating the EcoRI-ScaI fragment ofNotch1 into the EcoRI-EcoRV site ofpCMV-Tag4. Notch-d3 was made by ligating theScaI fragment of Notch1 into the SmaI site of pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma). Notch-d4 is the same with that previously described as NICD (36Sakamoto K. Ohara O. Takagi M. Takeda S. Katsube K. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MyoDwas a gift from A. Koseki (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan). C2/4 was provided by S. Matsuda (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). HEK293 or C2/4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and antibiotics. For induction of differentiation, the culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum (Sigma, lot 20K8408). Transfection was performed with total 1 μg of DNA in 12- or 24-well culture vessels using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instruction. C2/4-NOV and C2/4-Mock were established by Geneticin (Invitrogen) selection. The HA-tagged NOVfragment was ligated into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Bacmid production and transfection to High Five cells were performed per the manufacturer's instruction. NOV protein secreted in the culture medium was concentrated using Microcon YM10 (Millipore). Cells were passively lysed in TNTC buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmCaCl2 and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) 24 h after transfection. In the experiments to test calcium dependence, TNT buffer (100 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing EGTA was also used. Cell lysate was pre-absorbed to CL4B-agarose beads and incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE was conducted with SDS gel loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. The proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunodetection was performed as described previously (36Sakamoto K. Ohara O. Takagi M. Takeda S. Katsube K. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were peroxidase conjugated anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), peroxidase-conjugated anti-Flag (M2, Sigma), anti-phosphotyrosine (clone PT-66, Sigma), anti-human smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4, Dako), anti-porcine desmin (clone DE-R-11, Dako), and anti-rat myogenin (clone F5D, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)). Densitometric analysis was conducted on the scanned film image using Photoshop5.0 (Adobe). In brief, the signal intensities were calculated by integrating the blackness (0–255) of each pixel of the band images. The values of NOV co-precipitated with Notch were divided by the values of Notch in the cell lysates. Note that the values are merely relative indices without any physical meaning. RNA was extracted from the C2/4 cells cultured in the differentiation-inducing medium using Trizol (Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of total RNA were loaded to each lane. Standard Northern blot procedures were adopted and hybridization was performed using [32P]dCTP-labeled NOV, Notch1, Delta1, or MyoD cDNA fragment. Detection and imaging of the radioactive signals were conducted using the image plate scanner BAS2500 (Fujifilm). The reporter plasmids ofHES1 and HES5 promoters, HES1-luc and HES5-luc, were gifts from R. Kageyama (Kyoto University, Japan). Luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and the Luminosensor AB-2200 (Atto) per the manufacturers' instructions. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and firefly luciferase activity was normalized by co-transfected Renilla luciferase activity (pRL-EF, a gift from Y. Mochida, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan). In situ hybridization using digoxygenin-labeled RNA probe was performed as described previously (31Katsube K. Chuai M.L. Liu Y.C. Kabasawa Y. Takagi M. Perbal B. Sakamoto K. Gene Expression Patterns. 2001; 1: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Sakamoto K. Nakamura H. Takagi M. Takeda S. Katsube K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that NOV participates in the Notch signaling pathway, we investigated whether NOV associates with Notch1 or its ligands, Delta1 and Serrate1, using an immunoprecipitation assay. The C terminus ofNOV was tagged with an HA epitope, and the C terminus ofNotch1, Delta1 and Serrate1were each tagged with a Flag epitope. Immunoprecipitation of Notch1 from the protein extracts of HEK293 cells co-transfected withNOV and Notch1 recovered a complex containing NOV (Fig. 1A). NOV protein was not recovered in the absence of Notch1 protein (Fig.1A). The levels of NOV in the lysates were comparable. These results indicate that NOV associates with Notch1. We also performed immunoprecipitation of NOV from protein extracts of the cells co-transfected with Flag-tagged NOV and HA-taggedNotch1. Full-length Notch1 protein was recovered from the immunoprecipitant of NOV, which confirmed the NOV-Notch1 association (Fig. 1B). The small fragment that represents a cleaved Notch1 product with the transmembrane and intracellular domain (Notch (tm+ic)) was not co-immunoprecipitated with NOV, which implies that NOV associates with the extracellular domain of Notch1 (Fig.1B). The associations of NOV-Delta1 or NOV-Serrate1 were also detected but at less than 50-fold the level of NOV-Notch1 (Fig. 1A). Like other CCN family members, NOV consists of four modules, each of which appears to be involved in interaction with different molecules. To determine which module engages in the association with Notch1, we made a series of deletion constructs ofNOV and examined their association with Notch1 (Fig.2A). Because the wild type NOV has a secretory character, the signal sequence of IgG was appended to the N-terminal deletion constructs (NOV-d1, NOV-d2, and NOV-d4). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOV-d1, which lacks the first module, and NOV-d2, which lacks the first and the second modules, associated with Notch1, whereas NOV-d3 and NOV-d4, both of which lack the fourth module, did not associate with Notch1 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the CT domain is required for association with Notch1. To determine the region of Notch1 involved in association with NOV, we created deletion constructs of Notch1 and examined the association with NOV (Fig. 3A). NOV associated with Notch-d1, which lacks the 10th–36th EGF motifs (Fig. 3B). NOV associated with Notch-d2, which comprises only the first to ninth EGF motifs, and also with Notch-d3, which comprises only the 10th–36th EGF motifs (Fig. 3B). The intracellular domain of Notch1 (Notch-d4) did not associate with NOV (Fig. 3B). Densitometric analysis was performed to evaluate the amount of NOV captured by each Notch product. As for Notch-d1, -d2, and -d3, the amounts of the co-immunoprecipitated NOV were proportional to the amounts of each Notch deletion product. On the other hand, the full-length Notch1 captured NOV 10-fold more efficiently than those artificially engineered Notch deletion products (Fig.3B, bottom). These results indicate that NOV tends to associate preferentially with the EGF repeat region of wild type Notch1. Subsets of EGF domains contain calcium ion-dependent EGF motifs (38Stenflo J.

We examined whether the loss of Ca2+ alters the affinity of NOV-Notch1 association. HEK293 cells co-transfected with NOVand Notch1 were lysed with TNT lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitation of Notch1 was performed. The immunoprecipitant was divided into five aliquots, which were incubated for 30 min in the TNT buffer or in TNT buffer containing 1 mm or 2 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm or 2 mmEGTA, respectively. NOV protein that was kept captured on the beads with Notch or was released in the supernatants was analyzed by immunoblot. NOV·Notch1 complex was maintained in the buffer without Ca2+, and EGTA treatment did not dissociate the NOV·Notch1 complex, suggesting that NOV-Notch1 association is independent of Ca2+ (Fig. 3C). To investigate the biological activity of NOV on the Notch signaling pathway, we examined the effect of NOV on the promoter activity of HES1 and HES5, which are downstream target genes activated by the Notch signal (41de la Pompa J.L. Wakeham A. Correia K.M. Samper E. Brown S. Aguilera R.J. Nakano T. Honjo T. Mak T.W. Rossant J. Conlon R.A. Development. 1997; 124: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We used a C2/4 cell line, a subclone of C2C12 mesenchymal cells, which retains only myogenic potency (43Yoshida N. Yoshida S.

Commun. 1999; 262: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because C2/4 cells express Notch1(see Fig. 6A), Notch signaling could occur and regulate their differentiation. We co-transfected HES1-lucor HES5-luc with different amounts of NOV. The expression of NOV increased both HES1 and HES5promoter activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4A). HES5 promoter activation was rather modest compared with HES1, but the overall tendencies were similar. Co-transfection of the intracellular deleted form of Delta, which has a cell-autonomous dominant negative effect on Notch signaling (36Sakamoto K. Ohara O. Takagi M. Takeda S. Katsube K. Dev.

NOV-d1 showed similar activation of HES promoters, whereas NOV-d3 failed to activate them (Fig. 4B). Administration of NOV protein produced by a baculovirus system also led to the increase ofHES promoter activities (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that NOV-Notch1 association through the CT domain of NOV activates HES1 and HES5 promoters by facilitating the Notch signaling pathway.FIG. 4NOV enhances HES1 and HES5 promoter activities through interaction with Notch1. A, C2/4 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg ofHES1-luc or HES5-luc, 0.005 μg ofpRL-EF, and the indicated amounts of NOV. The total amount of plasmid was equalized with the empty mock vector. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. HES1 and HES5 promoter activities were increased by NOV in a dose-dependent manner. RLU, relative luciferase unit. B, C2/4 cells were co-transfected with 0.1 μg ofHES1-luc or HES5-luc, 0.005 μg ofpRL-EF, and 0.2 μg of the indicated plasmids, and a luciferase activity assay was performed. Transfection withNOV or NOV-d1 resulted in HES1 and HES5 activation (second and third barsfrom left), whereas NOV-d3 did not show this effect (fourth bars).

Twenty-four hours later, the culture medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing different amounts of the NOV protein produced and secreted by High Five cells. After 6 h of incubation, luciferase activity assay was conducted. Enhancement of HES1 and HES5 promoter activities was observed. RD, relative density.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TheHES promoter assay indicated that NOV acts positively on the Notch signaling pathway. In situ hybridization revealed thatNOV, Notch1, and Delta1 are co-expressed in the presomitic mesoderm (Fig.5) although the expression patterns are not identical. They are down-regulated with the onset of somite segmentation, but expression is retained in the dermomyotome even in late stage, implying their concomitant effects on myogenesis (26Perbal B.

(Berl.). 2001; 203: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of NOV in myogenesis, we analyzed the effects of NOV on the differentiation of C2/4. C2/4 cells were stellate or spindle-shaped when cultured in the serum-rich proliferating medium. Under low serum conditions, C2/4 cells were induced to differentiate and began to express the myogenic markers such as MyoD, myogenin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and desmin (Fig.6A and data not shown). They further transformed into fused multinuclear cells called myotubes. Under the differentiation-inducing condition, the endogenous expression of NOV and Notch1 were maintained but slightly decreased (Fig. 6A). The expressions of Delta1and MyoD were up-regulated with differentiation of C2/4 (Fig. 6A). We established the C2/4 cell lines stably expressing NOV (C2/4-NOV) or transformed with an empty mock vector (C2/4-Mock), and examined their differentiation ability. C2/4-NOV exhibited a reduction in their ability to fuse into myotubes, and the number of myotubes formed by C2/4-NOV was significantly reduced compared with C2/4-Mock (Fig. 6, B and C). On day 4, the expression of SMA, MyoD, and myogenin was remarkably down-regulated in C2/4-NOV (Fig. 6D). Notch1expression was not altered by NOV (Fig. 6D). These results imply that NOV has an inhibitory effect on myogenic differentiation. Notch is a multimodular signal protein that has 36 EGF motifs and Lin/Notch repeats in the extracellular region and CDC10/ankyrin repeats and other motifs including nuclear localization signals in the intracellular region. On ligand binding, the intracellular domain of Notch is cleaved and translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with the transcription repressor CBF1 and consequently up-regulates the transcription factors such as HES1 and HES5 (42Kageyama R.

Most components of autophagy also function in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, a constitutive biosynthetic pathway required for the transport of aminopeptidase I (Ape1). The protein components of autophagy and the Cvt pathway include a putative complex composed of Apg1 kinase and several interacting proteins that are specific for either the Cvt pathway or autophagy. A second required complex includes a phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase and associated proteins that are involved in its activation and localization. The majority of proteins required for the Cvt and autophagy pathways localize to a perivacuolar pre-autophagosomal structure. We show that the Cvt13 and Cvt20 proteins are required for transport of precursor Ape1 through the Cvt pathway. Both proteins contain phox homology domains that bind PtdIns(3)P and are necessary for membrane localization to the pre-autophagosomal structure. Functional phox homology domains are required for Cvt pathway function. Cvt13 and Cvt20 interact with each other and with an autophagy-specific protein, Apg17, that interacts with Apg1 kinase.

During vegetative conditions, these components are constitutively employed in a biosynthetic capacity by the Cvt pathway. However, under nutrient starvation conditions, intracellular signaling events induce the autophagic pathway, enabling the degradative recycling of proteins and organelles in the lysosome-like vacuole of yeast (1Harding T.M.

The characterization of their gene products has begun to delineate the molecular events of the Cvt and autophagy pathways (reviewed in Refs. 5Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J.

There is significant overlap between the targeting and transport mechanisms of these pathways; however, there also exist proteins specific for each. Interestingly, the specific components appear to interact directly or indirectly with a central component, Apg1. Apg1 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, which is required for both the Apg and Cvt pathways (7Matsuura A. Tsukada M. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 8Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Apg1 catalytic activity is presumably regulated through the association of specific proteins such as Apg13, another component required for both the Cvt pathway and autophagy (8Kamada Y. Funakoshi T.

Apg13 interacts with Vac8, a Cvt-specific protein initially characterized as functioning in vacuolar inheritance (9Scott S.V. Nice III, D.C. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y. Keizer-Gunnink I.

The Apg1 kinase also physically interacts with Cvt9 and Apg17, proteins that are specific for the Cvt and Apg pathways, respectively (8Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar,12Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A. Baba M. Scott S.V. Ohsumi Y. Dunn W.A., Jr. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A second complex that is required for both the Cvt and autophagy pathways includes the yeast PtdIns 3-kinase Vps34. This lipid kinase functions as part of a core complex, consisting of Vps34, Vps15, and Vps30/Apg6. Either Vps38, which is required for Prc1 transport, or Apg14, which is required for the autophagy and Cvt pathways, are also part of the complex (13Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The association of Vps38 or Apg14 appears to confer specificity, perhaps by targeting the PtdIns 3-kinase to its functional location. Both the Apg1 kinase and the Apg14-containing lipid kinase complex localize to perivacuolar punctate structures. At present, a direct connection between these complexes has not been established. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the Cvt and autophagy pathways, we carried out a systematic analysis of a yeast ORF deletion library. Our screen for strains defective for import of precursor Ape1 (prApe1) identified several previously uncharacterized mutants. Two of these mutants, yjl036w/snx4and ydl113c, renamed cvt13 and cvt20, respectively, correspond to genes that encode proteins reported to interact with Apg17 by the two-hybrid assay (14Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A., Li, Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar). In addition, both proteins contain phox homology (PX) domains. The PX domain is an ∼120 amino acid domain that functions as a phosphoinositide-binding module. Protein-lipid interactions enable the PX domain specifically to target proteins to organelle membranes. Through regulation of intracellular localization, the PX domain has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including cell growth, intracellular signaling, cytoskeletal organization, neutrophil defense, protein transport, and vesicular trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 15Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar and 16Wishart M.J. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A recent analysis extended phosphoinositide binding to all 15 PX domains encoded by theSaccharomyces cerevisiae genome (17Yu J.W. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44179-44184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, a connection has not yet been made between the PX domain and physiological function. In this paper we show that Cvt13 and Cvt20 interact with a component of the Apg1 kinase complex and are specifically required for the Cvt pathway. The PX domains within Cvt13 and Cvt20 drive PtdIns(3)P-specific recruitment to a perivacuolar structure. Mutations in the PX domain block function. Finally, we demonstrate that correct localization of Cvt13 and Cvt20 requires the synthesis of PtdIns(3)P by the Apg14-containing lipid kinase complex at the pre-autophagosomal structure. The S. cerevisiae knockout library in strains BY4742 and BY4743 was purchased from ResGenTM (Invitrogen). The strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Thecvt13Δ, cvt20Δ, and apg17Δ strains were generated by PCR-mediated disruption of the YJL036w, YDL113c, and YLR423c loci, respectively, using amplified sequences from either the S. cerevisiae TRP1 gene, theSaccharomyces kluyveri HIS3 gene, or theEscherichia coli kanr gene (18Longtine M.S.

AfterEagI, but prior to XhoI digestion, the 5′ overhang was filled in, creating a blunt end on GFP. Plasmid pCVT13-HA was digested with SmaI and XhoI to remove the DNA encoding the HA epitope and subsequently ligated with GFP, yielding pCVT13-GFP(426). Amino-terminal fusions of protein A to Cvt13 (pProtA-CVT13(424)), Cvt20 (pProtA-CVT20(424)), and Apg17 (pProtA-APG17(424)) were made by PCR amplification of the corresponding ORFs and ligation into theClaI/SalI sites of pRS424-CuProtA (27Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal GFP fusion plasmids pGFP-CVT20(416), pGFP-CVT20(415) (pPS108), and pGFP-APG17(426) were made by excising CVT20 orAPG17 from pProtA-CVT20 or pProtA-APG17 with ClaI and SalI and inserting into theClaI/SalI sites of pCuGFP(416) or pCuGFP- (426), respectively (25Kim J. Huang W.-P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To construct amino-terminal HA fusion plasmids, the 3xHA epitope was PCR-amplified from pRS416–3xHA. The PCR product was digested withSpeI and ClaI. Plasmid pProtA-CVT20 was digested with SpeI and ClaI to remove the DNA encoding protein A and subsequently ligated with the above PCR product, yielding pHA-Cvt20(416,424). DNA encoding the PX domain of Cvt20 was amplified by PCR with primers containing 5′ restriction enzyme sites that allow for in-frame gene fusions with the carboxyl terminus of GST. Amplification included the DNA encoding the PX domain of Cvt13 (amino acids 156–295) and Cvt20 (amino acids 173–301). PCR product and plasmid pGEX-KG (AmershamBiosciences) were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated to generate plasmid pGEX-KG-CVT13PX and pGEX-KG-CVT20PX. Plasmids pCvt13Y79A-GFP(416), pCvt13Y79A-HA(416), pGFP-Cvt20Y193A(416), and pGFP-Cvt20Y193A(415) (pPS109) were constructed using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).

Pulse/chase immunoprecipitation, nitrogen starvation, and pexophagy experiments were conducted as described previously (2Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc.

Induction of autophagy was estimated by measuring the activity of alkaline phosphatase from Pho8Δ60 with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate essentially according to methods published previously (29Mitchell J.K. Fonzi W.A. Wilkerson J. Opheim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 657: 482-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For subcellular fractionation experiments cvt13Δ (D3Y108) cells transformed with the pCVT13-HA(416) plasmid or cvt20Δ (D3Y109) cells transformed with the pHA-CVT20(426) plasmid were grown to midlog phase in SMD and then converted to spheroplasts as described previously (30Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were subjected to differential lysis in PS200 lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol) containing 5 mm MgCl2 essentially as described previously (25Kim J. Huang W.-P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fractionated samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. For isolation of protein A fusion proteins and associated proteins, 30A600 equivalents of yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts as described previously (30Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1 m sorbitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Spheroplasts were lysed on ice in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer, and protein A was recovered on Dynabeads® as described previously (27Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Cells were grown to midlog phase in SMD, induced with 10 μm CuSO4 where appropriate for 1–2 h, and viewed on a Nikon E-800 fluorescent microscope as described previously (27Kim J. Huang W.-P.

GST-Cvt20 PX domain fusion protein was purified from glutathione-Sepharose beads by elution with reduced glutathione according to manufacturer's specifications. Purified protein was then desalted with PD-10 columns and concentrated to 5 μg/ml with Centriprep YM-30 centrifugal filters. Protein-lipid overlay assays were conducted as described previously (24Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat.

Membranes were incubated with purified GST-Cvt13 and GST-Cvt20 PX domains at 0.05 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. Binding of GST fusions to phosphoinositides was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. No binding of GST alone to phosphoinositides was detected. In order to develop a comprehensive understanding of the protein components involved in cytoplasm to vacuole protein transport pathways, we undertook a systematic analysis of the yeast ORF deletion library. Each strain was initially screened for the accumulation of precursor aminopeptidase I (prApe1). The vacuolar hydrolase, aminopeptidase I (Ape1), is synthesized in the cytosol as a precursor protein and is transported to the vacuole through the Cvt or Apg pathway (reviewed in Refs. 5Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Traffic. 2001; 2: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 6Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Euk. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Two of the mutants that we identified were cvt13(YJL036w/snx4) and cvt20 (YDL113c). Both mutants accumulated the precursor form of Ape1 in rich medium, indicating a block in the Cvt pathway (Fig.1A). The cvt13mutant was initially isolated in a random screen for mutants defective in prApe1 maturation (1Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but the corresponding gene had not been identified. A yeast genome database search for sequences with similarity to human sorting nexins (SNXs) identified a number of genes, including the open reading frame YJL036w (32Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity of YJL036w with human SNX4 grouped it as the yeast ortholog SceSNX4. However, due to its functional placement within the Cvt transport pathway, YJL036w was renamedCVT13. Sequencing of the YJL036w gene from thecvt13 mutant revealed that deletion of the guanine base at position 113 of the ORF changed amino acid 38 and induced a frameshift. 2Z. Xie and H. Abeliovich, unpublished results. No function for the CVT20 gene product has been shown previously in prApe1 transport. To determine whether these proteins functioned in additional vacuolar transport pathways, we examined the processing of resident vacuolar hydrolases carboxypeptidase Y (Prc1) and alkaline phosphatase (Pho8). Prc1 and Pho8 transit to the vacuole through the CPY and ALP pathways, respectively, and are useful marker proteins to monitor the state of these transport processes (33Kim J. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 198: 153-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both Prc1 and Pho8 undergo glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex and are proteolytically processed in the vacuole. The molecular mass shifts that correspond to these modifications provide a convenient means to monitor the transport process. Yeast cells were subjected to a radioactive pulse/chase analysis to determine the kinetics of protein delivery to the vacuole. Wild type, cvt13Δ, and cvt20Δ cells efficiently processed both proteins, although the cvt13Δ strain displayed a weak defect in processing of Prc1 and accumulated ∼5% of the protein in the p2 Golgi-modified form (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that the Cvt13 and Cvt20 proteins do not have major functions in Prc1 and Pho8 vacuolar delivery pathways. Precursor Ape1 is transported to the vacuole through both the Cvt pathway and autophagy (2Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Most of the characterizedapg/cvt mutants are defective in delivery through both pathways and accumulate prApe1 under both rich and starvation conditions (reviewed in Ref. 34Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Some mutants, however, are specific to each pathway. For example, cvt9Δ and vac8Δ strains are blocked in the Cvt pathway but are not completely blocked for autophagic import. These mutants are able to “reverse” their prApe1 accumulation defect through starvation-induced autophagy (9Scott S.V. Nice III, D.C. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y. Keizer-Gunnink I. Funakoshi T.

In wild type cells, prApe1 is matured with a half-time of ∼30 min in synthetic minimal medium containing nitrogen (SMD). In contrast, very little mature Ape1 was detected in cvt13Δ and cvt20Δ cells under these conditions (Fig. 1B). The cvt13 and cvt20 mutants reversed the accumulation defect and processed prApe1 when shifted to SD-N, nitrogen starvation conditions (Fig. 1B). As a control, we examined the apg1Δ mutant. Apg1 is a Ser/Thr kinase essential for both Cvt transport and autophagy (7Matsuura A. Tsukada M. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y.

High throughput two-hybrid analysis indicated a possible three-way interaction between Cvt13, Cvt20, and Apg17 (8Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J.

In contrast tocvt9Δ and vac8Δ strains, theapg17Δ mutant is not defective for prApe1 import through the Cvt pathway but is defective for autophagy (8Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K.

We found that apg17Δ cells processed prApe1, albeit with a slightly lower efficiency (Fig. 1B). It is thought that starvation conditions result in a signal transduction event that induces autophagy and causes the Apg/Cvt machinery to switch from the production of Cvt vesicles to the formation of autophagoso"

GnRH acts through a plasma membrane receptor that is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors interact with heterotrimeric G proteins to initiate downstream signaling. In this study, we have investigated which G proteins are involved in GnRH receptor-mediated signaling in LβT2 pituitary gonadotrope cells. We have shown previously that GnRH activates ERK and induces the c-fos and LHβ genes in these cells. Signaling via the Gi subfamily of G proteins was excluded, as neither ERK activation nor c-Fos and LHβ induction was impaired by treatment with pertussis toxin or a cell-permeable peptide that sequesters Gβγ-subunits. GnRH signaling was partially mimicked by adenoviral expression of a constitutively active mutant of Gαq(Q209L) and was blocked by a cell-permeable peptide that uncouples Gαq from GPCRs. Furthermore, chronic activation of Gαq signaling induced a state of GnRH resistance. A cell-permeable peptide that uncouples Gαs from receptors was also able to inhibit ERK, c-Fos, and LHβ, indicating that both Gq/11 and Gs proteins are involved in signaling. Consistent with this, GnRH caused GTP loading on Gs and Gq/11 and increased intracellular cAMP. Artificial elevation of cAMP with forskolin activated ERK and caused a partial induction of c-Fos. Finally, treatment of Gαq(Q209L)-infected cells with forskolin enhanced the induction of c-Fos showing that the two pathways are independent and additive. Taken together, these results indicate that the GnRH receptor activates both Gq and Gs signaling to regulate gene expression in LβT2 cells.

These receptors can be activated by a diverse array of external stimuli, including growth factors, neurotransmitters, peptide, and protein hormones, chemokines, and other ligands. Agonist binding to a specific receptor on the cell surface causes a conformational change in the receptor that allows it to interact with its cognate G protein, stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange on the α-subunit of the G protein. The release of the GTP-bound α-subunit and βγ-subunits from the receptor-G protein complex initiates a broad range of intracellular signaling events, including the activation of classical effectors such as phospholipase C, adenylate cyclases, and ion channels, and regulation of the intracellular level of inositol phosphates, calcium, cyclic AMP, and other second messengers (for reviews see Refs. 1Gudermann T.

In the pituitary, GnRH signals are transmitted via a specific cell surface receptor, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. When GnRH binds to its receptor, it induces interaction of the receptor with heterotrimeric G proteins. This interaction then initiates a variety of intracellular signaling events, including an increase in phosphoinositide turnover, which results in a rise in intracellular diacylglycerol and calcium levels, and an increase in intracellular cAMP levels (9Shacham S.

Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These second messengers then activate downstream kinases including protein kinase C, calcium-dependent kinases such as Pyk2 and calmodulin-dependent kinase IV, and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA.In dispersed pituitary cell cultures, treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) results in decreased inositol phosphate (IP) turnover in response to GnRH, suggesting that a PTX-sensitive G protein (such as Gi/o) couples the receptor to IP turnover (14Hawes B.E. Barnes S. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hawes B.E. Marzen J.E. Waters S.B. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In human reproductive tract tumors, the GnRH receptor also couples to Gi (16Imai A. Takagi H. Horibe S. Fuseya T. Tamaya T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, in G-GH3 cells, which are GH3 somatomammotropes transfected with the rat GnRH-receptor, GnRH evoked IP turnover is insensitive to PTX (17Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2214-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that a different G protein may be involved in signal transduction in these cells.Studies using immuno-depletion and G protein labeling showed that the GnRH receptor is coupled to Gq/11 in αT3–1 pituitary cells (18Hsieh K.P. Martin T.F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Grosse R. Schmid A. Schoneberg T. Herrlich A. Muhn P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9193-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly, in CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells expressing the human GnRH receptor, GnRH couples exclusively to the Gq/11family of G proteins (19Grosse R. Schmid A. Schoneberg T. Herrlich A. Muhn P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9193-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the GnRH receptor also couples to Gs in primary pituitary cultures and G-GH3 cells. This G protein activates adenylate cyclase, leading to production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (20Han X.B. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Lin X. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3896-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The promiscuity of the GnRH receptor is underscored by recent studies (22Stanislaus D. Ponder S., Ji, T.H. Conn P.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showing that the GnRH receptor is able to couple to all three subfamilies of G proteins, Gq/11, Gs, and Gi, when overexpressed in rat pituitary cultures and G-GH3 cells. It is evident from all of these studies that cell context is extremely important for coupling of the GnRH receptor to different G proteins and highlights the danger of extrapolating results from one cell type to another.We have demonstrated recently (23Liu F. Austin D.A. Mellon P.L. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that GnRH activates the ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK families in the LβT2 cells. These cells express the mRNAs for the GnRH receptor and hence for the α- and β-subunits of LH and FSH are a good model for pituitary gonadotropes (24Alarid E.T. Windle J.J. Whyte D.B. Mellon P.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3319-3329PubMed Google Scholar, 25Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation and nuclear localization of ERK occur via a PKC and MEK- dependent but calcium-independent process. GnRH also induces c-Fos and LHβ protein expression. Surprisingly, induction of both of these genes is PKC-independent but calcium- and MEK-dependent in LβT2 cells (23Liu F. Austin D.A. Mellon P.L. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Both PKC and calcium signaling are activated via the phospholipase C pathway. Activation of phospholipase C would be consistent with coupling to Gαqas this G protein can activate PLCβ1 and β3 (26Drissi H. Lasmoles F., Le Mellay V. Marie P.J. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20168-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, activation can also be Gαq-independent as Gβγ can activate PLCβ2 (27Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4695-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).In this study, we address the question of whether multiple G proteins are involved in GnRH receptor signaling in LβT2 cells. By using membrane-permeable TAT peptides designed to uncouple the receptor from the G protein, we show that both Gq/11 and Gsproteins are involved in GnRH receptor signaling in LβT2 cells.DISCUSSIONPreviously, we showed that GnRH activates ERK and induces c-Fos and LHβ protein expression in LβT2 cells. In this study, we examined which G proteins are involved in these GnRH effects. We show that GnRH induction of ERK, c-Fos, and LHβ is not inhibited by pertussis toxin or a peptide that sequesters Gβγ, effectively ruling out signaling via Gi. This agrees with the results from Naor and co-workers (9Shacham S. Cheifetz M.N. Lewy H. Ashkenazi I.E. Becker O.M. Seger R. Naor Z. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1999; 60: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar) showing that Gi is not involved in the GnRH response in αT3-1 cells (9Shacham S. Cheifetz M.N. Lewy H. Ashkenazi I.E. Becker O.M. Seger R. Naor Z. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1999; 60: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that binding of GnRH to the receptor leads to the activation of phospholipase C and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which leads directly to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of protein kinase C. This is mediated via the coupling of the receptor to the Gq/11 family of G proteins. Expression of a mutant Q209L-Gαq, which lacks GTPase activity, enhances phospholipase C stimulation and transformation in NIH-3T3 cells (36De Vivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that expression of this same Gq mutant (Q209L) by adenoviral infection partially mimics the induction of c-Fos and LHβ by GnRH. However, the extent of induction is only 50% that seen with GnRH suggesting the presence of additional signals. We were unable to detect the activation of ERK, most likely due to its transient nature. We also show that chronic activation of Gαq signaling via Gαq (Q209L) results in a state of GnRH resistance. The mechanisms of GnRH resistance are not known, but it may be related to either the down-regulation of diacylglycerol-dependent PKC isoforms or the rapid down-regulation of Gq/11 proteins that have been observed with chronic PMA and GnRH treatment.Signaling cascades often require an activated protein to contact its immediate downstream mediator. Disrupting this protein-protein interaction, by introducing one of the binding domains into cell, can thus block specific pathways. Previous studies (34Chang M. Zhang L. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7021-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Hamm H.E. Rarick H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,38Taylor J.M. Neubig R.R. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that the GPCR/G protein interaction can be disruptedin vitro by peptides derived from the C terminus of the G protein. This approach to analyze signaling has been limited, however, as most peptides do not readily penetrate the cell membrane. Some success has been achieved by lipid or chemical attachment to a membrane permeabilization sequence. In this study, we rendered the blocking peptides cell-permeable by expressing them as fusion proteins with the TAT protein transduction domain (31Becker-Hapak M. McAllister S.S. Dowdy S.F. Methods. 2001; 24: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We generated TAT fusion peptides containing decapeptides from the carboxyl termini of Gαq (GqCT) and Gαs(GsCT) and a 20-amino acid peptide from phospholipase Cβ2. The α-subunit peptides block the interaction of GPCRs with their respective G proteins, and the PLCβ2 peptide binds to free Gβγ-subunits. We used these peptides here to show that both Gq and Gs proteins participate in GnRH receptor signaling leading to ERK activation and c-Fos and LHβ protein expression in LβT2 cells.It is now well documented that Gβγ-subunits, as well as the Gα-subunits, have the ability to signal to downstream effectors. Effector activation by Gβγ released from both Gs and Gi heterotrimers has been reported (39Dickenson J.M. Hill S.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 355: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Murthy K.S. Coy D.H. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23458-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 41de la Pena P. del Camino D. Pardo L.A. Dominguez P. Barros F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is possible that some of the activation of GnRH signaling is caused by Gβγ released from either Gq or Gs. In particular, the β2 isoform of phospholipase C is activated by Gβγ, as is adenylate cyclase 2. Thus, Gβγ signaling could potentially contribute to both Gq and Gs pathways. However, the lack of an effect with the Gβγ blocking peptide and the injection of the GST-βARK protein indicates that GnRH signaling is mediated primarily by α-subunits.Although it is thought that most of the biological actions of GnRH are mediated by Gq-coupled pathways, studies have suggested a physiological role for cAMP as a mediator of GnRH actions in the pituitary gland (42Bourne G.A. Baldwin D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E296-E299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third intracellular loop of the rat GnRH-R couples to both Gs and Gq/11-mediated signaling pathways in G-GH3 cells, and cAMP signaling is dependent on specific residues in the loop that are not essential for activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway (43Arora K.K. Krsmanovic L.Z. Mores N. O'Farrell H. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25581-25586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44Ulloa-Aguirre A. Stanislaus D. Arora V. Vaananen J. Brothers S. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both GnRH and cAMP activate the mouse GnRH-R gene promoter via the cAMP-response element in G-GH3 cells (45Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 46Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3452-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, there was no evidence for activation of Gs in αT3-1 cells (47Shah B.H. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study in tilapia pituitary cells demonstrated that GnRH induction of both α and FSHβ subunit genes was sensitive to inhibition of PKA, suggesting activation of cAMP signaling (48Gur G. Bonfil D. Safarian H. Naor Z. Yaron Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 189: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Induction of LHβ on the other hand was relatively resistant to inhibition of PKA but sensitive to PKC and MEK signaling. Our data suggest that both Gq and Gs are involved in GnRH receptor signaling in LβT2 cells similar to the tilapia study. We showed that artificial elevation of cAMP with forskolin can induce c-Fos protein expression on its own and can enhance c-Fos induction due to Gαq (Q209L), suggesting that the two pathways are independent and additive. Unfortunately, we are unable to detect changes in α-subunit protein in the LβT2 cells, and the FSHβ protein is expressed at an extremely low level. Despite this limitation, it is interesting to speculate that Gq and Gs pathways may be used differentially to regulate gonadotropin gene expression.In summary, we have provided evidence for the participation of both Gq and Gs signaling in the GnRH activation of ERK and induction of c-Fos and LHβ protein in LβT2 cells. These results are consistent with studies in primary pituitary cell cultures and confirm that the LβT2 cells are a good model system for in vitro studies of GnRH action. In addition, we demonstrated that a state of GnRH resistance can be induced by chronic Gqsignaling. Further studies are planned to investigate whether thisin vitro model of GnRH resistance is comparable with GnRH resistance seen in vivo. The family of G protein-coupled receptors is the largest and most complex group of integral membrane proteins involved in signal transduction. These receptors can be activated by a diverse array of external stimuli, including growth factors, neurotransmitters, peptide, and protein hormones, chemokines, and other ligands. Agonist binding to a specific receptor on the cell surface causes a conformational change in the receptor that allows it to interact with its cognate G protein, stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange on the α-subunit of the G protein. The release of the GTP-bound α-subunit and βγ-subunits from the receptor-G protein complex initiates a broad range of intracellular signaling events, including the activation of classical effectors such as phospholipase C, adenylate cyclases, and ion channels, and regulation of the intracellular level of inositol phosphates, calcium, cyclic AMP, and other second messengers (for reviews see Refs. 1Gudermann T.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)1 is a hypothalamic decapeptide, which serves as a key regulator of the reproductive system. In the pituitary, GnRH signals are transmitted via a specific cell surface receptor, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. When GnRH binds to its receptor, it induces interaction of the receptor with heterotrimeric G proteins. This interaction then initiates a variety of intracellular signaling events, including an increase in phosphoinositide turnover, which results in a rise in intracellular diacylglycerol and calcium levels, and an increase in intracellular cAMP levels (9Shacham S. Cheifetz M.N. Lewy H. Ashkenazi I.E. Becker O.M. Seger R. Naor Z. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1999; 60: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shacham S. Harris D. Ben-Shlomo H. Cohen I. Bonfil D. Przedecki F.

Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These second messengers then activate downstream kinases including protein kinase C, calcium-dependent kinases such as Pyk2 and calmodulin-dependent kinase IV, and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA. In dispersed pituitary cell cultures, treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) results in decreased inositol phosphate (IP) turnover in response to GnRH, suggesting that a PTX-sensitive G protein (such as Gi/o) couples the receptor to IP turnover (14Hawes B.E. Barnes S. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hawes B.E. Marzen J.E. Waters S.B. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In human reproductive tract tumors, the GnRH receptor also couples to Gi (16Imai A. Takagi H. Horibe S. Fuseya T. Tamaya T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, in G-GH3 cells, which are GH3 somatomammotropes transfected with the rat GnRH-receptor, GnRH evoked IP turnover is insensitive to PTX (17Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2214-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that a different G protein may be involved in signal transduction in these cells. Studies using immuno-depletion and G protein labeling showed that the GnRH receptor is coupled to Gq/11 in αT3–1 pituitary cells (18Hsieh K.P. Martin T.F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Grosse R. Schmid A. Schoneberg T. Herrlich A. Muhn P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9193-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly, in CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells expressing the human GnRH receptor, GnRH couples exclusively to the Gq/11family of G proteins (19Grosse R. Schmid A. Schoneberg T. Herrlich A. Muhn P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9193-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the GnRH receptor also couples to Gs in primary pituitary cultures and G-GH3 cells. This G protein activates adenylate cyclase, leading to production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (20Han X.B. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Lin X. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3896-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The promiscuity of the GnRH receptor is underscored by recent studies (22Stanislaus D. Ponder S., Ji, T.H. Conn P.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showing that the GnRH receptor is able to couple to all three subfamilies of G proteins, Gq/11, Gs, and Gi, when overexpressed in rat pituitary cultures and G-GH3 cells. It is evident from all of these studies that cell context is extremely important for coupling of the GnRH receptor to different G proteins and highlights the danger of extrapolating results from one cell type to another. We have demonstrated recently (23Liu F. Austin D.A. Mellon P.L. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that GnRH activates the ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK families in the LβT2 cells. These cells express the mRNAs for the GnRH receptor and hence for the α- and β-subunits of LH and FSH are a good model for pituitary gonadotropes (24Alarid E.T. Windle J.J. Whyte D.B. Mellon P.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3319-3329PubMed Google Scholar, 25Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation and nuclear localization of ERK occur via a PKC and MEK- dependent but calcium-independent process. GnRH also induces c-Fos and LHβ protein expression. Surprisingly, induction of both of these genes is PKC-independent but calcium- and MEK-dependent in LβT2 cells (23Liu F. Austin D.A. Mellon P.L. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Both PKC and calcium signaling are activated via the phospholipase C pathway. Activation of phospholipase C would be consistent with coupling to Gαqas this G protein can activate PLCβ1 and β3 (26Drissi H. Lasmoles F., Le Mellay V. Marie P.J. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20168-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, activation can also be Gαq-independent as Gβγ can activate PLCβ2 (27Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4695-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this study, we address the question of whether multiple G proteins are involved in GnRH receptor signaling in LβT2 cells. By using membrane-permeable TAT peptides designed to uncouple the receptor from the G protein, we show that both Gq/11 and Gsproteins are involved in GnRH receptor signaling in LβT2 cells. DISCUSSIONPreviously, we showed that GnRH activates ERK and induces c-Fos and LHβ protein expression in LβT2 cells. In this study, we examined which G proteins are involved in these GnRH effects. We show that GnRH induction of ERK, c-Fos, and LHβ is not inhibited by pertussis toxin or a peptide that sequesters Gβγ, effectively ruling out signaling via Gi. This agrees with the results from Naor and co-workers (9Shacham S. Cheifetz M.N. Lewy H. Ashkenazi I.E. Becker O.M. Seger R. Naor Z. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1999; 60: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar) showing that Gi is not involved in the GnRH response in αT3-1 cells (9Shacham S. Cheifetz M.N. Lewy H. Ashkenazi I.E. Becker O.M. Seger R. Naor Z. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1999; 60: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that binding of GnRH to the receptor leads to the activation of phospholipase C and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which leads directly to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of protein kinase C. This is mediated via the coupling of the receptor to the Gq/11 family of G proteins. Expression of a mutant Q209L-Gαq, which lacks GTPase activity, enhances phospholipase C stimulation and transformation in NIH-3T3 cells (36De Vivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that expression of this same Gq mutant (Q209L) by adenoviral infection partially mimics the induction of c-Fos and LHβ by GnRH. However, the extent of induction is only 50% that seen with GnRH suggesting the presence of additional signals. We were unable to detect the activation of ERK, most likely due to its transient nature. We also show that chronic activation of Gαq signaling via Gαq (Q209L) results in a state of GnRH resistance. The mechanisms of GnRH resistance are not known, but it may be related to either the down-regulation of diacylglycerol-dependent PKC isoforms or the rapid down-regulation of Gq/11 proteins that have been observed with chronic PMA and GnRH treatment.Signaling cascades often require an activated protein to contact its immediate downstream mediator. Disrupting this protein-protein interaction, by introducing one of the binding domains into cell, can thus block specific pathways. Previous studies (34Chang M. Zhang L. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7021-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Hamm H.E. Rarick H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,38Taylor J.M. Neubig R.R. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that the GPCR/G protein interaction can be disruptedin vitro by peptides derived from the C terminus of the G protein. This approach to analyze signaling has been limited, however, as most peptides do not readily penetrate the cell membrane. Some success has been achieved by lipid or chemical attachment to a membrane permeabilization sequence. In this study, we rendered the blocking peptides cell-permeable by expressing them as fusion proteins with the TAT protein transduction domain (31Becker-Hapak M. McAllister S.S. Dowdy S.F. Methods. 2001; 24: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We generated TAT fusion peptides containing decapeptides from the carboxyl termini of Gαq (GqCT) and Gαs(GsCT) and a 20-amino acid peptide from phospholipase Cβ2. The α-subunit peptides block the interaction of GPCRs with their respective G proteins, and the PLCβ2 peptide binds to free Gβγ-subunits. We used these peptides here to show that both Gq and Gs proteins participate in GnRH receptor signaling leading to ERK activation and c-Fos and LHβ protein expression in LβT2 cells.It is now well documented that Gβγ-subunits, as well as the Gα-subunits, have the ability to signal to downstream effectors. Effector activation by Gβγ released from both Gs and Gi heterotrimers has been reported (39Dickenson J.M. Hill S.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 355: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Murthy K.S. Coy D.H. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is possible that some of the activation of GnRH signaling is caused by Gβγ released from either Gq or Gs. In particular, the β2 isoform of phospholipase C is activated by Gβγ, as is adenylate cyclase 2. Thus, Gβγ signaling could potentially contribute to both Gq and Gs pathways. However, the lack of an effect with the Gβγ blocking peptide and the injection of the GST-βARK protein indicates that GnRH signaling is mediated primarily by α-subunits.Although it is thought that most of the biological actions of GnRH are mediated by Gq-coupled pathways, studies have suggested a physiological role for cAMP as a mediator of GnRH actions in the pituitary gland (42Bourne G.A. Baldwin D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E296-E299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third intracellular loop of the rat GnRH-R couples to both Gs and Gq/11-mediated signaling pathways in G-GH3 cells, and cAMP signaling is dependent on specific residues in the loop that are not essential for activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway (43Arora K.K. Krsmanovic L.Z. Mores N. O'Farrell H. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25581-25586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44Ulloa-Aguirre A. Stanislaus D. Arora V. Vaananen J. Brothers S. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both GnRH and cAMP activate the mouse GnRH-R gene promoter via the cAMP-response element in G-GH3 cells (45Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 46Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3452-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, there was no evidence for activation of Gs in αT3-1 cells (47Shah B.H. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study in tilapia pituitary cells demonstrated that GnRH induction of both α and FSHβ subunit genes was sensitive to inhibition of PKA, suggesting activation of cAMP signaling (48Gur G. Bonfil D. Safarian H. Naor Z. Yaron Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 189: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Induction of LHβ on the other hand was relatively resistant to inhibition of PKA but sensitive to PKC and MEK signaling. Our data suggest that both Gq and Gs are involved in GnRH receptor signaling in LβT2 cells similar to the tilapia study. We showed that artificial elevation of cAMP with forskolin can induce c-Fos protein expression on its own and can enhance c-Fos induction due to Gαq (Q209L), suggesting that the two pathways are independent and additive. Unfortunately, we are unable to detect changes in α-subunit protein in the LβT2 cells, and the FSHβ protein is expressed at an extremely low level. Despite this limitation, it is interesting to speculate that Gq and Gs pathways may be used differentially to regulate gonadotropin gene expression.In summary, we have provided evidence for the participation of both Gq and Gs signaling in the GnRH activation of ERK and induction of c-Fos and LHβ protein in LβT2 cells. These results are consistent with studies in primary pituitary cell cultures and confirm that the LβT2 cells are a good model system for in vitro studies of GnRH action. In addition, we demonstrated that a state of GnRH resistance can be induced by chronic Gqsignaling. Further studies are planned to investigate whether thisin vitro model of GnRH resistance is comparable with GnRH resistance seen in vivo. Previously, we showed that GnRH activates ERK and induces c-Fos and LHβ protein expression in LβT2 cells. In this study, we examined which G proteins are involved in these GnRH effects. We show that GnRH induction of ERK, c-Fos, and LHβ is not inhibited by pertussis toxin or a peptide that sequesters Gβγ, effectively ruling out signaling via Gi. This agrees with the results from Naor and co-workers (9Shacham S. Cheifetz M.N. Lewy H. Ashkenazi I.E. Becker O.M. Seger R. Naor Z. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1999; 60: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar) showing that Gi is not involved in the GnRH response in αT3-1 cells (9Shacham S. Cheifetz M.N. Lewy H. Ashkenazi I.E. Becker O.M. Seger R. Naor Z. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1999; 60: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that binding of GnRH to the receptor leads to the activation of phospholipase C and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which leads directly to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of protein kinase C. This is mediated via the coupling of the receptor to the Gq/11 family of G proteins. Expression of a mutant Q209L-Gαq, which lacks GTPase activity, enhances phospholipase C stimulation and transformation in NIH-3T3 cells (36De Vivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that expression of this same Gq mutant (Q209L) by adenoviral infection partially mimics the induction of c-Fos and LHβ by GnRH. However, the extent of induction is only 50% that seen with GnRH suggesting the presence of additional signals. We were unable to detect the activation of ERK, most likely due to its transient nature. We also show that chronic activation of Gαq signaling via Gαq (Q209L) results in a state of GnRH resistance. The mechanisms of GnRH resistance are not known, but it may be related to either the down-regulation of diacylglycerol-dependent PKC isoforms or the rapid down-regulation of Gq/11 proteins that have been observed with chronic PMA and GnRH treatment. Signaling cascades often require an activated protein to contact its immediate downstream mediator. Disrupting this protein-protein interaction, by introducing one of the binding domains into cell, can thus block specific pathways. Previous studies (34Chang M. Zhang L. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7021-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Hamm H.E. Rarick H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,38Taylor J.M. Neubig R.R. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that the GPCR/G protein interaction can be disruptedin vitro by peptides derived from the C terminus of the G protein. This approach to analyze signaling has been limited, however, as most peptides do not readily penetrate the cell membrane. Some success has been achieved by lipid or chemical attachment to a membrane permeabilization sequence. In this study, we rendered the blocking peptides cell-permeable by expressing them as fusion proteins with the TAT protein transduction domain (31Becker-Hapak M. McAllister S.S. Dowdy S.F. Methods. 2001; 24: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We generated TAT fusion peptides containing decapeptides from the carboxyl termini of Gαq (GqCT) and Gαs(GsCT) and a 20-amino acid peptide from phospholipase Cβ2. The α-subunit peptides block the interaction of GPCRs with their respective G proteins, and the PLCβ2 peptide binds to free Gβγ-subunits. We used these peptides here to show that both Gq and Gs proteins participate in GnRH receptor signaling leading to ERK activation and c-Fos and LHβ protein expression in LβT2 cells. It is now well documented that Gβγ-subunits, as well as the Gα-subunits, have the ability to signal to downstream effectors. Effector activation by Gβγ released from both Gs and Gi heterotrimers has been reported (39Dickenson J.M. Hill S.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 355: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Murthy K.S. Coy D.H. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is possible that some of the activation of GnRH signaling is caused by Gβγ released from either Gq or Gs. In particular, the β2 isoform of phospholipase C is activated by Gβγ, as is adenylate cyclase 2. Thus, Gβγ signaling could potentially contribute to both Gq and Gs pathways. However, the lack of an effect with the Gβγ blocking peptide and the injection of the GST-βARK protein indicates that GnRH signaling is mediated primarily by α-subunits. Although it is thought that most of the biological actions of GnRH are mediated by Gq-coupled pathways, studies have suggested a physiological role for cAMP as a mediator of GnRH actions in the pituitary gland (42Bourne G.A. Baldwin D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E296-E299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third intracellular loop of the rat GnRH-R couples to both Gs and Gq/11-mediated signaling pathways in G-GH3 cells, and cAMP signaling is dependent on specific residues in the loop that are not essential for activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway (43Arora K.K.

Vaananen J. Brothers S. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both GnRH and cAMP activate the mouse GnRH-R gene promoter via the cAMP-response element in G-GH3 cells (45Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 46Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3452-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, there was no evidence for activation of Gs in αT3-1 cells (47Shah B.H. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study in tilapia pituitary cells demonstrated that GnRH induction of both α and FSHβ subunit genes was sensitive to inhibition of PKA, suggesting activation of cAMP signaling (48Gur G. Bonfil D. Safarian H. Naor Z. Yaron Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 189: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Induction of LHβ on the other hand was relatively resistant to inhibition of PKA but sensitive to PKC and MEK signaling. Our data suggest that both Gq and Gs are involved in GnRH receptor signaling in LβT2 cells similar to the tilapia study. We showed that artificial elevation of cAMP with forskolin can induce c-Fos protein expression on its own and can enhance c-Fos induction due to Gαq (Q209L), suggesting that the two pathways are independent and additive. Unfortunately, we are unable to detect changes in α-subunit protein in the LβT2 cells, and the FSHβ protein is expressed at an extremely low level. Despite this limitation, it is interesting to speculate that Gq and Gs pathways may be used differentially to regulate gonadotropin gene expression. In summary, we have provided evidence for the participation of both Gq and Gs signaling in the GnRH activation of ERK and induction of c-Fos and LHβ protein in LβT2 cells. These results are consistent with studies in primary pituitary cell cultures and confirm that the LβT2 cells are a good model system for in vitro studies of GnRH action. In addition, we demonstrated that a state of GnRH resistance can be induced by chronic Gqsignaling. Further studies are planned to investigate whether thisin vitro model of GnRH resistance is comparable with GnRH resistance seen in vivo. We thank Dr. A. F.

https://openalex.org/W2083871368,"The properties of an interacting electron system depend on the electron correlations and the effective dimensionality. For example, Coulomb repulsion between electrons may inhibit, or completely block, conduction by intersite electron hopping, thereby determining whether a material is a metal or an insulator. Furthermore, correlation effects increase as the number of effective dimensions decreases; in three-dimensional systems, the low-energy electronic states behave as quasiparticles, whereas in one-dimensional systems, even weak interactions break the quasiparticles into collective excitations. Dimensionality is particularly important for exotic low-dimensional materials where one- or two-dimensional building blocks are loosely connected into a three-dimensional whole. Here we examine two such layered metallic systems with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and electronic transport measurements, and we find a crossover in the number of effective dimensions from two to three with decreasing temperature. This is apparent from the observation that, in the direction perpendicular to the layers, the materials have an insulating character at high temperatures but become metal-like at low temperatures, whereas transport within the layers remains metallic over the whole temperature range. We propose that this change in effective dimensionality correlates with the presence of coherent quasiparticles within the layers."
https://openalex.org/W1989981838,"Previous studies have shown that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades signal the induction of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in glial cells (Bhat, N. R., Zhang, P., Lee, J. C., and Hogan E. L. (1998)J. Neurosci. 18, 1633–1641; Bhat, N. R., Zhang, P., and Bhat, A. N. (1999) J. Neurochem. 72, 472–478). This study further investigates the role of p38 MAPK in the transcriptional activation of the iNOS gene by transient transfection with constitutively active upstream kinases in the pathway (i.e. MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3b(E)) and MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6b(E)). Expression in C-6 glial cells of either MKK3b(E) or MKK6b(E) resulted in an induction of the activity of a cotransfected rat iNOS promoter-reporter (iNOS-luciferase (Luc)) gene and an enhancement of cytokine-induced expression of iNOS mRNA, both of which were inhibitable by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. The MKK constructs also induced cAMP response element-mediated (CRE-Luc) and nuclear factor κB-dependent (nuclear factor κB-Luc) transcriptional activities. Transfection with dominant negative (dn) forms of CRE-binding protein (CREB) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), the two CRE-binding transcription factors targeted by the p38 MAPK pathway, resulted in opposite effects; dnCREB enhanced and dnC/EBP inhibited iNOS-Luc parallel to their effects on CRE-Luc. In addition, the induction, by MKK3b(E) and MKK6b(E), of iNOS promoter activity was enhanced by a wild-type activating transcription factor (ATF-2), whereas a phosphorylation-defective form of ATF-2 had a suppressive effect. The results of these molecular studies provide evidence for an important role for the p38 MAPK pathway in the transcriptional activation of the iNOS gene in rat glial cells involving the transcription factors nuclear factor κB, C/EBP, and ATF-2.

The mechanisms by which these agents induce the expression of iNOS have been the focus of intense study in the hope that strategies can be developed to inhibit NO synthesis and thus suppress inflammatory reactions. We (14Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Bhat A.N. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28373-28380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) have shown recently that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are involved in cytokine and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated iNOS induction in primary glial cells. MAPKs are a family of Ser/Thr-specific signaling kinases activated by a variety of intracellular stimuli through a cascade of protein phosphorylations. The three well studied mammalian MAPKs are: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. ERK is commonly activated by receptor Tyr kinases and G protein-coupled receptors, whereas JNK and p38 MAPK are potently activated by a variety of environmental stress and proinflammatory signals. Once activated, the MAPKs phosphorylate their respective substrates including several nuclear and cytoplasmic targets to regulate diverse cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, the inflammatory response, and even cell death (17Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 18Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

The upstream transduction chain of ERK is well known and consists of Ras-Raf-MAPK or ERK kinase (MKK/MEK)1/2. By contrast, the upstream regulators of JNK and p38 MAPK are less well defined. The immediate upstream transducers for these stress-activated protein kinases are MKK4/7-MEKK1 and MKK3/6-MEKK1, respectively. There is growing evidence that a number of additional MKKs (including MEKK2–5, mixed lineage kinases, or MLK1–3, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 or ASK1, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 or TAK1, p21-activated kinase or PAK and other Ste20 homologs) can function as upstream elements within the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways (18Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 20Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Each of the three MAPK modules has the potential to elicit transcriptional activation through phosphorylation of sets of transcription factors (22Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4398) Google Scholar, 23Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 24Treisman R. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). For example, ERKs target c-Myc, Elk-1, and Ets-2; JNKs phosphorylate c-Jun, Elk-1, and ATF-2; p38 MAPKs prefer Elk-1, CHOP/C/EBP, MEF2C, ATF-2, and CREB. Additionally, they may have cytoplasmic targets including downstream kinases, i.e. the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p90rsk) or mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPKAP K-1) (for ERKs), MAPKAP K2/K-3 (for p38), and MAPK-interacting kinases MNK1/2 and mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK-1) (for both ERK and p38 MAPK). These downstream kinases are capable of phosphorylating both cytoplasmic targets and nuclear factors such as SRF and CREB. A prominent role for p38 MAPK-mediated signaling in the transcriptional control of iNOS gene expression has been suggested in previous studies using a specific inhibitor of the kinase, SB203580 (14Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Bhat A.N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This finding is in line with accumulating evidence in favor of a major function of the kinase pathway in inflammatory cell signaling and the synthesis of a variety of proinflammatory molecules including cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules (26Herlaar E. Brown Z. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 27Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis indicates that the promoter regions of iNOS (as well as other proinflammatory molecules) contain consensus binding sites for numerous transcription factors including NFκΒ, C/EBP, CRE, Oct-1, AP-1, GAS, and IRE, of which many act as substrates of p38 MAPK or its downstream kinases (28Lowenstein C.J.

A detailed understanding of the relevant intracellular and nuclear signaling pathways including those mediated by MAPK cascades is helpful in identifying the control mechanisms whereby the expression of iNOS and other proinflammatory molecules are regulated. In the present study, we have employed a molecular approach, i.e. transient transfection with active forms of MKK3 and MKK6, the two known intracellular activators of p38 MAPK, to characterize further the signaling cascade involving the p38 MAPK pathway with respect to the regulation of iNOS gene expression in a glial cell model, i.e. C-6 glia. The results provide evidence for p38 MAPK-mediated nuclear signaling via NFκB, C/EBP, and ATF-2 in the regulation of iNOS promoter activity. Calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Invitrogen. Bacterial LPS, forskolin, and an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture were from Sigma. The recombinant cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF-α were from Prepro Tech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Anti-phosphospecific p38 MAPK (Tyr-182) antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-total p38 MAPK was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

The transfection reagent PolyFect was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Luciferase assay kits were from Promega (Madison, WI). Constructs containing active forms of MKK3 (pcDNAMKK3b(E)) and MKK6 (pcDNAMKK6b(E)) were a generous gift from Dr. J. Han (Scripps Clinic). Wild type and phosphorylation-defective ATF-2 (ATF-269,71Thr-Ala) were from Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts). Dominant negative (dn)CREB was from Dr. R. H. Goodman (Oregon Health Science University), and dnC/EBP-β was from Dr. R. M. Pope (Northwestern University). The reporter constructs pCRE-Luc and pNFκΒ-Luc were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The rat iNOS-Luc construct was made as described before (31Gavrilyuk V. Horvath P. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2,168-bp fragment of the rat iNOS promoter was amplified from Harlan Sprague-Dawley liver genomic DNA by PCR using primers derived from the published rat iNOS promoter sequence (32Zhang H.F. Chen X.S. Teng X.W. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1873-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (forward, 5′-CAG CCA AGT ATT CCA AAG CAA-3′, corresponding to bases 1108–1127; reverse, 5′-AGT CCA GTC CCC TCA CCA A-3′, corresponding to bases 3259–3277), and its identity was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The 2.2-kb fragment was ligated into the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega) and used for transient transfections. Renilla luciferase used as the internal control was from Promega. Transient transfections were carried out using a kit from Qiagen (PolyFect) according to manufacturer's protocols. Subconfluent cultures of C-6 glial cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with each reporter plasmid (iNOS-Luc, NFκΒ-Luc, and pCRE-Luc) and a plasmid expressing the enzyme Renillaluciferase from Renilla reniformis as an internal control. In all cases, the total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with corresponding empty vector. Where indicated, cells, 48 h after transfection, were treated with different stimuli for 6 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities present in cellular lysates were assayed by the use of the Dual Luciferase Reporter System (Promega), with a luminometer as specified by the manufacturer. The data represent firefly luciferase activity normalized byRenilla luciferase activity present in each sample expressed as -fold induction relative to control. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of iNOS mRNA was carried out as described previously (14Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Bhat A.N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) parallel to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase controls. The products were separated on agarose gels impregnated with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. C-6 glial cells were maintained as stock cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. Whenever required for experiments, the cells were subcultured in 12-well plates and used either for transfections or for the measurement of nitric oxide synthesis after cytokine treatment. Western blot was performed for the analysis of p38 MAPK activation (using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of the kinase) and iNOS. Briefly, protein samples (cell extracts, 20 μg of protein equivalents) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, 1% milk powder in 10 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h and incubated overnight with suitably diluted primary antibodies. After extensive washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with anti-IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The blot was finally developed with the alkaline phosphatase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (50 μg/ml) along with nitro blue tetrazolium (100 μg/ml) in sodium glycinate buffer (pH 9.6) in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2 NO production was determined by measurement of nitrite in the medium as described before (14Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of the spent medium was mixed with an equal volume of 1:1 mixture of 1% sulfanilamide in water and 0.1%N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 5% phosphoric acid. The absorbance was then read at 570 nm. Sodium nitrite dissolved in the culture medium was used as the standard. In previous studies, we have shown that combinations of cytokines and LPS stimulate iNOS induction in primary glial cultures in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner (14Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Bhat A.N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We tested whether a similar type of regulation occurs in the rat C-6 glioma cell line in which iNOS regulation and inflammatory gene expression have been studied extensively. Cell cultures were treated with LPS and the cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ individually and in combinations, and the production of NO in the form of nitrite was determined. As shown in Fig. 1A, incubation with the combination of LPS, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (LTI) yielded the maximal induction of NO production. To confirm a role for p38 MAPK in C-6 cell iNOS induction, the cultures were exposed to LTI in the presence of increasing concentrations of SB203580. A dose-dependent inhibitory effect of the drug is depicted in Fig. 1B, which indicates that as in the case of primary astrocytes and microglia (14Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), iNOS expression in C-6 glia depends on the activity of the p38 MAPK pathway. We next examined the activation of a rat iNOS promoter construct in C-6 glia in response to cytokine treatment and the effect of the MAPK inhibitor on that activity. A plasmid containing a 2.2-kb portion of the rat iNOS promoter attached to the luciferase gene (iNOS-Luc) was introduced into subconfluent cultures of C-6 glia by transient transfection. After 40 h, the cultures were treated with LPS and cytokines, individually and in combinations, for a further 6 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast to NO production, the iNOS promoter activity was substantially (2-fold) stimulated upon incubation with LPS alone. However, that activity was enhanced further when LPS was supplemented with other cytokines, and maximal stimulation (3-fold) of the iNOS promoter was achieved using a combination of LPS with TNF-α and IFN-γ. The activation of the iNOS promoter was inhibited by SB203580 with a similar dose-response curve (Fig. 2B). p38 MAPK is activated by its immediately upstream kinases MKK3 and MKK6 upon their activation in response to extracellular stimuli. Introduction of active forms of these intermediate kinases is therefore expected to mimic cellular responses elicited by extracellular signals acting through this kinase cascade. In cotransfection experiments, we tested the effects of expression of the active MKK3 (MKK3b(E)) and MKK6 (MKK6b(E)) on iNOS promoter activity. Transfection of C-6 cells with either MKK3b(E) or MKK6b(E) (but not their corresponding wild type, nonactive forms, data not shown) resulted in p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), reflecting its activation state and therefore confirming the intracellular activity of the transfected kinases. A dose-dependent induction of the iNOS-Luc activity by transfected MKK3b(E) and MKK6b(E) but not the wild type forms, is shown in Fig. 3B. Although transfection with the active MKK3b(E) kinase strongly induced iNOS promoter activity, by itself it was minimally active in inducing the expression of the endogenous iNOS enzyme (Fig. 4, A and B). However, incubation of kinase-transfected cells with LPS resulted in a detectable level of nitrite and iNOS expression, whereas exposure to LPS in combination with IFN-γ led to a further increase in iNOS induction. Similar results were obtained with cells transfected with MKK6b(E) (data not included). These results suggest that post-transcriptional events are necessary for iNOS protein expression, but they are not activated by MKK3 or MKK6.FIG. 4Induction of iNOS enzyme expression and nitrite production in C-6 glia transfected with MKK3b(E). A, cells were transfected with either pcDNA (empty vector) or MKK3b(E). After 2 days, the two sets of cultures were treated with LPS, IFN-γ, or a combination of the two for an additional 3 days. The medium from each culture well was then tested for nitrite production, and the cell pellets were analyzed for iNOS protein by immunoblot using a specific antibody. Nitrite values are expressed as the average ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. #, p ≤ 0.05 compared with the empty vector. B, sets of cultures transfected with either the control vector (pcDNA) or MKK3b(E) for 40 h were treated with a combination of LPS and IFN-γ in the presence and absence of 15 μm SB203580. The cultures were incubated for an additional 3 days, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot using anti-iNOS antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the role, if any, of the p38 pathway in the post-transcriptional regulation of iNOS involving mRNA stabilization, we determined the degradation rate of iNOS mRNA in the presence and absence of SB203580. To induce iNOS, the cultures were treated with the cytokine/LPS combination, LTI for 6 h, a time point at which the expression of iNOS mRNA peaks (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 5A, this induction is inhibitable by SB203580. After a 6-h induction of iNOS mRNA in response to LTI, the cultures in two sets were exposed to actinomycin D (an inhibitor of RNA synthesis) alone or to actinomycin D plus SB203580 for various lengths of time, and the iNOS mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-PCR. The data shown in Fig. 5, B and C, indicate that the rate of decay of LTI-induced iNOS mRNA is essentially unaltered in the presence of the kinase inhibitor, suggesting that the p38 MAPK pathway may not participate in stabilization of iNOS mRNA. Similar results were obtained with cells transfected with MKK3b(E) and treated with the cytokines (data not shown). As expected, the activation of iNOS promoter activity elicited by the two active MKKs was susceptible to inhibition by SB203580 (Fig.6, top panel). The iNOS promoter contains several regulatory elements including NFκB, CRE, and C/CAAT box, which act as binding sites for specific transcription factors that are presumed targets (direct or indirect) of p38 MAPK. Therefore, we tested the effect of active MKKs on NFκB- and CRE-dependent transcriptional activities parallel to iNOS promoter activation. As shown in Fig. 6, middle and bottom panels, the kinases stimulate the activities of both CRE-Luc and NFκB-Luc, respectively, and parallel to iNOS-Luc. Again, these activities are susceptible to inhibition by SB203580, suggesting that the relevant transcription factors, i.e. CREB or CREB-related proteins and NFκB, lie downstream from the p38 MAPK signal. The transcription factor CREB is a target of the p38 MAPK pathway via downstream kinases, MAPKAP kinases and MNK1/2 (23Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), after which phospho-CREB protein binds to CRE motifs present in target gene promoters to induce transcriptional activities. To determine the possible role of CREB in mediating transcriptional activation of the iNOS promoter in response to activated MKK3 and MKK6, we cotransfected cells with the active kinases together with dnCREB followed by determination of the iNOS-Luc activity. As shown in Fig.7A, dnCREB significantly potentiated iNOS activation by MKKs. These results suggest that CREB normally negatively regulates iNOS promoter activity in C-6 cells. Interestingly, similar effects of dnCREB on the activation of CRE-Luc promoter by MKKs were observed, namely a potentiation of MKK activation by dnCREB (Fig. 7B). In fact, dnCREB was found to increase CRE-Luc activity markedly in MKK3/6-transfected cells. That the dnCREB was functional was indicated by a parallel experiment in which the forskolin-stimulated CRE-Luc activity was inhibited by dnCREB (Fig.7C). The CRE site present in the rat iNOS promoter has the potential to bind transcription factors in addition to CREB which are also potential direct targets of MAPKs including C/EBP and ATF-2. To examine the role of C/EBP in iNOS induction, we introduced a dominant negative form of C/EBP and assayed iNOS promoter activity in cells cotransfected with active MKK3. As shown in Fig. 8, dnC/EBP elicits a significant inhibitory effect on MKK3-induced activation of the iNOS promoter activity. Similar results were obtained with MKK6 cotransfected with dnC/EBP (data not shown). These findings suggest that C/EBP normally acts to increase activation of the iNOS promoter. A possible role for ATF-2 in mediating iNOS promoter activation by MKKs was examined by transfecting cells with either a wild type or a mutant (phosphorylation-defective) form of ATF-2 (33Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Transfection with wild type ATF-2 enhanced, whereas mutant ATF-2 inhibited the MKK3-induced iNOS promoter activity (Fig. 9), thereby implicating a role for this transcription factor in iNOS gene expression. The inhibitory effect of the mutant was more prominent upon MKK3 but not MKK6 induction of iNOS-Luc. Excessive production of NO, mainly by activated glial cells, has been linked to several inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (3Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 33-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Parkinson J.F. Mitrovic B. Merrill J.E. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Bolanos J.P. Almeida A.

Trans. 1997; 25: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A greater understanding of the signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of glial iNOS has therefore potential therapeutic implications. Using a pharmacological approach, we had shown previously that MAPK signaling, in particular p38 MAPK, mediates endotoxin and cytokine stimulation of iNOS expression in cultured glial cells (14Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Bhat A.N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The present studies extend these observations and examine further the role of p38 MAPK in the transcriptional activation of iNOS gene using a transiently transfected rat iNOS promoter-reporter construct. Stimulation of cultured C-6 glial cells with cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and LPS results in an induced production of NO, which is mostly accounted for by a stimulation of iNOS promoter activity. The induction of iNOS-Luc and the production of NO were similarly inhibited by SB203580, suggesting the role of this kinase pathway in iNOS expression at the transcriptional level.

https://openalex.org/W2051427868,"TSLC1 is a tumor suppressor gene encoding a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. The significant homology of its extracellular domain with those of otherIg superfamily cell adhesionmolecules (IgCAMs) has raised the possibility that TSLC1 participates in cell-cell interactions. In this study, the physiological properties of TSLC1 were investigated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing TSLC1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as well as in the cells that express endogenous TSLC1. Biochemical analysis has revealed that TSLC1 is anN-linked glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 75 kDa and that it forms homodimers through cis interaction within the plane of the cell membranes. Confocal laser scanning microcopy of the cells expressing TSLC1 showed the localization patterns characteristic to adhesion molecules. At the beginning of cell attachment, TSLC1 accumulated in interdigitated structures at cell-cell boundaries, but, when cells reached a confluence, TSLC1 was distributed all along the cell membranes. In polarized cells, TSLC1 was recruited to the lateral membrane, implying trans interaction of TSLC1 between neighboring cells. In support of this notion, MDCK cells expressing TSLC1-GFP showed a significant level of cell aggregation in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Taken together, these results indicate that TSLC1 mediates intracellular adhesion through homophilic interactions in a Ca2+/Mg2+-independent manner.

Genet. 2001; 27: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated the two-hit inactivation of TSLC1 in primary non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer, implying its involvement in various human cancers (1Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). TSLC1 encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily proteins comprising three Ig-like C2-type domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning α-helix, and a cytoplasmic domain containing a putative signaling motif (1Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat.

From the significant homology of its extracellular domain with those of NCAM1 and NCAM2,1 we have inferred that TSLC1 is capable of mediating cell-cell interaction. Cell adhesion molecules generally fall into four major classes: the cadherins, the integrins, the selectins, and the Ig superfamily. Among them, Ig superfamily cell adhesionmolecules (IgCAMs) are the largest, numbering well over 100 members in vertebrates (2Hynes R.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M33-M37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These well-characterized molecules include NCAMs (3Edelman G.M. Annu. Rev.

Cell Res. 1997; 235: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Whereas cadherins and integrins require divalent cations such as Ca2+ or Mg2+ for their adhesive activities (9Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IgCAMs are usually Ca2+- or Mg2+-independent (10Benson D.L. Schnapp L.M. Shapiro L. Huntley G.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, most IgCAMs have preferences for homophilic and/or heterophilic interactions (10Benson D.L. Schnapp L.M. Shapiro L. Huntley G.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In combination with these interactions, IgCAMs promote a variety of cell-cell associations throughcis interaction within the plane of the membranes and/ortrans interaction across the membranes (2Hynes R.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M33-M37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Brummendorf T. Lemmon V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For instance, the heterophilic cis interaction between L1 and NCAM appears to enhance the homophilic trans-binding activity of L1 (12Kadmon G. Kowitz A. Altevogt P. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Kadmon G. Kowitz A. Altevogt P. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nectins form cis-homodimers that undergo homophilic and heterophilic trans interactions with each other to mediate cell-cell adhesion (6Miyahara M. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Satoh-Horikawa K.

In this study, the biochemical properties and subcellular localization of TSLC1 were investigated in the cells expressing TSLC1 tagged with GFP or endogenous TSLC1. We report the physiological properties of TSLC1 along with several lines of evidence that TSLC1 is a single transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell aggregation through homophilic trans interaction. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 (JCRB9068) and MDCK cells (JCRB9029) were obtained from the Human Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), whereas MDCK cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma Chemical) supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 10% FCS. Human colorectal carcinoma Caco-2 (HTB-37) cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 20% FCS. All media used in this study contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of green fluorescent protein (GFP), monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against GFP were purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HA (sc-7392) and ZO-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), respectively. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against TSLC1 (CC2) was raised against 18 synthetic polypeptides of the C terminus of TSLC coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and purified with an affinity column (Asahi Technoglass, Japan). Secondary antibodies for immunoblot analysis were from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, England). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) was used as a secondary antibody for immunofluorescence staining. Construction of pTSLC1-GFP was described previously (1Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For the construction of pTSLC1-HA, an HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced at the C terminus of TSLC1, which was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (pcTSLC1) in our previous study (1Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To prepare MDCK cells stably expressing TSLC1-GFP (MDCK/TSLC1-GFP), MDCK cells were transfected with pTSLC1-GFP using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable clones were selected in the media containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) (Invitrogen). Stably transfected clones were maintained in the presence of 300 μg/ml G418. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pTSLC1-GFP and/or pTSLC1-HA as described above. Cell lysates were prepared using a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The cell extract was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration of each sample was determined by the method of Bradford using a protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with an appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then added with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were rinsed four times with the lysis buffer, suspended in a sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. The samples were fractionated in 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and reacted with a mouse monoclonal antibody against GFP. The binding of the primary antibody was detected with Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting Substrate (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. For inhibitingN-linked glycosylation, when MDCK cells reached 70% confluence, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Two days later, cell lysates were prepared and incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody as described above. For enzymatic digestion of N-linked oligosaccharides, immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with a lysis buffer and eluted by boiling for 5 min in 150 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 0.6% SDS, and 1.5% β-mercaptoethanol. The eluted samples were treated with 1.5 unit of N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) and incubated overnight at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instruction. The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot detection of GFP-tagged proteins was carried out as described above. A monolayer of nonpolarized MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells was rinsed twice with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 3 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3, Pierce, Rockford, IL) at room temperature with constant agitation for 20 min. The reaction was quenched with the addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protein samples were then prepared by lysing the cross-linked cells in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm iodoacetamide. For chemical cross-linking of dissociated cells, 293 cells were rinsed with PBS, trypsinized, and dispersed by gentle pipetting. The cells were resuspended in PBS at 5 × 105 cells/ml, transferred to 15-ml polypropylene tubes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY), and incubated in the presence or absence of 3 mm BS3 at room temperature with constant agitation for 20 min. The reaction was stopped as described above. To assure a single-cell suspension, the cells were subjected to phase-contrast microscopy before and after the chemical cross-linking reaction. The cells were then spun down and added to a lysis buffer containing 10 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain protein samples. A cell aggregation assay was performed as described previously (14Miura M. Asou H. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10752-10758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To improve the detachment efficiency, a monolayer of MDCK cells or MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells was trypsinized 1 day prior to the experiment, split into two 100-mm plates, and cultured overnight. Subconfluent layers were rinsed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS, detached by incubation in 0.2% trypsin/1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min, and dispersed by gentle pipetting. After washing in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), the cells were resuspended in normal HBSS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+(Invitrogen), Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS (Invitrogen), or Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS containing 5 mm EDTA (5 × 105 cell/ml). The cell suspension (1 ml/well) was reseeded in 12-well plates precoated with bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma Chemical Co.) and rotated on a gyratory shaker at 37 °C for 20, 40, or 60 min. Aggregation was stopped with the addition of 2% glutaraldehyde. The extent of aggregation of cells was represented by the ratio of the total particle number at time t of incubation (Nt) to the initial particle number (N0). Cells were seeded on BIOCOAT collagen I-coated eight-well culture slides (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) a couple of days before fixation. For polarity experiments, MDCK/TSLC1-GFP or Caco-2 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per 24-mm Transwell-COL collagen-coated filter insert (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and allowed to grow to confluence for 3–4 days. The cells were washed twice in PBS (pH 7.2) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. For indirect fluorescent microscopy of HEK 293 or Caco-2, cells were seeded and fixed as described above. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, blocked for 30 min with 5% normal donkey serum (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) in PBS, and stained with the indicated primary antibodies diluted in 1% normal donkey serum overnight at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature and washed with PBS. The slides were mounted with a Vectashield antifade reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), covered with glass coverslips, and examined with a Zeiss LSM510 or Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser confocal scanning system equipped with a 488/514-nm argon and a 543-nm helium-neon laser. The X–Z vertical sections were generated with a 0.2-μm motor step. Each image represents a single averaged (16-line scan) image. In an attempt to elucidate the physiological function of TSLC1, an expression vector for TSLC1 tagged with GFP at its C terminus (pTSLC1-GFP) (1Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) was introduced into MDCK cells, and stable transfectants (MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells) were obtained. 200 μg of protein samples prepared from the cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, generating a single band at 100 kDa (Fig.1B, lane 2). By subtracting the molecular mass of GFP, 27 kDa, the size of TSLC1 was estimated at ∼75 kDa. The sequence analysis of TSLC1 predicted that its extracellular domain bears six NX(S/T) motifs for N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 1A). We, therefore, enzymatically digested the TSLC1-GFP protein withN-glycosidase F to release putative N-linked oligosaccharides. Approximately one half of the 100-kDa species was replaced with an 80-kDa species, confirming that TSLC1 was indeed glycosylated (Fig. 1B, lane 3) even though a 100-kDa species remained detectable even after the treatment, presumably due to incomplete digestion with N-glycosidase F. Consistent with this result, treating MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells with tunicamycin for 48 h, an antibiotic that inhibitsN-linked glycosylation, also gave rise to a band at 80 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that the size of TSLC1 in a deglycosylated form is ∼50 kDa. Previous studies have shown that the majority of IgCAMs function through homophilic and/or heterophilic interaction (2Hynes R.O.

We therefore investigated pre-existing forms of TSLC1 on the cell membrane by treating the monolayer of nonpolarized MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells with BS3, a noncleavable membrane-impermeable cross-linker. Protein samples were prepared in the presence of iodoacetamide to prevent the formation of nonspecific disulfide linkages. Immunoprecipitation of the cross-linker-treated samples followed by immunoblot analysis yielded an additional signal with a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa (Fig.2A, upper band), which seemed to represent the dimerized form of TSLC1-GFP present on the cell surface. We thus examined whether TSLC1 forms homodimers by transiently coexpressing TSLC1-GFP and TSLC1-HA in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The protein samples prepared from these cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody and immunoblotted with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. The result revealed coimmunoprecipitation of TSLC1-HA with TSLC1-GFP (Fig. 2B, right panel), indicating that TSLC1molecules were dimerized through homophilic interaction. These results led us to analyze the pre-existing forms of endogenous TSLC1 on the cell membrane. Several cell lines were tested for their expression of endogenous TSLC1 by Western blot analysis using anti-TSLC1 polyclonal antibody (CC2), which recognizes the C terminus of TSLC1, and it was found that HEK293 cells expressed a considerable amount of endogenous TSLC1 (data not shown). A single-cell suspension of HEK293 cells was incubated in the presence or absence of a chemical cross-linker BS3 followed by Western blot analysis with a CC2 antibody. Without a chemical cross-linker, a single band was detected at 75 kDa (Fig. 2C), which was compatible with the molecular size of TSLC1 estimated from the size of TSLC1-GFP (∼100 kDa) described above. By contrast, with 3 mm BS3, an immunoreactive signal was detected predominantly at 150 kDa on the blot (Fig. 2C), indicating that TSLC1 substantially exists as homodimers on the cell surface. Since chemical cross-linking was performed after dissociation of the cells, the homodimers of TSLC1 observed were most likely the consequence of cis interaction within the plane of the membrane of individual cells. In this regard, treating the monolayer of nonpolarized MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells with BS3 also showed a signal corresponding to monomeric TSLC1-GFP (Fig. 2A), which could be an artifact caused by overexpression of TSLC1-GFP. We explored subcellular distribution of TSLC1 in MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells at a range of cell densities by confocal laser scanning microscopy. When cells were well spread, TSLC1 molecules were distributed to punctate structures in the cytoplasm and at the tip of cell surface protrusions that were about to make contact with neighboring cell surfaces (Fig.3, A1–A2). It is intriguing that, at the initial stage of cell-cell attachment, TSLC1 was concentrated to zipper-like structures at the cell-cell boundaries, where filopodia are thought to penetrate and embed into opposing cells (Fig. 3, B1–B2). Once cells became confluent, TSLC1 protein was localized to all along cell membranes (Fig. 3, C1–C2). We next viewed subcellular localization of endogenous TSLC1 in HEK 293 cells. Immunostaining for endogenous TSLC1 with a CC2 antibody exhibited similar patterns to those of TSLC1-GFP exogenously introduced into MDCK cells at either low (Fig. 4, A1–A3) or high (Fig. 4, B1–B3) cell density.FIG. 4Subcellular localization of endogenous TSLC1 in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were seeded on culture slides at various cell densities. A few days later, the cells were permeabilized and stained for TSLC1 with a anti-TSLC1 polyclonal antibody (CC2) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed with a filter set suitable for rhodamine detection (panels A1 and B1) and differential interference contrast (DIC) (panels A2 and B2). Bars represent 10 μm. Note: At low cell density (panels A1–A3), staining for TSLC1 showed either “zipper-like” structures or completely sealed stable lines at cell-cell boundaries (A1). When confluent, a honeycomb-like distribution of TSLC1 was seen (B1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The distribution of TSLC1 was further examined in polarized MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The cells were also stained for ZO-1, a protein restricted to tight junction (15Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), to compare its localization with that of TSLC1-GFP. In the X–Y confocal sections, TSLC1-GFP was distributed to honeycomb-like structures at cell-cell boundaries as well as ZO-1 (Fig.5A, upper panels). In the X–Z vertical cross-section, ZO-1 staining revealed intense dots along the apical cell surface, where the apical and lateral cell membranes meet (Fig. 5A, lower panel inred). In contrast, TSLC1-GFP was detected predominantly on the lateral surface of the cells (Fig. 5A, lower panel in green) showing distinctive localization from that of ZO-1. Distribution of endogenous TSLC1 was also examined in polarized Caco-2 cells found to express endogenous TSLC1 (data not shown). Immunostaining for endogenous TSLC1 and ZO-1 in the polarized Caco-2 cells (Fig. 5B) exhibited very similar patterns to those of TSLC1-GFP in MDCK cells showing the lateral-specific localization (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that TSLC1 molecules achieve lateral localization through its transinteraction across the membranes as often seen in other adhesion molecules. It is also noteworthy that the subcellular localization seen in TSLC1-GFP/MDCK cells was compatible with that of endogenous TSLC1. In the last set of experiments, we employed a well-established cell aggregation assay (14Miura M. Asou H. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10752-10758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to further assess trans interaction of TSLC1. MDCK/TSLC1-GFP or the parental MDCK cells were dissociated, resuspended in HBSS, and incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time. The requirement for divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ in TSLC1-mediated adhesion activity was also tested in Ca2+/Mg2+-free HBSS in the presence or absence of 10 mm EDTA. Although parental MDCK cells showed little aggregation in the time frame of these experiments, MDCK cells expressing TSLC1-GFP significantly aggregated in a time-dependent manner (Fig.6A). The degree of aggregation of MDCK/TSLC1-GFP was comparable in either the presence or absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 6A), indicating that TSLC1-mediated cell aggregation does not require either of the divalent cations. When incubated in HBSS with the divalent cations, the parental MDCK cells exhibited weak cell-aggregation activity (Fig.6A), presumably caused by Ca2+-dependent cadherin endogenously expressed in MDCK cells. Taken together, these results suggest that TSLC1 mediates intercellular adhesion through homophilic transinteraction in a Ca2+/Mg2+ -independent manner. TSLC1 is a unique tumor suppressor gene, because it was identified by its direct activity of tumor suppression in nude mice when introduced in cancer cells. When TSLC1 was introduced into A549 cells lacking endogenous TSLC1, cell growth in vivo was significantly suppressed, whereas the growth rate of the cells in vitro was not affected (1Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we have assumed that suppression of a malignant phenotype of cancers by TSLC1 is not due to direct arrest of the cell cycle but to some other mechanism, such as the regulation of cell growth through cell-to-cell or cell-to-substrate interaction. In support of this notion, the amino acid sequence analysis of TSLC1 revealed significant homology of the extracellular domain of TSLC1 with those of NCAM1 and NCAM2. We, therefore, have assessed our hypothesis by characterizing TSLC1 and demonstrated that TSLC1 is a member of IgCAMs. Biochemical analysis has shown that TSLC1 is an N-linked glycosylated protein. The use of a chemical cross-linker in a single cell suspension has demonstrated that TSLC1 molecules predominantly exist as cis-homodimers on the cell membranes of the dispersed single cells. It remains to be clarified if the homophiliccis interaction plays a role in the adhesive function. To facilitate further investigation, studies are in progress developing antibodies against the extracellular domain of TSLC1 as well as TSLC1 mutants able to impede the dimerization. It is also intriguing to see if removal of the N-linked glycosylation on TSLC1 affects the homophilic interaction, because the modification of NCAM with polysialic acid, another post-transcriptional modification, has been reported to modulate its function by inhibiting its homophilic interaction with the bulky sugar residues (10Benson D.L. Schnapp L.M. Shapiro L. Huntley G.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Analysis of the subcellular localization of TSLC1 with confocal microscopy revealed the characteristic pattern to adhesion molecules. In nonpolarized cells, TSLC1 molecules were accumulated at the cell-cell contact sites. Similar patterns of subcellular localization were reported in other adhesion molecules, including E-cadherin and nectins (5Satoh-Horikawa K. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishimura M.

Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In polarized cells, TSLC1 was recruited to the lateral membrane but not to the apical or basal membranes, suggesting thetrans interaction of TSLC1 between apposing cells. In favor of this idea, the aggregation assay has demonstrated that TSLC1 mediates cell aggregation through homophilic transinteraction. In addition, we have found that this adhesive activity is independent of divalent cations, confirming that TSLC1 retains one of the characteristics of IgCAMs. It should be noted that chemical cross-linking of TSLC1-GFP in a monolayer of nonpolarized MDCK/TSLC1-GFP cells showed several additional bands with higher molecular weight on the blot by longer exposure (data not shown), suggesting heterophilic trans/cisinteraction of TSLC1 with other proteins that are endogenously expressed in the cells. Alternatively, these may represent a small amount of higher order homo-oligomers of TSLC1-GFP. Growing evidence indicates that most adhesion molecules transduce signaling by associating with other adhesion molecules and/or receptors for a soluble ligand (4Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Aplin A.E. Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin.

Hence, identification of hetero-interacting partners for TSLC1 may lead to finding novel signaling pathways underlying its biological functions. Accumulating reports indicate that Ig superfamily proteins are multifunctional and participate in the regulation of various cellular activities. In some instances, they play a role in regulating cellular response in the immune system (18Crocker P.R. Varki A. Immunology. 2001; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M. Sivori S. Augugliaro R. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These examples include sialic acid binding Ig-like lectins (siglecs) expressed in hematopoietic cells, which are reported to down-regulate cellular activation of immune system to prevent inappropriate auto-reactivity (18Crocker P.R. Varki A. Immunology. 2001; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M. Sivori S. Augugliaro R. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many of the Ig superfamily proteins are associated with malignancy. Whereas TSLC1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor, glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored carcinoembryonic antigen, another homophilic Ca2+-independent adhesion IgCAM, promotes de-differentiation and is one of the widely used tumor markers in clinical medicine (20Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Obrink B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that TSLC1 is involved in cell-cell adhesion. Recent extensive studies on adhesion molecules have revealed that adhesion has profound effects on cells that go far beyond merely gluing them together (2Hynes R.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M33-M37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). They play important and diverse roles in many aspects of cell behavior during the normal development, growth, or maintenance of tissues (22Braga V. Harwood A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E168-E170Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Altered adhesion properties have been recognized as a feature of cancer cells, and this is true for E-cadherin, another tumor suppressor (23Christofori G. Semb H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Notably, its alterations are often observed in the advanced stages of epithelial cancers (24Guilford P. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 172-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Loss of E-cadherin function, besides disrupting cell-cell adhesion, was suggested to convey signals that actively induce tumor invasion and/or metastasis (2Hynes R.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M33-M37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Christofori G. Semb H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). It therefore is probable that aberrant TSLC1 contributes to invasion or metastasis to surrounding or distal tissues in a similar manner. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which TSLC1 regulates cell-cell interactions may provide appropriate molecular targets for future cancer therapy. We are grateful to Drs. T. Yamada and Y. Ino for their generous help with the Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal scanning system."

Cells Tissues Organs. 2001; 168: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The biological function of the highly conserved SRCR domains has not yet been established, but their presence in proteins with broad spectrum binding properties suggests a role in ligand binding or adhesion. We recently noted genetic polymorphism within DMBT1. These polymorphisms lead to DMBT1 alleles, giving rise to polypeptides with interindividually different numbers of SRCR domains and SIDs. Based on analogies to mucins, we have proposed that these polymorphisms may lead to a differential efficacy in mucosal protection (10Mollenhauer J. Herbertz S. Holmskov U. Tolnay M. Krebs I. Merlo A.

Holmskov U. Sorger K. Schmitt L. Wiemann S. Otto H.F. Grone H.J. Poustka A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8880-8886PubMed Google Scholar). However, the major drawback of this hypothesis is that it remains to be shown that the SRCR domains and/or SIDs are involved in ligand binding. The search for the peptide domains on salivary agglutinin/DMBT1 involved in bacteria binding was therefore initially directed to this part of the molecule. On basis of the deduced amino acid sequence of agglutinin, we designed a digestion strategy to obtain a fragment consisting exclusively of SRCR and SID domains. This fragment preserved the S. mutans binding properties. To characterize the binding domain in greater detail, peptides were synthesized covering the complete SRCR and SID consensus sequence, and their binding toS. mutans was analyzed. Only one 16-mer peptide (QGRVEVLYRGSWGTVC) of the SRCR domain was found to bind toS. mutans and to mediate agglutination. Human parotid saliva was collected with a Lashley cup. Twenty-five ml of parotid saliva was kept on ice water for 30 min to promote the formation of a precipitate. This precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 2.5 ml of PBS. The pellet was ∼10-fold enriched in agglutinin. This crude agglutinin fraction was used as starting material for digestion studies and in the various binding studies. For further purification, the pellet was dissolved in buffer A (10 mmTris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 6.9, 0.05% CHAPS) and applied on an UNO Q-6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer A and linked to fast protein liquid chromatography equipment (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 mNaCl in buffer A. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The isolated agglutinin preparation contained no detectable protein impurities (less than 5%). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE, conducted on an Amersham Biosciences Phast System (Amersham Biosciences) using 4–15% polyacrylamide gels, and Western blotting were performed as described (28Bolscher J.G.

Lactobacillus casei (clinical isolate) was cultured on blood agar plates under microaerophilic conditions for 48 h at 37 °C.Helicobacter pylori (ATCC 43504) was cultured on selective Dent plates (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) for 72 h at 37 °C. Other bacteria strains were cultured in brain heart infusion (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) or Todd Hewitt medium (Oxoid) overnight in air/CO2 (19:1) at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and washed twice in PBS or Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm sodium chloride). Bacteria were diluted in buffer to a final OD700 of 0.5 or 1.0 corresponding with ∼5 × 108 and 109cells/ml, respectively. 0.5 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C, sequencing grade from Lysobacter enzymogenes (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), was added to 50 μl of crude agglutinin (50 μg/ml), dissolved in 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.5). After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, digestion was stopped by adding a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini tablets, Roche Diagnostics). For reduction, agglutinin was incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 4 h at 4 °C, and subsequently carboxymethylated with 20 mm 2-iodoacetamide for 4 h at 4 °C. The triplet coding for Lys-1812 is located at the splice fusion site of exons 45 and 46. To exclude that partial digestion at residue Lys-1812 originates from genetic polymorphism, the respective exons and their immediately flanking intronic sequences were amplified by PCR using the primers dmbt1ex45dsf2 (5′-GTGCAGAAGATGAAACTGGATG-3′) and dmbt1ex45dsr2 (5′-GCCCAGGACACAGTCTAAAC-3′) (exon 45) and dmbt1ex46dsf2 (5′-ACCTGTATTCAATGGCATCCC-3′) and dmbt1ex46dsr2 (5′-TGCCCCCAAAGAGGCAGC-3′) (exon 46) under the conditions described elsewhere (30Mollenhauer J.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer,. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Forward and reverse strands were sequenced with the primers as depicted herein. Two hundred μl of an S. mutans suspension (109 bacteria/ml in PBS) was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was mixed with 100 μl of digested agglutinin (50 μg/ml) supplemented with 5 mm calcium chloride and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 2 min, washed twice in PBS, and transferred to a new vial. Bacteria-bound components were extracted by incubation with 10 mm EDTA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The extracts were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Control extracts were obtained from bacteria that had not been incubated with (digested) agglutinin. Adhesion of S. mutans to the Lys-C proteinase-digested crude agglutinin immobilized on nitrocellulose was studied using an overlay adhesion assay. Briefly, 40-μl samples of digested agglutinin (50 μg/ml) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% bovine serum albumin (PBS-T-BSA) and incubated with S. mutans (109 bacteria in PBS-T-BSA) for 16 h at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose membranes were washed twice with PBS-T-BSA. Bound bacteria were visualized with monoclonal antibody OMVU37, directed against S. mutans (31de Soet J.J. van Dalen P.J. Pavicic M.J. de Graaff J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) as the chromogenic substrate. Based on the published amino acid sequence of gp-340 (7Holmskov U. Mollenhauer J. Madsen J. Vitved L. Gronlund J. Tornoe I. Kliem A. Reid K.B. Poustka A. Skjodt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10794-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), consensus sequences of the 13 SRCR domains and 11 SIDs were determined using alignment software (Vector NTI, InforMax Inc., Oxford, UK). Nine peptides, together spanning the complete sequence, were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the T-bag method adapted for Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (32van't Hof W. Driedijk P.C. van den Berg M. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Jung G. Aalberse R.C. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a JASCO HPLC System (Tokyo, Japan). Peptides were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied on a VYDAC C18-column (218TP, 1.0 × 25 cm, 10-μm particles, Vydac, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed with a linear gradient from 30 to 45% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 20 min at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The absorbance of the column effluent was monitored at 214 nm, and peak fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and reanalyzed by reversed-phase-HPLC and by capillary electrophoresis on a Biofocus 2000 apparatus (Bio-Rad). The authenticity of the (monomeric) peptides was confirmed by quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS) on a tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass Inc., Manchester, UK) as described previously (33Nagle G.T. Jong-Brink M. Painter S.D. Li K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of cysteine residues, exclusively monomeric peptides were detected, indicating that peptide multimerization by disulfide bond formation had not occurred. The purity of the peptides was at least 90%. Bacterial adhesion was examined using a microtiter plate method based on labeling of microorganisms with cell-permeable DNA binding probes. 2J. A. Bosch, E. C. I. Veerman, M. Turkenburg, K. Hartog, J. G. M. Bolscher, and A. V. Nieuw Amerongen, manuscript in preparation. Microtiterplates Fluotrac 600 (Greiner, Recklinghausen, Germany) were coated with various amounts of synthetic peptides, crude agglutinin, or purified agglutinin. For reduction, the peptides and agglutinin were incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 4 h at 4 °C and subsequently carboxymethylated with 20 mm 2-iodoacetamide for 4 h at 4 °C. The peptides were dissolved in coating buffer (100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6) to a starting concentration of 40 μg/ml and diluted serially. After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, plates were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1 mm Ca2+(TTC). Subsequently, 100 μl of an S. mutans suspension (5 × 108 bacteria/ml TTC) were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 using a plate washer (Mikrotek EL 403, Winooski, VT). Bound bacteria were detected using 100 μl/well of 1 mmSYTO-9 solution (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), a cell-permeable fluorescent DNA binding probe. Plates were incubated in the dark for 15 min at ambient temperature and washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20. Fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence microtiter plate reader (Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Laboratories, Offenburg, Germany) at 488-nm excitation and 509-nm emission wavelength. 150 μl of an S. mutanssuspension (5 × 108 bacteria/ml TTC) were mixed with 150 μl of peptide solution at final peptide concentrations of 0–200 μg/ml in a 96-well microtiter plate (low affinity, PS Microlon-F, Greiner) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After agglutination and subsequent sedimentation of the bacteria, 10 μl of the sediment was transferred on a microscopic slide. After heat fixation, bacteria were stained with a 20% crystal violet solution (Merck) and examined by light microscopy. Turbidometric analysis of the agglutination process was carried out using a spectrophotometer (UVICON 930, Kontron Instruments, Watford, UK). Bacterial suspensions (5 × 108 bacteria/ml TTC) supplemented with either calcium chloride or EDTA were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C before peptides were added. The optical density of the bacterial suspensions was monitored at 700 nm for 100 min at 37 °C. These experiments were repeated at least three times. To investigate the role of the repeating SRCR and SID domains of agglutinin/DMBT1 with respect toS. mutans binding, a selective proteolytic cleavage procedure was conducted using endoproteinase Lys-C (34Bank R.A.

Agglutinin/DMBT1 contains 10 lysine residues, which are all located in the C-terminal region (Fig.1A). One lysine residue is located in the 13th SRCR domain, 3 are located in the first CUB domain, 1 is located in the second CUB domain, 4 are located in the ZP domain, and 1 is located in the unique sequence, located C-terminally of the ZP domain. Hydrolysis after the 1st and 2nd lysine residues (Lys-1722, Lys-1791) will not yield distinct cleavage products because the resulting fragments are held together by disulfide linkages between Cys-1665 and Cys-1729 and between Cys-1766 and Cys-1792, respectively (23Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37McAlister M.S. Brown M.H. Willis A.C. Rudd P.M. Harvey D.J. Aplin R. Shotton D.M. Dwek R.A. Barclay A.N. Driscoll P.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis at Lys-1812 will generate a fragment that contains 13 of the 14 SRCR domains as well as the interspersing SID domains (Fig. 1A). The remaining C-proximal ZP and CUB domains contain additional Lys-C cleavage sites. Thus, Lys-C digestion would liberate a large SRCR/SID stretch in addition to a number of smaller fragments. SDS-PAGE analysis of the Lys-C-treated agglutinin revealed a new protein band with slightly lower molecular mass than the native agglutinin/DMBT1 (Fig. 2A). This band, the putative SRCR/SID stretch of agglutinin/DMBT1, was recognized by monoclonal antibody 213-6 directed against a peptide epitope of salivary agglutinin/DMBT1 (29Bikker F.J. Ligtenberg A.J. van der Wal J.E. van den Keijbus P.A. Holmskov U. Veerman E.C. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 134-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Immunoreactive protein bands of lower molecular mass were not detected. Reduction and subsequent carboxymethylation virtually did not show different protein patterns on Western blot (not shown). Next to the putative SRCR/SID stretch, the native agglutinin/DMBT1 was still present, even after prolonged incubation with excess Lys-C or addition of 0.01% SDS. The triplet encoding for Lys-1812 spans the fusion site of exons 45 and 46 after splicing. Sequencing did not reveal heterozygosity of the saliva donor in the exon or intron sequences. Thus, partial digestion of salivary agglutinin/DMBT1 is not based on genetic polymorphism. Sequencing of 25 cDNA clones further ruled out that alternative splicing leads to omission of Lys-1812 (not shown). Whether binding sites for S. mutans were still present after digestion was examined using an overlay adherence assay and a soluble-phase binding assay (Fig. 2). Nitrocellulose membranes containing native agglutinin and Lys-C-digested agglutinin overlaid with bacteria showed that S. mutans adhered to both agglutinin bands (Fig. 2B). This demonstrates that Lys-C digestion had not destroyed the binding domains for this bacterium. Controls, in which either bacteria incubation or antibody incubation was omitted, were negative. This was confirmed by the results of liquid-phase binding assays in which bacteria were incubated with a solution containing the digested agglutinin (Fig. 2C). Western analysis of the bacterial extracts and the corresponding supernatants demonstrated that both native agglutinin and the digested fragment were found in the bacterial pellets (Fig. 2C, lane 2). In contrast, the supernatants were completely devoid of agglutinin (Fig. 2C, lane 3). In control experiments in which the bacteria were omitted, agglutinin and the digested fragment were only present in the supernatants. To more specifically characterize the bacteria-binding region, we synthesized a series of peptides spanning the SIDs and SRCR domains of agglutinin. Using alignment software, the consensus sequences of the SIDs and SRCR domains were determined. This resulted in two consensus sequences for the SIDs, one 20-residue long sequence and one 22-residue long sequence (Fig. 1, B and C). Peptides representing these sequences were synthesized (designated SID20 and SID22, Table I). The consensus sequence of the SRCR domain had a length of 109 amino acids (Fig. 1D). To cover this sequence, seven synthetic peptides were synthesized, representing loops in the native protein that run in between disulfide bridges (23Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Nat. Struct.

We showed that At-PTOX is functional in tobacco chloroplasts and strongly accelerates the non-photochemical reoxidation of plastoquinols; this effect was inhibited by propyl gallate, a known inhibitor of PTOX. During the dark to light induction phase of photosynthesis at low irradiances, At-PTOX drives significant electron flow to O2, thus avoiding over-reduction of plastoquinones, when photo- synthetic CO2 assimilation was not fully induced.

In chloroplasts, the existence of a respiratory electron transport chain (chlororespiration) in interaction with photosynthesis has been suggested (2Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chlororespiration would involve non-photochemical reduction of the PQ pool and subsequent oxidation by a plastoquinol terminal oxidase. Non-photochemical reduction of PQs is a well established phenomenon that likely occurs during cyclic electron transfer reactions around photosystem I (PS I).

Nevertheless, the involvement of a plastid terminal oxidase in chlororespiration has been the subject of controversy during the last decade (2Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, such effects can be alternatively explained by an inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and the existence of redox interactions between chloroplasts and mitochondria (16Peltier G. Cournac L. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 523-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 17Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys.

Plant Physiol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Recently, the study of an Arabidopsis mutant (immutans) showing a variegated phenotype led to the identification of a protein involved in carotenoid biosynthesis (21Wu D.Y. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22Carol P. Stevenson D. Bisanz C. Breitenbach J. Sandmann G. Mache R. Coupland G. Kuntz M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology with mitochondrial alternative oxidases, this protein was suggested to act as a plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) (21Wu D.Y. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 23Carol P. Kuntz M. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 31-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Expression ofArabidopsis PTOX (At-PTOX) in Escherichia coliconferred a cyanide-resistant O2 uptake sensitive to propyl gallate, a known inhibitor of alternative oxidases (24Cournac L. Redding K.

Laboure A.M. Kuntz M. Carol P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In PS I-less mutants of the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a limited but significant electron flow from photosystem II (PS II) to molecular O2 was measured. Based on the effects of inhibitors (insensitivity to KCN and CO and sensitivity to propyl gallate) on this process and on the detection of a thylakoid protein that cross-reacted with an antibody raised against PTOX, it was proposed that the chlororespiratory O2 uptake is because of a Chlamydomonas homologue of PTOX (24Cournac L.

In higher plants, an involvement of PTOX in PQ oxidation has not been experimentally evidenced. Based on the study of a reconstituted system, Casanoet al. (6Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martin M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) proposed that a peroxidase using hydrogen peroxide as an electron acceptor may be involved in chlororespiration. To get further insight into the function of PTOX and in particular to determine whether this protein can achieve quinol oxidation in chloroplasts, tobacco plants constitutively expressing At-PTOX have been generated. We show that At-PTOX facilitates the oxidation of reduced PQs using O2 as a terminal acceptor. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacumvar. petit havana) were grown on compost in a phytotron (25 °C day/20 °C night; 12-h photoperiod) under an irradiance of 300 μmol photons·m−2·s−1 supplied by quartz halogen lamps (HQI-T 400W/DV, Osram, Germany). Plants were watered with a half-diluted Hoagland's nutritive solution. The Arabidopsis thaliana PTOX cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AJ004881) was used as a template for PCR amplification using the primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCTGACGGAGATGGCGGCGATTTCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCCGAGCTCTTATTAACTTGTAATGGATTTCTTGAGGC-3′, respectively, containing an XhoI and an SacI restriction site at the 5′ and 3′ end. The amplified fragment started 9 bp upstream to the coding sequence of the At-PTOX cDNA and contained two stop codons (the start codon and two stop codons are underlined). After digestion, the amplified fragment was introduced in a sense orientation into a plant binary vector (pKYLX71). Expression of At-PTOX was driven by a double sequence of the cauliflower mosaic virus35S-labeled constitutive promoter (26Odell J.T. Nagy F. Chua N.H. Nature. 1985; 313: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was introduced by electroporation into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58), which was used for tobacco transformation employing the standard leaf disc transformation method (27Horsch R.B. Fry J.E. Hoffmann N.L. Eichholtz D. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T. Science. 1985; 227: 1229-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3810) Google Scholar). Two independent transformation experiments were carried out, and six transformants were recovered on a kanamycin-selective medium (100 mg·liter−1). Two independent transgenic lines (PTOX1+ and PTOX2+), overexpressing high amounts of PTOX, were selected and were self-pollinated. The T1 generation was used for further experiments. Leaves were harvested at the end of the night period, and intact chloroplasts were isolated at 4 °C on a Percoll gradient according to a modification of the method described by Mills and Joy (51Mills W.R. Joy K.W. Planta. 1980; 148: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Approximately 30 g of leaves were ground in a blender for 2 s in 100 ml of medium A containing 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ascorbic acid, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. After filtration through 250- and 60-μm nylon net, followed by centrifugation (2000 × g, 3 min), the crude extract was resuspended in medium A (dithiothreitol-free) and layered onto a Percoll step gradient formed with two layers of medium A containing 90 and 40% (v/v) Percoll, respectively. After centrifugation in a swing out rotor at 3,500 × g for 15 min, intact chloroplasts were recovered from the 40:90% Percoll interphase, washed with 60 ml of medium A, pelleted at 2,000 ×g for 3 min, and osmotically lysed by resuspension in 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min. Lysed chloroplasts were diluted at a final concentration of 200 μg of chlorophyll·ml−1 in 30 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmNaHPO4, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of the chloroplast preparation were stored at −20 °C. For O2 exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, aliquots were resuspended in 30 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 msorbitol, 5 mm NaCl, and 10 mmMgCl2. (Fm −F0)/Fm measured on chloroplasts samples was 0.7 (±0.02, 6 experiments). Anaerobiosis was achieved by addition of glucose (20 mm) and glucose oxidase (2 mg·ml−1) to the chloroplast suspension. Reactive oxygen species generated by the glucose oxidase activity were scavenged by adding superoxide dismutase (500 units·ml−1) and catalase (1,000 units·ml−1). For mass spectrometric measurements of O2 exchange, osmotically lysed chloroplasts (20 μg of chlorophyll·ml−1) were placed in the measuring chamber (1.5-ml reaction volume). The sample was sparged with N2 to remove 16O2, and 18O2 (95% 18O isotope content, Euriso-Top, Les Ulys, France) was then introduced to reach an O2 concentration close to the equilibrium with air. Dissolved gases were introduced into the ion source of the mass spectrometer (model MM 14–80, VG Instruments, Cheshire, UK) through a Teflon membrane. Light was supplied by a fiber optic illuminator (Schott, Main, Germany) supplying a light intensity of 150 μmol photons·m−2·s−1. All gas exchange measurements were performed at 25 °C. The use of18O2 allowed the in vivodetermination of O2 evolution by PS II (originating from the photolysis of water which is not enriched) in the presence of O2 consuming processes. Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured at 25 °C using pulse-modulated fluorimeters (PAM 101–103 and PAM 2000, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany for chloroplasts and leaves, respectively). The maximal chlorophyll fluorescence level (Fm) was measured under a 0.8–1-s saturating pulse (about 8,000–10,000 μmol photons·m−2·s−1) in dark-adapted leaves, on which the basal fluorescence (F0) was recorded before the pulse. The maximal photochemical yield of PS II was determined as (Fm −F0)/Fm. Fluorescence levelsFm, Fs (fluorescence in the light), Fm′ (maximal fluorescence in the light, using a saturating pulse), and F0′ (basal fluorescence of light-adapted leaves, recorded after rapid reoxidation of the PQ pool using far-red light) were used to calculate PS II photochemical yield (Fm′ −Fs/Fm′), non-photochemical quenching (qN = 1 −Fm′/Fm), and photochemical quenching (qP = Fm′− Fs/Fm′ −F0′) under different irradiances (28Genty B. Briantais J.-M. Baker N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 87-92Crossref Scopus (7061) Google Scholar). Apparent photosynthetic electron transport rates (μmol electrons·m−2.s−1) were estimated as (Fm′ −Fs)/Fm′ × PFFDi × LA × 0.5, where PFFDi is the incident photosynthetic photon flux density; LA is the leaf absorbance (0.84), and 0.5 the factor accounting for the light partition between the two photosystems. For chlorophyll fluorescence measurements in stripped leaf discs, leaf samples were placed on a wet paper filter at 25 °C in ambient air. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements on attached leaves were performed using the gas exchange cuvette of a Licor gas exchange system (LI-6400, Li-Cor Inc, Lincoln, NE) to control leaf temperature (25 °C) and gas atmosphere. Illumination was provided by a homemade red (663 nm) LEDs source. Leaf discs were sampled from 5- to 8 week-old plants. After stripping the lower epidermis, leaf discs were soaked in water for 60 min. 2,5-Dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB, 50 μm final concentration) or propyl gallate (1 mm final concentration) was added diluted in methanol (maximal final methanol concentration was 0.5%). Control leaf discs were soaked in water containing methanol. It should be noted that the DBMIB concentration (50 μm) used for leaf discs was much higher than the concentration generally used to obtain specific inhibition of the cytochrome b6/fcomplex on isolated thylakoids (1 μm). Despite this relatively high concentration necessary to obtain an effect in leaf discs, we checked that DBMIB did not act as an electron acceptor. Net CO2 exchange measurements were performed on attached leaves using a portable gas exchange system (LI-6400, Li-Cor Inc, Lincoln, NE) and a homemade red (663 nm) LEDs source. Leaf temperature was maintained at 25 °C, and leaf vapor pressure deficit was maintained around 0.8 kPa. Various O2 and N2 concentrations were provided by mixing pure gases. O2 concentration was measured using a paramagnetic O2 analyzer (MAIHAK, Hamburg, Germany). This mixing system was also used for fluorescence measurements in attached leaves. Quantum yield of CO2 fixation in air and under non-photorespiratory conditions (O2 1.5% (v/v); CO2 750 μl·liter−1) were calculated from the slope of the linear portion of the light response curve (5 measurements at irradiances between 40 and 80 μmol photons·m−2·s−1 and 10 measurements at irradiances between 10 and 100 μmol photons·m−2·s−1 for air and non-photorespiratory conditions, respectively). Intact chloroplasts were isolated and purified from leaves using discontinuous Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradients as described previously (29Rumeau D. Cuiné S. Fina L. Gault N. Nicole M. Peltier G. Planta. 1996; 199: 79-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were osmotically lysed in a solution containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 15 mmNaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged for 20 min at 35,000 × g. Stroma lamellae and grana membranes were separated following a stacking step carried out as described previously (4Sazanov L.A. Burrows P.A. Nixon P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To prepare total insoluble proteins, tobacco leaves (1 g fresh weight) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder with a chilled pestle and mortar. The powder was resuspended in a 5-ml extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 30 min of stirring (4 °C) and centrifugation (40,000 × g for 20 min), the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer containing 1% SDS. After 30 min of stirring (4 °C) and centrifugation (40,000 × g for 20 min), proteins contained in the supernatant were precipitated with acetone (80% final concentration). Denaturing SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using 13% acrylamide (w/v) gels. Proteins were transferred onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and were probed with the purified anti-At-PTOX serum (24Cournac L. Redding K. Ravenel J. Rumeau D. Josse E.M. Kuntz M. Peltier G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17256-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were detected using the chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (AmershamBiosciences). RT-PCR analysis ofAt-PTOX transcripts was carried out as described previously (25Josse E.M. Simkin A.J. Gaffe J. Laboure A.M. Kuntz M. Carol P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) by amplifying 363 nucleotides of theAt-PTOX RNAs using the following primers: 5′-GTG CAY TTT GCI GAR AGC TGG AAT G-3′ and 5′-TCA TYG TIT TIC AAT GIT CTG CIT CRT CAT CTC-3′, where Y = C + T, R = A + G, and I = deoxyinosine. The amplification consisted of 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 45 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. The control was the rabbit globin mRNA (supplied by Invitrogen). Protein content was determined using a modified Lowry method (Sigma). Chlorophyll content was measured according to the method of Lichtenthaler and Wellburn (31Lichtenthaler H.K. Wellburn A.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 591-592Crossref Google Scholar). Transgenic tobacco plants expressing the At-PTOX cDNA sequence under the control of the doubled constitutive 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus were generated byAgrobacterium-mediated transformation. Two lines, PTOX1+ and PTOX2+, showing a particularly strong expression of the transgene were selected among six transformant lines and were further studied (Fig.1A). Note that although no signal was observed in WT tobacco (Fig. 1A, upper panel), a faint band was detected after re-amplification (Fig.1A, lower panel). We checked that amplified RT-PCR fragments, including the faint band amplified in WT tobacco (Fig. 1A), cross-hybridized with the At-PTOX probe by Southern analysis (data not shown). Antibodies raised against At-PTOX were used to characterize At-PTOX expression in tobacco transgenic lines using Western analysis. Both transformant lines showed large amounts of a 41-kDa band corresponding to At-PTOX in total insoluble leaf proteins (25Josse E.M. Simkin A.J. Gaffe J. Laboure A.M. Kuntz M. Carol P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas no signal was observed in wild type (Fig.1B). In both lines, At-PTOX was targeted to the chloroplasts, thanks to the presence of an N-terminal transit peptide (22Carol P. Stevenson D. Bisanz C. Breitenbach J. Sandmann G. Mache R. Coupland G. Kuntz M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and was found to be associated with thylakoid membranes, essentially stroma lamellae, with only small amounts being found in grana (Fig. 2). Subsequent experiments were performed on both PTOX1+ and PTOX2+ lines and yielded similar results.FIG. 2Membrane localization of At-PTOX in PTOX+ tobacco chloroplasts.A, Western analysis using an anti-At-PTOX antibody, performed on different membrane fractions prepared from tobacco chloroplasts (5 μg of proteins).

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) to be involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, the pigment content of transgenic plants was analyzed. High pressure liquid chromatography measurements did not reveal any significant difference in chlorophyll or carotenoid content in WT and PTOX+ extracts (data not shown). In addition, after transfer to high light conditions, similar amounts of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and antheraxanthin) were found in both plants. PTOX1+ and PTOX2+ plants did not show any particular phenotype, and growth was comparable with WT plants when cultivated under normal conditions (not shown). When intact WT leaves were illuminated for a few minutes and then placed in the dark, a transient increase in the F0 chlorophyll fluorescence level occurred (Fig. 3A) (see Refs. 32Groom Q.J. Kramer D.M. Crofts A.R. Ort D.R. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 36: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 33Harris G.C. Heber U. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The post-illumination fluorescence transient was absent in PTOX+ leaves, and the F0fluorescence level rapidly decreased after switching off the light (Fig. 3B). As reported previously, the fluorescence increase was absent in Ndh-less mutants (Fig. 3C), but interestingly the fluorescence signal decreased more slowly that in PTOX+. The absence of a post-illumination chlorophyll fluorescence increase in Ndh-less mutants was interpreted as the involvement of the Ndh complex in the re-reduction of the PQ pool occurring in the dark after a period of illumination (8Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 9Shikanai T. Endo T. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Asada K. Yokota A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Photosynthesis: Mechanism and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1877-1882Google Scholar). This experiment suggests that like the Ndh complex At-PTOX was able to modulate the redox state of PQ in the dark, most likely by oxidizing reduced plastoquinones. In agreement with this interpretation, when leaf discs were treated with propyl gallate, a potent inhibitor of PTOX (24Cournac L. Redding K. Ravenel J. Rumeau D. Josse E.M. Kuntz M. Peltier G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17256-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), a reversal of the loss of the F0fluorescence rise was observed (data not shown). Subsequent experiments were designed to characterize the role of At-PTOX in PQ oxidation. In the experiment described in Fig.4, chlorophyll fluorescence changes were measured in dark-adapted leaves in response to a saturating light pulse. During a pulse, PS II primary electron acceptors were fully reduced, and chlorophyll fluorescence rapidly reached a maximum level (Fm). After the light pulse, the chlorophyll fluorescence level decreased in the dark, and this decay was related to the reoxidation of PS II primary acceptors (QA) in redox equilibrium with the PQ pool. The fluorescence decay was clearly biphasic. The fast phase was similar in WT and PTOX+. On the other hand, the slowly decreasing phase was much faster in PTOX+ than in WT, indicating that PQs were more efficiently reoxidized in transgenic plants. Addition of propyl gallate severely slowed down the fluorescence decay, which came close to that observed in WT leaves (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, cyanide (KCN 1 mm) had no significant effect on the fluorescence decay measured in PTOX+ (data not shown). In order to check that PS II acceptors were more reduced in WT than in PTOX+during the fluorescence decay shown on Fig. 4A, a control experiment was performed by flashing a second light pulse 4 s after the first pulse (Fig. 5). Under such conditions, because no non-photochemical quenching ofFm occurred, the upper area delimited by the fluorescence induction curve reflected the relative pool size of electron acceptors of PS II, mainly the PQ pool (2Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Delosme R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 143: 108-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig.5A shows that in WT leaves, 4 s after the first pulse, PS II acceptors are more reduced than in dark-adapted leaves. In contrast, the redox state of PS II acceptors measured in PTOX+ leaves 4 s after a pulse illumination was close to that measured in dark-adapted leaves (Fig. 5B). We concluded from these experiments that At-PTOX was functional in transgenic tobacco leaves and was able to oxidize efficiently reduced PQs following their reduction by a saturating light pulse. We found that propyl gallate slightly (but in a reproducible manner) affected the slow phase of the fluorescence decay measured in WT leaves (Fig.4A), possibly indicating the contribution of a putative tobacco PTOX in PQ oxidation.FIG. 5Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements in response to a high light intensity (350 μmol photons·m−2·s−1) in"

This enlargement of myocardial mass can involve not only an increase in cardiomyocyte size, but increased proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. A potential key player in the cardiac hypertrophic response is the ERK family of MAPKs. To gain mechanistic insight into adrenergic regulation of myocardial mitogenic signaling, we examined β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation of ERK activation and DNA synthesis in cultured adult rat cardiac fibroblasts, including the involvement of tyrosine kinases in this signaling pathway. Addition of the β-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) to serum-starved cells induced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, and this was inhibited by selective inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Importantly and in agreement with the involvement of MAPKs and the EGFR in this response in cardiac fibroblasts, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 attenuated ISO-induced ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, pretreatment with PP2, a selective inhibitor of the Src tyrosine kinase, attenuated both ISO-mediated EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activation. Furthermore, studies in these cardiac fibroblasts showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase contributed to β-AR-mediated ERK activation, but not to EGFR activation. Finally, studies using selective inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases indicated that they and heparin-bound EGF shedding were involved in β-AR-induced ERK activation and subsequent DNA synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts. Because these cells primarily express the β2-AR subtype, our findings indicate that β2-AR-mediated EGFR transactivation of intracellular tyrosine kinase signaling pathways is the major signaling pathway responsible for the adrenergic stimulation of mitogenesis of cardiac fibroblasts.

Accordingly, there has been considerable interest in the possibility that modulation of GPCR signaling pathways may have the potential to treat pathophysiological mechanisms that are fundamental to the progression of hypertrophy and heart failure (5Esposito G.

Eguchi S. Ueno H. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4657-4668Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Gotch N. Shibuya M. Masaki H. Maruyama K. Tsutsumi Y.

This can involve the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as the EGFR-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 or expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the EGFR blocks GPCR-mediated EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activation (14Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that GPCR-mediated “transactivation” of the receptor tyrosine kinase cascade is an obligatory step in the MAPK activation pathway (14Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 15Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7035-7044Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In VSMCs and neonatal cardiac fibroblasts, stimulation of angiotensin II rapidly phosphorylates the EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor and causes an increase in Shc-Grb2 complex formation (7Eguchi S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been demonstrated that GPCR-mediated transactivation of the EGFR involves release of a soluble EGFR ligand, heparin-bound EGF (HB-EGF), from the cell surface, which can bind to and stimulate the phosphorylation of EGFRs (17Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 18Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fuhisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). HB-EGF is known to be a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for VSMCs in in vitro studies (19Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the pharmacological drug KB-R7785 inhibits the shedding of HB-EGF and attenuates hypertrophic changes in cardiac cells (20Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). HB-EGF shedding is also sensitive to the nonselective matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitor batimastat, indicating that, in some cell types, MMPs are involved in the GPCR-mediated EGFR transactivation pathway and subsequent ERK activation (17Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 21Gearing A.J. Beckett P. Christodoulou M. Churchill M.

Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Although cardiac fibroblasts represent one of the major cardiac cell types and contribute to cardiac cell proliferation and hypertrophy in an autocrine/paracrine manner (23Booz G.W. Baker K.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), few attempts have been made to characterize the GPCR-mediated growth of these cells. Of particular interest in cardiac fibroblasts is the β2-AR system, which is the major adrenergic receptor subtype in these cells (24Leicht M. Greipel N. Zimmer H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Gustafsson A.G. Brunton L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Meszaros J.G. Gonzalez A.M. Endo-Mochizuki Y. Villegas S. Villarreal F. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C154-C162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms of β2-AR-mediated cell proliferation of primary cultured adult rat cardiac fibroblasts, in this study, we examined the effects of selective receptor tyrosine kinase and other pharmacological inhibitors on ISO-induced DNA synthesis and ERK activation as an indicator of cell proliferation. Importantly, we demonstrate that activation of β2-ARs induces DNA synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts via ERK activation that is dependent on the EGFR. Moreover, other kinases appear to play a role in the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts, including Src tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Finally, we have elucidated that the activation of MMP and HB-EGF shedding in cardiac fibroblasts are obligatory mechanisms in β2-AR-induced ERK activation and cell proliferation.DISCUSSIONCardiac fibroblasts are an important component of the heart, as they compose as much as two-thirds of cell population in cardiac tissue (26Meszaros J.G. Gonzalez A.M. Endo-Mochizuki Y. Villegas S. Villarreal F. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C154-C162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Eghbali M. Czaja M.J. Zeydel M. Weiner F.R.

Biochem. 1996; 157: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Unlike cardiac myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts can proliferate even in the adult heart as well as produce extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and collagen (33Dostal D.E. Booz G.W. Baker K.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts also produce other putative growth factors that may act as autocrine and/or paracrine modulators of cell function and growth within the heart (23Booz G.W. Baker K.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding which hormones and signaling pathways control proliferation and synthetic capacities of cardiac fibroblasts is necessary to assess their contribution to cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. Importantly, the β-AR signaling system remains the most powerful means by which heart rate and contractility are physiologically regulated and maintained and, as our current data point out, may also be important for cardiac fibroblast signaling and activation. The β-AR system in cardiac fibroblasts consists almost exclusively of the β2-AR subtype; and thus, catecholamine stimulation of the heart proceeds via β1- and β2-ARs in cardiomyocytes, but primarily via β2-ARs in cardiac fibroblasts (24Leicht M. Greipel N. Zimmer H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Gustafsson A.G. Brunton L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Meszaros J.G. Gonzalez A.M. Endo-Mochizuki Y. Villegas S. Villarreal F. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C154-C162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, other GPCRs such as those for angiotensin II and endothelin that can alter proliferation and collagen deposition in cardiac fibroblasts have been studied, but mitogenic signaling induced by catecholamines through the β2-AR system has not been extensively studied in adult cardiac fibroblasts, which was the target of this study.In this study, we have demonstrated that the β-AR agonist ISO stimulates DNA synthesis via ERK in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. An additional major finding of this study is that ISO-stimulated ERK activation and subsequent DNA synthesis in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts require three different kinase activities, EGFR, Src, and PI3K. Src is involved in both EGFR transactivation and direct ERK activation; however, β-AR-dependent PI3K activation is not involved in EGFR transactivation. Moreover, studies using a neutralizing antibody for HB-EGF and a MMP-specific inhibitor suggest that processing of HB-EGF via MMP activity is required for the β-AR-mediated EGFR transactivation in cardiac fibroblasts. As depicted in Fig. 7, these current data provide novel insight into the major players involved in the proliferative signaling that takes place in response to catecholamine activation of the β2-AR system in adult cardiac fibroblasts.An increase in DNA synthesis is common in cardiac hypertrophy; and although the terminally differentiated cardiac myocyte does not proliferate, mitogenic signaling may contribute to cell proliferation of non-myocytes (i.e. fibroblasts) in the heart. GPCR-mediated ERK activation has been demonstrated to play an important role in cell hypertrophy and proliferation in various cardiac cells, including neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes (10Yamazaki T.

Res. 2000; 48: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a previous study in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts demonstrated that β-AR-mediated stimulation of protein synthesis does not require ERK activity (9Colombo F. Noel J. Mayers P. Mercier I. Calderone A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1091-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); however, for DNA synthesis in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts, we have found that ERK inhibition by PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, significantly attenuates ISO-induced mitogenic signaling. This is an example of discrepancies commonly found for GPCR signaling in the neonatal versus adult cardiac system, indicating that hormonal responsiveness and downstream effectors are disparate at different stages of development. Thus, identifying signaling components and proliferative mechanisms in each cardiac cell type and developmental stage is essential for a more complete understanding of the effects of hormones on cardiac function.An area of recent interest in β2-AR and GPCR mitogenic signaling is transactivation of the EGFR (14Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 15Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7035-7044Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 17Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We have found that, in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts, the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR is clearly required for β-AR-mediated ERK activation and subsequent DNA synthesis. Moreover, β2-AR activation in adult cardiac fibroblasts induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR presumably through multiple inputs (Fig. 7). Importantly, the trigger for this β2-AR-mediated EGFR transactivation in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts appears to involve Gi heterotrimeric G proteins, as PTX attenuated ISO-stimulated EGFR and ERK activation as well as DNA synthesis. Thus, as in cardiomyocytes, the β2-AR in cardiac fibroblasts can couple to both Gs and Gi proteins. Interestingly, in cardiomyocytes, dual β2-AR coupling to PTX-sensitive G proteins may be involved in novel regulation of calcium signaling and contractile function (36Xiao R.P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).Our current data also show that the Src tyrosine kinase is involved in β2-AR-mediated mitogenic signaling in rat cardiac fibroblasts, which is consistent with other known GPCR signaling cascades (37Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Aikawa R. Zhu W. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1997; 82: 337-345Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Src activity precedes EGFR transactivation, as both EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activity were attenuated in response to ISO in adult cardiac fibroblasts using the Src-specific inhibitor PP2. Importantly, GPCR-induced association of Src with the transactivated EGFR has been demonstrated previously in other cell types (38Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 39Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Moreover, in VSMCs, Src appears to be necessary for angiotensin II-mediated ERK activation (38Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Thus, in adult cardiac fibroblasts, Src could be a link that connects the transactivated EGFR to ERK because it can be recruited by the β-arrestin-mediated internalization of desensitized β2-ARs that is seen after ligand binding (40Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The precise role of Src in transactivation remains to be determined, although β-arrestin-dependent recruitment of Src to the β2-AR may provide the initial mechanism for recruiting Src to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, our present findings demonstrate that Src is a major regulatory protein involved in cardiac fibroblast proliferation after ISO stimulation by both an EGFR-dependent and Src-dependent EGFR-independent manner.Although we did not specifically address the issue, the involvement of PTX-sensitive G proteins in β-AR-mediated mitogenic signaling in cardiac fibroblasts suggests that G protein βγ-subunits (Gβγ) may be involved because Gi primarily activates ERK in many cell types via Gβγ (41Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 42Crespo P., Xu, N. Simons W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we speculated that Gβγ-dependent kinases might also play a role in β-AR-mediated mitogenic signaling in these cardiac fibroblasts. One such kinase, PI3K, can regulate a number of cellular processes, including protein synthesis; cytoskeletal reorganization; cell growth; and suppression of apoptosis in numerous cell types, including neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes (43Schluter K.D. Simm A. Schafer M. Taimor G. Piper H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1655-H1663PubMed Google Scholar, 44Pham F.H. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, β-AR-dependent PI3K activity may be involved in cardiac hypertrophy (4Esposito G. Prasad S.V. Rapacciuolo A. Mao L. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1453-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it has recently been shown that ISO-induced protein synthesis in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts is concomitant with increased PI3K activity (9Colombo F. Noel J. Mayers P. Mercier I. Calderone A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1091-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, PI3K appeared to be required for β2-AR-mediated ERK activation, which plays a major role in DNA synthesis in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. However, EGFR activation following ISO stimulation was independent of PI3K activity in cardiac fibroblasts, which is also required for the ISO mitogenic response. Thus, β2-AR/PI3K/ERK signaling can occur independently of EGFR activity (Fig. 7).Importantly, transactivation of the EGFR by GPCRs is an important mechanism that helps explain mechanistic questions regarding cell growth promotion by GPCRs (14Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 15Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7035-7044Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Recently, the MMP-dependent generation of HB-EGF has been reported to mediate EGFR transactivation (17Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The potential importance of MMP activity and “shedding” extends to cardiovascular cells, as thrombin and angiotensin II induce HB-EGF-dependent EGFR phosphorylation via MMPs in VSMCs (31Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Moreover, the MMP inhibitor BB94 inhibits VSMC migration and DNA synthesis following arterial injury (19Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 45Lovdahl C. Thyberg J. Hultgardh-Nilsson A. J. Vasc. Res. 2000; 37: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the MMP inhibitor BB2116 as well as a neutralizing antibody for HB-EGF to demonstrate attenuation of β-AR-mediated ERK activation and DNA synthesis in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. These data implicate MMP activity and HB-EGF shedding as critical components of cardiac fibroblast proliferation in response to catecholamine stimulation.Interestingly, HB-EGF itself has previously been implicated in heart diseases, as its transcriptional regulation has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy (46Schwartzbauer G. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35786-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and heart failure. 2W. J. Koch and B. C. Blaxall, unpublished data.

It has been implicated functionally in the assembly and structural stability of synaptic junctions as well as in the trafficking, recruitment, and localization of specific ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. The N terminus of SAP97 (S97N) has been shown to play a key role in the selection of binding partners and the localization of SAP97 at adhesion sites, as well as the clustering of ion channels in heterologous cells. Using the S97N domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the minus-end-directed actin-based motor, myosin VI, as an S97N binding partner. Moreover, in light membrane fractions prepared from rat brain, we found that myosin VI and SAP97 form a trimeric complex with the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit, GluR1. These data suggest that SAP97 may serve as a molecular link between GluR1 and the actin-dependent motor protein myosin VI during the dynamic translocation of AMPA receptors to and from the postsynaptic plasma membrane.

Using the S97N domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the minus-end-directed actin-based motor, myosin VI, as an S97N binding partner. Moreover, in light membrane fractions prepared from rat brain, we found that myosin VI and SAP97 form a trimeric complex with the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit, GluR1. These data suggest that SAP97 may serve as a molecular link between GluR1 and the actin-dependent motor protein myosin VI during the dynamic translocation of AMPA receptors to and from the postsynaptic plasma membrane. membrane-associated guanylate kinase guanylate kinase-like PSD95/SAP90-DLG-ZO1 α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid fetal bovine serum glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Tris-buffered saline phosphate-buffered saline postnatal day 8 nerve growth factor The synapse-associated protein SAP97 belongs to the SAP90/PSD-95 subfamily of membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGUKs).1 This family of proteins contains three PSD95/SAP90-DLG-ZO1 (PDZ) domains, an Src homology 3 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain. Each domain has been found to be a site of protein-protein interaction (1Craven S.E. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 2Sheng M.

MAGUKS are found both pre- and postsynaptically within the vertebrate central nervous system, where they are thought to play key roles in the organization of synaptic junctions. More specifically, MAGUKs have been shown to be involved in the targeting of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and receptors, anchoring synaptic proteins at the synaptic membrane and organizing signaling complexes (2Sheng M.

Within the nervous system, SAP97 has been found localized within the presynaptic nerve termini of excitatory synapses in the hippocampal formation, at postsynaptic sites within the cerebral cortex, and along bundles of unmyelinated axons in other brain regions (5Müller B.M.

Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to most other MAGUKs, SAP97 is also expressed in non-neural tissues, where it also exhibits a restricted staining pattern. For example, in epithelial cells, SAP97 and its human homolog, hDlg, have been found localized at sites of cell-cell contact along the lateral membrane where they are integrated into the cortical cytoskeleton (5Müller B.M.

This suggests that SAP97 may play a scaffolding role in the assembly and structural integrity of various types of membrane specialization. This concept is supported by studies on Dlg, the SAP97 orthologue in Drosophila, where it is found to be essential for the assembly of septate junctions and epithelial tumor suppression (12Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 13Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) as well as the assembly and function of the larval neuromuscular junction (8Budnik V. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SAP97 can functionally replace Dlg in knock-out flies at the neuromuscular junction and can suppress tumor formation in the imaginal discs (14Thomas U. Phannavong B. Muller B. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Within the CNS, SAP97 has been implicated in the synaptic localization and membrane trafficking of GluR1, a subunit of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (10Valtschanoff J.G.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, GluR1 has been found to interact with the first PDZ domain of SAP97 via its C-terminal tail and co-localize at the postsynaptic density (PSD) in rat cerebral cortex (10Valtschanoff J.G. Burette A. Davare M.A. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Weinberg R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The association of GluR1 and SAP97 appears to occur initially during the early stages of the biosynthesis of GluR1 subunits, as an interaction between these two synaptic proteins has been detected, whereas GluR1 subunits are still in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi network (16Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SAP97 and GluR1 complexes appear to dissociate as the two proteins reach the synaptic plasma membrane (16Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, SAP97 may play a role in the synaptic trafficking of GluR1. In non-neuronal cell systems, SAP97 appears to be involved in the trafficking of integral membrane proteins to and from the plasma membrane. For example, SAP97 has been found to translocate from a vesicular compartment to sites to cell-cell adhesion in an E-cadherin-dependent manner (11Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of domains essential for the localization of SAP97 at adhesion sites has shown that the N-terminal segment proceeding the PDZ1 domain of SAP97 (S97N) is the most critical (17Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the S97N region has been found to be a key regulatory element in the selection of SAP97 binding partners including the GUK domain-binding protein, GKAP, and the KA2 subunits of kainate receptors, as well as the formation of homomultimers of hDlg (18Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Mehta S., Wu, H. Garner C.C.

To gain further clues to the function of the S97N domain, we searched for proteins that interact with this domain. Here, we report that the C-terminal cargo binding domain of myosin VI, a minus-end-directed actin-dependent motor, interacts with the N-terminal 104 amino acid residues of SAP97 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that SAP97 and myosin VI form a trimeric complex with GluR1 in vesicular fractions from rat brain. These data suggest that SAP97 may serve as an adapter protein linking myosin VI to vesicular cargoes carrying glutamate receptor subunits. Goat polyclonal anti-GST antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-myosin VI antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Tama Hasson (21Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibodies mAb-77.4 and mAb-119 were produced by the Hybridoma Core Facility at University of Alabama at Birmingham, and rabbit polyclonal antibody 5′31f and 2d have been described previously (5Müller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both mAb-77.4 and 5′31f were generated against the N-terminal 163 amino acid residues of SAP97 (11Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 2d antibody was raised against the PDZ1–2 domains of SAP90/PSD95. The rabbit polyclonal SAP97 antibody, 62426 III3, was raised against the N-terminal 1–105 amino acid residues of SAP97 (a generous gift from Johannes Hell (10Valtschanoff J.G. Burette A. Davare M.A. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Weinberg R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). The mouse monoclonal antibody mAb-119 was generated against the N-terminal 119 amino acid residues of SAP102 (6Müller B.M. Kistner U. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Kuhlendahl S. Fenster S.D. Lau L.F. Veh R.W. Huganir R.L. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal anti-GluR1 antibody raised against the C terminus of GluR1 subunit was purchased from Chemicon. The rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) media supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The human colon carcinoma cell line CACO-2 was cultured in MEM (Invitrogen) media supplemented with 10% FBS and COS7 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2atmosphere. Transfection and immunofluorescent staining of the cells were performed as described previously (11Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S97N1–65, S97N1–104, and S97N1–186 were amplified by PCR using SAP97 as template. The PCR products were first subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) by TOPO-TA cloning. His6/T7-tagged S97N1–65,S97N1–104, and S97N1–186 constructs were created by subcloning the corresponding PCR fragments into pRSETC vector (Invitrogen). GST-tagged myo6-C construct was created by subcloning the yeast two-hybrid prey clone N104#29 into pGEX-2T.1 (modified from pGEX2T by changing the multiple cloning sites). The fragment encodes the C-terminal region of myosin VI containing amino acid residues 1126–1262. The recombinant GST- and His6-tagged molecules were expressed in bacteria strain BL21 GOLD (Stratagene) after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fisher Biotech) as described by Kuhlendahl et al.(22Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), for GST proteins, or TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH), for His6 proteins, according to the protocols of the manufacturers. ELISA-based binding assays were performed as described previously (22Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a microplate reader (Cambridge Technology Inc.). The values for each experiment were changed into relative binding activity by defining the maximal absorbance at 405 nm as 100%. All assays were repeated three times in duplicates. In overlay assays, protein samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with blocking solution (5% skim milk and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)) followed by incubation with 10 μg/ml Hi6/T7-tagged S97N1–65 or S97N1–104diluted in 3% FBS/TBS, for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times with TBS, blocked with blocking solution for 30 min, and incubated with anti-T7 monoclonal antibody for 2 h at room temperature followed by AP-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were detected after soaking blots in 10 ml of AP staining solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 165 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT, Sigma) and 82.5 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP, Sigma). The reaction was stopped with distilled water after 5–10 min. Pull-down assays using GST fusion proteins were performed as follows. GST alone or GST fusion proteins were purified as described above and dialyzed for 2 h in PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer (Pierce). Ten μg of GST fusion proteins were then coupled to 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads for each reaction by incubating them at room temperature for 1 h. After being washed several times with PBS, the beads are ready for the assay. To prepare cell extracts, confluent cells in 10-cm culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. One ml of extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and 1 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) was then added to each 10-cm dish, and cells were scraped off with a rubber policeman. After homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer and a 30-min incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant (cell extracts) was then incubated with GST fusion protein-coupled glutathione beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation. After three washes with the extraction buffer and one wash with PBS, 100 μl of SDS sample buffer was used to elute the proteins associated with the glutathione beads. The samples were boiled for 5 min and then processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously (23Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, cultured PC12 cells in each 10-cm dish were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, PH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and incubated on ice for 30 min to solubilize the proteins. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was precleared with bovine serum albumin-treated protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. Crude membrane fractions were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat brain. In brief, the brains from rats of postnatal day 8 (P8) were rapidly removed after cervical dislocation, homogenized on ice in 1:10 (w/v) homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Following centrifugation at 800 × g for 15 min to remove the nuclei and cell debris, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S100) was retained, and the pellet (P100) was resuspended and solubilized for 20 min at 4 °C in Buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100). The fractions were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Flotation assays were performed essentially as described previously (28Zhai R.G. Vardinon-Friedman H. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Ziv N.E. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2001; 29: 131-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In brief, P8 brains were dissected and homogenized in homogenization buffer as described above. Homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The crude membrane in the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, lysed hypotonically in 9 volumes of 2 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet (P100) was adjusted to 2 m sucrose and loaded as a layer of a discontinuous sucrose gradient underneath layers of 1.2, 0.8, and 0.3 m sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 350,000 × g for 3 h. Fractions were taken from the top to the bottom. Fractions used for immunoprecipitation were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal 186 residues of SAP97 (S97N) plays an essential role in the targeting of SAP97 to sites of cell-cell contact, in the multimerization of SAP97 molecules and in the selection of binding partners (17Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D.

Although the latter two interactions are thought to represent both inter- and intramolecular interactions between and within SAP97, the former is conceivably due to intermolecular interactions with other cellular proteins. To gain insight into how the S97N domain functions to direct the localization of SAP97, we performed a yeast two-hybrid-based screen to identify potential S97N binding partners. Three baits were created, S97N1–186, S97N1–65, and S97N1–104, and used to screen a mouse kidney library. S97N1–186 was self-activating and was not used further. Several potential binding partners were identified for the S97N1–65 and S97N1–104 baits. Of these, one clone, N104#29, was found to encode the C-terminal region of myosin VI, an actin-based unconventional motor protein (termed myo6-C) (Fig.1B) (21Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Avraham K.B. Hasson T. Sobe T. Balsara B. Testa J.R. Skvorak A.B. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hum. Mol.

Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This clone is of particular interest because actin-based motor proteins are implicated in protein trafficking (26Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between S97N and myo6-C, we first performed an ELISA-based binding assay to assess whether these interactions could occur in vitro. In these assays, the myo6-C, as well as two non-interacting clones, N65#23 and N104#8, used as controls, were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins, and the S97N1–65 and S97N1–104 were fused to the His6/T7 epitope. In each experiment, 20 pmol of His6/T7-tagged S97N1–65 (Fig. 1C) or S97N1–104(Fig. 1D) were bound to a 96-well ELISA plate and incubated with increasing concentrations of GST or GST-tagged N65#23, N104#8, and myo6-C. The binding activity was detected by anti-GST antibody, followed by AP-conjugated secondary antibody. Myo6-C was found to bind both S97N fragments, although binding was stronger with S97N1–104 than S97N1–65. Clones N65#23 and N104#8 were unable to interact with S97N1–65 or S97N1–104 (Fig. 1, C and D). As a second measure that the S97N domain can interact with the C-terminal tail of myosin VI, we performed an overlay assay. Here, GST and GST-tagged myo6-C were immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with 10 μg/ml His6/T7-tagged S97N1–65 or S97N1–104, and then stained with anti-T7 antibody. Again, both S97N1–104 and S97N1–65 were found to interact with GST-tagged myo6-C (Fig.2A). As observed in our ELISA, S97N1–104 appeared to bind more strongly to myo6-C than S97N1–65, as assessed by the intensity of the bands (Fig.2A). These data indicate that most of the first 104 amino acid residues S97N1–104 are required for strong binding to this C-terminal segment of myosin VI. Our initialin vitro binding data demonstrated that short regions of SAP97 (S97N1–104) and myosin VI (myo6-C) can interact with each other (Figs. 1 and 2A). To determine whether these regions could interact when placed in the context of full-length molecules, a GST-based “pull-down” assay was utilized (Fig. 2, B and C). PC12 cell extracts were used as the source for full-length SAP97 and myosin VI, because both proteins are endogenously expressed in these cells. When GST-tagged S97N1–104 was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with total cell extracts of PC12, endogenous myosin VI was found to bind the GST-S97N1–104 beads but not the control GST beads (Fig. 2B). Similarly, incubating PC12 cell extracts with GST-myo6-C-bound glutathione-agarose beads lead to the specific isolation of SAP97 (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that S97N1–104 and myo6-C interact in the context of full-length molecules. Although members of the SAP97 family share a high degree of homology between their PDZ, Src homology 3, and GUK domains, little if any similarity exists between their N-terminal sequences (17Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore the specificity of the myosin VI-SAP97 interaction, we examined whether GST-myo6-C could affinity purify another member of the SAP97 family. This was accomplished by transfectingmyc-tagged SAP102 and SAP97 into COS7 cells and subjecting the cell extracts to pull-down with GST-myo6-C. Althoughmyc-tagged SAP97 was readily detected in the bound fraction of GST-myo6-C, in three separate experiments myc-tagged SAP102 was not detected (Fig. 2D), indicating that the interaction between myosin VI with SAP97 is specific. To assess the importance of the interaction between SAP97 and myosin VI, we compared the distribution pattern of SAP97 and myosin VI in PC12 cells by double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy. In undifferentiated PC12 cells, e.g. those that had not been treated with nerve growth factor (NGF), SAP97 exhibited a punctate cytoplasmic pattern as well as a pronounced immunoreactivity at sites of cell-cell contact (Fig.3a). Myosin VI also exhibits a punctate cytoplasmic pattern similar to SAP97, and yet it was not found at cell-cell adhesion sites (Fig. 3b). The punctate pattern observed for myosin VI is similar to that observed previously for myosin VI in neuronal cells (27Suter D.M. Espindola F.S. Lin C.H. Forscher P. Mooseker M.S. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Given the small size of these undifferentiated cells, it was not feasible to determine accurately whether SAP97 and myosin VI truly co-localize. We therefore treated PC12 cells for 3 days with NGF. This treatment induced the outgrowth of neurites as well as the loss of cell-cell adhesion sites (Fig. 3). In this situation, cells double-labeled with SAP97 and myosin VI antibodies revealed a partially overlapping punctate pattern for these two proteins (Fig. 3, d–f). This suggests that perhaps both myosin VI and SAP97 are present on a population of vesicles within PC12 cells. The fact that there is only a partial overlap is somewhat expected given that SAP97 is thought to move with its ion channels via vesicular membranes both to and from the plasma membranes (11Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas myosin VI is thought to be involved primarily in the retrieval of membrane proteins from the plasma membrane (26Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Further support that SAP97 and myosin VI physically interact with each other in these cells was obtained by immunoprecipitating SAP97 with either our 5′31f or 2d antibodies from cellular extracts from both NGF differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The 5′31f antibody recognizes the S97N domain of SAP97, and the 2d antibody recognizes the PDZ1–2 domain in SAP97 (5Müller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probing Western blots of these immunoprecipitates with antibodies against SAP97 and myosin VI showed that both were found in the precipitates with anti-SAP97 antibodies prepared from both NGF-treated and untreated cells but not in precipitates with a control IgG (Fig. 4). These data suggest that SAP97 and myosin VI can interact in PC12 cells, perhaps on a subpopulation of vesicles. In non-neuronal cells, SAP97 has been found to exist as a soluble protein in association with vesicular membranes, and as a structural component of the cortical cytoskeleton assembled at sites of cell-cell contact (11Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is readily observed in undifferentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 3) as well as columnar epithelial cells such as CACO2 or MDCK (11Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, myosin VI can exist as a soluble protein, in association with vesicular membranes, and at least in the inner ear is association with the actin-rich microvilli of the hair cell epitheliam (21Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These observation suggest that the myosin VI and SAP97 interaction could potentially occur in a variety of situations, e.g. as soluble proteins, with vesicular membrane as suggested from our PC12 experiment, and/or in association with the cortical cytoskeleton. Our previous studies on the colonic epithelial cell line, CACO2, show that nearly all of the SAP97 is found at cell-cell adhesion sites, with very little in the cytoplasm (11Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined this system to assess whether myosin VI interacts with SAP97 when it is assembled into the cortical cytoskeleton. Although both proteins were found to be expressed in these cells (Fig.5A), they exhibit distinct distribution patterns as assessed by double-label immunofluorescent microscopy (Fig. 5C). For example, SAP97 is found at adhesion sites, whereas myosin VI exhibits a punctate"

When the purified cyt <i>c</i> was reacted with an excess amount of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) at pH 7.4, the peroxidase activity of cyt<i>c</i> was increased by 4.5-, 6.9-, and 8.6-fold at molar ratios (HOCl/cyt <i>c</i>) of 2, 4, and 8, respectively. In comparison with native cyt <i>c</i>, the mass spectra obtained from the HOCl-treated cyt <i>c</i> revealed that oxygen is covalently incorporated into the protein as indicated by molecular ions of <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> = 12,360 (cyt <i>c</i>), 12,376 (cyt <i>c</i> + O), and 12,392 (cyt <i>c</i> + 2O). Using tandem mass spectrometry, a peptide (obtained from the tryptic digests of HOCl-treated cyt <i>c</i>) corresponding to the amino acid sequence MIFAGIK, which contains the methionine that binds to the heme, was identified to be involved in the oxygen incorporation. The location of the oxygen incorporation was unequivocally determined to be the methionine residue, suggesting that the oxidation of heme ligand (Met-80) by HOCl results in the enhancement of peroxidase activity of cyt <i>c</i>. ESR spectroscopy of HOCl-oxidized cyt <i>c</i>, when reacted with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of the nitroso spin trap 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP), yielded more immobilized MNP/tyrosyl adduct than native cyt<i>c</i>.

The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1, a heterodimeric DNA-binding protein consisting of a cytokine-, oxygen- and growth factor-regulated HIF-1α and a constitutive HIF-1β/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter element) normally promotes the expression of adaptive genes under hypoxic conditions. However, during pathophysiologic conditions involving ischemia and/or hypoxia, HIF-1α overexpression drives aberrant gene expression with rapid progression to the lethal phenotype (28Semenza G.L.

It is interesting that IL-1β partially mimics cellular hypoxia, leading to increased HIF-1α-DNA binding and activation ofCOX-2 and PS2 in human gingival and synovial fibroblasts and in rat and monkey retinal neurons (30Thornton R.D.

How hypoxia modulates oxygen-sensitive, pro-inflammatory transcription factor signaling and gene expression in human neural cells is not well understood. Because COX-2 regulates PG and lipid-messenger production and PS1 mediates the generation of Aβ, which can trigger microglial activation and further release of IL-1β, COX-2 and PS1 expression represents an exceptionally potent driver for pro-inflammatory signaling in the brain. Here we provide data showing that COX-2 and PS1 gene up-regulation in [IL-1β+Aβ42]-induced HN cells and in AD hippocampal CA1 contrasts with the coordinate down-regulation of basal COX-2 and PS1 gene transcription observed during human neurogenesis. These effects were greatly magnified in hypoxia-stressed, [IL-1β+Aβ42]-treated HN cells and blocked by the electron spin-trap agent and free radical scavenger α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN). The data also indicate that COX-2 and PS1 are basally rare, labile, and transient genetic participants in [IL-1β+Aβ42]-mediated, hypoxia-enhanced, pro-inflammatory signaling in HN primary cells, similar to those found in AD-affected brain. DNA microarray analysis further suggests that COX-2and PS1 are under transcriptional control, in part by AP1-, NF-κBp50/p65-, STAT1α-, and HIF-1α-DNA binding, as are the related TATA-containing pro-inflammatory gene family members encodingNF-κBp50/p105, IL-1β precursor, and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). These findings further suggest that episodic hypoxia during brain aging may drive intermittent COX-2, PS1, and related pro-inflammatory gene expression that contributes cumulatively to amyloidogenesis, brain inflammation, and AD neuropathology.

(St. Louis, MO); Aβ42 (Aβ1–42; 62-0-80) and a 42-amino acid scrambled control peptide Aβ42s (62-0-81) were purchased from the American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA). Normal human neural (HN) progenitor cells (CC-2599), NPMM (neural progenitor maintenance medium), human epidermal and fibroblast growth factors, gentamicin/amphotericin B (G/A1000), and neural survival factor-1 were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). AP1, HIF-1α, NF-κBp50/p65, and STAT1α gel-shift consensus and mutant oligonucleotides (9Lukiw W.J. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 1: 583-592Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Lukiw W.J.

AP1, HIF-1α, NF-κBp50/p65, and STAT1α supershift and COX-2 and PS1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). HN cells derived from explanted human fetal brain tissue and cryo-preserved in primary passage as “spheroids” were grown to ∼70% confluence (∼50,000 cells per 3.5-cm diameter well) in six-well Costar plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2/20% O2/75% N2in humidified air at 1 atm (normoxic conditions) in NPMM medium (Clonetics CC-4241) supplemented with human fibroblast growth factor, neural survival factor-1, human epidermal growth factor, and G/A1000, as described by the manufacturer (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD). HN cells tested negatively for HIV-1, hepatitis B and C, mycoplasma, bacteria, yeast, and fungi and positively for the glial and neural markers GFAP, MAP2, and β-tubulin III (Clonetics). After 2 weeks of development, HN cells were exposed to IL-1β, Aβ42, Aβ42s, [IL-1β+Aβ42], PBN, and/or normoxia or ambient hypoxic conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2/5% O2/90% N2 in humidified air at 1 atm) for 0, 1, and 3 h in an electronically metered hypoxia incubator (Model 1143, Series II, ThermoForma) in sterile Plexiglas chambers as previously described (31Lukiw W.J.

Concentrations of O2 were also continuously monitored using a dissolved O2 meter (Corning Model 317) with the O2 probe immersed in an adjacent well in NPMM culture medium. RNA and protein were isolated (see below) and stored at −81 °C within minutes of removal of cells from normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Stringent criteria were used in the case selection of human brain tissues used in these studies. Hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 region (CA1) and superior temporal lobe neocortices (A22) from Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD and National Institutes of Aging-autopsy-confirmed control, and AD brains were obtained from hundreds of potential specimens from domestic and international brain banks. No AD tissues had a known clinical history of familial degenerative disease, and there were no statistically significant differences in age (control age, 68.8 ± 1.9 years; AD, 69.2 ± 1.5 years; p ∼ 0.8), post-mortem interval (control, 2.0 ± 0.7 h; AD, 2.1 ± 0.7 h; p ∼ 0.9), or tissue pH (control, 6.7 ± 0.1; AD, 6.8 ± 0.1; p ∼ 0.9) between the two brain groups (4Lukiw W.J.

Basal abundance and decay kinetics were established for human-specific COX-2, PS1, and PS2 RNA message by an assay for total RNA in both HN cells and in control human neocortex and hippocampal CA1 using Northern dot blots and RT-PCR. No inhibitors of transcription or translation were used. Nuclei within these latter tissues still actively support run-on RNA polymerase II transcription to ∼85% of control values up to the 3-h post-mortem interval (4Lukiw W.J. Carver C.A. LeBlanc H.J. Bazan N.G. Alzheimer Rep. 2000; 3: 161-167Google Scholar). Aged HN cells were incubated at 37 °C, and COX-2, PS1, and PS2 RNA message levels were compared with the RNA message levels for control β-actin signal in the same sample for 0–24 h. RNA adenine-uridine-rich element (ARE) analysis was performed by Hitachi DNASIS MAX DNA sequence analysis software (Hitachi Genetics group) and/or TRANSFAC version 5.4 (BIOBASE, Wolfenbuttel, Germany).COX-2 and PS1 RNA message stabilities were used as a stringent guide in the selection of post-mortem human brain tissues for RNA analysis (4Lukiw W.J. Carver C.A. LeBlanc H.J. Bazan N.G. Alzheimer Rep. 2000; 3: 161-167Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts (NPXTs) were prepared from one to three 3.5-cm-diameter wells of HN cells or 100 mg (wet weight) brain tissue and quantitated as described previously (9Lukiw W.J. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 1: 583-592Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Lukiw W.J. Bazan N.G. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lukiw W.J. Pelaez R.P. Martinez J. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3914-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NPXTs (5 μg) derived from HN cells were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) end-labeled AP1, HIF-1α, NF-κBp50/p65, or STAT1α consensus and mutant oligonucleotides in 5-μl volumes, reacted for 30 min on ice, analyzed on 5% acrylamide/90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.4, 1 mm EDTA (TBE) gels, and dried onto 2-mm Whatman filter paper at 80 °C for 2 h and phosphorimaging was performed. Gel supershift assays employed rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for AP1, HIF-1α, the NF-κBp50/p65 subunit, and STAT1α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-44X, sc-8710X, sc-7151X, and sc-464X, respectively). Total RNA from HN cells or human brain tissues was isolated with a phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate reagent (TRIzol, Invitrogen). RNA isolation reagents were prepared from 0.2-μm-filtered, diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and human RNase inhibitors (Ambion 2682 and 2690), anti-RNase (Ambion 2692, 1 unit/μl), and RNasin (Promega N2115, 1 unit/μl) were used throughout the isolation procedures. Total RNA samples were analyzed on an RNA Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and hadA260/A280 ratios typically of ≥2.0. No significant differences in the spectral purity, rate of degradation, or molecular size or yield of total RNA between control and AD brain tissues or between control HN and ligand-treated RNA message populations were noted. Packed HN cells and brain RNA yields were ∼100 μg of total RNA from each 100-mg wet weight tissue/cell sample. Total RNA was fractionated into an enriched poly(A)+ fraction by RNase-free DNase treatment followed by incubation with biotinylated oligo(dT) (CLONTECH BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, K1038). Enriched poly(A)+mRNA was recovered on streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads in a magnetic separator (MagneSphere Z5341, Promega Biotech). Poly(A)+ mRNA was converted into cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus RT in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (10 μCi/μl, 100 μCi per reaction, 3000 Ci/mmol, AmershamBiosciences), nucleospin-column purified, and hybridized onto dot blots or DNA array panels in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH BD Biosciences, S1135). DNA array panels (1184 human genes; CLONTECH BD Biosciences, 7850/7852; lots 0030637 and 0010880), each containing 10 ng of cDNA, were pretreated, prehybridized, hybridized, washed, and exposed according to the manufacturer's protocol PT3140 (CLONTECH BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). RT-PCR was performed by the superscript one-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) and human-specific COX-1, COX-2, PS1, NF-κBp50/p105, IL-1β, and cPLA2 primers as previously described (4Lukiw W.J.

PS1, NF-κBp50/p105, COX-1, COX-2, IL-1β, and cPLA2 5′ upstream promoter DNA sequences (−1200 to +100 bp, +1 = major start of transcription) were sequenced (COX-2 and PS1) and analyzed using an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer and BLAST2 (NCBI, National Institutes of Health), DNASIS, and TRANSFAC analytical algorithms using the GenBankTM accession numbers AF458103, S57113, D64068,AF276953, U26540, and U08374, respectively. For Western, Northern dot blot, RT-PCR, and DNA array analyses, signal-intensity data were gathered and averaged from three to five independent experiments by phosphorimaging onto molecular imaging screens (FUJI Film) for 3–36 h using a Typhoon Molecular Imager system (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical significance of the Western, Northern dot blot, and RT-PCR data was determined by two-way factorial analysis of variance (p, analysis of variance); error bars in Figs. 1, 2, FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 7, and 9represent standard errors from the mean. For DNA array quantitation a “standard analysis” used 9 × 106 cpm of probe per 96-cm2 DNA array, an 18-h hybridization, and a 12-h exposure onto phosphor storage screens. Resulting data sets were analyzed, and features were extracted using Atlas version 2.0 (CLONTECH BD Biosciences) and GeneSpring version 4.1.5 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) bioinformatics algorithms. Signal parameters (signal ratio, difference, and DNA filter background correction) were adjusted so that gene targets showing only the largest treated versus control changes, that is, exceeding a factor of 2.7-fold (p < 0.05), were reported.FIG. 2Basal COX-2 and PS1 expression during human brain development and in AD neocortex (NCTX) and hippocampus (HIPP).

Sequence analysis showed that SmTCTP differed from other reported TCTPs in having only one signature sequence. Subsequently, SmTCTP was cloned in a T7 expression system and expressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. Recombinant SmTCTP (rSmTCTP) has a molecular mass of ∼23 kDa with the histidine tag. Further analysis showed that SmTCTP transcripts and protein are expressed in all life cycle stages of the parasite within the vertebrate hosts. Interestingly, antibodies to SmTCTP were present in the sera of mice 9 weeks after infection with S. mansoni. Characterization studies showed that rSmTCTP is a calcium-binding protein that can cause histamine release from basophil/mast cells and induce eosinophil infiltration. These findings suggest that SmTCTP may have an important role in the development of allergic inflammatory responses associated with schistosomiasis and may be a target for new drug development.

Bendorf R. Gaestel M. Gross B. Nurnberg P. Kraft R., A., O. Bielka H. Biochem. Int. 1989; 19: 277-286PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently TCTP was found to be present in many cell types (2Sanchez J.

Homologues of TCTP have been reported from several organisms including plants, earthworm, parasites, and hydras (3Pay A. Heberle-Bors E. Hirt H. Plant Mol.

Med. 1996; 183: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) from basophils. Despite their varied functions, ubiquitous distribution, and high level of conservation, the primary physiological function of TCTP still remains unclear (8Gachet Y. Tournier S. Lee M. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Poulton T. Bommer U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we reported the cloning of TCTP homologues from the filarial parasites Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti(10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study we describe the cloning of a TCTP homologue from the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni. Results from the present study show that similar to the filarial TCTPs, the SmTCTP also exhibit a calcium-binding property and mediate histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. EST databases of S. mansoni were searched with Schistosoma japonicum TCTP homologue (GenBankTM accession number U85483) at the parasite genome BLAST server (www.ebi.ac.uk/blast2/parasites.html). The search identified two ESTs, one from S. mansoni cercarial stage (EMBL accession No. AA559731) and second one from S. mansoni adult (EMBL accession No. N20681) with significant homology. By aligning these two sequences a forward primer specific toS. mansoni, TCTP was designed with a sequence of 5′-ATGCGAGTGTTCAAGGATG-3′. As the ESTs were partial, the 3′-end of the TCTP could not be identified. Using the 5′-end SmTCTP sequence as the forward primer and the T7 promoter primer located downstream to the multiple cloning sites as the reverse primer, a PCR reaction was performed on the S. mansoni schistosomula cDNA library. PCR parameters were as follows: 95 °C of denaturation for 30 s, 58 °C of primer annealing for 30 s, 72 °C of primer extension for 3 min, and cycled for 30 cycles; a final extension of 5 min was performed at 72 °C before storing the samples at 4 °C. The PCR product was cloned in pST-Blue vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the DNA insert was sequenced. The sequence was characterized by sequence analysis programs and named as SmTCTP. The open reading frame of SmTCTP was cloned in T7 expression vector. The forward PCR primer corresponded to the beginning of the open reading frame of SmTCTP with the addition of an upstream in-frame BamHI restriction site, (5′-CGCGGATCCATGATCGTGTATAAGGATATG-3′). The reverse primer corresponded to the 3′-end of SmTCTP open reading frame flanked by HindIII restriction site (5′-CCCAAGCTTTCAATATTTTTCCTGAGTTAATCC-3′). PCR parameters were 95 °C of denaturation for 30 s, 52 °C of primer annealing for 30 s, 72 °C of primer extension for 3 min, and cycled for 30 cycles. A final extension of 5 min was performed at 72 °C before storing the samples at 4 °C. The PCR products obtained were digested with BamHI and HindIII enzymes and ligated to similarly digested T7 expression vector pRSET A (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). Insert DNA was sequenced to ensure the authenticity of the cloned nucleotide sequence. A recombinant construct of SmTCTP in T7 expression vector was maintained in XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For expression, the recombinant plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) containing pLysS (Invitrogen) to minimize toxicity due to the protein. When A600 of the cultures reached 0.6, 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the cultures to induce gene expression, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 3 h. Total proteins were separated in a 12% SDS-PAGE, and the presence of histidine-tagged protein was confirmed using an anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the histidine-tagged recombinant proteins were purified using a TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The purified SmTCTP was passed through a polymyxin B-agarose column (Detoxi-gel, Pierce) to eliminate endotoxins if any in the preparation before using in functional assays. Polyclonal antibodies to purified rSmTCTP were generated in C57/BL6 mice. Mice were treated in accordance with an approved institutional protocol. For generating antibodies, mice were immunized with 2 μg of rSmTCTP in Gerbu adjuvant (CCBiotech Corp., Poway, CA) followed by three booster doses at 2-week interval. After the final booster dose, mice were bled, and the sera were separated and stored at –20 °C. Reactivity of the sera was tested on Western blots. Seven C57BL/6 mice were infected with 100 cercariae of S. mansoni as described previously (11Ramaswamy K., He, Y.X. Salafsky B. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following infection, blood samples were collected from each mouse on weeks 2, 3, 8, and 9 by ocular puncture, and sera were separated. Serum samples collected before infection (day 0) served as controls. Expression of SmTCTP transcript in various life cycle stages (sporocyst, cercaria, schistosomula, adult male, and adult female) of the parasite was determined by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from each of the life cycle stages of the parasite using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and was reverse-transcribed using RETROscript (Ambion, Austin, TX). Hepatopancreas from normal snails was used as a control for the sporocyst stage. First, the cDNA of actin was PCR-amplified from each sample (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using S. mansoni actin-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-ACTAAGTGAACATGGCCGACG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGCATGTGGTAGAGCATAAC-3′). After the band densities were determined using NIH Image software, the concentrations of individual samples were then adjusted so that each sample contained approximately the same level of actin. Individual samples were then PCR-amplified using SmTCTP-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-ATGTTCACAGACTCGCACTGTCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TATGGTGTCATACCGTCCTC-3′). Primers for actin and SmTCTP amplify 536- and 447-bp target fragments, respectively. PCRs were performed as follows: for actin, 3 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 30 cycles; For SmTCTP, 3 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 28 cycles. The final extension was followed by 5 min at 72 °C for all target cDNA amplifications. The products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Photographs of gels were scanned, and band densities were analyzed using NIH Image software. Results are shown as scanned photographs and are expressed as target band intensity divided by β-actin band density. Expression of SmTCTP protein in various life cycle stages (sporocyst, cercaria, schistosomula, adult male, and adult females) of the parasite was determined by an immunoblot analysis. Excretory secretions (ES) of schistosomula were prepared as described previously (12Ramaswamy K. Salafsky B. Potluri S., He, Y.X., Li, J.W. Shibuya T. J. Inflamm. 1995; 46: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble antigens of the parasites were prepared by sonication (Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cross-reactive antigens from these preparations were then removed by incubating them for 1 h at room temperature with nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) strips adsorbed with mouse pre-immune serum (1:10). These antigens were then resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with mouse anti-SmTCTP (1:100 dilution) or mouse pre-immune serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the membrane three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce Chemicals) was added at a 1:5000 dilution, and color was developed using a chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Purified rSmTCTP was used as a positive control. The ability of SmTCTP to bind calcium was studied in vitro as described previously (10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified rSmTCTP transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes was incubated with 20 μCi/ml45CaCl2 (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) for 10 min, washed with distilled water for 5 min, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 10 min. The ability of SmTCTP to induce the release of histamine from a rat basophilic cell line, RBL-2H3 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was studied as described previously (10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, rSmTCTP at final concentrations of 10, 1.25, and 0.3 μg/ml was added to cultured RBL-2H3 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Histamine released into the culture supernatant was determined using a kit purchased from Beckman-Coulter (Immunotech, Miami, FL) as per the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Substance 48/80 (Sigma), an ionophore added at 0.3 μg/ml final concentration, served as a positive control for histamine release assay. Another recombinant protein of S. mansoni, Sm-G-binding factor (SmGBF), expressed in our laboratory and purified under similar conditions, was used as negative control. C57BL/6 mice were sensitized first by injecting 20 μg of ovalbumin (Sigma) intraperitoneally. One week after sensitization, 5 μg of rSmTCTP suspended in 100 μl of saline was injected into the peritoneum. rSmGBF or sterile phosphate-buffered saline was used as the negative control. At 24 h after injection, peritoneal cells were collected, and a differential count was made on a cytospin (Cytopro, Wescor Inc. Logan, UT) smear preparation of the cells stained with Giemsa. Statistical analyses to test the significance of variance between control and experimental groups were determined by a Mann-Whitney U test using a Sigmastat program (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). A cDNA fragment of 513 bp was isolated from S. mansoni cercarial cDNA using primers derived from S. japonicum TCTP sequence and EST sequences of S. mansoni as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Translation of the nucleotide sequence revealed a putative open reading frame of 170 amino acids with a molecular mass of 19.6 kDa and pI of 4.68. BLAST analysis of encoded polypeptide sequence confirmed that the isolated cDNA clone is a homologue of TCTP protein. Multiple sequence alignment of the SmTCTP-encoded polypeptide with the TCTP family of proteins is shown in Fig. 1A. SmTCTP displayed 58% identity and 77% similarity with S. japonicum TCTP. Human and mouse TCTP proteins share 35–38% identity and 60% similarity with smTCTP, whereas filarial TCTP proteins from B. malayi and W. bancrofti had only about 27% identity and 52% similarity with SmTCTP. The phylogenetic tree, depicted in Fig. 1B, shows that S. mansoni and S. japonicum TCTP are closely related, while they are distinctly separate from filarial and mammalian TCTP proteins. A search of amino acid sequence of SmTCTP with the pattern data base of Prosite (13Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofman K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) revealed that SmTCTP contained 100% identical TCTP1 signature sequences, (I/A)G(G/A/S)N(P/A)SAE(G/D/E)(P/A/G/E)X(0/1)(D/E/G)X(D/E/N)X2(D/E), which corresponded to amino acid positions 46–56. However, it lacked a conspicuous signature sequence 2, which is present in all of the known TCTPs except the TCTP of hydra (GenBankTM accession No. 6094440). SmTCTP contained several potential phosphorylation sites and a myristoylation site (data not shown). In addition, SmTCTP also contained the typical Lupas coiled-coil structure as described previously with the filarial TCTPs (10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SmTCTP cloned in T7 expression vector pRSET A was expressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. The resultant recombinant fusion protein showed the expected molecular size of 23 kDa (Fig. 2), which corresponded to 19.6 kDa of SmTCTP open reading frame and ∼3 kDa encoded by cloning vector from the translational start codon to the cloning siteBamH1, that included a hexa-histidine tag. The recombinant protein was then purified using metal affinity column chromatography to >98% purity (Fig. 2). Purified rSmTCTP was probed with sera collected from mice at different time points after infection with S. mansoni cercariae. Recombinant SmTCTP was reactive with 9-week post-infection sera but not with 0-, 2-, 3-, or 8-week sera (Fig. 2). Anti-rSmTCTP sera generated in mice were a positive control. Interestingly, rSmTCTP did not react with antisera raised against filarial TCTPs and vice-versa (data not shown). RT-PCR amplification of the SmTCTP gene from different life cycle stages ofS. mansoni showed that the gene is transcribed in all the stages evaluated (Fig. 3A). Semiquantitative analysis done by comparing the ratio of target to actin transcript suggested that the SmTCTP expression level is slightly higher in female adult worms than at other life cycle stages (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analyses done on the soluble protein extracts of the different life cycle stages of the parasite also showed that the expression of SmTCTP protein was present in sporocyst, cercaria, schistosomula, adult male, and adult female stages (Fig.4). However, SmTCTP expression was comparatively lower in sporocystic stages. Interestingly SmTCTP was also present in the ES products of schistosomula. A protein at 85 kDa in the ES products reacted strongly with the anti-SmTCTP antibodies. Based on densitometric scanning of this band, it was estimated that the schistosomula of S. mansoni secrete approximately 1 μg of SmTCTP/1000 schistosomula. As has been reported previously with other TCTP proteins (10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Bhisutthibhan J. Meshnick S.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2397-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Yoon T. Jung J. Kim M. Lee K.M. Choi E.C. Lee K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the SmTCTP antibody also recognized several proteins most prominently around 25, 60, 85, and 150 kDa in molecular size in the worm homogenates of schistosomula, adult male worms, and adult female worms (Fig. 4). Mammalian and filarial TCTP are shown to bind calcium (7Kim M. Jung Y. Lee K. Kim C. Arch. Pharm. Res. 2000; 23: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The calcium-binding domain of SmTCTP showed significant similarity with the calcium-binding domain of mammalian and filarial TCTPs. Hence, we wanted to test for whether rSmTCTP could also bind calcium. Overlay studies with radioactive Ca45 demonstrated that rSmTCTP could indeed bind calcium (Fig. 5). This suggested that SmTCTP is a calcium-binding protein. Because mammalian and parasite TCTPs can induce the release of histamine from basophils (16MacDonald S. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we wanted to evaluate whether SmTCTP also possess similar property. Histamine releasing ability of rSmTCTP was evaluated using a rat basophilic cell line, RBL-2H3. Results showed that rSmTCTP induced histamine release in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6). This release was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than spontaneous release. The addition of another S. mansoni recombinant protein, rSmGBF, which was expressed and purified under conditions similar to rSmTCTP, did not release histamine from RBL-2H3 above base line. Injection of rSmTCTP into the peritoneal cavity of mice sensitized 1 week previously with ovalbumin resulted in significant cellular infiltration within 24 h after the injection. A differential count showed that eosinophils are the predominant infiltrating cells in the peritoneal cavity (Fig.7). Injection of rSmGBF, a recombinant protein from the schistosomular stages of S. mansoniexpressed and purified under similar conditions as rSmTCTP, did not stimulate eosinophil accumulation in the peritoneal cavity. We have cloned a TCTP homologue from S. mansoni using S. japonicum TCTP sequences and schistosome EST data base sequences. Similar to other TCTP proteins, SmTCTP was found to be a calcium-binding protein with a histamine-releasing function. To our knowledge, SmTCTP is the first recombinant protein characterized from S. mansoni that has a histamine-releasing function. A comparison of amino acid sequence data of SmTCTP with other TCTP proteins showed that S. mansoni and S. japonicumTCTP proteins share a high percentage of homology but are divergent from filarial TCTP proteins. In terms of percent similarity and percent identity, schistosome TCTP proteins share slightly more similarity with mammalian TCTP proteins (38% identity and 61% similarity) than filarial TCTPs (27% identity and 52% similarity). Immunoblot analysis showed that rSmTCTP antisera did not recognize filarial TCTP proteins (data not shown), indicating that there is no immunological cross-reactivity between filarial and schistosome TCTPs. This probably indicates that SmTCTP has evolved independently. The phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1B) also suggests that the schistosome TCTP is well separated from filarial TCTPs. Another striking feature is that the signature sequence 2 is not conserved in SmTCTP and shows only 63% similarity with other TCTPs. All known TCTP proteins, (includingS. japonicum TCTP) have a region with 100% similarity to signature sequence 2, except the TCTP homologue reported from the metazoan hydra (6Yan L. Fei K. Bridge D. Sarras M. Dev. Genes Evol. 2000; 210: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hydra TCTP showed 86% similarity with signature sequence 2, with a substitution of threonine for glycine at position 9. In S. mansoni, amino acid positions 3, 5, 7, and 13 are substituted with methionine, proline, serine, and isoleucine, respectively, for isoleucine, glutamic acid, methionine, and valine. Interestingly, proline can introduce bends in the α-helix, potentially causing structural changes to the SmTCTP molecule. This may explain the lack of cross-reactivity between filarial TCTPs and SmTCTP. Nevertheless, the functional significance of signature sequences in any of the TCTP proteins has not been established yet. Calcium-binding studies using radioactive calcium showed that SmTCTP binds calcium in a manner similar to filarial and other TCTP proteins. Previously Ram et al. (17Ram D. Romano B. Schechter I. Parasitology. 1994; 108: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) described several calcium-binding proteins in S. mansoni having different molecular sizes (20, 19, 16, and 8 kDa). These proteins, especially the 20-kDa antigen, possess the four EF-hand motifs for calcium binding and show significant homology with other members of the calcium-binding family of proteins such as calmodulin, troponin C, and light-chain myosin. The 20-kDa antigen appears to be expressed in schistosomula and adult worms but not in the egg stages (17Ram D. Romano B. Schechter I. Parasitology. 1994; 108: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Another 58-kDa calcium-binding protein of S. mansoni, the calreticulin, is expressed in all life cycle stages of the parasite including cercariae, adult worm, and eggs (18Khalife J. Liu J.L. Pierce R. Porchet E. Godin C. Capron A. Parasitology. 1994; 108: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SmTCTP appears to be significantly different from all of these calcium-binding proteins of S. mansoni in the absence of any sequence homology either with them or with other members of the calcium-binding family of proteins and in the absence of any EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. These findings therefore suggest that SmTCTP is a novel calcium-binding protein. Analysis of various life-cycle stages of S. mansoni for the expression of SmTCTP showed that although transcripts for SmTCTP are present in all life-cycle stages, only those stages that are present in the vertebrate host (schistosomula and adults) express high levels of SmTCTP (Fig. 4). A recent study by Niak et al.(19Niak C.H., Su, K.W. Ko R.C. Parasitology. 2001; 123: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that heat induction increases TCTP expression in the infective stage of Trichenella spiralis by 5.7-fold more than in the uninduced parasite. Therefore, it is possible that entry of the schistosomula stages from a cold-blooded snail vector to a warm-blooded host might have triggered the higher expression of SmTCTP. Other parasites are also known to express TCTP differentially (5Bhisutthibhan J. Pan X. Hossler P. Walker D. Yowell C. Carlton J. Dame J. Meshnick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16192-16198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Longitudinal screening of sera for antibodies against SmTCTP in infected mice showed that antibodies to rSmTCTP appear in the sera of infected mice only around 9 weeks after infection. This time period coincides with the initiation of egg-induced granulomatous pathology in this infection. Therefore, it is possible that SmTCTP expressed in the adult/egg stages of the parasite may have potential significance in the pathology associated with this infection. Sequence analysis of SmTCTP showed that it lacks leader sequences. Yet, significant amounts of SmTCTP were present in the ES of schistosomula (Fig. 4). MacDonald et al. (20MacDonald S. Rafnar T. Langdon J. Lichtenstein L. Science. 1995; 269: 688-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) have also showed that human TCTP are secretory proteins despite the lack of signal sequence. Similar observations were made previously with filarial TCTPs (10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), P. falciparum TCTP (21MacDonald S.M. Bhisutthibhan J. Shapiro T.A. Rogerson S.J. Taylor T.E. Tembo M. Langdon J.M. Meshnick S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10829-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and mouse TCTP (22Teshima S. Rokutan K. Nikawa T. Kishi K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6356-6366PubMed Google Scholar). Neither the mechanism of SmTCTP secretion nor its functional significance in host-parasite interaction is fully understood at this time. Given its partial homology with host TCTP it is possible that SmTCTP may play an important role in host modulation similar to the malarial TCTP (21MacDonald S.M. Bhisutthibhan J. Shapiro T.A. Rogerson S.J. Taylor T.E. Tembo M. Langdon J.M. Meshnick S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10829-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Another interesting finding was the ability of SmTCTP to induce histamine release from a rat basophilic cell line in a dose-dependent manner. TCTPs from other parasites are also known to possess histamine-releasing function (10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21MacDonald S.M. Bhisutthibhan J. Shapiro T.A. Rogerson S.J. Taylor T.E. Tembo M. Langdon J.M. Meshnick S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10829-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Numerous earlier studies, in experimental animals and in patients with acute or chronic schistosomiasis, have reported the release of histamine during infections with S. mansoni (23Schoenbechler M.J. Sadun E.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1968; 127: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24El-Din A.H. Peters S.M. Attia W.M. Liu W.J. Ali M.K. Bellanti J.A. Ann. Allergy. 1983; 50: 190-194PubMed Google Scholar, 25Harris W.G. Immunology. 1973; 24: 567-577PubMed Google Scholar, 26Catto B.A. Lewis F.A. Ottesen E.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1980; 29: 886-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27el-Hawey A.M. Selim A.S. Mousa A.H. J. Egypt Med. Assoc. 1970; 53: 530-537PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that these histamine-releasing effects during infection may be due to the release of SmTCTP by the parasites in infected individuals. Recently, using a glass microfiber histamine release assay, it has been shown that whole worm antigen homogenate and soluble egg antigens of S. mansoni can induce histamine release from basophils that are passively sensitized with sera from individuals with schistosomiasis (28Satti M.Z. Ebbesen F. Vennervald B. Lind P. Ghalib H. Sulaiman S. Daffalla A. Skov P.S. Trop. Med. Int. Health. 1996; 1: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Similarly, soluble egg antigens of S. mansoni have been shown to induce release of histamine and interleukin-4 from human basophils in a dose-dependent manner (29Falcone F.H. Dahinden C.A. Gibbs B.F. Noll T. Amon U. Hebestreit H. Abrahamsen O. Klaucke J. Schlaak M. Haas H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Despite all of these observations, there has been no report to date on the identification of a histamine-releasing antigen from S. mansoni. SmTCTP is probably the first fully characterized histamine-releasing recombinant antigen of S. mansoni. Histamine release has also been demonstrated routinely in cell cultures within 1 h after incubation with antigens from adult, egg, or cercarial stages of S. mansoni. This histamine release, which occurs in an antigen-specific fashion, is thought to account for the specific suppression of lymphocyte responsiveness to parasite antigens (30Hofstetter M. Fasano M.B. Ottesen E.A. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1376-1380PubMed Google Scholar). Because SmTCTP is one of the major antigens of S. mansoni that can induce release of histamine into the microenvironment around the parasite, it is possible that SmTCTP has the potential of regulating host immune responses as well. This conclusion is supported by the previous findings that immunoregulation of egg-induced granulomas in S. mansoni infection is mediated by histamine (H2) receptor bearing granuloma lymphocytes (31Weinstock J.V. Chensue S.W. Boros D.L. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 423-427PubMed Google Scholar,32Barsoum I.S. Dahawi H.S. Gamil F.M. Habib M., El Alamy M.A. Colley D.G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1576-1580PubMed Google Scholar). SmTCTP has significant sequence homology with human TCTP, also designated as human histamine-releasing factor (9Schroeder J.T. Lichtenstein L.M. MacDonald S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies from Susan Macdonald's laboratory (16MacDonald S. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggested that histamine-releasing factor might exert its histamine-releasing activity independently of IgE and FcεR1 suggesting that it may have a unique receptor on the surface of basophils. Our studies show that rSmTCTP also induces its histamine-releasing function independent of IgE. Previous studies by Catto et al. (26Catto B.A. Lewis F.A. Ottesen E.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1980; 29: 886-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that cercariae of S. mansoni produce a mast cell-triggering factor that can release histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. They also note that this activation occurs in the absence of serum and does not require adherence of cercariae to mast cells. It is possible that the factor described by Catto et al. (26Catto B.A. Lewis F.A. Ottesen E.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1980; 29: 886-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could likely be SmTCTP. It is believed that histamine and possibly other vasoactive amines released in the skin during infection can cause vasodilation, which facilitates easy migration of the parasite into the blood vessels (33Gerken S.E. Mota-Santos T.A. Vaz N.M. Correa-Oliveira R. Dias-da-Silva W. Gazzinelli G. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1984; 17: 301-307PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, secretion of SmTCTP by skin-migrating schistosomula may be a survival strategy of the parasite. The present study also shows that rSmTCTP can induce eosinophil infiltration in a manner similar to the filarial TCTPs (10Gnanasekar M. Rao K. Chen L. Narayanan R. Geetha M. Scott A. Ramaswamy K. Kaliraj P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this findings also support recent report that histamine-releasing factors are chemotactic for eosinophils (34Bheekha-Escura R. MacGlashan D. Langdon J. MacDonald S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eosinophil infiltration around schistosomula and egg stages of the parasite has long been demonstrated (35Sabin E.A. Kopf M.A. Pearce E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Capron M. Capron A. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1992; 87: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Lichtenberg F. Sher A. Gibbons N. Doughty B.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1976; 84: 479-500PubMed Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the accumulation of eosinophils around the parasite (38Owhashi M. Maruyama H. Nawa Y. Int. J. Parasitol. 1996; 26: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 39Horii Y. Owhashi M. Ishii A. Parasitol. Res. 1990; 76: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates another possible mechanism by which eosinophils are recruited around the parasite. Because SmTCTP can induce eosinophilia and release histamine from mast cells/basophils, it is highly probable that SmTCTP play an important role in the development of allergic inflammation associated with schistosomiasis mansoni. Exogenously added histamines are known to increase the neuromuscular activity of schistosomes (40Ercoli N. Payares G. Nunez D. Exp. Parasitol. 1985; 59: 204-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) possibly by binding to a 65-kDa G protein-coupled histamine receptor expressed on the surface of S. mansoni (41Hamdan F.F. Abramovitz M. Mousa A. Xie J. Durocher Y. Ribeiro P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because SmTCTP can induce release of histamine, the above findings might suggest an important physiological function for SmTCTP in the regulation of motor activity of the worm. Similarly, Bhisutthibhan et al. (5Bhisutthibhan J. Pan X. Hossler P. Walker D. Yowell C. Carlton J. Dame J. Meshnick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16192-16198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that malarial TCTPs are targets for the anti-malarial drug artimisinin. Because, artimisinin derivatives are also highly effective against schistosomiasis (42Shuhua X. Tanner M. N′Goran E.K. Utzinger J. Chollet J. Bergquist R. Minggang C. Jiang Z. Acta Trop. 2002; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the target for artimisinin derivatives in schistosomes could be SmTCTP. Thus, SmTCTP is an interesting molecule that may play a crucial role in the development of pathology and/or survival of the parasite in the host. Developing drugs or intervention that specifically target SmTCTP may potentially help in the control of pathology and/or infection due to S. mansoni.

The carboxyl terminus of each ENaC subunit contains a PPXY motif that is believed to be important for interaction with the WW domains of the ubiquitin-protein ligases, Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. Disruption of this interaction, as in Liddle's syndrome where mutations delete or alter the PPXY motif of either the β or γ subunits, has been shown to result in increased ENaC activity and arterial hypertension. Here we present evidence that N4WBP5A, a novel Nedd4/Nedd4-2-binding protein, is a potential regulator of ENaC. In Xenopus laevisoocytes N4WBP5A increases surface expression of ENaC by reducing the rate of ENaC retrieval. We further demonstrate that N4WBP5A prevents sodium feedback inhibition of ENaC possibly by interfering with the xNedd4-2-mediated regulation of ENaC. As N4WBP5A binds Nedd4/Nedd4-2 via PPXY motif/WW domain interactions and appears to be associated with specific intracellular vesicles, we propose that N4WBP5A functions by regulating Nedd4/Nedd4-2 availability and trafficking.

Therefore, mutating just one PY motif from a single subunit of the multimeric ENaC complex is sufficient to lead to a disease phenotype. Studies in the Xenopus oocyte system show that the mutations in ENaC subunits, similar to those that cause Liddle's syndrome, result in increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (5Hansson J.H.

The PY motifs in the carboxyl termini of ENaC subunits have been shown to interact with the WW domains of the two highly related ubiquitin-protein ligases, Nedd4 and Nedd4-2/KIAA0439, that are known to be expressed in a number of different tissues (13Kumar S.

Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 have been proposed to down-regulate Na+ channel activity in response to increases in intracellular Na+ by ubiquitinating the channel, leading to its endocytosis and degradation (17Harvey K.F.

Therefore, Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are key negative regulators of ENaC, and a disruption of this regulation is the most likely cause of Liddle's syndrome. Nedd4 consists of a HECT type of ubiquitin-protein ligase domain, 3–4 WW domains, and a Ca2+ and lipid binding domain (13Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 14Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A.

Nedd4-2 also contains a ubiquitin-protein ligase domain and 4 WW domains but lacks a Ca2+ and lipid binding domain (19Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The WW domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are required for substrate binding, whereas the ubiquitin-protein ligase domain is required for ubiquitination of substrates such as ENaC (26Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 have been cloned from mammals, but so far only Nedd4-2 has been found to be present in Xenopus (13Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 14Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A.

DNA Seq. 1998; 9: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). With the view of identifying additional substrates for Nedd4, we previously carried out a far Western screen using the WW domains of Nedd4 as a probe (28Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). By using this approach we identified a number of PY motif-containing proteins that interact with the WW domains of Nedd4. One of these, N4WBP5, is a novel Golgi-associated protein containing two PY motifs in the amino-terminal domain and three putative transmembrane domains in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein (29Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A closely related protein identified in data base searches, which we have named N4WBP5A, also contains two PY motifs and the three transmembrane domains. We show here that, similar to N4WBP5, N4WBP5A binds to Nedd4. Because Nedd4 is implicated in ENaC control, we were interested to test whether N4WBP5A has a role in Nedd4-mediated ENaC regulation. We report that N4WBP5A is highly expressed in collecting duct cells of the kidney and other tissues that express ENaC. We show that N4WBP5A interacts with Nedd4-2, in addition to Nedd4, and this interaction is mediated via PY motif/WW domain interactions. Most importantly, we demonstrate that inXenopus oocytes, N4WBP5A has the ability to enhance ENaC surface expression by interfering with the Nedd4/Nedd4-2-mediated regulation of ENaC. Hydropathicity (Kyte and Doolittle) of the N4WBP5A protein was estimated using the Protscale Software at ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (SIB), and transmembrane (TM) domains were predicted using the TMHMM version 2.0 software (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Denmark). The coding region of N4WBP5A was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR, with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag, and cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3-N4WBP5A-FLAG. The generation of pCXN2-Nedd4 has been described previously (29Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-Nedd4-2-FLAG was generated by PCR amplification of the mouse Nedd4-2 open reading frame with a FLAG tag engineered at the amino terminus and cloning into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). PCR mutagenesis was used to create N4WBP5A-PY by altering tyrosine residues 56 and 82 to alanine. The N4WBP5A-GST bacterial expression construct was generated by PCR amplification of the N4WBP5A cDNA encoding the amino-terminal 135 residues, lacking the initiation methionine, and cloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) such that the N4WBP5A sequence was fused to the carboxyl-terminal of GST. The Nedd4-2-GST bacterial expression construct was generated by PCR amplification of a region of Nedd4-2, residues 110–226, located between WW domains 1 and 2 and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK such that the Nedd4-2 sequence was fused to the carboxyl terminus of GST. Mouse Nedd4-2 single WW domain-GST constructs were generated by PCR amplification of each WW domain followed by cloning into either theEcoRI or BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). PCR mutagenesis was used to mutate each WW domain such that the second conserved tryptophan was altered to phenylalanine and the conserved proline altered to alanine. The expression construct containing all four WW domains fused to GST was generated by PCR amplification and cloning into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2TK. The three subunits of wild-type rat ENaC (rENaC) (30Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) or of βR564X rENaC (9Schild L., Lu, Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pSD5 vector (gifts from Professor Bernard C. Rossier and Professor Laurent Schild, Lausanne, Switzerland). For αβγrENaC, hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes were inserted according to the FLAG epitope placement into the rat ENaC sequence (7Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). HA-tagged ENaC cDNAs were subcloned into the pGEMHE vector (kindly provided by Dr. Blanche Schwappach, Heidelberg, Germany). N4WBP5A, N4WBP5, and Nedd4-2 were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange XL protocol (Stratagene, TX) to engineer N4WBP5AD108X. Capped mRNAs were synthesizedin vitro by using the T7 or SP6 mMESSAGEmMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as described previously (17Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The purified N4WBP5A-GST and Nedd4-2-GST fusion proteins were used to inoculate two rabbits each (0.5 mg of protein/rabbit). Rabbits were boosted three times at 3-week intervals with 0.5 mg of protein/boost/rabbit. Sera were collected and tested on recombinant protein. The polyclonal antisera were passed through columns of GST coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4 (AmershamBiosciences) to remove GST-specific antibodies. Flow-through from this step was affinity-purified against N4WBP5A-GST or Nedd4-2-GST coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4. Bound proteins were eluted into Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) and dialyzed against PBS. Affinity-purified antibodies were diluted in 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. A full-length mouse N4WBP5A cDNA was used to probe a multiple tissue Northern (MTN) blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from mouse tissues (CLONTECH). A β-actin cDNA probe (CLONTECH) was used as a loading control probe. M-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, and HEK 293T cells were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For co-transfection of HEK 293T cells 1 μg of each plasmid was used. Immunoprecipitations of HEK 293T cells were carried out the day after transfection, and M-1 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 106 cells/100-mm dish, and immunoprecipitations were carried out when cells reached confluency. Immunoprecipitations were performed by harvesting cells in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), preclearing lysates with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h, incubating lysates overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody (5 μg/ml), and then for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed two times in lysis buffer and once in PBS, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (2 μg/ml, Sigma), anti-Nedd4-2 (0.25 μg/ml), and anti-Nedd4 monoclonal antibody (0.75 μg/ml). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:2000, Amersham Biosciences) were used, and detection of bound antibody was achieved using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Equivalent loadings of purified GST fusion proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels run in duplicate. One gel was stained with Coomassie, whereas the duplicate gel was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). A 32P-labeled N4WBP5A probe was produced by direct labeling of the GST fusion protein with protein kinase A (New England Biolabs). Glutathione beads containing bound fusion protein were incubated with protein kinase A and [32P]ATP in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 12 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed 5 times in PBS, and labeled protein was eluted with glutathione buffer. The membrane was blocked in Hyb 75 (28) and hybridized with the 32P-labeled N4WBP5A protein probe for 4 h at 4 °C in Hyb 75. The membrane was washed three times in Hyb 75 and exposed to x-ray film. Kidneys of 6–8-week-old male Wistar rats (n = 3) were perfusion-fixed, and cryosections were prepared as described previously (31Riccardi D. Hall A.E. Chattopadhyay N., Xu, J.Z. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F611-F622PubMed Google Scholar). Cryosections were brought to room temperature, rehydrated in 1× PBS for 5 min, and then blocked for 30 min with 5% normal goat serum in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The blocking solution was removed, replaced with an affinity-purified rabbit anti-NW4BP5A antibody (or corresponding negative controls, see below) diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA in PBS with 5% normal goat serum added, and the slides incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified box. The slides were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an affinity-purified anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 as secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Europe Inc., Leiden, The Netherlands) diluted in 5% normal goat serum in 1% BSA in PBS. After incubation with the secondary antibodies, all sections were washed and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Negative control experiments were carried out by preincubating the N4WBP5A antiserum with an excess of antigenic peptide, by using the preimmune serum and by omitting the primary antibody. Immunofluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with 20–100× objectives. Images were acquired using a Hamamatsu digital camera and processed using the software package KS300 version 3.0 (Carl Zeiss Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK). Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and injected as described (32Konstas A.-A. Mavrelos D. Korbmacher C. Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 441: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with various cRNA combinations. For each ENaC subunit or Kir1.1a channel, 1 ng of cRNA was used, whereas 20 ng of cRNA were used for N4WBP5A, Nedd4-2, and CFTR. Injected oocytes were routinely kept in “high sodium” modified Barth's saline (88 mmNaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.6 with Tris) containing 2 μm amiloride or alternatively in “low sodium” modified Barth's saline (1 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 60 mmN-methyl-d-glutamine, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.6 with HCl). Unless stated otherwise, oocytes were studied 2 days after injection using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (32Konstas A.-A. Mavrelos D. Korbmacher C. Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 441: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oocytes were routinely clamped at a holding potential of −60 mV. The amiloride-sensitive current (ΔIami) was determined by subtracting the corresponding current value measured in the presence of 2 μm amiloride from that measured prior to the application of amiloride in a NaCl solution (in mm: 95 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris). Data are given as mean values ± S.E.; n indicates the number of oocytes; Nindicates the number of different batches of oocytes used; significance was evaluated by the appropriate version of Student's ttest. Experiments were essentially performed as described recently (33Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) using rat monoclonal anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or mouse anti-FLAG M2 as primary antibodies (1 μg/ml). Peroxidase-conjugated affinity purified F(ab)2 fragment goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon) were used as secondary antibodies (2 μg/ml). Chemiluminescence of individual oocytes placed in 50 μl of Power Signal ELISA solution (Pierce) was quantified in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA) by integrating the signal over a period of 15 s. Results are given in relative light units (RLU). Proteins from homogenized oocytes were separated by SDS electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% milk powder and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. For the detection of ENaC-HA, primary rat-anti-HA monoclonal antibody (100 ng/ml) and secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (160 ng/ml) were used. For the detection of N4WBP5A, affinity-purified antisera to N4WBP5A (250 ng/ml) and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (1:2000, Amersham Biosciences) were used. For the detection of FLAG-tagged N4WBP5A and N4WBP5, mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1 μg/ml) and peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (200 ng/ml) were used. Nitrocellulose filters were incubated in primary antibody for 3 h and in the secondary antibody for 90 min at 20 °C. Washes were in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Detection was performed with the enhanced luminol reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). N4WBP5A (GenBankTM accession number AAL05872) was identified in the GenBankTM data base as a protein highly homologous to N4WBP5. N4WBP5A contains two PY motifs in the amino-terminal half of the protein, and three potential transmembrane domains in the carboxyl-terminal region (Fig.1, A and B). Both mouse and human homologues of N4WBP5A are present in the data base and share >90% identity with each other. Northern blot analysis of RNA derived from mouse tissues suggested that N4WBP5A has two transcripts of 2.4 and 2.1 kb in most tissues (Fig.1C). In testis, a smaller transcript of 1.3 kb was also detected. N4WBP5A expression was highest in the brain, liver, kidney, and testis with the 2.1-kb transcript predominating in brain, liver, and kidney. Lower level expression was apparent in heart, lung, spleen, and skeletal muscle (in descending order) (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained using a human multiple tissue expression array, which additionally showed N4WBP5A expression in colon, salivary gland, placenta, and trachea (data not shown). Intrarenal distribution of N4WBP5A was determined using immunofluorescence experiments on paraformaldehyde-fixed rat kidney cryosections. Fig.1D shows that N4WBP5A-specific (i.e. peptide protectable) immunoreactivity is present in distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct cells (upper panel). N4WBP5A can be detected in the cytosol mainly at the basolateral side but also in perinuclear regions and within vesicle-like structures, with a punctate distribution pattern. Outer and inner medullary collecting ducts also exhibit strong intracellular N4WBP5A immunoreactivity (data not shown). Fig. 1D also shows that no N4WBP5A-specific immunofluorescence was detected in the glomeruli, proximal convoluted and proximal straight tubules, thin descending and ascending limbs, and in the parietal Bowman's epithelium. No significant fluorescence can be observed in sections incubated with peptide-absorbed antiserum (Fig.1D, lower panel) when the preimmune serum was used and when the primary antibody was omitted (not shown). Like Nedd4, Nedd4-2, a close relative of Nedd4, has been shown recently (19Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 20Kamynina E. Tauxe C. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F469-F477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Abriel H. Loffing J.

Nedd4-2 contains four WW domains, of which WW3 and WW4 interact with the ENaC subunits (20Kamynina E. Tauxe C. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F469-F477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether N4WBP5A physically interacts with Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK 293T cells ectopically expressing these proteins. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with Nedd4 or Nedd4-2-FLAG and vector or pcDNA3-N4WBP5A-FLAG. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Nedd4ab1 (N4) antibody that cross-reacts with both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 or rabbit preimmune serum, and the blot was probed with anti-FLAG or an anti-Nedd4 monoclonal antibody. Both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 were found to interact with N4WBP5A (Fig. 2A). To determine whether endogenous N4WBP5A and Nedd4/Nedd4-2 interact, immunoprecipitations from the mouse cortical collecting duct cell line M-1 were carried out. M-1 cells are known to endogenously express ENaC (35Letz B. Ackermann A. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Korbmacher C. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By using the Nedd4-2 antibody, but not preimmune serum from the same animal, both Nedd4-2 and N4WBP5A were co-immunoprecipitated (Fig.2B, lower panel). Because both antibodies (against Nedd4-2 and against N4WBP5A) were raised in rabbits, it is currently not possible to do co-localization immunocytochemistry using double staining. However, we analyzed N4WBP5A and Nedd4-2 localization in M-1 cells using side by side immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig.2C, Nedd4-2 is localized to the Golgi and throughout the cytoplasm, whereas N4WBP5A appears as punctated staining throughout the cytosol. Thus, both proteins are present in the cytoplasm of M-1 cells with some apparent overlap of the staining consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation data. To"

DHE delivered via methyl-β-cyclodextrin was delivered to both the apical and basolateral membranes and became concentrated in the apical membrane within 1 min. Intracellular DHE was targeted mainly to vesicles of the subapical compartment or apical recycling compartment (SAC/ARC), where it colocalized with fluorescent transferrin and fluorescent analogs of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. In contrast, transport of DHE from the plasma membrane to the trans-Golgi network was found to be very low. Vesicles containing DHE traversed the cells in both directions, but vesicular export of DHE from the SAC/ARC to the plasma membrane domains was low. Disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton disturbed vesicular transport of DHE but not its enrichment in the apical (canalicular) membrane. Transport of DHE to the canalicular membrane after photobleaching was very rapid (t = 1.6 min) and was largely ATP-independent in contrast to enrichment of DHE in the SAC/ARC. Release of DHE from the canalicular membrane was also ATP-independent but slower than the enrichment of sterol in the biliary canaliculus (t = 5.4 min). Canalicular DHE could completely redistribute to the basolateral plasma membrane but could not transfer from one cell to the other cell of an HepG2 couplet. We conclude that sterol shuttles rapidly among the plasma membrane domains and other membrane organelles and that this nonvesicular pathway includes fast transbilayer migration."

https://openalex.org/W1588700422,"The neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) can inhibit inflammatory gene expression in glial cells; however, the mechanisms involved are not clear. In primary astrocytes, NE dose-dependently increased the expression of inhibitory IκBα protein accompanied by an increase in steady state levels of IκBα mRNA. Maximal increases were observed at 30–60 min for the mRNA and at 4 h for protein, and these effects were mediated by NE binding to β-adrenergic receptors. NE activated a 1.3-kilobase IκBα promoter transfected into astrocytes or C6 glioma cells, and this activation was prevented by a β-antagonist and by protein kinase A inhibitors but not by an NFκB inhibitor. NE increased IκBα protein in both the cytosolic and the nuclear fractions, suggesting an increase in nuclear uptake of IκBα. IκBα was detected in the frontal cortex of normal adult rats, and its levels were reduced if central NE levels were depleted by lesion of the locus ceruleus. The reduction of brain IκBα levels was paralleled by increased inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide. These results demonstrate that IκBα expression is regulated by NE at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which could contribute to the observed anti-inflammatory properties of NE in vitro and in vivo.

It has therefore been suggested that intrinsic mechanisms exist that maintain the brain in a refractory state of inflammatory activation. In primary cultures of rat astrocytes, we showed that neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE)1 prevents induction of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) (4Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Feinstein D.L. J.

Similarly, others show that NE reduces glial expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α (6Willis S.A. Nisen P.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar, 7Caggiano A.O. Kraig R.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. J.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1438-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A similar role for NE in regulating inflammatory events in brain is supported by our recent findings that experimental depletion of brain NE levels by chemical lesion of the locus ceruleus (LC) increases the cortical inflammatory responses to injection of aggregated amyloid β (14Heneka M.T. Gavrilyuk V. Dumitrescu-Ozimek L Daeschner J. O'Banion M.K Weinberg G Klockgether T Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that LC neurons are lost in Alzheimer's disease (15Mann D.M. Yates P.O. Hawkes J. Clin. Neuropathol. 1983; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar) and that levels of β2-adrenergic receptor (βARs) are reduced in astrocytes in multiple sclerosis patients (16Zeinstra E. Wilczak N. De Keyser J. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 289: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17De Keyser J. Wilczak N. Leta R. Streetland C. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1628-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that diminished NE levels or perturbations of the NE-signaling system contribute to the neuroinflammation that occurs in these diseases. The mechanism(s) by which NE reduces inflammatory gene expression is not yet well defined. In astrocytes, we found that NE induced protein binding to a 27-bp region of the rat NOS2 promoter, which is located immediately upstream of a NFκB binding site located at bp position −107 to −96 (18Gavrilyuk V. Horvath P. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This 27-bp region contains several potential binding sites for regulatory transcription factors, including CREB and C/EBP, and consistent with this we found that the NE-dependent protein binding to this region was reduced by preincubating nuclear extracts with an antibody to CREB. Those results suggested that the NE-dependent binding of CREB or a closely related protein to this region of the NOS2 promoter suppresses the NFκB-dependent transcriptional activity. However, the means by which transcription factor binding to the 27-bp region can attenuate NFκB-dependent transcription occurring downstream, and whether interactions with inhibitory IκB proteins are involved is not yet known. The processes leading to NFκB activation are now well characterized (19May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 20Simeonidis S. Stauber D. Chen G.Y. Hendrickson W.A. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In brief, a heterodimeric NFκB complex is maintained in the cytoplasm due to association with an inhibitory IκB protein. The IκB family of proteins contain ankyrin repeats in their carboxyl termini, which bind to and mask the nuclear localization sequence present in the NFκB subunits. After the appropriate cellular stimulation (by cytokines, UV radiation, infection), activation of protein kinases leads to eventual activation of the IκB kinase complex, which in turn phosphorylates IκB proteins at their amino termini. This modification converts IκB into a substrate for ubiquination and subsequent targeting for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. IκB breakdown or dissociation from NFκB reveals the nuclear localization sequence, allowing for nuclear uptake of active NFκB. In our studies using astrocytes, we found that although NE did not reduce NFκB activation (as assessed by nuclear uptake of the p65 subunit and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay), NE prevented the rapid degradation of IκBα that normally occurs upon incubation with LPS or cytokines (18Gavrilyuk V. Horvath P. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment with NE alone increased basal IκBα protein expression, suggesting that NE might have direct effects on IκBα expression. Although an increase in IκBα levels might be expected to reduce nuclear uptake of NFκB, the fact that IκB proteins can complex with and inhibit NFκB while associated with DNA within the nucleus (21Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the NE-dependent increase of IκBα exerts inhibitory effects while bound to the NOS2 promoter. In the present report, we show that in astrocytes NE alone increases IκBα protein and mRNA levels and increases the activation of the IκBα promoter. As found for suppression of NOS2 by NE, these increases were mediated by binding to βARs and blocked by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors. Increases in IκBα protein levels were found both in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus, consistent with the possibility that IκBα inhibits NOS2 by binding to NFκB on the NOS2 promoter. Finally, we show that in rats in which brain NE levels were depleted (by chemical lesion of the LC), the cortical levels of IκBα are decreased, and the subsequent induction of inflammatory gene expression is increased. Together, these findings provide evidence that NE (most likely acting via increases in cAMP) directly activates IκBα gene expression and provides a working model to help explain how NE restricts inflammatory events in brain. Cell culture reagents (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, antibiotics, and LPS (Salmonella typhimurium) were from Sigma. Fetal calf serum was from Atlanta Biological (Norcross, GA). Human recombinant interleukin 1β (4 × 106 unit/mg) was obtained from the NIH AIDS reagents program. Recombinant rat interferon γ (4 × 106unit/mg) and synthetic oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen. Anti-IκBα (SC-371) rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) antibodies (#4050-05) were from Fisher.Taq polymerase and cDNA reagents were from Promega (Madison, WI) and Invitrogen. A 1.3-kb human IκBα promoter cloned into pGL3 basic (Promega) was a kind gift of Dr. Hector Wong (University of Pittsburgh, PA). C6 glioma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Cells were passaged once a week and used after 3–4 days at which point they were 90–95% confluent. Primary astrocytes were from cerebral cortices of post-natal day 1 Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (22Galea E. Feinstein D.L. Reis D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10945-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Media was changed every 3 days. After 2 weeks of growth in complete media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum) the cultures consisted of 95–98% astrocytes and 2–3% microglia. C6 cells or astrocytes were grown until ∼40% confluent. Cells were transfected with a 1.3-kb fragment of the human IκBα promoter driving luciferase reporter expression with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. C6 cells were cotransfected with pSV2Neo vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), containing the neomycin resistance gene, and after 2 days growth, stable cells were selected by growth in 0.8 mg/ml of antibiotic G418. The LC was chemically lesioned as previously described (14Heneka M.T. Gavrilyuk V. Dumitrescu-Ozimek L Daeschner J. O'Banion M.K Weinberg G Klockgether T Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats received two intraperitoneal injections (1 week apart) of eitherN-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4, 5 mg/kg) dissolved in PBS or PBS alone. Four weeks after the second treatment, brain inflammation was induced as described (23Lacroix S. Feinstein D. Rivest S. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 625-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) by giving animals an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0 or 1 mg/kg), and 24 h later, protein and RNA samples were prepared from frontal cortices. Cells or tissue samples were lysed in 10 volumes of 8 m urea containing protease inhibitors (Sigma) and sonicated briefly. Aliquots were either frozen at −80 °C or mixed with 5× gel sample buffer (0.5% SDS, 200 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol) and boiled for 10 min. Protein samples (10 μg) were separated through 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blocked with PBS containing 5% dry milk for 1 h. Then the membranes were rinsed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 0.2% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody solution was removed, membranes were washed 4 times in PBST, and 0.1 μg/ml peroxidase-labeled goat secondary antibodies was added for 2 h. After 4 washes with PBST, bands were visualized by incubation in enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film. Cells were lysed by addition of CHAPS buffer (10 mm CHAPS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and the plate was frozen at −80 °C, thawed, and shaken on a rotary shaker for 10–15 min at room temperature. Aliquots of cell lysates (10–20 μl) containing equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were placed into wells of an opaque, white 96-well microplate. An equal volume of luciferase substrate (Steady Glo reagent, Promega) was added to all samples, and the luminescence was measured in a microplate luminometer (Rosys-Anthos). Cells were washed in cold PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and protease inhibitors (Sigma). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%, and the lysates were incubated a further 5 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and pellets (nuclear fraction) were mixed with SDS loading buffer and boiled for Western blot analysis. Total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from cells and tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and mRNA levels were estimated by RT-PCR (18Gavrilyuk V. Horvath P. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The primers used for NOS2 detection were 1704F (5′-CTG CAT GGA ACA GTA TAA GGC AAA C-3′), corresponding to bases 1704–1728, and 1933R (5′-CAG ACA GTT TCT GGT CGA TGT CAT GA-3′), complementary to bases 1908–1933 of rat NOS2 cDNA sequence, which yield a 230-bp product. The primers used for IκBα were 299F (5′-CAT GAA GAG AAG ACA CTG ACC ATG GAA-3′) and 627R (5′-TGG ATA GAG GCT AAG TGT AGA CAC G-3′), which yield a 328-bp product. The primers used for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase detection were 796F (5′-GCC AAG TAT GAT GAC ATC AAG AAG) and 1059R (5′-TCC AGG GGT TTC TTA CTC CTT GGA), which yield a 264-bp product. Quantitative estimates of IκBα mRNA levels were obtained by carrying out competitive RT-PCR as previously described (14Heneka M.T. Gavrilyuk V. Dumitrescu-Ozimek L Daeschner J. O'Banion M.K Weinberg G Klockgether T Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gavrilyuk V. Horvath P. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24847-24856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in which a known amount of a smaller (by 50 bp) competitive internal standard is included in the PCR reaction along with the cDNA template. The internal standard contains the same primer binding sites and is amplified with the same efficiency as the IκBα cDNA. Comparison of PCR product band intensities (derived from cDNA and from internal standard) at the end of the reaction allows estimation of the initial starting amount of IκBα cDNA relative to the amount of standard added. PCRs were initiated by a hot start method, and conditions were 35 cycles of denaturation at 93 °C for 15s, annealing at 63 °C for 20s, and extension at 72 °C for 20s followed by 5 min at 72 °C in a Hybaid Thermoreactor (Franklin, MA) controlled by tube temperature. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Band intensities were determined using the Alpha Infotech 2000 imaging system. In some experiments, changes in mRNA levels were also estimated by real time PCR using similar cycling conditions in the presence of SYBR Green (1:10,000 dilution of stock solution from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), carried out in a 20-μl reaction in a Corbett Rotor-Gene (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). Relative mRNA concentrations were calculated from the relative take-off point of the PCR reactions (the point at which fluorescence signal was above background levels) using the manufacturer's software included in the unit. All enzymatic experiments were done at least in triplicate, and means ± S.E. were determined. Statistical significance was assessed by one way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's post hoc tests, and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Incubation of primary rat astrocytes with NE caused a dose-dependent increase in total cellular levels of the IκBα protein (Fig.1A). Increases were observed beginning between 1 and 5 μm NE and were maximal (up to 230% control values) between 25 and 100 μm NE. The increases in protein levels were paralleled by an increase in the steady state levels of the IκBα mRNA (Fig. 1B), with the greatest increase (almost 2-fold control values assessed by competitive RT-PCR) observed between 5 and 25 μm NE. Limited analyses using real time PCR (data not shown) confirmed that induction of IκBα mRNA was maximal at 25 μm NE and that competitive RT-PCR underestimated the actual magnitude of the increase (which was estimated to be up to 9-fold compared with control values by real time PCR). Examination of IκBα protein levels after different incubation times with NE showed that maximal increases occurred after 4 h of incubation, reaching 9–10-fold control values (Fig.2A). In other experiments (not shown) we observed a subsequent gradual decrease in IκBα protein levels occurring after 8 h and returning to control values by 24 h. Increases in IκBα protein levels were detected in both the cytosolic as well as the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2B), suggesting that NE not only increases IκBα expression but also influences its subcellular localization. The effects of NE on IκBα mRNA (Fig. 2C) was also time-dependent, with maximal increases (roughly 2-fold control values) occurring sooner than that seen with proteins, namely between 30 and 60 min of incubation. The IκBα mRNA levels measured after 4 h showed little further decrease over the next 24 h. Similar analyses using real time PCR (not shown) confirmed that maximal induction of IκBα mRNA occurred between 60 and 90 min of incubation, with a maximal increase of ∼7-fold observed. The effect of NE on IκBα protein and mRNA levels were mediated by binding to βARs (Fig. 3), since co-incubation with a βAR antagonist (propranolol) prevented the increase by NE, whereas co-incubation with an αAR antagonist (phenoxybenzamine) had no effect. In addition, the effects of NE were replicated by the βAR agonist isoproterenol. The actions of NE were blocked by co-incubation with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Fig. 3), suggesting that the increased mRNA levels were due to increased IκBα gene transcription and not to increased mRNA stability. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of NE on the activation of a 1.3-kb fragment of the human IκBα promoter (Fig. 4A). As found for IκBα mRNA levels, activation of the IκBα promoter in astrocytes was dose-dependently increased by NE, with significant increases observed at 5 μm and higher. This activation was blocked by actinomycin D or propranolol, not effected by phenoxybenzamine, and increased by incubation with isoproterenol alone (Fig. 4B). The effects of NE were also reduced (by roughly 20%) upon incubation with the selective PKA inhibitor KT5720. These results demonstrate that NE can directly activate IκBα gene transcription, most likely via βAR-dependent increases in cAMP and possibly involving PKA activation. To further explore the mechanisms mediating NE effects, we selected rat C6 glioma cells for stable expression of the IκBα promoter (Fig.5). In these cells, incubation with NE also led to a dose-dependent promoter activation, although the maximal induction was ∼50% over control values (as compared with the roughly 2-fold induction observed in the primary astrocytes). Co-incubation with the PKA inhibitors H89 or KT5720 significantly and potently blocked the activation due to NE, whereas co-incubation with the NFκB inhibitor ZIE had no effect on promoter activation. In the absence of NE, these drugs only slightly reduced the basal activity of the IκBα promoter. Chemical lesion of noradrenergic LC neurons results in diminished cortical NE levels and an increased inflammatory response to Aβ (14Heneka M.T. Gavrilyuk V. Dumitrescu-Ozimek L Daeschner J. O'Banion M.K Weinberg G Klockgether T Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether changes in IκBα could be involved, we examined protein lysates prepared from frontal cortices of control and DSP4-treated rats (Fig. 6A). IκBα was detected at high levels in control animals, and this expression was not appreciably modified at 24 h after peripheral LPS injection. In contrast, IκBα levels in DSP4-treated animals were significantly decreased compared with non-DSP4 treated animals. Furthermore, peripheral LPS injection into those animals resulted in a pronounced increase in IκBα levels, which, due to the presence of an NFκB site within its promoter, is often used as an index of inflammatory gene activation, therefore suggesting an overall greater inflammatory response than what occurred in non-DSP4-treated animals. Glial fibrillary acidic protein levels measured in the same protein samples showed only slight changes due to either DSP4 treatment or LPS injection. The effects of DSP4 treatment on cortical inflammatory response was examined by RT-PCR analysis of cortical mRNA samples (Fig.6B). Measurements of IκBα mRNA were consistent with the results of Western blot analysis and indicate a decrease in basal levels due to DSP4 treatment and a large increase due to LPS injection in the DSP4-treated animals (over 10-fold) compared with no apparent increase in the control animals. The levels of the NOS2 mRNA were low in non-LPS-injected animals, were increased ∼40% by LPS in the control animals, and were increased ∼3–4-fold in the DSP4-treated animals. In control animals, levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were not increased by peripheral LPS, but slightly decreased (to 80% of control values), whereas in DSP4-treated animals, LPS slightly increased glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels (∼30% over control values). These results suggest that NE normally maintains IκBα expression at levels that limit the brain inflammatory response to peripheral LPS injection (or other inflammatory stimuli). We previously showed in primary astrocytes and in C6 cells that incubation with NE partially blocked the rapid decrease in IκBα protein levels that occurs upon incubation with LPS and cytokines (18Gavrilyuk V. Horvath P. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, those results did not address whether NE reduced degradation of pre-existing IκBα or increased de novo synthesis of new IκBα. However, we also observed that NE alone increased IκBα levels versus control cells, suggesting that NE could directly increase IκBα expression, perhaps by increasing transcription and/or translation. In the present study we provide evidence that NE directly increases transcription of the IκBα gene, leading to increased IκBα mRNA levels, and thereby reducing the overall loss of IκBα that occurs upon inflammatory stimulation. These findings provide a molecular mechanism to help explain previous reports which demonstrate that increases in cAMP by β-agonists (24Farmer P. Pugin J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5073-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), LPS induced NOS2 expression that was reduced by treatment with forskolin, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, cholera toxin, or isoproterenol. In these cells NFκB activation (assessed by nuclear uptake of p65 subunit) was also blocked by forskolin, as was the LPS-dependent IκBα degradation. The authors showed that forskolin potentiated the normal increase in IκBα mRNA that occurs after LPS treatment and, furthermore, that forskolin alone increased steady state IκBα mRNA levels. Similarly, in human pancreatic cancer cells, the induction of macrophage colony stimulating factor by interleukin 1α was blocked by increases in cAMP as was activation of NFκB (28Kamthong P.J. Wu M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In these cells, degradation of IκBα was prevented by cAMP, and levels of IκBα mRNA were increased. Because IκBα mRNA stability was not effected, the authors concluded that cAMP increased IκBα gene transcription. In human THP1 monocytic cells (24Farmer P. Pugin J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: 675-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 8 production was inhibited by βAR agonists as was nuclear uptake of NFκB. In these cells, the rapid (by 30 min) loss of IκBα due to LPS was not significantly reduced by βAR agonists, but there was a delayed increase in cytoplasmic IκBα protein levels occurring between 1 and 3 h after treatment with LPS. Importantly, the addition of isoproterenol alone did not increase IκBα protein levels, indicating that the addition of an inflammatory stimuli was needed. By carrying out studies in the presence of LPS together with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, it was found that isoproterenol increased the IκBα protein half-life (from 20 to 60 min). The signaling pathways by which NE, via increases in cAMP, activates IκBα promoter expression are not yet known. The IκBα promoter has been sequenced from several species, and most attention has focused on the presence of three κB and two κB-like sequences that confer NFκB inducibility onto IκBα expression (29Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 30Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the κB1 site at position −63 to −53 as well as the κB-like site at position −34 to −24 are required for induction by inflammatory agents and are, therefore, responsible for autoregulation of NFκB activation since newly synthesized IκBα will rapidly complex with and inactivate NFκB. In several cell types, cAMP has been shown to activate NFκB (31Serkkola E. Hurme M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Muroi M. Suzuki T. Cell. Signal. 1993; 5: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Herring A.C. Koh W.S. Kaminski N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and in previous studies we observed that NE alone could activate a truncated NOS2 promoter which still contained the proximal NFκB binding site (18Gavrilyuk V. Horvath P. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, in those studies NE did not lead to detectable levels of NFκB activation (as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay or by nuclear staining for the p65 subunit), suggesting instead that cAMP-inducible factors were responsible for activation of the NOS2 promoter. However, it remains possible that in the current studies, IκBα induction by NE is due in part to low levels of cAMP-dependent NFκB activation. Additional potential transcription factor binding sites have been identified in the IκBα gene promoter that could confer induction by cAMP, including SP1 and AP2 as well as two potential activating transcription factor-CREB sites and several near consensus C/EBP binding sites (see Fig. 7). Evidence that Sp1-dependent genes can be modulated through cAMP is indicated since Sp1-dependent reporter gene activity and DNA binding of recombinant Sp1 was stimulated by PKA (34Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and cAMP-dependent activation of a phosphodiesterase 5A2 promoter was blocked when the Sp1 binding sequences were specifically mutated (35Lin C.S. Chow S. Lau A., Tu, R. Lue T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, AP-2 dependent gene transcription was activated by cAMP (36Woltje M. Kraus J. Hollt V. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) including that of 2′3′-phosphodiesterase expression in C6 astrocytoma cells (37Gravel M. Gao E. Hervouet-Zeiber C. Parsons V. Braun P.E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1940-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Activation of Sp1 and AP2 sites, alone on in concert with low levels of NFκB activation, could therefore contribute to cAMP-dependent induction of IκBα expression. Whether the potential activating transcription factor-CREB or C/EBP-like sites play a role in NE effects remains to be determined. Alternatively, there is accumulating evidence that IκBα (38DeMeester S.L. Buchman T.G. Qiu Y. Jacob A.K. Dunnigan K. Hotchkiss R.S. Karl I. Cobb J.P. Arch. Surg. 1997; 132: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as well as IκBβ (39Stasiolek M. Gavrilyuk V. Sharp A. Horvath P. Selmaj K. Feinstein D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24847-24856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is a heat shock protein since the IκBα promoter contains near consensus binding sites for the heat shock transcription factor 1 (Ref. 40Wong H.R. Ryan M.A. Menendez I.Y. Wispe J.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and see Fig. 7) and since its expression is increased after the induction of a heat shock response. The ability of NE to induce a heat shock response has been reported several times, although the signaling mechanism is not clear, being reported to be due to activation of αARs (41Meng X. Brown J.M., Ao, L. Banerjee A. Harken A.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 42Chin J.H. Okazaki M., Hu, Z.W. Miller J.W. Hoffman B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2316-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), βARs (43Dragon S. Baumann R. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 280: 870-878Crossref Google Scholar), or increased release of NO (44Nisoli E. Regianini L. Bulbarelli A. Briscini L. Breacale R. Carruba M.O. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, it has been shown that NE can increase expression of small heat shock proteins (45Imura T. Shimohama S. Sato M. Nishikawa H. Madono K. Akaike A. Kimura J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9768-9779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Zhang W.L. Tsuneishi S. Nakamura H. Kobe J. Med. Sci. 2001; 47: 77-95PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that NE increases the astroglial heat shock response, which together with effects on other transcription factors as mentioned above, can cause IκBα gene expression. The means by which increased IκBα can reduce astroglial NOS2 expression is also not fully understood. We have shown using NOS2 promoter constructs, that a 27-bp region located immediately upstream is necessary to confer inhibition by NE, since removal of this area abolished any inhibitor action of NE on NOS2 promoter transcription (18Gavrilyuk V. Horvath P. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because NE did not modify nuclear uptake or DNA binding of NFκB yet increased IκB expression and nuclear localization, we propose that normally, nuclear levels of inhibitory IκB proteins do not form stable complexes with DNA-bound NFκB and, therefore, do not inhibit NFκB-dependent transcription. We suggest that induction of a factor binding to a site located in the 27-bp region by NE stabilizes the association of IκBα with NFκB, resulting in inhibition of transcription (Fig. 8). The ability of nuclear-located IκBα to interact with and inhibit DNA bound NFκB has previously been reported (21Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo relevance of noradrenergic regulation of IκBα expression and, thus, inflammatory gene expression is suggested by observations that the noradrenergic neurons of the LC are damaged or lost in Alzheimer's disease (15Mann D.M. Yates P.O. Hawkes J. Clin. Neuropathol. 1983; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar), leading to a loss (or at least a transient loss) in noradrenergic signaling within projection areas. A possible perturbation in noradrenergic signaling is also implicated in multiple sclerosis, since it has been shown that treatment with βAR agonists (47Chelmicka-Schorr E. Kwasniewski M.N. Thomas B.E. Arnason B.G. J. Neuroimmunol. 1989; 25: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48Wiegmann K. Muthyala S. Kim D.H. Arnason B.G. Chelmicka-Schorr E. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 56: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) can provide protection in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and more recently that the levels of β2ARs in astrocytes were decreased in multiple sclerosis patients as compared with healthy controls (16Zeinstra E. Wilczak N. De Keyser J. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 289: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have recently tested this hypotheses by examining the effects of LC depletion on the inflammatory response to cortical injection of aggregated β-amyloid (14Heneka M.T. Gavrilyuk V. Dumitrescu-Ozimek L Daeschner J. O'Banion M.K Weinberg G Klockgether T Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that both the magnitude as well as the duration of the inflammatory responses measured (NOS2 and interleukin 1β expression) were increased if cortical NE levels were first depleted. In the current study, we show that the same DSP4 treatment led to a dramatic decrease in cortical levels of the IκBα protein, consistent with the idea that NE normally keeps the IκBα gene transcriptionally active. The consequences of having diminished IκBα levels are exemplified by the fact that after peripheral injection of LPS, a well characterized method that has been shown to induce brain inflammatory gene expression (23Lacroix S. Feinstein D. Rivest S. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 625-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the levels of the IκBα protein and mRNA are more strongly increased in the DSP4-treated animals than in the controls. Likewise, in control animals, peripheral LPS induced low levels of the NOS2 mRNA, whereas in DSP4 treated animals the magnitude of NOS2 induction (relative to non-LPS injected animals) was much greater. In summary, our data demonstrate the NE, via activation of βARs, increases in cAMP, and activation of PKA can directly increase IκBα gene expression in astrocytes. Whether the same holds true in other cell types is not clear. Increased IκBα levels can reduce overall levels of NFκB activation either by maintaining NFκB in the cytoplasm or, as we postulate in astrocytes, by binding to NFκB within the nucleus. Our data suggest that certain anti-inflammatory drugs may act in part by counteracting the loss of IκB expression due to perturbation of NE levels or NE-signaling system. In this respect, the findings that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ can increase IκB expression (10Weber C.K. Liptay S. Wirth T.

https://openalex.org/W1982049220,"In susceptible insects, Cry toxin specificity correlates with receptor recognition. In previous work, we characterized an scFv antibody (scFv73) that inhibits binding of Cry1A toxins to cadherin-like receptor. The CDR3 region of scFv73 shared homology with an 8-amino acid epitope (869HITDTNNK876) of the Manduca sexta cadherin-like receptor Bt-R1 (Gomez, I., Oltean, D. I., Gill, S. S., Bravo, A., and Soberón, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 28906–28912). In this work, we show that the previous sequence of scFv73 CDR3 region was obtained from the noncoding DNA strand. However, most importantly, both scFv73 CDR3 amino acid sequences of the coding and noncoding DNA strands have similar binding capabilities to Cry1Ab toxin as Bt-R1869HITDTNNK876 epitope, as demonstrated by the competition of scFv73 with binding to Cry1Ab with synthetic peptides with amino acid sequences corresponding to these regions. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to three exposed loop regions of domain II of Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab toxins, we found that loop 2 synthetic peptide competed with binding of scFv73 to Cry1A toxins in Western blot experiments. Also, loop 2 mutations that affect toxicity of Cry1Ab toxin are affected in scFv73 binding. Toxin overlay assays of Cry1A toxins to M. sexta brush border membrane proteins showed that loop 2 synthetic peptides competed with binding of Cry1A toxins to cadherin-like Bt-R1 receptor. These experiments identified loop 2 in domain II of as the cognate binding partner of Bt-R1869HITDTNNK876. Finally, 10 amino acids from β-6-loop 2 region of Cry1Ab toxin (363SSTLYRRPFNI373) showed hydropathic pattern complementarity to a 10-amino acid region of Bt-R1(865NITIHITDTNN875), suggesting that binding of Cry1A toxins to Bt-R1 is determined by hydropathic complementarity and that the binding epitope of Bt-R1 may be larger than the one identified by amino acid sequence similarity to scFv73. In susceptible insects, Cry toxin specificity correlates with receptor recognition. In previous work, we characterized an scFv antibody (scFv73) that inhibits binding of Cry1A toxins to cadherin-like receptor. The CDR3 region of scFv73 shared homology with an 8-amino acid epitope (869HITDTNNK876) of the Manduca sexta cadherin-like receptor Bt-R1 (Gomez, I., Oltean, D. I., Gill, S.

B. thuringiensis aminopeptidase N brush border membrane vesicles surface plasmon resonance complementary determinant region single-chain variable fragment Bacillus thuringiensis(Bt)1 is an aerobic, spore-forming bacteria that produces crystalline inclusions during the sporulation phase (1Crickmore N.

Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 193-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These inclusions, which are toxic to larvae of several insects orders as well as to other invertebrates, are composed of proteins known as Cry toxins (1Crickmore N. Zeigler D.R. Feitelson J.

Cry proteins are produced as protoxins that are activated by midgut proteases to release the toxin fragment (3Choma C.T. Surewicz W.K. Carey P.R. Pozsgay M. Raynor T. Kaplan H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that Cry toxins exert their pathological effect by forming lytic pores in the membrane of insect midgut epithelial cells (1Crickmore N. Zeigler D.R. Feitelson J. Schnepf E.

In particular, Cry1Aa and Cry3A structures are more similar and have the following characteristics. The N-terminal domain I, a seven-α-helix bundle in which helix α-5 is encircled by the other helices, is the pore-forming domain. Domain II consists of three anti-parallel β-sheets with exposed loop regions, and domain III is a β-sandwich (4Li J. Carroll J. Ellar D.J.

The identification of epitopes involved in Cry toxin-receptor interactions could provide insights into the mechanism of insect specificity and the mode of action of these toxins. Also, this knowledge could offer tools for improving the specificity and toxicity of Cry toxins. Two Cry1A toxin receptors from various lepidopteran insects have been identified as aminopeptidase N (APN) and cadherin-like proteins (Bt-R1, Bt-R175) (10Garczynski S.F. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem.

In Lymantria dispar, besides APN and cadherin-like receptors, a high molecular weight anionic protein (Bt-R270) that binds Cry1A toxins with high affinity was identified (17Valaitis A.P. Jenkins J.L. Lee M.K. Dean D.H. Garner K.J. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 46: 186-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, an on-going debate is whether these are functional receptors leading to toxin pore formation activity. In contrast to APN, expression of the cadherin-like protein from Bombyx mori, Bt-R175, on the surface of Sf9 insect cells made these cells sensitive to Cry1Aa toxin (13Nagamatsu Y. Koike T. Sasaki K. Yoshimoto A. Furukawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Also, a Heliothis virescens population resistant to Cry1Ac toxin contained a mutation in a cadherin-like coding gene (18Gahan L.J. Gould F. Heckel D.G. Science. 2001; 293: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Moreover, in previous work we identified a scFv antibody (scFv73) that inhibited binding of Cry1A toxins to cadherin-like receptors, but not to APN, and reduced the toxicity of Cry1Ab to Manduca sextalarvae. Interestingly the CDR3 region of scFv73 shared homology with an eight-amino acid epitope of M. sexta cadherin-like receptor, Bt-R1, involved in Cry1A interaction (19Gomez I. Oltean D.I. Gill S.S. Bravo A. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Evidence was obtained that showed Cry1A toxin binding to this cadherin epitope facilitates proteolytic cleavage of helix α-1 in domain I and formation of a tetramer oligomer pre-pore that is insertion-competent (20Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Overall, these results suggest that binding to cadherin-like receptor is an important step in the mode of action Cry1A toxins.Site-directed mutagenesis studies of Cry1A toxins revealed that loop α-8, located in the junction of domains I and II, and loop 2 and loop 3 regions of domain II are involved in receptor recognition and toxicity (21Lee M.K.

This site was specific for Cry1Aa toxin since it was not involved in Cry1Ac binding (29Yaoi K. Nakanishi K. Kadotani T. Imamura M. Koizumi N. Iwahana H. Sato R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In cadherin-like receptors, a region located between residues 1245 and 1391 of Bt-R175 was identified as a binding region important for Cry1Aa interaction (13Nagamatsu Y. Koike T. Sasaki K. Yoshimoto A. Furukawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We identified an 8-amino acid epitope in Bt-R1(869HITDTNNK876) and 2 amino acid epitopes inB. mori Bt-R175(873IIDTNNK880 and1296LDETTN1301) involved in binding of Cry1A toxins (19Gomez I. Oltean D.I. Gill S.S. Bravo A. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of receptor interaction it is important to identify the Cry1A cognate binding partner for Bt-R1869HITDTNNK876 epitope.The molecular basis of protein-protein interactions remains largely unknown, although accumulating evidence indicates that proteins can interact through amino acid sequences displaying inverse hydropathic profiles leading to the concept of hydropathic complementarity (30Blalock J.E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One model for interacting complementary structures postulates secondary structures, β-strands and α-helices, in which the hydrophilic surfaces are oriented toward the aqueous phases, whereas hydrophobic surfaces face each other (31Markus G. Trisch G.L. Parthasarathy R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and another model suggests complementary surface contour (32Villain M. Jackson P.L. Manion M.K. Dong W-J., Su, Z. Fassina G. Johnson T.M. Sakai T.T. Krishna N.R. Blalock J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 2676-2685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This concept has been crucial for the molecular recognition theory that proposes that peptides whose sequences are obtained from the noncoding DNA strands likely bind the amino acid sequence of the coding strand since they have inverted hydropathic patterns (30Blalock J.E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Bost K.L. Smith E.M. Blalock J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Life Sci. 1999; 55: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) hydropathic complementarity has been successfully applied to produce biologically active synthetic analogs of receptor binding sites (33Bost K.L.

Immunol. 2000; 37: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Also, hydropathic complementarity has been shown to determine several peptide-antibody interactions (40Boquet D. Déry O. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Couraud J.Y. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, there are few examples of naturally occurring peptides or proteins whose similarity in binding properties is correlated with similar hydropathic patterns.In this work, we demonstrate that the scFv73 CDR3 region interacts with the same epitope in Cry1Ab toxin as the869HITDTNNK876 epitope of Bt-R1. Also, we identified domain II loop 2 of Cry1A toxins as the cognate binding partner of the Bt-R1869HITDTNNK876 epitope. Finally, hydropathic profiles analyses of the loop 2 regions in the toxins and of the cadherin-like receptor Bt-R1 binding epitope revealed that hydropathic complementarity could account for the interaction of Cry1A toxins with their cadherin-like receptors and that the binding epitope in Bt-R1 is likely to include residues865NITIHITDTNN875.DISCUSSIONUnderstanding the molecular basis of Cry toxin specificity will help in the rational design of improved toxin formulations useful in insect pest management. The identification of epitopes involved in Cry toxin-receptor interaction could provide insights into the mechanism of insect specificity and the mode of action of these toxins. In this work we identified loop 2 of domain II of Cry1A toxins as the cognate binding epitope of the M. sexta receptor Bt-R1869HITDTNNK876. This finding highlights the importance of BtR1-Cry1A binding epitope since extensive mutagenesis of loop 2 of Cry1A toxins has shown that this loop region is important for receptor binding and toxicity (22Rajamohan F. Alcantara E. Lee M.K. Chen X.J. Curtiss A. Dean D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rajamohan F. Cotrill J.A. Gould F. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2390-2396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Besides loop 2, loop α-8 and loop 3 of Cry1A toxins are also important for receptor interaction and toxicity (21Lee M.K. Jenkins J.L. You T.H. Curtiss A. Son J.J. Adang M.J. Dean D.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Rajamohan F. Hussain S-R.A. Cotrill J.A. Gould F. Dean D.H. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2000; 38: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Bt-R1epitopes involved in binding loop α-8 and loop 3 regions still remains to be identified. In this work we analyzed the role of the three exposed loop regions of domain II on receptor interaction. The role of loop α-8 on receptor Bt-R1 interaction still remains to be analyzed since mutagenesis of this region has been shown to have an important role on receptor interaction (21Lee M.K. Jenkins J.L. You T.H. Curtiss A. Son J.J. Adang M.J. Dean D.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Loop 2 peptides of Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab toxins competed with binding of both toxins to Bt-R1 in toxin overlay assays (Fig. 5). However, only the peptide corresponding to loop 3 of Cry1Aa but not that of Cry1Ab competed with binding of the corresponding Cry1A toxin to Bt-R1 (Fig. 5). Cry1Aa loop 3 shares no amino acid sequence identity with Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac loop 3 regions (24Rajamohan F. Hussain S-R.A. Cotrill J.A. Gould F. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25220-25226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest that loops 2 and 3 of Cry1Ab and Cry1Aa toxins contribute differentially to the binding of these toxins to Bt-R1, with Cry1Aa loop 3 more important in the interaction with Bt-R1 receptor than Cry1Ab loop 3. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Cry1Ab loop 3 has structural constraints for receptor interaction, therefore explaining the lack of competition by the Cry1Ab loop 3 peptide in Cry1Ab binding to Bt-R1(Fig. 5).CDR3 of scFv73 exhibits similar binding properties as Bt-R1since scFv73 binding to Cry1Ab toxin is affected by loop 2 mutations that also affect Cry1Ab receptor binding (Fig. 3). In addition, by using scFv73 as a surrogate for Bt-R1, we found that binding of Cry1A toxins to this epitope facilitates proteolytic cleavage of helix α-1 of domain I and the formation of a tetramer oligomer pre-pore structure, showing that scFv73 has functional activity similar to that of the natural Bt-R1 receptor (20Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).Prior SPR binding analysis showed the binding of the Cry1Ab loop 2 F371A mutant to APN is barely affected (50Jenkins J.L. Dean D.H. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Press, New York2000: 33-54Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and this mutant has a 2-fold lower affinity for Bt-R1 as judged by binding to scFv73 (Table II, Fig. 4). However, the irreversible binding and toxicity is affected (22Rajamohan F. Alcantara E. Lee M.K. Chen X.J. Curtiss A. Dean D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rajamohan F. Cotrill J.A. Gould F. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2390-2396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, binding to Bt-R1 facilitates proteolytic cleavage of helix α-1 and the formation of a pre-pore structure that is membrane insertion-competent, probably by inducing a conformational change that makes helix α-1 accessible for proteolytic degradation (20Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that binding of Cry1Ab F371A mutant to Bt-R1 does not promote the conformational change that facilitates helix α-1 degradation, thus affecting the formation of the pre-pore structure. This hypothesis could explain the effect of the F371A mutation on irreversible toxin binding since it is postulated that formation of the pre-pore is a prerequisite for membrane insertion (20Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Analysis of pre-pore formation by the Cry1Ab F371A mutant induced by scFv73 binding will enable us to determine whether this step is affected (work in progress).Competition of Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab toxins to APN and Bt-R1 in toxin overlay assays in the presence of loop 2 synthetic peptides showed that loop 2 is important for interaction of the Cry1A toxin to Bt-R1 but not for APN (Fig. 5). These data support the fact that Bt-R1 has an important role in insect toxicity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the APN receptor has a role in Cry1Ab toxicity since several loop 2 point mutations affect both APN binding and toxicity (26Lee M.K. Rajamohan F. Jenkins J.L. Curtiss A. Dean D.H Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 50Jenkins J.L. Dean D.H. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Press, New York2000: 33-54Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fact that some Cry1A loop 2 mutations affect APN binding suggests that a similar binding epitope as BtR1-Cry1A could be present in APN. However, the loop 2 peptides did not compete with Cry1Ab binding to APN. These data are in apparent contradiction. An important methodological difference is that SPR binding studies (26Lee M.K. Rajamohan F. Jenkins J.L. Curtiss A. Dean D.H Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 50Jenkins J.L. Dean D.H. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Press, New York2000: 33-54Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) determined binding of native proteins in contrast to toxin overlay assays, which determine binding to denatured proteins after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Thus, structural differences could account for the lack of competition of loop 2 peptide on Cry1A toxins binding to APN observed in this work.Accumulating evidence indicates that proteins can interact through amino acid sequences displaying inverted hydropathic profiles, implying that amino acid sequences that share low amino acid sequence identity can interact with the same epitopes if they share a similar hydropathic profile (30Blalock J.E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Analysis of hydropathic patterns of Cry1A loop 2 regions and that of BtR1-Cry1A epitope showed that the interaction of these regions is determined by inverse hydropathic patterns (Fig.6). Hydropathic profiles of amino acid sequences of scFv73 CDR3 and BtR1-Cry1A epitope were similar (Fig. 6A) and inverted to a region of Cry1A that corresponds to the end of β-6 and loop 2 (Fig. 6, B and C). If we analyze the hydropathic pattern of the amino acid region adjacent to the Bt-R1-Cry1A epitope, we find an inverse pattern with Cry1Ab region including five residues of β-6 and five residues of loop 2 in both toxins. This analysis predicts that mutations of Cry1A β-6 residues 363SSTLY367 would affect receptor binding and toxicity (work in progress). The Bt-R1 included residues 865NITIHITDTNN875, suggesting that the binding epitope could be larger than the one previously mapped based on amino acid sequence identity with scFv73 CDR3 (19Gomez I. Oltean D.I. Gill S.S. Bravo A. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Using a computer-simulated docking method, we analyzed the binding of a peptide corresponding to Bt-R1864GNITIHITDTNNKVPQAE880 to Cry1Ab. We observed that the binding of this Bt-R1 amino acid sequence to β-6-loop 2 region was favorable in steric and energy-pairing analyses among several other favorable binding possibilities obtained (Fig.7). This result provides support to this region of Bt-R1 interacting with β-6-loop 2 of Cry1A toxins. The inverted hydropathic pattern of Cry1Ab loop 2 sequences with that of Bt-R1-Cry1A was more complementary than that of loop 2 of Cry1Aa (Fig. 6, B and C); these data correlates with a slightly lower affinity of Cry1Aa to Bt-R1 compared with the binding affinities of Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac toxins (51Keeton T.P. Bulla L.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that inverse hydropathic patterns could determine the interaction of loop 2 of Cry1A toxins with Bt-R1 could be used in the rational design of more toxic Cry1A mutant proteins by optimizing the profile of β-6 loop 2 to that of the epitope in the receptor. Mutants with optimized inverted hydropathic patterns are predicted to have improved affinity toward its receptor as has been shown for other examples of interacting proteins (34Blalock J.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).In this study we show that amino acid sequences obtained from the coding and noncoding DNA strands of scFv73 CDR3 bind to loop 2 of Cry1A toxins. The molecular recognition theory predicts that peptides obtained from noncoding DNA strands (anti-peptides) bind to amino acid sequence epitopes of the coding strand (30Blalock J.E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 52Root-Bernstein R. Holswortn D.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 190: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the case of scFv73 CDR3, the amino acid sequence of the noncoding strand has similar binding properties as the coding DNA strand CDR3 amino acid sequence (Fig. 2A). There are other examples of anti-peptides that have similar binding properties as the coded amino acid sequence in the literature (35Dillon P.F. Root-Bernstein R.S. Holsworth D.D. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 51Keeton T.P. Bulla L.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of hydropathic profiles of the coding and noncoding scFv73 CDR3 amino acid sequences revealed that they share a similar hydropathic pattern (Fig. 6A), explaining their ability to interact with the same epitope in the toxin even though they share no sequence identity. The noncoding amino acid sequence of scFv73 CDR3 (RITQTTNR) shares amino acid sequence identity with Bt-R1869HITDTNNK876 epitope (1"

The enzyme was found to be a single-strand-specific exoribonuclease that acts in the 3′ to 5′ direction in a non-processive manner. However, although otherEscherichia coli exoribonucleases stop several nucleotides downstream of an RNA duplex, RNase T can digest RNA up to the first base pair. The presence of a free 3′-hydroxyl group is required for the enzyme to initiate digestion. Studies with RNA homopolymers and a variety of oligoribonucleotides revealed that RNase T displays an unusual base specificity, discriminating against pyrimidine and, particularly, C residues. Although RNase T appears to bind up to 10 nucleotides in its active site, its specificity is defined largely by the last 4 residues. A single 3′-terminal C residue can reduce RNase T action by >100-fold, and 2-terminal C residues essentially stop the enzyme. In vivo, the substrates of RNase T are similar in that they all contain a double-stranded stem followed by a single-stranded 3′ overhang; yet, the action of RNase T on these substrates differs. The substrate specificity described here helps to explain why the different substrates yield different products, and why certain RNA molecules are not substrates at all.

Li Z. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 67-105Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was originally identified as an activity involved in the end-turnover of tRNA (2Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4290-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This process consists of the removal and re-addition of the 3′-terminal AMP and, to a very small extent, the penultimate CMP residues of tRNA. Other studies demonstrated that RNase T also is involved in other aspects of RNA metabolism, including the 3′ maturation of tRNAs (4Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), 5 S and 23 S rRNAs (5Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Y.). 1999; 5: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and other small, stable RNAs (7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although multiple exoribonucleases may contribute to the 3′ maturation of these RNAs, RNase T is often the most efficient (8Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In fact, RNase T is essential for generating the mature 3′-ends of 5 S and 23 S rRNAs (5Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all the RNase T substrates share a common sequence feature, i.e. their 5′- and 3′-ends pair with each other to form a stable, double-stranded (ds)1 stem followed by a few unpaired 3′-nucleotides (7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). 5 S and 23 S rRNAs differ from the other small, stable RNAs in that their mature forms contain only 1 or 2 unpaired 3′ residues, whereas the others contain 4 unpaired residues when matured. Thus, RNase T appears to be the only exoribonuclease that can efficiently remove residues near a stable double-stranded stem. However, what determines the number of unpaired residues remaining after RNase T action is still unknown. In vitro, purified RNase T acts on a variety of tRNA-like substrates (2Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4290-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, the preferred substrate is mature tRNA-CCA, but terminal residues also can be removed from phosphodiesterase-treated tRNA and removed slowly from tRNA-CA and tRNA-CCA-C2–3. In contrast, tRNA-CCp, aminoacyl-tRNA, tRNA-CC, and tRNA-CU are either inactive or extremely poor substrates. Recently, it was found that RNase T could also act as a single strand-specific DNA exonuclease (10Viswanathan M. Dower K.W. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35126-35131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RNase T displays weak sequence specificity with DNA substrates, and it stops at DNA duplex structures leading to the formation of blunt ends. At high levels, RNase T can suppress the UV repair defects of an E. colimutant deficient in other DNA exonucleases, RecJ exonuclease, exonuclease I, and exonuclease VII (12Viswanathan M. Lanjuin A. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 929-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but whether RNase T functions as a DNase in vivo is still not clear. In this study, we examine in detail the substrate specificity of RNase T using synthetic oligonucleotides to mimic various structural and sequence features of natural RNAs. Our data indicate that RNase T action on RNA is single strand-specific and that the enzyme discriminates against the removal of C residues. Although RNase T appears to bind as many as 10 nt of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), its specificity is defined largely by the last four nucleotides. These findings explain many of the properties of RNase T during maturation of stable RNAs, including its closer approach to the ds stems of 5 S and 23 S rRNAs compared with other stable RNAs. Purified E. coli RNase T was prepared as described previously (9Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li Z. Zhan L.

[γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sequagel, used to prepare polyacrylamide-urea gels for single nucleotide resolution analysis, was purchased from National Diagnostics. The T7 Sequenase sequencing kit was from USB Corp. Dideoxy ATP was a product of Invitrogen. RNA homopolymers and A2 dinucleotide were from Sigma Chemical Co. RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon Inc. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA Core Facility of our department. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. To determine the activity of RNase T on oligonucleotide substrates, the RNA oligonucleotides were 5′-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Duplex-containing substrates were prepared by heating mixtures of a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide and its complementary oligonucleotide (molar ratios, ∼1:1.2) to 100 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature to anneal the two strands. RNase T reactions were carried out in mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. For qualitative analysis, oligonucleotide substrates at 25 μm were present in each reaction with either 1× (1.1 ng/μl) or 10× (11 ng/μl) RNase T. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. Reactions were stopped with 2 volumes of loading buffer containing 96% formamide and 1 mm EDTA. Reaction products were resolved on 22.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Quantitative data were obtained using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) to determine the amount of each band present. For kinetic analyses, the amount of RNase T used for each substrate was adjusted so that only 10–20% of the substrate molecules were acted upon. The total release of nucleotide was calculated from the percentage of radioactivity in the bands in each lane. If multiple reaction products were generated, the reaction rate was a weighted summation of all the bands. Thus, for example, if 1, 2, or 3 nt were removed, the corresponding bands would be weighted by multiplying by 1, 2, or 3, respectively. Kinetic constants were calculated using Lineweaver-Burk plots. An oligonucleotide substrate containing a 3′-phosphate terminus (A16P) was prepared by periodate oxidation of A17 in lysine-HCl buffer. A DNA substrate containing a 3′-dideoxy terminus was prepared by primer extension in a typical DNA sequencing reaction using bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase). The template DNA oligonucleotide used was the 22-mer, 5′-TATCCGCGGCTTGCCAGACCGC-3′, and the 5′-32P-labeled primer was the 13-mer DNA oligonucleotide, 5′-32P-GGCAAGCCGCGGA-3′. Only dTTP and ddATP were added for the elongation reaction, so that the fully extended primer product would contain a 3′-dideoxy terminus. In a second experiment, performed at the same time, dATP replaced ddATP to generate a 3′-OH-terminated substrate of the same sequence. The Sequenase-extended products were boiled for 5 min and kept on ice until use. They were used directly in an RNase T assay without further treatment. RNase T is known to play an important role in tRNA end-turnover and 3′ maturation. As a first step to examining the details of RNase T's substrate specificity, we investigated whether oligonucleotide substrates could be used to accurately mimic the enzyme's action on tRNA and on tRNA precursors, thereby simplifying identification of the specificity determinants. The oligonucleotides examined were derived from sequences at the 3′-end of tRNA1Tyr and its precursors. These included the 11-mer, 5′-CCCCACCACCA-3′, the 14-mer, 5′-CCCCACCACCAUCA-3′, and the 17-mer, 5′-CCCCACCACCAUCACUU-3′. These molecules correspond to the mature 3′-end of tRNA1Tyr and to precursors with 3 or 6 extra 3′ residues, respectively. In addition, the 7-mer complementary oligonucleotide, 5′-GGUGGGG-3, was also present in those experiments in which we mimicked the complete acceptor stem of the tRNA and the precursors. The use of these particular substrate analogues allowed comparison with earlier studies of the in vitro and in vivo action of RNase T on tRNA1Tyr and tRNATyrsu3+ (4Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6064-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Fig. 1 (A–C) shows the action of RNase T on oligonucleotides that mimic the aminoacyl stems of mature tRNA1Tyr and of its precursors with 3 or 6 extra 3′ residues. As shown in Fig.1A, RNase T slowly removes a single 3′ terminal A residue from the mature tRNA analogue, but then essentially stops at the –CC sequence, in complete accordance with its action on full-length tRNA molecules (3Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Likewise, RNase T rapidly removes the 3 extra residues following the –CCA sequence in the precursor analogue to first generate an intermediate with 2 extra residues, followed by formation of the mature end, and eventually the −1 product (Fig. 1B). Similar accumulation of the +2 intermediate was observed previously in studies of the maturation of tRNA1Tyrand tRNATyrsu3+ (4Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6064-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase T processing of the precursor analogue with 6 extra residues was considerably slower (Fig. 1C), again in keeping with what was observed earlier with tRNAs (14Li Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6064-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented suggest that synthetic RNA oligonucleotides can serve as useful analogues to mimic RNase T action on tRNA precursors, thereby simplifying studies of its specificity. Single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides are also acted on by RNase T in a manner similar to its action on the duplex-containing substrates (Fig. 1, compareD–F to A–C). However, one major difference observed between the ssRNA and dsRNA substrates was in the digestion of the 11-mer. In the presence of the 7-mer complementary strand (Fig.1A), RNase T action on the 11-mer was significantly slower than when the 11-mer alone was used as substrate (Fig. 1D). Quantitative analysis indicated that the presence of the complementary 7-mer reduced the kcat ∼ 10-fold. These data suggest that proximity to a ds stem may slow RNase T action. It should be noted that even with ssRNA, RNase T does not digest through the CC sequence left at the 3′-end of the 11-mer once the terminal A residue had been removed. Interestingly, RNase T appears to act on the ss and dsRNA substrates in a stepwise manner, with each major intermediate containing a 3′ terminal CC, UC, or CU doublet. The reason for this stepwise phenomenon will be examined in the following sections. Additional evidence for RNase T action on ssRNA comes from studies of RNA homopolymers (see below). RNase T is a major contributor to the final 3′-exonucleolytic trimming during the maturation of most stable RNAs (4Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The deduced secondary structures of these RNAs share a common feature in that their 5′- and 3′-ends pair with each other to form stable, ds stems followed by a few unpaired 3′-nucleotides (6Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To understand how such duplex structures close to the 3′ terminus affect RNase T action, we used the 17-mer RNA oligonucleotide, alone or paired with complementary strands of various lengths, as substrates for RNase T (Fig.2). Inasmuch as the 17-mer RNA oligonucleotide is relatively resistant to RNase T digestion (see Fig.1), a 10-fold higher level of RNase T (molar ratio RNA:RNase T of 50:1) was used in these analyses so that differences could be observed more readily. Under these assay conditions the 17-mer ssRNA is digested quickly in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 2A). As noted above, each intermediate accumulating during the digestion process is one with either a terminal CC, UC, or CU sequence, suggesting that RNase T has difficulty in removing such sequences. As shown in Fig. 2 (B–D), addition of complementary oligonucleotides dramatically affects RNase T action. Thus, formation of a 7-base pair (bp) duplex leads to accumulation of the 10-nt intermediate, whereas less of the 7-nt intermediate is generated compared with ssRNA (Fig. 2B). Extending the duplex length to 9 bp (Fig. 2C) further stabilizes the 10-nt intermediate, and, at the same time, 11- and 12-nt intermediates accumulate to a higher level, supporting the conclusion that RNase T action slows down as it gets close to a double-stranded stem. Finally, when a completely double-stranded 17-mer is used as substrate (Fig. 2D), RNase T action essentially ceases. The very slow removal of a single nucleotide from this substrate is probably due to the presence of two AU base pairs at the 3′-end, which may lead to some terminal “breathing.” These observations indicate that RNase T is a single strand-specific exoribonuclease that can act only on the single-stranded portion at the 3′-end of an RNA substrate. The presence of a stable RNA duplex also will slow RNase T action as the duplex is approached. During its action on the substrates examined in Figs. 1 and 2, RNase T seemed to slow down at certain nucleotide sequences. However, this stepwise digestion was not observed when RNA homopolymers were used as substrates (Fig.3). Rather, in its action on homopolymers, RNase T generated a ladder of products with a random distribution, indicating that RNase T action is non-processive. Given sufficient enzyme and time, RNase T can digest ssRNA to dinucleotides, and even mononucleotides, although the final step from dinucleotide to mononucleotide proceeds extremely slowly (see below). To determine the effects of substrate length on RNase T action, a series of RNA homopolymers, A2, A4, A6, A8, A10, and A17, were evaluated as substrates. Based on theKm measurements shown in Table I, length does not appear to be a factor affecting RNase T action once a substrate is at least 10 nt long. However, for oligonucleotides shorter than about 10 nt, RNase T action displays considerable sequence length dependence. TheKm values increase gradually from ∼20 μm for a substrate 10 nt or longer to about 150 μm for the tetranucleotide, A4. These data suggest that RNase T has an extended RNA-binding site that can interact with as many as 10 nt of a ssRNA segment. Likewise, below 6 nt there is a dramatic effect on the kcat of the reaction. The dinucleotide, A2, is a particularly poor substrate with aKm of ∼1 mm and akcat only about 2% that of the longer substrates. These data explain why digestion of oligonucleotides essentially stops at the dinucleotide level.Table IKinetic constants for RNase T action on homopolymer substratesOligonucleotideKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin−1A2∼1000∼40∼0.04A415011807.9A664211033A850195039A1025129052A1721200095U173568019C1770630.90 Open table in a new tab In contrast to DNA substrates, on which RNase T action shows very little base specificity (11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), RNase T action on RNA substrates is strongly influenced by the nucleotide to be removed. Thus, although A17 could be completely converted to A2 over a period of 30 min (Fig. 3A), 10 times as much RNase T was required to shorten U17 to a dinucleotide in the same period of time (Fig. 3, C and D). RNase T action on C17 was even slower; this substrate could only be partially shortened even after 90 min of treatment in the presence of the high level of RNase T (Fig. 3B). Kinetic analyses (Table I) showed that, for the 17-nt homopolymers, A17 (kcat ∼ 2000 min−1) is a much better substrate than either U17 (kcat ∼ 700 min−1) or C17 (kcat ∼ 60 min−1). kcat/Kmvalues for these substrates differ by as much as 100-fold. Poly(G) homopolymers were not included in this analysis, because they tend to form complicated structures that interfere with both RNase T action and with the electrophoretic procedure. However, qualitative analyses with other G-containing oligonucleotides (e.g. the complementary 7-mer, GGUGGGG, used above) suggested that the rate of RNase T action on G residues may be similar to that on A residues (data not shown). These data show that RNase T displays base specificity strongly favoring the removal of purine nucleotides over pyrimidine nucleotides. This strong base specificity probably accounts for the stepwise digestion described above in RNase T action on certain substrates (Figs. 1 and 2). The action of RNase T on the homopolymer substrates demonstrated that the enzyme is strongly affected by the nucleotides present in a single-stranded RNA substrate. To examine this phenomenon in more detail, a variety of single and multiple nucleotide substitutions were made in the 11-mer and 14-mer substrates studied in Fig. 1 (B and C), and these new oligonucleotides were evaluated both for their ability to be shortened by RNase T and for the intermediates that accumulated during the digestion. Based on a large number of experiments of this type (data not shown), it appeared that the ability of RNase T to digest a single-stranded RNA substrate was determined almost exclusively by the actual sequence of the four 3′-terminal residues and not just the base composition of the substrate. A hint of the importance of the 3′-terminal sequence was already suggested by the stepwise digestions shown in Figs. 1 and 2, which indicated that RNase T has difficulty removing pyrimidine doublets. Consequently, to systematically examine the importance of the sequence of the four 3′-terminal residues, a series of RNA tetranucleotides, containing only A and/or C residues, were prepared that were evaluated for their ability to act as substrates of RNase T. The data in Fig.4 and Table II show profound differences among the various tetranucleotides tested, even ones with identical base compositions. Interestingly, the most effective substrate is CCAA, whereas another with the same base composition, AACC, is the poorest. The two substrates differ inkcat/Km values by a factor of 104. Digestion of the various substrates (Fig. 4) conforms with the previous observations that RNase T action essentially ceases at –CC sequences. Thus, AACC and CCCC are relatively inactive as substrates (Fig. 4, C and F); a single terminal A residue is efficiently removed from ACCA and CCCA, at which point digestion stops (Fig. 4, B and E); and two A residues are removed from AAAA and CCAA (Fig. 4, A and D).Table IIKinetic constants for RNase T action on tetranucleotide substratesOligonucleotideKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin−1AAAA15011807.9ACCA1246104.9AACC4252.2<0.01CCAA323370105CCCA13811008.0CCCC245120.05 Open table in a new tab Based on these studies with tetranucleotides, it appears that RNase T action strongly disfavors C residues in the two 3′-terminal positions, especially the last one. A single substitution of C for A at the last residue of the 3′-terminus (CCCC compared with CCCA) leads to over a 100-fold reduction inkcat/Km. In the penultimate position (CCCA compared with CCAA), an A to C change reducedkcat/Km only about 10-fold. Surprisingly, RNase T seems to favor C residues at the −3 and −4 position of the RNA substrate. Thus, CCAA is a much better substrate than AAAA, and even CCCC is a more effective substrate than AACC (Table II). These data demonstrate that the four terminal residues combine to define RNase T substrate specificity. Although the studies with RNA homopolymers suggested that RNase T might bind up to about 10 nt of the substrate, the data suggest that residues beyond the last four seem to contribute only to the stability of binding, not to the specificity. Previous data showed that RNase T is also a potent, single-strand-specific DNA exonuclease (11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that the 2′-OH group may have some negative effects on substrate binding, because RNA substrates normally display much higher Km values than do DNA substrates (11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the 3′-OH group has any effect on RNase T activity, we constructed an RNA substrate with a 3′-PO4 terminus and a DNA substrate with a dideoxy terminus. It was already known that RNase T does not act on tRNA-CCp, a 3′-phosphate-containing macromolecular substrate (2Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4290-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To confirm that this lack of action on a 3′-phosphate-terminated molecule was not due to tRNA structure, the oligonucleotide, A16P, was tested as an RNase T substrate. As shown in Fig.5A, using the same assay conditions, A17 was almost completely digested to the dinucleotide after about 2 min of RNase T treatment, whereas A16P was completely inactive, even after 30 min. These data indicate that the presence of a 3′-phosphate protects against RNase T action. In a second experiment, RNase T activity on a DNA substrate containing a 3′-dideoxy terminus was compared with its action on a 3′-OH-containing substrate of the same sequence. As shown in Fig.5B, after 2 min of RNase T treatment, the original DNA substrate with a 3′-OH terminus was completely removed. However, the substrate with the dideoxy terminus was quite stable, even after 30 min of RNase T treatment. These data suggest that a free 3′-OH group is necessary for RNase T action. In this report we used synthetic RNA oligonucleotides to study in detail the substrate specificity of RNase T. Our data show that RNase T is a single strand-specific exoribonuclease that digests non-processively in a 3′ to 5′ direction. The enzyme slows as it approaches a duplex structure, and it stops completely at the RNA duplex itself. Most interestingly, RNase T action on ssRNA is sequence-specific, and this sequence-specificity is determined largely by the last four nucleotides at the 3′ terminus. If we define the subsites on the enzyme at which these last 4 residues bind as subsites 1–4, then subsites 1 and 2 strongly favor an A residue over a C residue for RNase T cleavage, whereas C residues are favored at subsites 3 and 4. Of these four positions, the one binding the 3′-terminal residue shows the most dramatic effect. Thus, a single A to C change at the 3′ terminus of an RNA substrate (CCCA to CCCC) makes it greater than 100-fold more resistant to RNase T cleavage. One obvious possibility for this strong discrimination against a terminal C residue is that, at the catalytic center of RNase T, interactions with a terminal C residue are disfavored. A recent, detailed computational analysis of protein-RNA complexes may explain the basis for this discrimination. In those studies it was found that phenylalanine side chains strongly prefer to make van der Waals contacts with A, U, or G residues, but they do not interact with C residues (16Jones S. Daley D.T. Luscombe N.M. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Based on structural modeling of RNase T using E. coli exonuclease I as the template (17Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar), it is likely that the 3′-terminal base of the RNA substrate is sandwiched between two phenylalanine side chains, those of residues 29 and 77. 2Y. Zuo and M. P. Deutscher, unpublished observations. Moreover, both of these phenylalanine residues are highly conserved in RNase T orthologues. The computational analysis also showed that, in contrast to phenylalanine, tyrosine-base interactions show a similar level of preference for all four bases in RNA (16Jones S. Daley D.T. Luscombe N.M. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Thus, if phenylalanine-RNA interactions are responsible for RNase T substrate specificity, as suggested, mutating residues Phe-29 and Phe-77 to tyrosines should convert RNase T to a more nonspecific ribonuclease. It will be interesting to see whether further work bears out this prediction. In earlier work, it was shown that RNase T also is a DNA exonuclease (10Viswanathan M. Dower K.W. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35126-35131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the major difference in the rate of removal of A and C residues observed when RNA oligonucleotides are the substrates, digestion of DNA oligonucleotides displays much less sequence dependence (11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This difference can be explained based on the preferences of phenylalanine residues for their interactions with nucleic acid bases in various contexts (16Jones S. Daley D.T. Luscombe N.M. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 19Luscombe N.M. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2860-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas there is poor interaction with C residues in RNA molecules, the van der Waals contacts between Phe and A and between Phe and C in ssDNA are essentially the same. These observations support the conclusion that interactions between the 3′-terminal residue of the nucleic acid substrate and phenylalanine side chains in the active site are important determinants of RNase T specificity. The specificity of RNase T in the in vitro reactions goes a long way in explaining the various functions of the enzyme in vivo. Thus, RNase T has not been implicated in either mRNA degradation or in removing long 3′-trailer sequences from RNA precursors. In both of these situations, the probability of encountering multiple pyrimidine residues, and even multiple C residues, is quite high, precluding RNase T from acting effectively on such substrates. On the other hand, RNase T is a major contributor to the final 3′ trimming of a variety of stable RNA precursors (4Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and to the end-turnover of tRNA (3Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Other RNases generally are not able to approach closer than within 4 nt of a duplex with any degree of effectiveness. In these reactions, RNase T needs to remove only a small number of residues, making it less likely that random sequences would cause RNase T to stop. All the in vivo substrates of RNase T share the common structural feature of having their 5′- and 3′-ends pair with each other to form a stable RNA duplex followed by several unpaired nucleotides. It was suggested previously (7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that the double-stranded stem might play an important role in the action of RNase T on these substrates. However, it is now clear that in addition to the inability of RNase T to digest an RNA duplex, the sequence of the unpaired residues also affects RNase T digestion, providing one explanation for why processing of precursors by RNase T can leave different lengths of 3′ overhang that varies with the substrate. Thus, the combination of the double-stranded stem, the actual sequence of the single-stranded residues to be removed, and the assembly of RNAs into RNP structures (5Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) all affect how close to the ds stem RNase T will proceed. The mature 3′-ends of tRNA and tmRNA are –CCA, and each has 4 unpaired terminal residues. Inasmuch as RNase T action is non-processive, the mature 3′-ends of these molecules can be protected by rapid aminoacylation. If, by chance, RNase T does remove the 3′-terminal A residue, the resulting –CC sequence greatly slows any additional digestion, allowing tRNA nucleotidyltransferase to repair the –CCA sequence (3Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During tRNA maturation, the most active substrates for RNase T appear to be the +1 precursors (−CCAN), because these usually are not observed in cells or extracts containing RNase T (4Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6064-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, for those tRNA precursors that contain multiple C and U residues immediately after the –CCA sequence, RNase T has been found not to be involved in their maturation. Rather, other enzymes, such as RNase PH, became more important. For example, the 3′ maturation of tRNA1Val (precursor 3′ trailing sequence –CUUC or −CUUUCUC) and tRNA2BVal (precursor 3′ trailing sequence –UCCU) is unaffected in RNase T− strains, whereas precursors to these tRNAs do accumulate in RNase PH− strains (4Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The maturation of several other RNAs by RNase T also leaves 4 unpaired 3′-terminal residues (7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Both 4.5 S RNA and 6 S RNA have –CC residues at their mature 3′-ends, explaining why RNase T digestion stops. M1 RNA terminates with a –CCU sequence, which also would be expected to be resistant to RNase T. The mature 3′-ends of 5 S and 23 S rRNAs terminate with either 1 or 2 unpaired U residues, respectively. Although these ends may afford some protection against further RNase T action, previous studies showed that assembly into the ribosome structure is a major determinant protecting the RNA (5Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on these and other examples, it is clear that the unusual substrate specificity of RNase T is an important aspect of its function in vivo."

A genetic screen for zinc hypersensitivity inSchizosaccharomyces pombe identified a missense mutation truncating Zhf, an endoplasmic reticulum transporter. These cells were ∼5-fold more zinc-sensitive than other independent mutants. The targeted disruption of zhf prevented growth on low zinc medium and caused hypersensitivity to elevated zinc/cobalt but resistance to cadmium. The exposure to elevated zinc but not copper also promotes the accumulation of transcripts encoding a metallothionein designated Zym1. The Sty1 pathway is required for maximal zym1 expression but is not obligatory for zinc perception. The targeted disruption of zym1impaired cadmium tolerance but only slightly impaired zinc tolerance, whereas zym1 overexpression substantially rescued zinc hypersensitivity of zhf− cells. Four equivalents of zinc were displaced from Zym1 by up to 12 equivalents ofp-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulphonate. Zym1 thiols react rapidly with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) compared with bacterial zinc metallothionein (6.8 and 0.2 × 10−4s−1, respectively). Zym1 is unlike known fungal metallothioneins that are induced by and sequester copper but not zinc. Less zinc but normal cadmium was accumulated by zym1Δ, consistent with zinc sequestration by Zym1 in vivo.

The targeted disruption of zhf prevented growth on low zinc medium and caused hypersensitivity to elevated zinc/cobalt but resistance to cadmium. The exposure to elevated zinc but not copper also promotes the accumulation of transcripts encoding a metallothionein designated Zym1. The Sty1 pathway is required for maximal zym1 expression but is not obligatory for zinc perception. The targeted disruption of zym1impaired cadmium tolerance but only slightly impaired zinc tolerance, whereas zym1 overexpression substantially rescued zinc hypersensitivity of zhf− cells. Four equivalents of zinc were displaced from Zym1 by up to 12 equivalents ofp-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulphonate. Zym1 thiols react rapidly with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) compared with bacterial zinc metallothionein (6.8 and 0.2 × 10−4s−1, respectively). Zym1 is unlike known fungal metallothioneins that are induced by and sequester copper but not zinc. Less zinc but normal cadmium was accumulated by zym1Δ, consistent with zinc sequestration by Zym1 in vivo. metallothionein low zinc medium mitogen-activated protein kinase p-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulphonate 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) Proteins that require zinc for catalysis pervade metabolism, and zinc is a common element of protein structure (1Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). However, excess zinc is toxic, and cells restrict the availability of zinc. In mammalian cells, cytosolic-free zinc content has been estimated as picomolar (2Atar D. Backx P.H. Appel M.M. Gao W.D. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2473-2477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and the sensitivity of cellular zinc sensors suggests that there is also effectively no free zinc in Escherichia coli (3Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Surplus zinc must be sequestered and stored until it is required for the incorporation into nascent proteins. It remains to be fully defined how zinc is delivered to intracellular stores and mobilized from them. In higher eukaryotes but not Saccharomyces cerevisiae, surplus zinc can be sequestered in small cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins called metallothioneins (4Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The exposure to zinc and a diversity of other factors promotes a rapid increase in both metallothionein mRNA and protein (5Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ghoshal K. Jacob S.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 357-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metallothioneins are capable of binding a range of metals, but in mammals they predominantly coordinate zinc with the exception of cells challenged with supraoptimal concentrations of metals that can displace zinc from metallothionein clusters (7Shaw III, C.F. Savas M.M. Petering D.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mice that lack MT-I1 and MT-II exhibit a small increase in sensitivity to zinc (8Kelly E.J. Quaife C.J. Froelick G.J. Palmiter R.D. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 1782-1790PubMed Google Scholar), but in cell lines that lack functional zinc transporters, metallothioneins confer some residual resistance (9Palmiter R.D. Findley S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). A number of roles have been proposed for MT-I and MT-II, but uncertainty remains around the evolutionary advantage that has selected for so many metallothionein genes in such a wide diversity of organisms (4Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Importantly, in S. cerevisiae, the metallothioneins Cup1 and Crs5 coordinate copper are induced in response to elevated copper concentrations by the transcriptional regulator Ace1 and function predominantly in the detoxification of excess copper (10Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 11Jensen L.T. Howard W.R. Strain J.J. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18514-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There is no evidence for any role for either protein in zinc homeostasis. In mammalian cells, surplus intracellular zinc is also sequestered to compartments such as vacuoles and specialized vesicles, and this is also true of S. cerevisiae (12Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 13Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaiffe C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2000; 12: 2845-2855Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The mutants of S. cerevisiae that are defective in either vacuolar biogenesis or acidification consequently exhibit increased sensitivity to metals including zinc (16Eide D. Bridgham J.T. Zhao Z. Mattoon J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Ramsay L.M. Gadd G.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two important determinants of zinc tolerance in S. cerevisiae are the vacuolar metal transporters Zrc1 and Cot1 (18Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The overexpression of either of these transporters increases zinc tolerance, whereas deletion reduces zinc tolerance (19Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, a loss of these proteins severely impairs the accumulation of intracellular zinc (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 12: 2845-2855Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Zrc1 and Cot1 are members of the cation diffusion facilitator family that also includes the mammalian zinc transporters ZnT-1 to ZnT-5 (22McMahon R.J. Cousins R. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). ZnT-1 is located at the plasma membrane and functions in zinc efflux (9Palmiter R.D. Findley S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). ZnT-2 and ZnT-3 are involved in the intracellular trafficking of zinc (12Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 13Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaiffe C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ZnT-3 functions in zinc uptake into vesicles within neurones (13Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaiffe C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). ZnT-2 contributes to zinc efflux and the loading of vesicles in the intestine, kidney, and testis (12Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Transfection with ZnT-2 confers a degree of zinc resistance, indicating that storage in intracellular compartments maintains a tolerable number of zinc atoms within the cytosol (12Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). ZnT-4 performs specialized functions in the brain, intestine, and mammary gland (25Murgia C. Vespignani I. Cerase J. Nobili F. Perozzi G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1231-G1239PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ZnT-5 transports zinc into secretory granules in pancreatic beta cells (23Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). During the writing of this paper, Clemens et al. (26Clemens S. Bloβ T. Vess C. Neumann D. Nies D.H. zur Nieden U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18215-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported a cation diffusion facilitator transporter Zhf located in the endoplasmic reticulum and linked to the accumulation of zinc within this compartment inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. We had coincidentally recovered the gene encoding the same protein from a screen designed to identify the major determinant(s) of zinc tolerance, confirming similar phenotypes and additionally observing impaired growth ofzhfΔ on low zinc medium (LZM). Here we examine the action of a gene designated zym1, encoding a 50-residue cysteine-rich polypeptide. By analogy to fungal metallothioneins, it might be anticipated that zym1transcripts would accumulate in response to copper, but we establish that zinc not copper enhances transcript abundance. Expression is substantially reduced in either wis1Δ orpcr1Δ cells, implicating the Sty1 MAPK pathway (27Toone W.M. Jones N. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) inzym1 regulation, although this pathway is not obligatory for zinc perception because zinc-dependent expression is retained albeit at a lower level. The deletion of zym1confers a “minimal” reduction in zinc tolerance in a wild-type background. Surprisingly, zym1Δ does show some reduction in cadmium tolerance, even though phytochelatins are the principal determinants of resistance in S. pombe (28Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1998; 18: 3325-3333Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 29Ha S.B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We have exploited zhf− cells to demonstrate thatzym1 overexpression does substantially rescue zinc hypersensitivity of this genotype. The deletion of zym1 also reduces zinc accumulation but does not alter the accumulation of cadmium. We report in vitro analyses of the zinc-binding properties of Zym1 and establish that 10–12 equivalents ofp-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulphonate (PMPS) displace four equivalents of zinc, confirming the coordination to most if not all 12 cysteine residues. As a zinc metallothionein from a fungal species, Zym1 provides the opportunity for functional and regulatory studies in a genetically tractable organism. The routine culturing of S. pombe was performed in either rich medium (YE5S) or minimal medium (EMM) as described previously (30Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar) using standard techniques. LZM was prepared as described previously (31Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The strains used in this study were NT5, h− ura4-D18; IS537, h− ura4-D18 zhf-537; SW60, h− ura4-D18 zhf::ura4+; SW62, h+ ura4-D18 zym1::ura4+; SW61, h−; JX125, h90pcr1::ura4+; and GD1682, h−wis1::ura4+. All of the strains are ade6− and leu1−. The zhf open reading frame (SPAC23C11.14) was disrupted using a PCR-based approach as described previously (32Bahler J., Wu, J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides 5′-KO (5′-ATTTACCTTATTCCTTTTTCTCCCTGTGAAATTCAACCCTTACCATTTTTTTGAAATTGGTGACTTTTCGTTTTCAAACTGCTTAGCTACAAATCCCACT-3′) and KO-3′ (5-′-AATATAAAATTTTACCTCAAGAATAAATCAAAAGATGTGACACAATAGATTAACCACGTTAAATTTATAATGTTCGCAAATCTGACATAAAACGCCTAGG-3′) were used to amplify a 1.6-kilobases of ura4+containing fragment from pRep42. The amplified fragment was used to transform NT5 to Ura+, thus creating SW60. Integration at the correct locus was confirmed by PCR analysis. A strain in which the zym1+ open reading frame (SPAC22H10.13) was deleted was achieved using the same approach. The oligonucleotides used for amplification of the ura4+ containing the disrupting fragment were 5′-KO (5′-TCTCACCTTTTTTACCACTTTAAGCGTGCTTGAGACAATCGACTTTCAACAACTCATATCACCCTAACAAACTTTCAACGGCTTAGCTACAAATCCCACT-3′) and KO-3′ (5′-ACAATAAGACGAGGCGGACATTGCTTTATGGATGAAATATTTCGTCAAGGCCAGAACTACAGTCCGTAAATCTCATATAGTCTGACATAAAACGCCTAGG-3′). Random mutagenesis was performed by plating exponentially growing colonies onto rich (YE5S) agar plates (∼1 × 103cells/plate) and subjecting them to UV irradiation using a Stratalinker at a dosage that resulted in ∼70% killing. Plates were incubated in the dark at 30 °C for 4–5 days. The resulting colonies were replica-plated onto rich agar (YE5S) plates that were either supplemented or not supplemented with 2 mmZnSO4. A plasmid (pRep1-Zym1) for the over-expression ofzym1 in S. pombe was created by using PCR products corresponding to zym1, generated using primers 5′-zym1 (5′-GCGATCATATGGAACACACTACCCAATG-3′) and zym1-3′ (5′-CGTCTGGATCCGTCAAGGCCAGAACTACAGTC-3′). The resulting fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI followed by ligation to the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pRep1 vector to create pRep1-Zym1. A plasmid for the overexpression of zym1 in E. coliwas produced by ligating the zym1 PCR product into theNdeI and BamHI sites of pGEM-T (Promega). Thezym1 DNA was then excised using NdeI and EcoRI and ligated to the prokaryotic expression vector pET29a to create pMHNR6.1. RNA was extracted from 0.3 × 109 cells as described previously (33Whitehall S. Stacey P. Dawson K. Jones N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3705-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with some modification. Cell pellets were washed in H2O and resuspended in 200 μl of RNA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.25% (w/v) SDS) with 200 μl of phenol:chloroform in a 2-ml screw-capped Eppendorf tube. The cells were ruptured with 0.75 ml of 0.5-mm glass beads (Biospec) in a Ribolyser (Hybaid) using two 10-s bursts at full power. An additional 0.75 ml of RNA buffer was added followed by spinning in a microfuge for 5 min. The aqueous layer was subjected to further phenol:chloroform extractions before the RNA was precipitated with 0.1 volumes of sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.6 volumes of isopropyl alcohol. RNA pellets were washed in 70% (v/v) ethanol and resuspended in H2O. A 10–15-μg sample of total RNA was denatured with glyoxal, separated on either a 1.2 or 1.4% (w/v) agarose gel prepared in 15 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus hybridization membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA probes were produced by PCR amplification from genomic DNA using the appropriate primers. All of the probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by use of a Prime-a-Gene labeling kit (Promega). Exponentially growing cells (∼2 × 104) were inoculated into 5 ml of medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of metal.A595 was measured either after an overnight incubation at 30 °C for rich medium (YE5S) or minimal medium (EMM) or after a 20-h incubation at 30 °C for LZM. Cell pellets from aliquots (1 ml) of metal-supplemented cultures were washed in SSW (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm trisodium citrate, pH 4.2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaCl) and resuspended in 1 ml of 70% (v/v) HNO3. Zinc contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. pMHNR6.1 was used to transform BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells and protein expression induced in cells grown to 0.7 (A595) by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Zinc sulfate (0.5 mm) was added to the E. coli growth media, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 5 h before harvesting by centrifugation. The aliquots (2 ml) of cleared lysate were applied to a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-75, 2.5 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 9.7, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions containing Zym1 were pooled, concentrated (Vivaspin 20, 2.5 kDa of molecular mass cut off, Sartorius), and exchanged into 25 mm Tris, pH 9.7, by gel filtration (PD10, AmershamBiosciences). Zym1 was applied to an anion exchange column (1-ml HiTrapQ, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mmTris, pH 9.7), and eluted with 40 ml of 0–500 mm linear NaCl gradient. The purity and identity of the recombinant protein were confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SmtA was expressed and purified as described previously (34Blindauer C.A. Harrison M.D. Parkinson J.A. Robinson A.K. Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. Sadler P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9593-9598Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The amount of Zn2+ bound to Zym1 (1 nmol) was determined using the metallochromic indicator, 4-(2)-(pyridylazo)resorcinol, and the cysteine-specific reagent, PMPS, as described previously (35Daniels M.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Selkirk R. Sun H. Parkinson J.A. Sadler P.J. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22957-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thiol reactivity was assessed by incubating either recombinant SmtA (1 nmol) or Zym1 (0.75 nmol) with 37.5 μm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.6. Therefore, the concentration of protein thiols was equal in each sample. The formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 405 nm, and the values calibrated by reacting known amounts of free cysteine with DTNB. To identify proteins responsible for either sequestering or storing surplus zinc ions, we undertook a genetic screen to isolate mutants with reduced zinc tolerance. S. pombe cells were subjected to random mutagenesis via UV irradiation, and colonies were identified that exhibited impaired growth on rich agar (YE5S) supplemented with 2 mmZnSO4. Approximately, 50,000 colonies were screened from which 12 strains with increased sensitivity to zinc were isolated. One strain subsequently designated zhf-537 was non-viable on rich agar (YE5S) containing 0.4 mm ZnSO4 (Fig.1A). An isogenic wild type formed colonies on rich agar (YE5S) containing 3 mmZnSO4. Exponentially growing cells were inoculated into rich medium (YE5S) containing increasing concentrations of zinc and were incubated overnight. The growth of the wild type was not inhibited by up to 150 μm ZnSO4, whereaszhf-537 showed some inhibition at 5 μmZnSO4 and complete inhibition at 50 μm (Fig.1B). The mutant had impaired growth on medium enriched with cobalt but enhanced growth in the presence of cadmium compared with control cells (data not shown). As a first step to identify the mutation, we searched the S. pombe genomic data base for homologues of genes with known function in the cell biology of zinc. Open reading frame SPAC23C11.14 encodes a polypeptide with greater than 40% identity to Cot1 and Zrc1 of S. cerevisiae (19Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21Conklin D.S. Culberston M.R. Kung C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, we recovered and sequenced SPAC23C11.14 from zhf-537 and identified a nonsense cytosine to thymine substitution converting codon Gln-298 to stop and truncating the carboxyl terminus of Zhf by 89 residues. To confirm that zinc sensitivity resulted from loss of Zhf, we created a strain in which zhf was replaced with theura4-selectable marker. It was noted that the introduction of ura4 alone enhanced growth in rich medium without added zinc, although supplementation with ZnSO4 in the range of 50–150 μm restored growth at rates more similar to strains deficient in ura4 (Fig. 1, B and C, compare control strains). Most importantly, thezhfΔ strain was hypersensitive to zinc showing impaired growth on rich medium (YE5S) compared with the equivalent control strain and was unable to grow in medium supplemented with 20 μm ZnSO4 (Fig. 1C). A genetic cross between zhf-537 and zhfΔ yielded only zinc-hypersensitive progeny, confirming that the mutation ofzhf is the major determinant of zinc resistance and responsible for the aberrant phenotype of zhf-537. Intracellular sequestration by cation diffusion facilitator transporters in S. cerevisiae provides a supply of zinc for efficient use, especially when cells are transferred to zinc-depleted conditions (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 12: 2845-2855Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Does Zhf also contribute toward the efficient use of zinc, and doeszhfΔ have impaired growth in zinc-limiting medium? Theura4 containing control strain had poor growth on LZM unless supplemented with at least 20 μm ZnSO4 (Fig.1D). Significantly, zhfΔ failed to grow on LZM, although slight growth was restored in 20 μmZnSO4. This was not to control the levels (Fig.1D, inset). In the absence of Zhf, S. pombe is sensitive to both high and low zinc such that in minimal medium with limited buffering capacity, we were unable to establish conditions supporting growth equivalent to the respective control strain. S. pombe synthesizes cadmium-binding phytochelatins termed class III metallothioneins (36Murasugi A. Wada Nakagawa C. Hayashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. McCue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 38Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4291-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but there is also open reading frame SPAC22H10.13 within the S. pombegenome encoding a hypothetical protein with similarity to mammalian class I metallothioneins (Fig. 2). The predicted protein contains 12 cysteine residues, is shorter than mammalian metallothioneins (50 versus 61 amino acids), and the arrangement and spacing of the cysteine residues differ. In addition, the hypothetical S. pombemetallothionein also contains a single histidine residue. Is SPAC22H10.13, hereafter referred to as zym1, transcribed, and if so do the transcripts accumulate in response to elevated concentrations of copper in common with other fungal metallothioneins? Zinc caused the accumulation of zym1 transcripts with up to 10–20-fold increase 30 min after the addition of ZnSO4(Fig. 3, A and C). There was a direct correlation between zym1 transcript abundance and zinc concentration. In contrast, equivalent exposures to CuSO4 did not result in a detectable increase in the abundance of zym1 transcripts (Fig. 3B). To detect any subtle change in zym1 transcript abundance in response to copper, the blot was subjected to an extended exposure and this revealed low abundance and longer zym1-specific transcripts in control cells. The proportion of longer zym1transcripts increased in cells exposed to copper, although the overallzym1 transcript abundance did not increase (Fig.3B). The copper-binding transcriptional activator Ace1 modulates copper metallothionein expression in S. cerevisiae, but the induction ofzym1 by zinc (Fig. 3A) implies a different mode of control (10Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 11Jensen L.T. Howard W.R. Strain J.J. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18514-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, the Sty1 MAPK pathway plays a central role in coordinating changes in gene expression in response to a wide range of environmental stresses (27Toone W.M. Jones N. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this pathway could control zym1 and therefore examined transcript abundance in a strain lacking Wis1, a MAPK kinase critical for the activation of Sty1 (38Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4291-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Millar J.B. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 40Shiozaki K. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Both the basal and zinc-induced levels of zym1 transcripts were severely reduced in wis1Δ (Fig. 3C). The Sty1 pathway clearly controls the expression of zym1, but this pathway is not obligatory for zinc perception because zinc induction was retained in Wis1 mutants albeit at reduced magnitude. The abundance of zym1 transcripts was also reduced in cells lacking Pcr1, a bZIP transcription factor that in conjunction with Atf1 functions downstream of Sty1 (41Kanoh J. Watanabe Y. Ohsugi M. Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 1996; 4: 391-408Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 42Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3C). Zinc-dependent zym1 expression (Fig. 3A) suggests a role in the binding and storage of zincin vivo. We investigated whether or not the overexpression of zym1 suppressed zinc hypersensitivity associated with the loss of Zhf. The zhf-537 strain was transformed with either pRep1-Zym1, which expresses zym1 from the nmt1promoter (43Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), or an empty vector (pRep1), and the resulting strains assayed for growth on minimal agar (EMM) with or without, 0.4 mm ZnSO4. The strain containing pRep1-Zym1 grew on zinc-enriched agar (EMM) unlike the control strain (Fig.4A). Suppression appeared incomplete, because wild-type cells grew better on 0.4 mmZnSO4 than zhf-537 containing pRep1-Zym1. Exponentially growing liquid cultures of zhf-537 containing pRep1-Zym1 showed enhanced cell division in the presence of zinc compared with equivalent cells containing pRep1 alone (Fig.4B). A role in zinc homeostasis was further tested by creating a strain in which zym1 was inactivated by insertion. The growth of the resulting zym1Δ showed only a small but reproducible impairment in rich medium (YE5S) supplemented with 10–100 μm zinc (Fig.5A). The analyses of cellular metal content by atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed less atoms of zinc per zym1Δ cell compared with wild-type cells (Fig.5B). Phytochelatins are the major determinants of cadmium resistance in S. pombe(28Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1998; 18: 3325-3333Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 29Ha S.B.

We tested the growth of zym1Δ in cadmium and observed a decrease in tolerance (Fig.6A). However, zym1Δ showed no difference in cadmium content as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (data not shown), and in this respect, the action of Zym1 is different in the cellular handling of cadmium and zinc. A loss of Zym1 has the greatest effect on resistance to cadmium (compare Fig. 5 with 6A) but only modulates the accumulation of zinc (Fig. 5B). Evidence that Zym1 confers some protection against cadmium indicates that the gene product is present in cadmium-challenged cells. Basal zym1 expression in culture may be sufficient to mediate this level of resistance. Alternativelyzym1 may be induced by cadmium, and this theory was tested. Cadmium increased the proportion of longer zym1 transcripts as observ"

The mutant gene (YRR2–1) responsible for the resistance was identified as an allele of the ILS1 gene encoding tRNAIle synthetase (IleRS). The activity of IleRS, but not several other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases examined in wild type cell extract, was highly sensitive to RM-A (IC50 = 8 ng/ml). The IleRS activity of the YRR2–1 mutant was 4-fold more resistant to the inhibitor compared with that of wild type. The mutation IleRSN660D, near the KMSKS consensus sequence commonly found in the class I aminoacyl transferases, was found to be responsible for RM-A resistance. Moreover, overexpression of theILS1 gene from a high-copy plasmid conferred RM-A resistance. These results indicated that IleRS is a target of RM-Ain vivo. A defect of the GCN2 gene led to decreased RM-A resistance.

Yeast provides an ideal system to investigate the diverse biological activity of drugs because of the observations that various drugs that are effective to both yeast and higher eukaryotic cells often elicit their effects by an identical mechanism, sharing structurally and functionally conserved drug target molecules. Because RM-A exhibits an antifungal activity, we attempted to dissect its mode of action by identifying its target molecule by the power of yeast genetics (1Takahashi H. Osada H. Koshino H. Sasaki M.

However, the molecular mechanism by which RM-A inhibits the growth of yeast cells has still remained unknown. On the basis of these findings, the purpose of this study is to identify as an yet unknown RM-A target molecule in yeast by isolating and characterizing mutants resistant to RM-A in a genetic background in which several genes implicated in multidrug resistance have been deleted. We revealed that a dominant mutation (YRR2–1) in the ILS1 gene encoding isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) is responsible for the RM-A resistance. The IleRS activity, but not those of several other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases examined in the wild type (WT) cell extract, was highly sensitive to RM-A, whereas the IleRS activity in the YRR2–1 strain was more resistant to the inhibitor, indicating that IleRS is a major target for RM-A in yeast. The transcription of ILS1 gene is activated by the Gcn2-Gcn4 general amino acid control pathway (for review, see Ref. 5Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that a defect of the GCN2 gene led to an increased RM-A sensitivity, indicating that the elevation ofILS1 expression by the Gcn2-Gcn4-mediated autoregulatory mechanism also contributes to RM-A resistance.DISCUSSIONThe genetic and biochemical approaches on the yeast RM-A resistance have revealed that IleRS is a target of RM-A drug action. The physiological effects of RM-A on yeast, such as the inhibition of growth and protein synthesis, can be explained by the essential role of IleRS for growth and protein synthesis. Of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases examined in vitro, only IleRS was highly sensitive to RM-A. Furthermore, both the dominantYRR2–1 mutation and overexpression of ILS1 (WT) from a high-copy plasmid conferred resistance specifically to RM-A, and only the ILS1 mutant alleles were found among the dominant RM-A-resistant mutations. Based on these results, we concluded that IleRS is a major in vivo target of RM-A action in yeast. The molecular basis for the extreme specificity of RM-A to IleRS still remains to be clarified.Under starvation conditions, when nutrients are limited, S. cerevisiae cells accumulate in G1 (16Unger M.W. Hartwell L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 96: 1664-1668Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Johnston G.C. Pringle J.R. Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 105: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 18Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When nutrients are limiting, haploid yeast cells do not proceed to START in late G1, but instead exit the mitotic cell cycle in early G1 and enter a stationary or G0 phase. The cell-cycle-specific growth inhibition may be the result of the cessation of protein synthesis and thereby leads to physiological changes characteristic of starved cells entering stationary phase (G0). In fact, we found by reciprocal shift experiments that the RM-A restriction point was in early G1 before the α-factor arrest point (data not shown). A similar mode of growth inhibition was reported with rapamycin, which ultimately blocks translational initiation (19Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). As suggested for rapamycin action, the cell-cycle-specific growth inhibition by RM-A may be elicited by the decreased translation of an unstable protein(s) essential for G1 progression, such as G1cyclins, which are unstable and limiting in G1 (19Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The entry into the stationary phase enables cells to maintain viability for long periods when nutrients are not available.Our genetic approach to the mode of RM-A action in yeast revealed that the GCN2 gene plays a role in RM-A resistance. The expression of the ILS1 gene is under the control of theGCN2-GCN4 pathway implicated in general amino acid control that responds to starvation for single amino acids in a manner dependent on Gcn2 (for review, see Ref. 5Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A simple interpretation for the involvement of Gcn2 in RM-A resistance is that RM-A treatment leads to a decreased level of charged tRNAIle, which in turn activates Gcn2 kinase (probably via the Gcn2p HisRS-like domain sensing uncharged tRNAs), and thereby induces the ILS1 expression via theGCN2-GCN4 pathway. In fact, the transcription of the ILS1 gene was activated in response to RM-A stress (Fig.6, A and B). Gcn2 phosphorylates the α subunit of the translation initiation factor-2 (eIF2-α) leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis and thereby mediates translational control of GCN4 (20Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The feedback regulation mediated by the GCN2-GCN4 pathway is reminiscent of the autoregulatory model described for the yeast GCD5/KRS1 gene, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase. In this model, thegcd5–1 mutation causes a reduced charging of tRNALys, and this starvation signal activates the mechanism that compensates for the defect of lysyl-tRNA synthetase by increasingGCN4 expression at the translational level, which in turn stimulates transcription of GCD5/KRS1 and leads to increased lysyl-tRNA synthetase activity (8Lanker S. Bushman J.L. Hinnebusch G. Trachesel H. Mueller P.P. Cell. 1992; 70: 647-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The autoregulation ofILS1 expression by a similar mechanism would lead to increased RM-A resistance through the elevation of the cellular abundance of the drug target molecule. It was previously demonstrated that the temperature-sensitive Ils1–1 allele causes derepression of the general control system in amino acid-complete medium at a non-permissive temperature (21Delforge J. Messenguy F. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The gcn2mutants are sensitive to analogs of various amino acids, indicating that similar autoregulation is also inducible in response to depletion of other amino acids caused by the analogs (22Wolfner M. Yep D. Messenguy F. Fink G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).In this study, the dominant mutants specifically resistant to RM-A were the key to the identification of the drug target molecule. Dominant multidrug resistance is known to arise in the genes that encode Pdr1, Pdr3, and Yrr1 transcription factors in the presence of drugs (3Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,9Balzi E Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Decottignies A.

In this regard, the use of the genetic background in which various genes implicated in nonspecific multidrug resistance had been eliminated was effective, as indicated by the result that all five mutations that exhibited a dominant resistance phenotype fell into a single genetic complementation group YRR2/ILS1. Analogous approaches would be useful in dissecting the mode of drug action with other drugs of biological or pharmacological interest. For gene cloning, we constructed and screened a genomic library of theYRR2–1 mutant because the appropriate recessive phenotype for screening from the WT genomic library was not available with the mutation. However, if a recessive phenotype, such as low- or high-temperature sensitivity, that facilitates gene cloning using a WT genomic library is linked to the dominant mutation, this approach would become more useful for the identification of a drug target molecule.

The entry into the stationary phase enables cells to maintain viability for long periods when nutrients are not available. Our genetic approach to the mode of RM-A action in yeast revealed that the GCN2 gene plays a role in RM-A resistance. The expression of the ILS1 gene is under the control of theGCN2-GCN4 pathway implicated in general amino acid control that responds to starvation for single amino acids in a manner dependent on Gcn2 (for review, see Ref. 5Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A simple interpretation for the involvement of Gcn2 in RM-A resistance is that RM-A treatment leads to a decreased level of charged tRNAIle, which in turn activates Gcn2 kinase (probably via the Gcn2p HisRS-like domain sensing uncharged tRNAs), and thereby induces the ILS1 expression via theGCN2-GCN4 pathway. In fact, the transcription of the ILS1 gene was activated in response to RM-A stress (Fig.6, A and B). Gcn2 phosphorylates the α subunit of the translation initiation factor-2 (eIF2-α) leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis and thereby mediates translational control of GCN4 (20Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The feedback regulation mediated by the GCN2-GCN4 pathway is reminiscent of the autoregulatory model described for the yeast GCD5/KRS1 gene, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase. In this model, thegcd5–1 mutation causes a reduced charging of tRNALys, and this starvation signal activates the mechanism that compensates for the defect of lysyl-tRNA synthetase by increasingGCN4 expression at the translational level, which in turn stimulates transcription of GCD5/KRS1 and leads to increased lysyl-tRNA synthetase activity (8Lanker S. Bushman J.L. Hinnebusch G. Trachesel H. Mueller P.P. Cell. 1992; 70: 647-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The autoregulation ofILS1 expression by a similar mechanism would lead to increased RM-A resistance through the elevation of the cellular abundance of the drug target molecule. It was previously demonstrated that the temperature-sensitive Ils1–1 allele causes derepression of the general control system in amino acid-complete medium at a non-permissive temperature (21Delforge J. Messenguy F. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The gcn2mutants are sensitive to analogs of various amino acids, indicating that similar autoregulation is also inducible in response to depletion of other amino acids caused by the analogs (22Wolfner M. Yep D. Messenguy F. Fink G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study, the dominant mutants specifically resistant to RM-A were the key to the identification of the drug target molecule. Dominant multidrug resistance is known to arise in the genes that encode Pdr1, Pdr3, and Yrr1 transcription factors in the presence of drugs (3Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,9Balzi E Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Decottignies A.

Jungwirth H. Zisser G. Kuchler K. Hogenauer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27091-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this regard, the use of the genetic background in which various genes implicated in nonspecific multidrug resistance had been eliminated was effective, as indicated by the result that all five mutations that exhibited a dominant resistance phenotype fell into a single genetic complementation group YRR2/ILS1. Analogous approaches would be useful in dissecting the mode of drug action with other drugs of biological or pharmacological interest. For gene cloning, we constructed and screened a genomic library of theYRR2–1 mutant because the appropriate recessive phenotype for screening from the WT genomic library was not available with the mutation. However, if a recessive phenotype, such as low- or high-temperature sensitivity, that facilitates gene cloning using a WT genomic library is linked to the dominant mutation, this approach would become more useful for the identification of a drug target molecule.

Since protein kinase C (PKC) transduces signals that influence differentiation, survival, and apoptosis of various cell types, we investigated the roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of action of PKC isoforms in NO-induced dedifferentiation and apoptosis of articular chondrocytes. We report here that among the expressed isoforms, activities of PKCα and -ζ were reduced during NO-induced dedifferentiation and apoptosis. Inhibition of PKCα activity was independent of NO-induced activation of ERK or p38 kinase and occurred due to blockage of expression. On the other hand, PKCζ activity was inhibited as a result of NO-induced p38 kinase activation and was observed prior to proteolytic cleavage by a caspase-mediated process to generate enzymatically inactive fragments. Inhibition of PKCα or -ζ activities potentiated NO-induced apoptosis, whereas ectopic expression of these isoforms significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells and blocked dedifferentiation. Ectopic expression of PKCα or -ζ did not affect p38 kinase or ERK but inhibited the p53 accumulation and caspase-3 activation that are required for NO-induced apoptosis of chondrocytes. Therefore, our results collectively indicate that p38 kinase-independent and -dependent inhibition of PKCα and -ζ, respectively, regulates NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes.

Direct production of NO by treatment with the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), during primary culture of rabbit articular chondrocytes causes dedifferentiation and apoptotic cell death (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D.

The effects of NO on differentiation and apoptosis of chondrocytes are regulated by the converse functions of two mitogen-activated protein kinase subtypes, specifically, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase, in association with the elevation of p53 protein levels, caspase-3 activation, and differentiation status. SNP treatment stimulated the activation of both ERK-1/-2 and p38 kinase. Activated ERK-1/-2 induces dedifferentiation and inhibits NO-induced apoptosis, whereas p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase plays a role in the maintenance of the differentiated status and induction of chondrocyte apoptosis. In addition to NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation, ERK-1/-2 regulates chondrogenesis and the maintenance of differentiated phenotypes of articular chondrocytes. For example, down-regulation of ERK-1/-2 activity during chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells enhanced differentiation (12Chang S.-H. Yang M.-S., Oh, C.-D. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Chun J.-S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5613-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, ERK-1/-2 activity in differentiated articular chondrocytes was dramatically increased during dedifferentiation caused by a serial monolayer culture. Moreover, inhibition of ERK-1/-2 activity subsequently blocked dedifferentiation (14Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J., Oh, C.-D., Ju, J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). ERK-1/-2 activity in chondrogenesis is regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) α, whereas ERK-1/-2 and PKCα independently regulate dedifferentiation due to serial subcultures. PKCα expression was down-regulated during subculturing of chondrocytes, which in turn resulted in cellular dedifferentiation. PKC comprises a family of serine/threonine kinases with 11 isoforms (15Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Individual PKC isoforms exhibit a high degree of homology in the catalytic region but vary with regard to tissue distribution and activation requirements. In addition to regulating cell differentiation, PKC proteins play an important role in the modulation of apoptosis by acting as either pro- or antiapoptotic signals. Whether PKC induces or protects against apoptosis varies with the cell type, extracellular stimuli, and the specific isoforms that are activated or inhibited. Among the PKC isoforms, PKCδ is consistently reported as proapoptotic (16Pongracz J. Webb P. Wang K. Deacon E. Lunn O.J. Lord J.M. J. Biol.

Because a role of PKC in the regulation of NO-induced apoptosis has not been clearly elucidated yet, we addressed in this study the potential involvement of PKC isoforms in the regulation of NO-induced dedifferentiation and apoptosis of rabbit articular chondrocytes by using SNP as a NO donor. We additionally investigate the specific mechanisms of regulation of NO-induced apoptosis by these PKC isoforms. We report here that p38 kinase-independent and -dependent inhibition of PKCα and -ζ, respectively, is required for both NO-induced dedifferentiation and accumulation of proapoptotic p53 that in turn induces apoptosis of chondrocytes. Rabbit articular chondrocytes were released from cartilage slices of 2-week-old New Zealand White rabbits by enzymatic digestion, as described previously (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M.

Briefly, cartilage slices were dissociated enzymatically for 6 h in 0.2% collagenase type II (381 units/mg of solid, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, and individual cells were obtained by collecting the supernatant after brief centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin and plated onto culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. The medium was replaced every 1.5 days, and cells reached confluence in ∼5 days. The cells were treated with indicated inhibitors for 30 min unless otherwise indicated prior to SNP treatment. These inhibitors include 20 μm caspase-3 inhibitor, z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-DEVD; Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) (33Varghese J. Chattopadhaya S. Sarin A. J.

Caspase-3 activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm following cleavage of the synthetic substrate, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chromophorep-nitroaniline (Ac-DEVD-pNA). Briefly, chondrocytes were lysed on ice for 10 min in cell lysis buffer provided in the CLONTECH A ApoAlertTM CPP32 colorimetric assay kit. Lysates were reacted with 50 μmAc-DEVD-pNA in reaction buffer (0.1 m Hepes, 20% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors including 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Mixtures were maintained at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Enzyme activity was calculated from a standard curve prepared using p-nitroaniline. Levels of relative p-nitroaniline were normalized against the protein concentration of each extract. Apoptotic cell death was quantified by a flow cytometric assay based on the number of cells containing fragmented DNA, as previously described (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K.

Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation and fixed in 80% ethanol precooled to −20 °C. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h. The number of cells containing fragmented DNA was quantified using 1 × 104 cells on a FACSort flow cytometer.

Briefly, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and protease inhibitors (as described above) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mmNa3VO4). Samples were precipitated with polyclonal antibodies against p38 kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), PKCα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), or PKCζ (BD Transduction Laboratories). Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce), which were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of substrate (ATF-2 fusion protein for p38 kinase or myelin basic protein for PKCα and -ζ). Substrate phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. Chondrocytes were transfected with empty vector or expression vector containing wild-type PKCα, PKCζ, or the catalytic domain of PKCζ (38Soh J.W Lee E.H Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell.

The expression vector was introduced to cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 24 h and used for further assay as indicated in each experiment. Total RNA isolated by a single-step guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) was denatured and fractionated on formaldehyde/agarose gels (15 μg/lane). RNA was then transferred to Schleicher & Schuell Nytran N nylon membranes. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in 250 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 5% dextran sulfate, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml denatured single strand DNA for 3 and 12 h, respectively. PKCα transcript was probed with partial cDNA generated by reverse transcriptase PCR. The forward PCR primer for PKCα was 5′-TCAACCCCGAGTGGAACGAGACA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GGAAATAGTGTTGGTCGTCTTTT-3′. High specific activity random-primed probes were prepared from the PCR product (324 bp) using the T7 QuickPrime kit (Amersham Biosciences) as specified by the supplier. Filters were washed three times with 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins from chondrocytes were extracted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with inhibitors for proteases and phosphatases. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose sheet was blocked with 3% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, and proteins were detected using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-p53 polyclonal antibody and active caspase-3 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), PKCζ and ERK-1/-2 (BD Transduction Laboratories), p38 kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and phosphorylation-specific antibody for ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an ECL system. Western blotting analyses revealed that rabbit joint articular chondrocytes express α, ε, ζ, and λ/ι isoforms of PKC (14Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J., Oh, C.-D., Ju, J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We initially determined the effects of SNP (1 mm) on the expression pattern of PKC isoforms in chondrocytes. Among the expressed PKC isoforms, levels of α and ζ decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas ε and λ/ι expression patterns remain unchanged at all the time points and SNP concentrations measured (Fig. 1, A and B). The reduction in PKCα protein levels appears to be due to a dose-dependent decrease in transcription upon SNP treatment (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the decrease in PKCζ protein levels was accompanied by a concomitant increase in an ∼46-kDa fragment (Fig.1D). Since the epitope of the anti-PKCζ antibody employed was localized at the C-terminal region, the detected protein is similar to the reported PKCζ fragment generated by the action of caspase in other cell types during apoptosis (28Berra E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40620-40627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A recent study by our group demonstrated that SNP treatment of articular chondrocytes causes both dedifferentiation and apoptotic cell death (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined whether the observed decrease in PKCα expression and degradation of PKCζ affects phenotypic loss of differentiated chondrocytes by inducing ectopic expression of wild-type PKCα and -ζ. Consistent with our previous data (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), SNP treatment led to a reduction in sulfated proteoglycan accumulation and expression of type II collagen, as determined by Alcian blue staining and Western blot analysis, respectively (Fig. 2), thus signifying dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. Ectopic expression of PKCα or -ζ significantly blocked dedifferentiation of SNP-treated cells, as determined by the rescue of type II collagen expression (Fig.2B) and accumulation of sulfated proteoglycan (Fig.2A). Therefore, the above results indicate that reduction of PKCα and -ζ participates in the regulation of SNP-induced dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. Treatment of chondrocytes with SNP (1 mm) for 24 h causes apoptotic cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which is detectable as early as 6 h (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M.

Therefore, the possible involvement of PKCα and -ζ in SNP-induced apoptosis was determined by inhibiting the activity or ectopic expression of these PKC isoforms. Treatment of chondrocytes with indicated concentrations of PKC inhibitors (GF109203X (40Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E.

Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) enhanced SNP-induced apoptotic death of chondrocytes. Stimulation of apoptosis was evident at 1 μm, and more cells underwent apoptosis at higher concentrations (Fig. 3A). In contrast, ectopic expression of PKCα or -ζ significantly blocked SNP-induced apoptotic death of chondrocytes (Fig. 3, B and C). Quantitation of apoptotic cells using a FACSort flow cytometer with propidium iodide staining disclosed that the percentage of apoptotic cells (23 ± 2%) was reduced to 7 ± 2% and 9 ± 2% upon ectopic expression of PKCα and -ζ, respectively (Fig. 3C), indicating that both isoforms are required for SNP-induced apoptosis. A decrease in PKCα activity was noted during SNP-induced apoptosis (Fig.4A, upper panel), consistent with reduced mRNA and protein levels (Fig.4A, lower panel). To elucidate the signaling pathways leading to decreased PKCα expression and activity, chondrocytes were treated (prior to the addition of SNP) with inhibitors for signaling molecules involved in apoptosis and dedifferentiation such as ERK-1/-2, p38 kinase, and caspase-3. As shown in Fig. 4B, inhibition of ERK-1/-2 with PD98059, p38 kinase with SB203580, or caspase-3 with z-DEVD (data not shown) did not affect SNP-induced reduction of PKCα expression or activity. Expression of dominant negative forms of ERK-2 or p38 kinase also had no effects on the expression and activity of PKCα (Fig. 4B). However, inhibition of ERK potentiated SNP-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of p38 kinase or caspase-3 blocked apoptotic cell death (Fig.4C), which is consistent with our previous results (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The above results thus indicate that inhibition of PKCα activity is a result of decreased expression and is independent of known signaling molecules involved in apoptosis, including ERK-1/-2, p38 kinase, and caspase-3. In the next series of experiments, the functional relationship between degradation and enzymatic activity of PKCζ was determined. In cells treated with SNP for various time periods, PKCζ activity decreased in a time-dependent manner, consistent with the pattern of degradation (Fig.5A). This decrease in PKCζ protein level was blocked upon treatment of cells with z-DEVD (Fig.5B), a relatively specific inhibitor of caspase-3 (33Varghese J. Chattopadhaya S. Sarin A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein is cleaved by a process involving caspase-3. This result was further supported by the observation that inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 (conditions that inhibit SNP-induced caspase-3 activation) blocked PKCζ cleavage, whereas that of ERK-1/-2 with PD98059 (potentiating caspase-3 activation) enhanced PKCζ cleavage (Fig. 5C) (11Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D.

Cleavage of PKCζ by caspases produces either an active or inactive catalytic domain, depending on the experimental system (28Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2057963035,"RFLAT-1/KLF13, a member of the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors, was identified as a transcription factor expressed 3–5 days after T lymphocyte activation. It binds to the promoter of the chemokine gene RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and regulates its “late” expression in activated T-cells. In this study, a series of experiments to define the functional domains of RFLAT-1/KLF13 were undertaken to further advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by this factor. Using the GAL4 fusion system, distinct transcriptional activation and repression domains were identified. The RFLAT-1 minimum activation domain is localized to amino acids 1–35, whereas the repression domain resides in amino acids 67–168. Deletion analysis on the RFLAT-1 protein further supports these domain functions. The RFLAT-1 activation domain is similar to that of its closest family member, basic transcription element-binding protein 1. This domain is highly hydrophobic, and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that both negatively charged and hydrophobic residues are important for transactivation. The nuclear localization signal of RFLAT-1 was also identified using the RFLAT-1/green fluorescence protein fusion approach. RFLAT-1 contains two potent, independent nuclear localization signals; one is immediately upstream of the zinc finger DNA-binding domain, and the other is within the zinc fingers. Using mutational analysis, we also determined that the critical binding sequence of RFLAT-1 is CTCCC. The intact CTCCC box on the RANTESpromoter is necessary for RFLAT-1-mediated RANTEStranscription and is also required for the synergy between RFLAT-1 and NF-κB proteins.

Mammalian transcription factors are grouped into several categories based upon their structural domains for DNA binding and include the helix-loop-helix, homeodomain, leucine zipper, and zinc finger protein families (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). The zinc finger proteins are further classified based on the number of zinc fingers and the amino acid residues responsible for zinc binding. Among them, the Cys2His2(C2H2)1zinc finger proteins have been estimated to make up 1% of the human genome (2Klug A. Schwabe J.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The majority of these have not been characterized, and their biological functions are just beginning to be elucidated. A subset of C2H2 proteins contains a DNA-binding domain consisting of three contiguous C2H2 zinc fingers at the carboxyl terminus. Because their highly conserved DNA binding motifs resemble those of the segmentation gene product ofDrosophila melanogaster, Krüppel, they have been named Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) (3Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 4Turner J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Based on a recent BLAST search, this rapidly growing family now has 19 members and includes one of the first identified general transcription factors, Sp1 (5Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). These KLFs play critical roles in regulating a diverse range of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, embryogenesis, and tumorigenesis (6Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar).We have been investigating the transcriptional control of RANTES gene expression to understand the “late” expression kinetics ofRANTES in activated T lymphocytes. RFLAT-1 was identified by expression cloning through its binding to the A site of theRANTES promoter (7Song A. Chen Y.F. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T.A. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to activating the RANTES gene in T-cells, RFLAT-1 (also known as FKLF2 and BTEB3) can activate the human γ globin promoter, other erythroid-specific genes, SV40, and SM22α promoters (8Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 3578-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Martin K.M. Cooper W.N. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DNA binding studies demonstrate that RFLAT-1 bound to the A site of the RANTES promoter, a consensus basic transcription element (BTE), and CACCC box of the γ globin promoter (7Song A. Chen Y.F. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T.A. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G.

J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).By sequence analysis, RFLAT-1 belongs to the KLF family and shares the greatest homology with basic transcription element-binding protein 1 (BTEB1/KLF9) and BTEB4 (see Fig. 1). Although the amino acid sequences in the zinc finger domains of KLFs are highly conserved and bind to similar DNA sequences, the regions outside of the zinc fingers are not homologous. This heterogeneity may in part account for the tissue-specific expression of KLFs, the diverse biochemical mechanisms by which KLFs function, and explain their specific roles in a variety of biological processes. The structure-function relationships of selected KLFs have been studied in detail. Sp1, a relatively large protein (782 amino acids), contains multiple transactivation domains, including two glutamine-rich activation motifs and Ser/Thr rich regions (10Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Although Sp1 is a potent activator of transcription, some KLFs, like Sp3 (11Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and KLF12 (12Imhof A. Schuierer M. Werner O. Moser M. Roth C. Bauer R. Buettner R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 194-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are repressors. Other KLFs, such as EKLF/KLF1, GKLF/KLF4, and LKLF/KLF2, contain separate transcriptional activation and repression domains (13Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Chen X. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3118-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Yet S.F. McA'Nulty M.M.

The transactivation domain of EKLF/KLF1 is critical for cell-specific inducibility of a β-globin promoter (18Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GKLF/KLF4 activates the human keratin 4 and Epstein-Barr virus ED-L2 promoters (19Jenkins T.D. Opitz O.G. Okano J. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10747-10754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas it suppresses the activity of the CYP1A1 promoter (20Zhang W. Shields J.M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17917-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, despite similar DNA binding properties, the specific biological activities of KLFs may largely rely on their distinct domains outside of DNA binding, and characterization of these motifs may help elucidate their functions.The human RFLAT-1/KLF13 is a 288-AA polypeptide with three C2H2 fingers at the carboxyl terminus (AA 169–249). The zinc finger domain is responsible for DNA binding and also appears to mediate interaction with coactivators cAMP- response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (21Song C.Z. Keller K. Murata K. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7029-7036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little is known about the function of other structural regions of RFLAT-1/KLF13. The present study is a detailed analysis of selected functional domains of RFLAT-1/KLF13. We show that RFLAT-1 contains distinct transcriptional activation and inhibitory domains, which reside at the very end of the amino terminus and the middle portion of the protein, respectively. The activation domain, which differs from any of the well known transactivation motifs, is rich in hydrophobic amino acids and embedded with negatively charged residues. These negatively charged residues are important for transactivation activity. We identified two potent, independent NLS within RFLAT-1, either of which is sufficient to translocate GFP into the nucleus. We also demonstrate that RFLAT-1 recognizes and binds to a CTCCC box within the RANTESpromoter. The intact binding sequence is absolutely required for RFLAT-1-mediated RANTES transcription in T-cells. Finally, the structural similarities and differences between RFLAT-1/KLF13 and other KLFs are compared to better specify their biological functions.DISCUSSIONRFLAT-1/KLF13 was first identified as part of a search for late expressed T-cell transcription factors regulating RANTEStranscription in T lymphocytes (7Song A. Chen Y.F. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T.A. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present study to determine the structure-function relationship of RFLAT-1, a transcriptional activation domain, a repression domain, and two nuclear localization signals have been identified. Combined with information from other reports (21Song C.Z. Keller K. Murata K. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7029-7036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), our current model of the RFLAT-1 structural/functional domains is summarized in Fig. 8. RFLAT-1/KLF13 belongs to the recently identified and expanding KLF family. The evolutionary phylogenetic tree of 19 members of this family shows that RFLAT-1/KLF13, BTEB1/KLF9, and BTEB4/DRRF are most closely related and may form a subfamily. BTEB1/KLF9 was first cloned based on its ability to bind to the BTE, a GC-rich sequence present in the promoter of the cytochrome P-450IA1 (CYP1A1) gene (29Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It functions as an activator for multiple GC box-containing promoters such as the SV40 early promoter but acts as a repressor of single GC box containing promoters like that of the CYP1A1 gene. The transcriptional activation domain of BTEB1 was mapped to two regions at the amino terminus: AA 13–26 and AA 58–68 (25Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Imataka H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). BTEB4 was recently cloned from human pancreas (30Conley A.A. Urrutia R. Pancreas. 2000; 21: 437Google Scholar), but little information is available as to its function and domain structure. It may be an ortholog of the mouse DRRF, which is important for modulating dopaminergic transmission in the brain (31Hwang C.K. D'Souza U.M. Eisch A.J. Yajima S. Lammers C.H. Yang Y. Lee S.H. Kim Y.M. Nestler E.J. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7558-7563Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to the similar DNA-binding motifs shared by all family members, these three proteins also share homology within their transactivation domains. As shown in Fig. 1B, the amino termini of these three factors are very similar. This region contains one of the activation domains of BTEB1/KLF9 (25Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Imataka H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is the activation domain of RFLAT-1/KLF13 identified in this study. It will be interesting to determine whether this region also mediates transactivation by BTEB4.FIG. 8Functional domains of RFLAT-1. The RFLAT-1 minimum activation domain is localized to AA 1–35, whereas the repression domain resides in AA 67–168. There are two NLS; one is the basic region upstream of the DNA-binding domain (AA 147–168), and one is the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. The zinc finger domain has also been shown to mediate interaction with coactivators such as CBP/p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (21Song C.Z. Keller K. Murata K. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7029-7036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Transcriptional Activation Domain of RFLAT-1/KLF13The activation domains of RFLAT-1/KLF13 and BTEB1/KLF9 differ from the well characterized activation domains of many transcription factors, including other KLFs. For example, the transactivation domain of Sp1 is glutamine-rich (10Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), that of BTEB2 is proline-rich (32Kojima S. Kobayashi A. Gotoh O. Ohkuma Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Sogawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and those of EKLF and GKLF are acidic-rich (13Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Geiman D.E. Ton-That H. Johnson J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation domains of RFLAT-1/KLF13 and BTEB1/KLF9 have a high content of hydrophobic residues, with a small number of acidic and serine residues embedded within them (Fig. 2B). Mutagenesis studies on RFLAT-1 indicate that the highly conserved acidic residues and their neighboring hydrophobic residues are equally important in mediating transactivation. Thus, they may represent a new module responsible for transcriptional activation. It is generally accepted that the role of activation domains is to mediate interaction between sequence-specific transcription factors and basal transcriptional machinery (33Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). For example, the acidic residues may contact the target by charged interactions, and glutamine residues are involved in hydrogen bonding. In the case of RFLAT-1 and BTEB1, we predict that the contact between their transactivation domains with the basal transcriptional apparatus may involve both charged residues and hydrophobic interaction. The interaction may be initiated by contact between charged amino acids and reinforced and stabilized by stronger hydrophobic forces. Although it is currently not known whether the general components of the initiation complex or RNA polymerase II itself is the target for RFLAT-1, BTEB1, and BTEB4, it seems reasonable to predict that they probably all interact with the same protein or a similar region.The Repression Domain of RFLAT-1/KLF13Although many KLFs function only as activators or repressors, some KLFs are bifunctional, containing both activation and repression domains. Most of the repression domains have been identified using the GAL4 fusion system, like those of EKLF (13Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), GKLF (15Yet S.F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M. Layne M.D. Chin M.T. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Jain M.K. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and LKLF (17Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29299-29306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RFLAT-1/KLF13 is an activator for the RANTES gene, but, when fused with the GAL4 DBD, it acts as a repressor (Fig. 2B). This observation provides the first evidence that RFLAT-1/KLF13 may be a bifunctional transcription factor. Deletion analysis revealed that the minimum region conferring maximum repression is AA 67–168. This region shows no obvious sequence similarity with any other proteins, including its closest family members, BTEB1 and BTEB4 (Fig. 1B), but it is rich in alanines (19%) and prolines (20%), which are common residues in a few of the known repression domains (34Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These residues are also known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Although no repression domain has been identified for BTEB1, this factor was first cloned as a repressor for the rat CYP1A1 promoter (29Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Additionally, the mouse BTEB4/DRRF can act as either an activator or repressor on dopamine receptor promoters (31Hwang C.K. D'Souza U.M. Eisch A.J. Yajima S. Lammers C.H. Yang Y. Lee S.H. Kim Y.M. Nestler E.J. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7558-7563Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These data suggest that, in addition to the well known bifunctional EKLF subfamily (EKLF, LKLF, and GKLF), the RFLAT-1/KLF13 subfamily of KLFs can also be activators and repressors depending upon the targeting promoters, the interacting proteins, and the cellular contacts.In general, the mechanisms of transcriptional repression are less well understood than those mediating activation. It has been proposed that there are three mechanisms for repression: interference with (a) activator DNA binding; (b) the activity of DNA-bound activators; or (c) the general transcription machinery (34Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It has long been known that some KLFs are transcriptional repressors, but only recent reports describe the mechanisms of suppressive activities of selective KLFs. BKLF confers its repressive activity by binding to the cellular protein CtBP2 (carboxyl-terminal binding protein 2) (35Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). EKLF interacts with the corepressors mSIN3A and histone deacetylase 1 through its zinc finger domain and suppresses transcription (14Chen X. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3118-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The inhibitory domain of LKLF binds to a cofactor WWP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which results in attenuated transactivation (17Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29299-29306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the above cases, the mechanisms of repression are all at the intermolecular level and involve interaction with corepressors. In the GAL4 system, fusion of the RFLAT-1/KLF13 repression domain with GAL4 DBD did not change its DNA binding affinity (data not shown). On the contrary, the presence of the repression domain completely masked or quenched the activity of the activation domain, suggesting that its mode of action is either by covering the activation surface or interacting and interfering with the basal transcriptional machinery. In the RFLAT-1, RANTES promoter system, deletion of the repression domain resulted in increased RFLAT-1 transactivation activity, which further indicates the inhibitory function of this domain.The NLS of RFLAT-1Most eukaryotic transcription factors contain one or more NLS that can be recognized by nuclear transport proteins. These proteins translocate the transcription factors across the nuclear membrane in an ATP-dependent fashion (36Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Two types of NLS have been defined: the “core” NLS, which contains four or more arginine and lysine residues within a hexapeptide that is frequently flanked by acidic residues or prolines and glycines, and the “bipartite” NLS, which consists of two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a short nonbasic peptide (26Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based on sequence search, a bipartite NLS was identified within RFLAT-1 AA 147–168. This is a potent NLS because it is sufficient to direct GFP into the nucleus. However, it is not the only NLS on RFLAT-1 because deletion of this signal did not affect the nuclear transport. Moreover, this bipartite NLS sequence is not conserved on BTEB1 and BTEB4 (Fig.1B), and little is known about the NLS of the two BTEB proteins.Although no putative NLS (core or bipartite) is found within the finger region, the second NLS of RFLAT-1 was localized to the three zinc fingers of the DNA-binding domain. Deletion of the last zinc finger significantly reduced nuclear transport, perhaps indicating that all three fingers are required for optimal nuclear translocation. The zinc fingers of other KLFs, such as those of GKLF (26Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), UKLF (37Matsumoto N. Laub F. Aldabe R. Zhang W. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28229-28237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and EKLF (38Pandya K. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16304-16312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), have also been shown to act as strong NLS. In some cases, a “global” structure of zinc fingers, rather than specific sequences, serves as an NLS (39Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yang M. May W.S. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27399-27406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In others, basic residues within the zinc fingers are critical determinants for nuclear localization (38Pandya K. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16304-16312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that for KLFs, the zinc finger domain may have multiple functions. This domain of RFLAT-1/KLF13 is involved in nuclear localization, interaction with coactivators CBP/p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor, and binding to DNA.RFLAT-1 Recognition SequencesAll KLFs recognize GC-rich regions, but their precise recognition sequences are slightly different. Sp1 binds to GC-rich box GGGGCGGGG, whereas EKLF recognizes GT-rich CACCC sequence. Our mutation analyses demonstrated that RFLAT-1/KLF13 recognizes and binds to the CTCCC box of theRANTES promoter. Competition studies showed that it also binds to other previously published GT- or GC-rich sequences. However, its affinity to the GT box is somewhat stronger than that to the GC box. This intact CTCCC sequence is required for RFLAT-1-mediated RANTES gene transcription in T-cells. The importance of this sequence for the synergistic effect between RFLAT-1 and NF-κB proteins supports the enhanceosome model in which both activators and their cognate DNA fragments are all required to exert optimal gene transcription (7Song A. Chen Y.F. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T.A. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the functions of selected structural regions of RFLAT-1/KLF13, a member of the Krüppel-like transcription factor family, were analyzed. Distinct transcriptional activation and repression domains and two potent, independent nuclear localization signals were identified. Unique structural features may help define the mechanisms of action of RFLAT-1/KLF13 in regulating gene expression. Additionally, this information provides new insights into functional similarity and differences among the large and growing Krüppel-like transcription factor family. Transcription factors are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression by either activating or repressing the initiation of transcription. Mammalian transcription factors are grouped into several categories based upon their structural domains for DNA binding and include the helix-loop-helix, homeodomain, leucine zipper, and zinc finger protein families (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). The zinc finger proteins are further classified based on the number of zinc fingers and the amino acid residues responsible for zinc binding. Among them, the Cys2His2(C2H2)1zinc finger proteins have been estimated to make up 1% of the human genome (2Klug A. Schwabe J.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The majority of these have not been characterized, and their biological functions are just beginning to be elucidated. A subset of C2H2 proteins contains a DNA-binding domain consisting of three contiguous C2H2 zinc fingers at the carboxyl terminus. Because their highly conserved DNA binding motifs resemble those of the segmentation gene product ofDrosophila melanogaster, Krüppel, they have been named Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) (3Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 4Turner J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Based on a recent BLAST search, this rapidly growing family now has 19 members and includes one of the first identified general transcription factors, Sp1 (5Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). These KLFs play critical roles in regulating a diverse range of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, embryogenesis, and tumorigenesis (6Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We have been investigating the transcriptional control of RANTES gene expression to understand the “late” expression kinetics ofRANTES in activated T lymphocytes. RFLAT-1 was identified by expression cloning through its binding to the A site of theRANTES promoter (7Song A. Chen Y.F. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T.A. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to activating the RANTES gene in T-cells, RFLAT-1 (also known as FKLF2 and BTEB3) can activate the human γ globin promoter, other erythroid-specific genes, SV40, and SM22α promoters (8Asano H., Li, X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 3578-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Martin K.M. Cooper W.N. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

However, the molecular mechanisms and the DNase responsible for the differentiation-dependent apoptotic DNA laddering are poorly understood. Here we show that a Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease, DNase γ, is induced in C2C12 myoblasts during myogenic differentiation and catalyzes apoptotic DNA fragmentation in differentiating myoblasts. A Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent, Zn2+-sensitive endonuclease activity appears in C2C12 myoblasts during myogenic differentiation. The enzymatic properties of the inducible DNase were found to be quite similar to those of DNase I family of DNases. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that the induction of DNase γ, a member of the DNase I family of DNases, is correlated with the appearance of inducible DNase activity. The induction of DNase γ occurs simultaneously with myogenin induction but precedes the up-regulation of p21. A high level of DNase γ expression was also detected in differentiated myotubes but not in skeletal muscle fibers in which DNase X is highly expressed. The role of DNase γ in myoblast apoptosis was evaluated in the following experiments. Proliferating myoblasts acquire DNA ladder producing ability by the ectopic expression of DNase γ, but not DNase X, suggesting that the expression level of DNase γ is the determinant of the differentiation-dependent apoptotic DNA laddering observed in myoblasts. DNA fragmentation during differentiation-induced apoptosis is strongly suppressed by the antisense-mediated down-regulation of DNase γ. Importantly, the extent of DNA laddering is well correlated with the level of endogenous DNase γ activity.

Muscle precursor cells give rise to myoblasts that subsequently withdraw from the cell cycle, express muscle-specific genes, and fuse into multinucleated myotubes (1Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 2Perry R.L. Rudnick M.A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D750-D767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Walsh K. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been noted that skeletal muscle development is accompanied by the death of muscle cells via a physiological process recently referred to as programmed cell death or apoptosis (3Walsh K. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Huppertz B. Tews D.S. Kaufmann P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 205: 215-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Sandri M. Carraro U. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1373-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a cellular suicidal program by which damaged or no longer needed cells are individually eliminated to maintain healthy homeostasis in multicellular organisms (6Ellis R.E. Jacobson D.M. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 7Meier P. Finch A. Evan G.

Thus, apoptosis during muscle development is considered to be essential for normal skeletal muscle development by eliminating cells with defects or undergoing damage during differentiation. Apoptosis is indicated by its specific morphologies, such as loss of cell volume and chromatin condensation, and biochemical markers, including the externalization of membrane phosphatidylserine, the cleavage of death substrates by activated caspases, and the degradation of genomic DNA into nucleosomal fragments (8Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 9Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Res. 2000; 10: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The occurrence of the nucleosomal DNA fragmentation has long been recognized as an important feature of apoptosis, and the ladder configuration visualized in agarose gel electrophoresis is frequently used as reliable evidence of apoptosis (12Kaufmann S.H. Mesner Jr., P.W. Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 3-15Crossref Google Scholar). Murine C2C12 myoblasts have been widely used as a model system in which to study apoptosis in developing muscle, because extensive cell death occurs during myogenic differentiation (13Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 14Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the patterns of DNA degradation in C2C12 apoptosis differ depending on the degree of differentiation. Nucleosomal ladder formation is clearly detected in cells when apoptosis is induced under differentiating conditions; however, apoptosis under proliferating conditions produces no such DNA laddering (15Fimia G.M.

Furthermore, C3H-10T1/2 cells, which are unable to degrade genomic DNA into nucleosomal fragments, acquire ladder producing ability when myogenic differentiation is induced by the forced expression of MyoD (15Fimia G.M. Gottifredi V. Passananti C. Maione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15575-15579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the mechanism of differentiation-dependent DNA fragmentation is important for understanding apoptosis in developing muscles; however, the molecular basis for the interesting observations is as yet not well understood. To date, several mammalian DNases, such as DNase I, DNase X, DNase γ, DNase II, CAD1/DFF40, and endonuclease G, have been suggested to be responsible for apoptotic DNA fragmentation (17Enari M.

Among these candidates, the involvement of CAD in some apoptotic conditions, such as Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells and dexamethasone-induced thymic apoptosis, is well documented (27Nikonova L.V. Nelipovich P.A. Umansky S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 699: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Zhang J. Wang X. Bove K.E. Xu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37450-37454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, it remains controversial whether the apoptotic DNase is always the same or differs depending on cell type, differentiation stage, and/or apoptotic stimulus. It has long been suggested that apoptotic DNA laddering is produced by a nuclear Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease (27Nikonova L.V. Nelipovich P.A. Umansky S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 699: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar), and we identified a novel 33-kDa Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease, named DNase γ, in the nuclei of apoptotic rat thymocytes (30Shiokawa D. Ohyama H. Yamada T. Takahashi K. Tanuma S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). DNase γ, also known as DNAS1L3 (31Rodriguez A.M. Rodin D. Nomura H. Morton C.C. Weremowicz S. Schneider M.C. Genomics. 1997; 42: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), is a member of the mammalian DNase I family of DNases. It shows high activity under neutral pH conditions and is strongly inhibited by certain metal ions, such as Zn2+ and Ni2+ (25Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A previous study, performed using a DNase γ-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, revealed that DNase γ is stored within the inner space of the nuclear envelope. When cells are induced to undergo apoptosis, DNase γ translocates into the nucleus and hydrolyzes genomic DNA into nucleosomal fragments (25Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, DNase γ is shown to have the ability to produce apoptotic DNA fragmentation; however, the apoptotic situations under which DNase γ is indispensable for DNA laddering have yet to be identified. In this study, we have found that DNase γ is newly synthesized via transcriptional activation in C2C12 cells during myogenic differentiation and that interference in DNase γ induction by the expression of its antisense RNA markedly suppresses apoptotic DNA fragmentation in differentiating myoblasts. Our results provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of DNase γ in the apoptosis of mammalian cells and provide a clear explanation for the differentiation-dependent DNA laddering of apoptosis in C2C12 myoblasts. Mouse C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in growth medium (GM) (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum). To induce myogenic differentiation, subconfluent cultures were shifted to differentiation medium (DM) (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum). Apoptosis of proliferating C2C12 cells was induced by the addition of staurosporine (STS) at a concentration of 0.5 μm. Cells grown on a sterile collagen-coated coverslips or fronting dead cells were stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting cells were then fixed in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with 1 mm Hoechst 33258 in DPBS, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Equal numbers of cells were seeded in 35-mm diameter dishes, and apoptosis was induced by shifting the cells to DM or STS treatment as described above. At the indicated times after the induction of apoptosis, both attached and detached cells were harvested, and DNA fragmentation was analyzed as described previously with some modifications (30Shiokawa D. Ohyama H. Yamada T. Takahashi K. Tanuma S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In brief, the resulting cells were collected and washed twice with DPBS, lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mmEDTA, 0.5% (w/v) sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K), and incubated overnight at 50 °C. Then 0.5 mg/ml RNase A was added, and the lysates were and incubated for an additional 30 min. The same aliquots of the resulting solutions were then subjected to 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA was visualized by UV illumination after Cyber Gold staining (Molecular Probes). RT-PCR analysis was performed using total RNA extracted from the indicated cells or adult skeletal muscle (C57/black 6 mouse) as described previously (25Shiokawa D. Tanuma S.

PCR amplification was carried out in 30 cycles, each cycle consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The primers used are as follows: DNase I (551 bp) (sense), 5′-ATCCAAGAGGTCAGAGACTCC-3′, and (antisense), 5′-TCAGACACCAGAGTGCAAGAC-3′; DNase X (396 bp) (sense), 5′-GATATCATGGTGCTTCAGGAG-3′, and (antisense), 5′-TGCATTGAAGTCTCCAAGCAG-3′; DNase γ (330 bp) (sense), 5′-CACGTACAAAGAGCAGTATGC-3′, and (antisense), 5′-CGAATGTTCTGCCAGGCCTTC-3′; DNAS1L2 (431 bp) (sense), 5′-AGATGTAGCGTCAGTGGTGAGCAC-3′, and (antisense), 5′-AGTTGTGAACTGAGGCTGAGTGGG-3′; myogenin (504 bp) (sense), 5′-GCGGACTGAGCTCAGCTTAAG-3′ and (antisense), 5′-GCTGTCCACGATGGACGTAAG-3′; p21 (358 bp) (sense), 5′-TGTCCAATCCTGGTGATGTCC-3′ and (antisense), 5′-TCAGACACCAGAGTGCAAGAC-3′; and ICAD (772 bp) (sense), 5′-GGCCATTGATAAGTCCCTGAC-3′ and (antisense), 5′-CCTGAGTGAATGCAAGCTCTG-3′. Subconfluent cultures in 35-mm diameter dishes were shifted to DM and cultured for the indicated numbers of days. An equal number of cells grown in GM (up to 40% confluent in 60-mm diameter dishes) were used as a control (GM). Cells were collected, washed twice with DPBS, lysed in 100 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and kept on ice for 30 min. After removing the debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, the supernatants were collected and used as cell extracts. The DNase activity of each extract was assayed by the plasmid assay as described previously (25Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 μl of total cell extract was added to 19 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Mops-NaOH (pH 7.2), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 500 ng of supercoiled pBluescriptIIKS+) containing the indicated divalent cations. The mixtures were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and equal aliquots were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, the activity of DNase γ in C2C12 cells was analyzed by activity gel assay as described previously (32Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). DNase γ, purified from mouse spleen as described previously (33Shiokawa D. Iwamatsu A. Tanuma S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. The in-gel reaction was performed in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mmCaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2) overnight at 50 °C. C2C12 cells (2 × 105) grown in GM were transfected with 1 μg of expression vector using a Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h post-transfection, the cultures were placed in fresh medium and subjected to experiments. Cells co-transfected with pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) and phDNase γ-Myc-His or phDNase X-Myc-His (25Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with 1 mm Hoechst 33258, and observed under fluorescence microscopy. Cells transfected with pcDNA-myc-hisC (Invitrogen), phDNase γ-Myc-His, or phDNase X-Myc-His were cultured for an additional 24 h in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm STS. DNA fragmentation in the resulting cells was analyzed as described above. The expressions of the DNase γ-Myc-His and DNase X-Myc-His proteins were detected by Western blot using an anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) as described previously (25Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Activated DNase γ located in apoptotic nuclei was detected in situ using hg302 anti-DNase γ mAb (34Shiokawa D. Tanaka M. Kimura T. Hashizume K. Takasawa R. Ohyama H. Fujita K. Yamada T. Tanuma S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Proliferating C2C12 cells, grown on collagen-coated coverslips, were cultured in DM for 2 days or treated with 0.5 μm STS for 24 h. The resulting cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde and soaked in ethanol, and after blocking with DPBS containing 5% fetal calf serum, the resulting cells were incubated with hg302 (2 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h in a humid sealed chamber. After incubation, the cells were washed with DPBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:300 dilution, Vector Laboratories) under the same conditions. After washing with DPBS, the morphology of the cells and fluorescence of FITC were observed under fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). A cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of mouse DNase γ was excised from pmDNase γ-Myc-His vector (34Shiokawa D. Tanaka M. Kimura T. Hashizume K. Takasawa R. Ohyama H. Fujita K. Yamada T. Tanuma S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) by XhoI digestion. The fragment was then subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCAG/puro, a kind gift from Dr. D. Kitamura, in the reverse orientation, and an antisense RNA expression vector for DNase γ (pCAG-mDNase γAS) was obtained. Proliferating C2C12 cells were transfected with pCAG-mDNase γAS as described above, and the cells stably integrated by the transgene were selected by puromycin resistance (10 μg/ml). The resulting cells were cloned by two cycles of colony isolation, and several independent clones of C2C12-DNase γ antisense cells were obtained. Subcultures of the clones were differentiated in DM for 3 days, and subjected to activity gel assay to select clones whose DNase γ activity was efficiently suppressed. As a result, we established two independent DNase γ-knockdown cells, C2C12/γAS1.34 and C2C12/γAS2.12. A mock transfectant, C2C12/puro cells, was obtained by the same method, except for the selection by DNase γ activity, and used in control experiments. Myogenic differentiation was induced in C2C12 cells by shifting the culture to low mitogen conditions. Two days after the induction of differentiation, both differentiating and apoptotic cells could be seen in the same field (Fig.1A, center panels). Floating dead cells were most frequently observed at this time. After 4 days, the appearance of newly dead cells was only slight, and most living myoblasts were fused to multinucleated myotubes (Fig.1A, right panels). The morphological features of apoptosis that occur naturally during myogenic differentiation were found to be almost the same as those induced by STS treatment under proliferating conditions (Fig. 1B). In both cases, a loss of cell volume and chromatin condensation could be observed (Fig.1A, center panels, and B). The positive staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-annexin V indicates the externalization of membrane phosphatidylserine, a biochemical marker of apoptosis (Fig. 1B, lower panels). Thus, apoptotic cells induced under two distinct conditions are shown to be morphologically indistinguishable. However, their patterns of DNA degradation are markedly different. As shown in Fig. 2, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed only in differentiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A) but not in that induced by STS treatment (Fig. 2B).FIG. 2Patterns of DNA fragmentation during differentiation- or STS-induced apoptosis in C2C12 cells.Proliferating cells were shifted to DM and cultured for 0–4 days (A) or treated with 0.5 μm STS for 0–24 h (B). The resulting cells were harvested at the indicated times, and genomic DNA extracted from the cells was analyzed by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results strongly suggest that part of the death mechanism regulating the production of DNA fragmentation must differ depending on the differentiation state of C2C12 cells. In this study, our goal was to identify the DNase responsible for apoptotic DNA fragmentation in C2C12 cells, and to clarify the reason that DNA laddering could be seen in myoblasts only under differentiating conditions. In order to examine whether some DNase might be newly synthesized or activated during differentiation, we analyzed cellular DNase activities in proliferating and differentiating C2C12 cells. Total cell extracts were prepared from cells cultured in GM (Fig.3A, left panel) or differentiated in DM for 3 days (Fig. 3A, right panel), and their DNase activities were assayed using supercoiled plasmid DNA as a substrate. Little difference could be detected between their DNase activities in the absence or presence of Ca2+or Mg2+ alone. However, strong DNase activity was observed in differentiating but not in proliferating C2C12 cells in the presence of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 3A). The maximum activity was observed under neutral pH conditions (data not shown), and the activity was strongly inhibited by the addition of Zn2+ ion (Fig. 3A). Up to 100 μg/ml of G-actin, a specific inhibitor of DNase I, had no inhibitory effect on the DNase activity (data not shown). Changes in the DNase activity during myogenic differentiation are shown in Fig. 3B. The results indicate that the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent DNase activity is induced early in myogenic differentiation and remains high in differentiated myotubes. To date, four distinct mammalian genes encoding DNase I-like DNase, DNase I, DNase X, DNase γ, and DNAS1L2, have been identified (31Rodriguez A.M. Rodin D. Nomura H. Morton C.C. Weremowicz S.

Although the DNase I family genes are expressed with distinct tissue specificities, their coding proteins are shown to have similar Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent, Zn2+-sensitive DNase activities (25Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). On the basis of their properties, we assumed that one of them is likely to be responsible for the inducible DNase activity. Thus, we performed RT-PCR to examine changes in their expression during myogenic differentiation. The mRNA for DNase X was strongly detected in terminally differentiated adult skeletal muscle. The expression of DNase X was also observed in C2C12 cells; however, the level was quite low compared with that observed in skeletal muscle and remained unchanged during differentiation (Fig. 4A). In contrast to DNase X, no signs of DNase γ expression could be detected in adult skeletal muscle or proliferating C2C12 cells; however, DNase γ expression was induced in C2C12 cells during myogenic differentiation. A time course study revealed that the induction of DNase γ occurs almost simultaneously with myogenin induction but preceding the up-regulation of p21 (Fig. 4A). No mRNAs for DNase I or DNAS1L2 could be detected in C2C12 cells throughout the time course of differentiation (data not shown). We also investigated the expression of an Mg2+-dependent endonuclease, CAD, and its inhibitor, ICAD. The expression of CAD could not be detected in C2C12 cells at any time during differentiation or in terminally differentiated adult skeletal muscle (data not shown), suggesting that the differentiation-dependent DNA laddering seen in C2C12 apoptosis cannot be explained by the CAD/ICAD system. In contrast, ICAD is ubiquitously expressed in all cells or tissues tested, and the level was unchanged during the differentiation of C2C12 cells. Thus, the cDNAs generated in the indicated cells or tissues were normalized for ICAD and used for RT-PCR. The induction of DNase γ was also confirmed by activity gel assay (Fig. 4B). Dark bands representing DNase γ activity appeared to correlate well with the expression of the DNase γ mRNA. On the basis of these results, DNase γ is shown to be induced in C2C12 cells during myogenic differentiation via the transcriptional activation of its coding gene. This finding provides a good explanation for the appearance of a Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent, Zn2+-sensitive DNase activity in differentiated C2C12 cells. Furthermore, these results suggest the involvement of DNase γ in apoptosis associated with the differentiation of C2C12 cells. To evaluate the physiological consequence of DNase γ induction, we examined whether proliferating C2C12 cells acquire ladder producing ability upon the ectopic expression of DNase γ. The transient expression of DNase γ causes no apoptotic phenotypes, such as cell shrinkage or nuclear condensation, in transfected (GFP-positive) cells (Fig.5, A and B), indicating that DNase γ expression itself causes no toxic or apoptosis-inducing effects in proliferating myoblasts. We next examined the effects of DNase γ expression under apoptotic conditions. Cultures individually transfected with DNase γ or DNase X expression vectors, or an empty vector, were maintained in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm STS. After 24 h of continuous treatment, genomic DNA was extracted from each culture and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 5C, no spontaneous DNA fragmentation could be observed in cells cultured without STS. However, STS treatment caused extensive DNA fragmentation only in cells transfected with DNase γ. Western blot confirmed the same expression levels of DNase γ and DNase X in each transfectant (Fig.5D). These results clearly indicate that the ectopic expression of DNase γ enables proliferating C2C12 cells to undergo DNA ladder formation and suggest that the expression of DNase γ is the cause of the differentiation-dependent DNA fragmentation observed in C2C12 apoptosis. Importantly, little DNA fragmentation was produced by STS treatment in cells expressing exogenous DNase X. This indicates that DNase γ-mediated DNA fragmentation is not a nonspecific result caused by the expression of an active DNase but reflects a feature specific for DNase γ. In a previous study (25Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the nuclear translocation of DNase γ was suggested to be an important process for its apoptotic function. To examine whether DNase γ is located in the nuclei of apoptotic myoblasts, we performed indirect immunofluorescence analysis for DNase γ. For t"

The mechanism through which tissues acquire retinol from the circulating retinol·RBP·TTR complex is subject to considerable debate.

Such receptors could provide cells with a mechanism to regulate retinol uptake.Most RBP is synthesized in hepatocytes. However, other adult organs and tissues have been reported to synthesize RBP, including, oddly, the eye (12Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

Little is known about the function that RBP serves in the eye, one of the two organs (testis is the other) that are highly dependent on retinol (11Saari J.C. Osborne N.N. Chader G.J. Progress in Retinal Research. 9. Pergamon Press, Oxford1990: 363-381Google Scholar, 27Unni E. Rao M.R. Ganguly J. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1983; 21: 180-192PubMed Google Scholar, 28Huang H.F. Marshall G.R. Biol. Reprod. 1983; 28: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).We generated a mutant mouse that lacks RBP (RBP−/−) by targeted disruption of the RBP genomic locus (29Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). RBP−/−mice, although viable and fertile, have reduced blood retinol and eye retinoid levels and markedly impaired retinal function during the first months of life. The visual impairment does not arise from abnormal eye development during embryogenesis. Given a retinoid-sufficient diet, the mutant mice acquire normal vision by 5 months of age, even though blood retinol levels remain low. Nevertheless, RBP is required for efficient eye uptake of retinol from the circulation, as shown by the near absence of retinyl ester reserves in the eyes of the RBP−/− mutants (29Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Deprived of dietary vitamin A, vision remains abnormal, and blood retinol declines to undetectable levels. Our studies also indicate that the livers of RBP−/− mice acquire retinol normally from the diet and establish hepatic retinyl ester stores. However, these mice are unable to mobilize stored retinol from the liver efficiently. Inefficient uptake of dietary retinol into the eye and inability to mobilize hepatic retinol account for the visual phenotype of the mice. 2S. Vogel, R. Piantedosi, S. M. O'Byrne, Y. Kako, L.

Blaner, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the retinoid status of the eyes of RBP−/− mice is extremely tenuous and dependent on a regular vitamin A intake from the diet.In this work, we further explore the role of RBP in assuring that the eye acquires and maintains normal vitamin A levels. Specifically, we investigated whether RBP expressed in an extrahepatic tissue can fulfill this role. Accordingly, we introduced a transgene that expresses human RBP (hRBP) under the control of the mouse muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter into the RBP null mouse. We found that circulating hRBP derived from muscle fully suppresses the visual defect of the RBP null mouse.DISCUSSIONThe visual cycle is driven by retinal derived from circulating retinol (10Wald G.

The role of RBP of extrahepatic origin is not known.In this work, we have shown that hRBP expressed ectopically in muscle can deliver retinol to the eye. This was demonstrated using a genetically engineered mouse strain that lacks functional RBP (29Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and that carries a transgene that expresses hRBP from the MCK promoter. As expected, the major tissue sites of hRBP expression are skeletal muscle and heart. No hRBP is expressed in the liver (Fig. 2A).Unlike RBP−/− animals, hRBP−/− mice do not show visual defects in the first months of life, as determined by electroretinography, and have copious optic stores of retinol and retinyl esters (Fig. 4). The amount of hRBP secreted into the bloodstream is very high; and correspondingly, the levels of serum retinol are 3-fold higher than in wild-type animals and 30-fold higher than in RBP null mice. The high concentrations of retinol may account for the suppression of the visual defect of RBP−/−animals. However, we have not excluded a more direct role of RBP in the delivery of retinol to the eye. Interestingly, we noted that the eye takes up retinol bound to chylomicron remnants very poorly in comparison to other tissues2 and may rely on a mechanism involving a receptor for RBP. Such a receptor has been reported for the eye (19Pfeffer B.A. Clark V.M. Flannery J.G. Bok D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1986; 27: 1031-1040PubMed Google Scholar) and other tissues (16Ward S.J. Chambon P. Ong D.E. Bavik C. Biol.

We found, however, no detectable hRBP in the RPE of hRBP−/− mice (Fig. 5). Thus, the delivery of retinol to the eye does not entail endocytosis of a retinol·RBP complex.Retinol·RBP is secreted from the liver in association with TTR, a serum protein that prevents renal filtration of the RBP complex (12Soprano D.R.

Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11793-11798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the appearance in the blood of hRBP derived from muscle could be the result of a co-secretion process. However, the elevated concentration of hRBP in the muscle of transgenic animals (see Table II) may circumvent a requirement for co-secretion with TTR.Note that the muscle of the hRBP−/− animals also contains substantially greater levels of retinoids than wild-type muscle (see Tables I and III). Because muscle is not a depot for retinoids in wild-type mice, this accumulation must be facilitated by hRBP present in this tissue. Neither the subcellular location of this retinoid nor the protein to which it is complexed is known.Among the tissues where the synthesis of extrahepatic RBP has been shown, the eye is one of the most difficult to understand. RBP is expressed in the RPE and from there secreted into the interphotoreceptor matrix (26Adler A.J. Edwards R.B. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Little is known about the function that RBP serves in the eye. Our data indicate that circulating hRBP, derived from muscle, efficiently delivers vitamin A to the eye. The hRBP−/− animals have wild-type eye retinoid levels and do not display the visual impairment of RBP−/− mice. Thus, RBP expressed in the eye appears to play no role in maintaining the visual cycle.The data reported in this study leave open the issue of how the retinol·hRBP complex is taken up by the RPE. We found no hRBP in the RPE of the transgenic animals. Thus, if there is an RBP receptor, it does not function through an endocytic pathway. We do not believe, however, that hRBP acts only to keep circulating retinol levels high. Our experimental evidence suggests that the eye has a special affinity for retinol·RBP.2 Efforts to elucidate the role of RBP in the delivery of retinol to the eye and to identify a possible RBP receptor are ongoing. Retinoids are needed to maintain normal growth and development, immunity, reproduction, vision, and other essential physiological process (1Napoli J.L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: S52-S62Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although not biologically active per se, retinol (vitamin A alcohol) is the major circulating form of vitamin A. Within tissues, retinol is oxidized to all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acids. These bind to nuclear receptors and regulate transcription of >300 diverse target genes (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C.

In the eye, retinol is converted to 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore for the visual pigment opsin (10Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 11Saari J.C. Osborne N.N. Chader G.J. Progress in Retinal Research. 9. Pergamon Press, Oxford1990: 363-381Google Scholar). The transport of retinol from liver stores to target tissues requires a specific 21-kDa transport protein, retinol-binding protein (RBP)1 (12Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 257-282Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of the retinol·RBP complex from different species reveals a single retinol molecule buried within a highly conserved eight-strand β-barrel structure (13Newcomer M.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The retinol-binding site of RBP consists principally of amino acid residues coded by exons III–V. The genomic organization of the RBP gene is also highly conserved across species (12Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 257-282Google Scholar). Retinol·RBP is found in a 1:1 molar complex with a 55-kDa protein, transthyretin (TTR) (14Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Complex formation prevents retinol·RBP excretion by the kidney (12Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

The mechanism through which tissues acquire retinol from the circulating retinol·RBP·TTR complex is subject to considerable debate. Membrane receptors for holo-RBP have been reported in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), in placenta, and in several other tissues and cells (16Ward S.J. Chambon P. Ong D.E. Bavik C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Smeland S. Bjerknes T. Malaba L. Eskild W. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. Biochem.

Such receptors could provide cells with a mechanism to regulate retinol uptake. Most RBP is synthesized in hepatocytes. However, other adult organs and tissues have been reported to synthesize RBP, including, oddly, the eye (12Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 257-282Google Scholar). Expression of RBP in rat, bovine, and human RPE has been described (20Herbert J. Cavallaro T.

Gouras P. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This RBP is believed to be secreted from the RPE into the interphotoreceptor matrix (26Adler A.J. Edwards R.B. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Little is known about the function that RBP serves in the eye, one of the two organs (testis is the other) that are highly dependent on retinol (11Saari J.C. Osborne N.N. Chader G.J. Progress in Retinal Research. 9. Pergamon Press, Oxford1990: 363-381Google Scholar, 27Unni E. Rao M.R. Ganguly J. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1983; 21: 180-192PubMed Google Scholar, 28Huang H.F. Marshall G.R. Biol. Reprod. 1983; 28: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We generated a mutant mouse that lacks RBP (RBP−/−) by targeted disruption of the RBP genomic locus (29Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). RBP−/−mice, although viable and fertile, have reduced blood retinol and eye retinoid levels and markedly impaired retinal function during the first months of life. The visual impairment does not arise from abnormal eye development during embryogenesis. Given a retinoid-sufficient diet, the mutant mice acquire normal vision by 5 months of age, even though blood retinol levels remain low. Nevertheless, RBP is required for efficient eye uptake of retinol from the circulation, as shown by the near absence of retinyl ester reserves in the eyes of the RBP−/− mutants (29Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Deprived of dietary vitamin A, vision remains abnormal, and blood retinol declines to undetectable levels. Our studies also indicate that the livers of RBP−/− mice acquire retinol normally from the diet and establish hepatic retinyl ester stores. However, these mice are unable to mobilize stored retinol from the liver efficiently. Inefficient uptake of dietary retinol into the eye and inability to mobilize hepatic retinol account for the visual phenotype of the mice. 2S. Vogel, R. Piantedosi, S. M. O'Byrne, Y. Kako, L. Quadro, I. J. Goldberg, M. E. Gottesman, and W. S. Blaner, manuscript in preparation.2S. Vogel, R. Piantedosi, S. M. O'Byrne, Y. Kako, L. Quadro, I. J. Goldberg, M. E. Gottesman, and W. S. Blaner, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the retinoid status of the eyes of RBP−/− mice is extremely tenuous and dependent on a regular vitamin A intake from the diet. In this work, we further explore the role of RBP in assuring that the eye acquires and maintains normal vitamin A levels. Specifically, we investigated whether RBP expressed in an extrahepatic tissue can fulfill this role. Accordingly, we introduced a transgene that expresses human RBP (hRBP) under the control of the mouse muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter into the RBP null mouse. We found that circulating hRBP derived from muscle fully suppresses the visual defect of the RBP null mouse. DISCUSSIONThe visual cycle is driven by retinal derived from circulating retinol (10Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 43Goodman D.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Retinol is water-insoluble and is carried in blood dissolved in postprandial chylomicron remnants as retinyl esters or bound to a specific carrier protein, RBP (12Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B.

We found, however, no detectable hRBP in the RPE of hRBP−/− mice (Fig. 5). Thus, the delivery of retinol to the eye does not entail endocytosis of a retinol·RBP complex. Retinol·RBP is secreted from the liver in association with TTR, a serum protein that prevents renal filtration of the RBP complex (12Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

Morimoto T. Tosetti F. Gaetani S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Detectable levels of TTR mRNA have been reported in rat skeletal muscle (46Soprano D.R. Herbert J. Soprano K.J. Schon E.A. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11793-11798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the appearance in the blood of hRBP derived from muscle could be the result of a co-secretion process. However, the elevated concentration of hRBP in the muscle of transgenic animals (see Table II) may circumvent a requirement for co-secretion with TTR. Note that the muscle of the hRBP−/− animals also contains substantially greater levels of retinoids than wild-type muscle (see Tables I and III). Because muscle is not a depot for retinoids in wild-type mice, this accumulation must be facilitated by hRBP present in this tissue. Neither the subcellular location of this retinoid nor the protein to which it is complexed is known. Among the tissues where the synthesis of extrahepatic RBP has been shown, the eye is one of the most difficult to understand. RBP is expressed in the RPE and from there secreted into the interphotoreceptor matrix (26Adler A.J. Edwards R.B. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Little is known about the function that RBP serves in the eye. Our data indicate that circulating hRBP, derived from muscle, efficiently delivers vitamin A to the eye. The hRBP−/− animals have wild-type eye retinoid levels and do not display the visual impairment of RBP−/− mice. Thus, RBP expressed in the eye appears to play no role in maintaining the visual cycle. The data reported in this study leave open the issue of how the retinol·hRBP complex is taken up by the RPE. We found no hRBP in the RPE of the transgenic animals. Thus, if there is an RBP receptor, it does not function through an endocytic pathway. We do not believe, however, that hRBP acts only to keep circulating retinol levels high. Our experimental evidence suggests that the eye has a special affinity for retinol·RBP.2 Efforts to elucidate the role of RBP in the delivery of retinol to the eye and to identify a possible RBP receptor are ongoing.

In many Gram-negative bacteria, the heme is attached to the polypeptide by the periplasmically functioning cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) proteins. Exceptionally, Hydrogenobacter thermophiluscytochrome c552, which has a normal CXXCH heme-binding motif, and variants with AXXCH, CXXAH, and AXXAH motifs, can be expressed as stable holocytochromes in the cytoplasm ofEscherichia coli. By targeting these proteins to the periplasm using a signal peptide, with or without co-expression of the Ccm proteins, we have assessed the ability of the Ccm system to attach heme to proteins with no, one, or two cysteine residues in the heme-binding motif. Only the wild-type protein, with two cysteines, was effectively processed and thus accumulated in the periplasm as a holocytochrome. This is strong evidence for disulfide bond formation involving the two cysteine residues of apocytochrome c as an intermediate in Ccm-type Gram-negative bacterial cytochromec biogenesis and/or that only a pair of cysteines can be recognized by the heme attachment apparatus.

Despite the essential roles of these proteins, it is not clear either how or why the heme becomes covalently attached to the polypeptide; it is not covalently bound in most hemoproteins (9Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Remarkably, three different c-type cytochrome biogenesis systems have been identified to date (1Tho¨ny-Meyer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 2Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem.

Gram-negative bacteria use either the cytochrome c maturation (Ccm)1 proteins (also called system I) or a distinct set of proteins known as system II (10Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The Ccm proteins (in Escherichia coli, CcmABCDEFGH; Ref. 11Tho¨ny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are located in the periplasm and/or cytoplasmic membrane; all bacterial cytochromes c are either periplasmic or on the periplasmic face of this membrane (1Tho¨ny-Meyer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 2Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem.

It is commonly assumed, but it has not been proven, that formation of a disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues of apocytochromec is an intermediate in bacterial cytochrome cbiogenesis by the Ccm system. The cysteine thiols are thought to be oxidized to a disulfide by DsbA, one of the proteins of the Dsb disulfide isomerase system, which actively forms disulfide bonds in the periplasm (2Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Tho¨ny-Meyer L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that a bacterial apocytochrome c can spontaneously form an intramolecular disulfide bond in oxidizing conditions even in the absence of DsbA (14Daltrop O. Allen J.W.A. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It would be necessary for any intramolecular disulfide in apocytochrome c to be reduced before the thiols can react with the vinyl groups of heme. CcmG and CcmH both contain the thioredoxin motif (CXXC) of disulfide reductases (13Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Tho¨ny-Meyer L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); at least one of them has been argued to reduce the cysteines of apocytochrome c before heme attachment, ultimately by transferring electrons from DsbD (also known as DipZ) (13Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Tho¨ny-Meyer L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Reid E. Cole J. Eaves D.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). DsbD receives electrons from the cytoplasmic TrxA and transfers them to the periplasm. Mutants of E. coli deficient in DsbA, DsbB (the oxidant for DsbA), DsbD, or TrxA were all unable to synthesize c-type cytochromes (16Sambongi Y. Crooke H. Cole J.A. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Metheringham R. Tyson K.L. Crooke H. Missiakas Raina D. Cole J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 95-102PubMed Google Scholar, 18Reid E. Eaves D.J. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether this was because of the inability of these mutants to process a disulfide involving apocytochrome c, one or more of the Ccm proteins, or indeed a combination of these proteins. The importance of investigating whether the substrate, i.e.cytochrome c, or the biogenesis apparatus requires disulfide bonds is emphasized by work on the type II secretion system in Gram-negative bacteria (19Pugsley A.P. Bayan N. Sauvonnet N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1312-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The requirement for DsbA was initially taken to mean that a secreted protein needed a disulfide bond; later it was shown that the disulfide was required in the biogenesis machinery and that a modified substrate could be secreted with a single cysteine thiol instead of a disulfide between two cysteines (19Pugsley A.P. Bayan N. Sauvonnet N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1312-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is important for understanding the operation of the Ccm system to determine whether it can assemble cytochromes c in which the heme is attached to the apoprotein by only one thioether bond. Among other things, this would provide strong evidence as to whether an intramolecular disulfide bond in an apocytochrome c is indeed an intermediate. Rıáos-Velázquez et al.(20Rıáos-Velázquez C. Cox R.L. Donohue T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) made single and double cysteine to alanine substitutions in the heme-binding motif of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochromec2. Such variant proteins were unable to support growth via photosynthesis where functional cytochromec2 is required. However, in their experiments, no product cytochromes with these substitutions, either holo or apo forms, could be isolated. This indicates that the proteins produced were unstable and rapidly degraded in vivo; thus it is not possible to say definitely whether or not the heme was covalently attached to the polypeptides by the Ccm proteins of R. sphaeroides before degradation occurred. Sambongi et al. (21Sambongi Y. Stoll R. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) conducted similar experiments using heme-binding motif variants of Paracoccus denitrificans cytochromec550, but again the products were unstable. Unusually heme may be covalently (and correctly) attached to cytochromec552 from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus in the cytoplasm of E. coli apparently without the action of any specialized biosynthesis proteins (22Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Karan E.F. Russell B.S. Bren K.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Sinha N. Ferguson S.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of one or both of the heme-binding cysteine residues by alanines (C11A, C14A, and C11A/C14A) also results in formation of stable cytochromes (25Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the two former cases, the heme is covalently attached to the polypeptide through a single thioether bond; in the latter the product is a b-type cytochrome whose heme is noncovalently bound to the polypeptide. Therefore, we have usedH. thermophilus cytochrome c552 and the C11A, C14A, and C11A/C14A variants to investigate the functioning of the Ccm system. Each of the proteins has been targeted to the periplasm of E. coli where the Ccm proteins act and expressed with or without plasmid-borne ccm genes. E. coli strain JCB387 (27Hussain H. Grove J. Griffiths L. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was transformed with an appropriate plasmid encoding for H. thermophilus cytochromec552, C11A, C14A, or C11A/C14A variants. Two forms of these plasmids were used; plasmids pKHC12 (22Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), pEST201, pEST202, and pEST203 (25Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with no periplasmic signal sequence, resulting in cytoplasmic expression of the cytochromes, have been described previously. New plasmids were constructed with the signal sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochromec551 to target the apocytochromes to the periplasm. PCR was used to amplify and fuse the signal sequence gene to the cytochrome gene on plasmids pKHC12, pEST201, pEST202, and pEST203 using the same method as Zhang et al. (28Zhang Y. Arai H. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 85: 346-349Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). pEST210, which carries wild-type cytochrome c552 and the signal sequence, was the kind gift of Dr. Y. Sambongi. Each of these new plasmids was sequenced to ensure that the signal sequence was present and that there were no secondary mutations in the cytochrome gene. Cells could also be co-transformed with pEC86 (29Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Tho¨ny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), which carries theE. coli cytochrome c maturation genesccmABCDEFGH. E. coli cytochromeb562 with a periplasmic targeting sequence was produced using a plasmid described previously (30Trower M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar);b562 cell cultures were grown identically to those transformed with the other plasmids, and the plasmid-borneccm genes were co-transformed as required. Cells were initially grown on LB-agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics (100 μg ml−1 ampicillin in each case plus 34 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol where pEC86 was co-transformed). Single colonies were picked into 500-ml 2× TY medium (16 g liter−1 peptone, 10 g liter−1 yeast extract, 5 g liter−1 NaCl) supplemented with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in 3-liter flasks. Cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 20–24 h before harvesting. Cell pellets were washed with cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl. The cells were then centrifuged again, and the cell pellets were weighed and resuspended in 15 ml of SET buffer (0.5 m sucrose, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA). 15 mg of lysozyme was added, immediately followed by 15 ml of ice-cold water to administer a mild osmotic shock. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 9000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was retained as the periplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of water, sonicated vigorously on ice, and centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant at this stage was taken to be the cytoplasmic fraction. Cytochrome content was determined by recording absorption spectra of the crude periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions to which a few grains of solid disodium dithionite had been added. Concentrations (and hence the quantity of cytochrome per gram of wet cells) were determined using the characteristic absorbance wavelengths and extinction coefficients described below for reduced H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 and variants. Note, however, that is was necessary to correct absorbance measurements of cell extracts because of the presence of endogenous E. coli cytochromes (see “Results”). For the wild-type H. thermophilus cytochrome c552, ε = 182 or 27.7 mm−1 cm−1 at 417 or 552 nm, respectively; for the C11A variant, ε = 179.5 or 27.7 mm−1 cm−1 at 422 or 557 nm, respectively; for the C14A variant, ε = 174.5 or 29.8 mm−1 cm−1 at 420 or 556 nm, respectively; for the C11A/C14A variant, ε = 145 or 27.3 mm−1 cm−1 at 425 or 560 nm, respectively. The extinction coefficients for the wild-type and single cysteine cytochromes were determined by recording absorption spectra of highly purified protein whose absolute concentration had been determined by total amino acid analysis. The extinction coefficients for the C11A/C14A protein were determined from pyridine hemochrome assays (31Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Activity staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels for covalently bound heme was conducted using the method of Goodhewet al. (32Goodhew C.F. Brown K.R. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 288-294Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Since all the cytochrome-encoding plasmids conferred ampicillin resistance, cell fractions were assayed for periplasmic proteins using β-lactamase activity (33Jansson J.A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 171-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To 980 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 in a quartz cuvette, 10 μl of 100 mg ml−1 ampicillin and 10 μl of cell extract were added. Absorbance change at 244 nm was recorded; note that it was necessary (and appropriate) to directly compare only the activity, normalized for volume, observed for the periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions from a particular culture fractionation. Cytoplasmic proteins were assayed using malate dehydrogenase activity (34Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Le Rudulier D. Gloux K. Riou N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To 970 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 μl of 25 mm β-NADH and 10 μl of cell extract were added. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 20 mmoxaloacetate as substrate. Absorbance decrease at 340 nm was monitored to relate the activity observed for the volume-normalized periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions from a particular culture. E. coli strain JCB387 was transformed with various plasmids to assess the ability of the E. coli cytochromec maturation proteins to process wild-type H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 and C11A, C14A, and C11A/C14A variants; these have CXXCH, AXXCH, CXXAH, and AXXAH heme-binding motifs, respectively. Each of these four proteins was available with or without a periplasmic targeting sequence. The latter enables translocation of the polypeptide to the periplasm where the Ccm system operates. Thus, in our investigations, 16 combinations were used: cytochrome c552, C11A, C14A, and C11A/C14A ± a periplasmic signal sequence, each ± the plasmid-borneccm genes. E. coli strain JCB387 (27Hussain H. Grove J. Griffiths L. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was chosen because preliminary experiments indicated that it produced only moderate yields of each of the four H. thermophiluscytochromes cytoplasmically (i.e. in the absence of the targeting sequence the cytochrome production was detectable but not such as to swamp any periplasmic cytochromes that may be produced with a targeting sequence). Strain JCB387 also produced a poor yield of periplasmically targeted wild-type cytochromec552 in the absence of the co-transformedccm plasmid. Cells were grown aerobically, so that expression of the endogenous Ccm system of E. coli would be minimized, and were fractionated into periplasmic and cytoplasmic components; each fraction was assayed for contamination by the other using enzyme marker assays. The fractionation protocol was carefully optimized to result in minimal contamination of the periplasmic fraction with cytoplasmic proteins and vice versa (see “Experimental Procedures”). Quantities of cytochrome produced were determined spectrophotometrically. In the absence of a periplasmic signal sequence, effectively 100% of each of the cytochromes was made cytoplasmically (TableI). 2Note that subtraction from the percentage of the total cytochrome in the periplasmic fraction (Tables I and II, fourth column) is necessary to correct for contamination of the periplasmic fraction by cytoplasmic proteins as indicated by malate dehydrogenase assays (Tables I and II, fifth column).These data were as anticipated and serve both as a control experiment and as a reference against which expression with a periplasmic signal sequence can be assessed. In the presence of the signal sequence, of cytochrome c552 and each of the three variants studied, only the wild-type holoprotein was found in significant quantities in the periplasm. With the signal sequence and the ccm plasmid present, essentially 100% of the wild-type cytochrome was periplasmic (Table II). In contrast, the variant cytochromes were found in the periplasm only in small amounts even when the Ccm proteins were co-expressed (in each case less than 5% of the total cytochrome after subtraction for cytoplasmic contamination and endogenous cytochrome production byE. coli (see below)). In the presence of the periplasmic targeting sequence, with or without the ccm plasmid, there was no significant quantitative difference in the total expression level or periplasmic quantities of the AXXAH, CXXAH, or AXXCH proteins (Table II). Small quantities of variant proteins in the periplasm can be accounted for by self-assembly; if protein with a signal sequence is translocated to the periplasm and encounters heme, it can be expected to spontaneously form a cytochrome as it does in the cytoplasm.Table IDistribution in E. coli of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 and variants with altered heme-binding motifs expressed from genes lacking signal sequencesHeme-binding motifPresence of the ccm plasmid% of the periplasmic marker protein in the periplasmic fraction% of the total H. thermophilus cytochrome in the periplasmic fraction% of the cytoplasmic marker protein in the periplasmic fractionTotal H. thermophilus cytochromemg/g wet cellsCXXCH−797100.9CXXCH+76751.0AXXCH−707191.2AXXCH+92331.5CXXAH−7417190.44CXXAH+74580.96AXXAH−891111.8AXXAH+85322.2These control data are the averages of two or three experiments. Ccm + indicates that the plasmid-borne cytochrome cmaturation genes were co-transformed with the plasmid carrying the cytochrome gene. The periplasmic and cytoplasmic marker proteins were β-lactamase and malate dehydrogenase, respectively. The percentage of the total cytochrome in the periplasm and the yield of total cytochrome per gram of wet cells are corrected from the raw measurements by subtracting a constant background level of endogenous E. coli cytochromes (see “Results”).

Within experimental error, targeting the apocytochromes to the periplasm caused a decrease in total holocytochrome production in every case except for the wild-type cytochromec552 when co-expressed with the Ccm proteins (compare data in Table II with data in Table I). Moreover, the results in Table II (and described above) show that the vast majority of the periplasmically targeted holocytochromes with substitutions in the heme-binding motif were made cytoplasmically despite the presence of the signal sequence. Staining SDS-polyacrylamide gels for covalently bound heme for such periplasmically targetedc552 variants resulted in a band at a higher molecular weight than for cytoplasmically produced protein with no targeting sequence, reflecting the presence of both heme and the targeting sequence in the higher molecular weight material. It might be anticipated that the availability of the periplasmic signal sequence would cause rapid translocation of the apoprotein before heme attachment could occur in the cytoplasm. However, our data indicate that there is competition between the rate of heme binding to apoprotein in the cytoplasm and the rate of apoprotein translocation to the periplasm by the general type II secretion (Sec) proteins. Translocation may be slowed because H. thermophilus apocytochromes c552 are quite structured (36Wain R. Pertinhez T.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Dobson C.M. Ferguson S.J. Smith L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45813-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the Sec system transports unfolded proteins (37Sanders C. Wethkamp N. Lill H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The observation that the periplasmically targeted double alanine (C11A/C14A) variant protein, which forms a b-type cytochrome (25Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was not made in significant quantities in the periplasm, either with or without the Ccm system, is an apparent anomaly. In our experimental conditions, E. coli cytochromeb562 with a periplasmic signal sequence was made effectively 100% periplasmically with or without co-expression of theccm plasmid (Table II). It is well established that disruption of the Ccm proteins does not inhibitb562 formation in the periplasm of E. coli (38Throne-Holst M. Tho¨ny-Meyer L. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Goldman B.S. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6338-6347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); hence we anticipated that C11A/C14Ac552 would be made equally well. One plausible explanation for our observations is that, when in the periplasm, the apo form of the C11A/C14A protein, which is not a naturally occurringb-type cytochrome, acquires its heme less quickly than and/or is more susceptible to proteolysis than apocytochromeb562. This would not affect the wild-type cytochrome c552, which can rapidly acquire heme from the Ccm system. The means by which b-type cytochromes acquire heme in the bacterial periplasm, a compartment of the cell in which they are rare, is far from understood, so the specific nature of the apocytochrome may, therefore, also be important for the process. When wild-type cytochrome c552 was expressed with the periplasmic signal sequence but no ccm plasmid, a significant fraction of the c552 was found in the periplasmic fraction (on average ∼60%). This suggests that the endogenous E. coli Ccm system, which is maximally expressed under anaerobic conditions (40Iobbi-Nivol C. Crooke H. Griffiths L. Grove J. Hussain H. Pommier J. Mejean V. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), was being expressed to some extent during growth (i.e. our cultures were not fully aerobic). However, even with this level of expression of periplasmic cytochrome c552, the yield in mg of periplasmic cytochrome produced per g of wet cells was only ∼14% of that produced when the ccm plasmid was present; thus this effect is relatively minor. As a corollary, wild-typec552 with a periplasmic signal sequence but noccm plasmid produced ∼40% cytoplasmic cytochromec, whereas in the equivalent casewith the ccm plasmid, the latter value was ∼0%. Furthermore, any low level expression of the cells’ own Ccm proteins has not affected our data for the cytochromes with substitutions in the heme-binding motif since the introduction of theccm plasmid (which implies a much higher level of expression) makes no significant quantitative difference to the periplasmic cytochrome expression levels of these variant proteins. To determine background absorbances in our measurements, we assessed the level of endogenous cytochrome production by E. colistrain JCB387 not transformed with any of our plasmids. In the periplasmic fractions of such cells, we detected a c-type cytochrome (λmax, 551 and 419 nm), probably NapB, a soluble subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase (41Potter L.C. Cole J.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 69-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm we detected absorbance from one or more hemoproteins (observed λmax, ∼560 and ∼423 nm), e.g.catalase. The periplasmic cytochrome accounted for 33% of the total absorbance, and the cytoplasmic cytochrome(s) accounted for 67% with the periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions normalized for volume. These proportions were essentially the same (32 and 68%) if E. coli JCB387 was transformed with the ccm plasmid pEC86 but no exogenous cytochrome plasmid. One might expect that expression of the Ccm proteins from the plasmid would stimulate production of the endogenous periplasmic c-type cytochrome. However, thenap and ccm operons are co-regulated in E. coli (11Tho¨ny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Grove J. Tanapongpipat S. Thomas G. Griffiths L. Crooke H. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), so in a given set of growth conditions, the expression of NapB would be limited by the same factor(s) with or without co-expression of the Ccm proteins from pEC86. We have corrected for these background hemoprotein absorbances in Tables I and II assuming that the endogenous cytochromes were produced at the same levels per gram of wet cells in all of our growth experiments; the effect is to reinforce the conclusions drawn in the paragraphs above. The percentages of each of the variant cytochromes (AXXCH, CXXAH, or AXXAH heme-binding motifs) in our periplasmic fractions are lowered because some of the absorbance attributed to these proteins in the raw measurements was in fact due to endogenous cytochrome(s).Table IIDistribution in E. coli of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552, variants with altered heme-binding motifs, and E. coli cytochrome b562, expressed from genes with signal sequencesHeme-binding motifPresence of the ccm plasmid% of the periplasmic marker protein in the periplasmic fraction% of the total H. thermophilus cytochrome (or of cyt.b562) in the periplasmic fraction% of the cytoplasmic marker protein in the periplasmic fractionTotalH. thermophilus cytochrome (or cyt. b562)mg/g wet cellsCXXCH−68 (17)40 (11)4 (2)0.66 (0.26)CXXCH+79 (12)82 (10)3 (0)3.0 (1.8)AXXCH−63 (12)13 (5)16 (11)0.53 (0.28)AXXCH+80 (15)4 (6)5 (4)0.73 (0.38)CXXAH−72 (16)0 (1)6 (3)0.51 (0.28)CXXAH+79 (7)13 (5)8 (7)0.51 (0.11)AXXAH−80 (5)3 (3)10 (3)0.49 (0.12)AXXAH+85 (10)9 (4)6 (5)0.93 (0.48)RXXYH in cyt.b562−8385205.4RXXYH in cyt.b562+9384124.1Ccm + indicates that the plasmid-borne cytochrome cmaturation genes were co-transformed with the plasmid carrying the cytochrome gene.

The principal result of this study is that the type I cytochromec maturation system as found in many Gram-negative bacteria can only effectively process covalent heme attachment to apocytochromec with two cysteine residues in the heme-binding motif. The nature of our experiments is such that we cannot say with certainty that the activity of the Ccm system toward the substrate apoproteins with single or no cysteine heme-binding motifs is 0%, rather than <2%, of that with the double cysteine apocytochrome; nevertheless, the latter value is a reasonable estimate of the upper limit of any such activity. The implication is that an intramolecular disulfide bond within apocytochrome c is, as postulated on the basis of less direct evidence, an intermediate in this type of cytochromec biogenesis. This idea finds support in the observation that H. thermophilus apocytochromec552 forms an intramolecular disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions following removal of the heme in vitro (14Daltrop O. Allen J.W.A. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the data presented in the present work is that that both apocytochrome cysteine thiols play specific, and required, roles in the maturation pathway, possibly involving intermolecular disulfide bonds. A further interpretation, which may or may not be combined with the obligate formation of one or more disulfide bonds, is that the ultimate highly specific recognition determinant for heme attachment by the Ccm system is the two cysteine thiols in the apocytochrome heme-binding motif. Note, however, that any rationalization of our data must allow for the fact that the Ccm proteins are active with substrate apocytochromes that either have naturally (43Herbaud M.-L. Aubert C. Durand M.-C. Guerlesquin F. Tho¨ny-Meyer L. Dolla A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), or have as the result of amino acid substitutions (20Rıáos-Velázquez C. Cox R.L. Donohue T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), CXXXXCH or CXXXCH heme binding-motifs, and thus it is the two cysteines that are important rather than their precise spatial arrangement. It is very possible that the CXXCH motif of apocytochromec cannot avoid being oxidized to a disulfide in the bacterial periplasm, e.g. by the active oxidant DsbA, and thus that the Ccm system has evolved to handle such oxidized apoproteins. Indeed it has been suggested (13Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Tho¨ny-Meyer L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that formation of a disulfide in the apocytochrome may pre-fold the polypeptide and that this facilitates covalent heme attachment. The likelihood that a disulfide bond is an intermediate in holocytochrome cformation also implies that covalent heme attachment, or formation of a mixed disulfide between one of the apocytochrome cysteines and a cysteine from one of the Ccm proteins, is concerted with reduction of the apocytochrome disulfide. Otherwise the reduced disulfide is susceptible to rapid reoxidation by, for example, DsbA. The crucial difference between our failure to observe covalent attachment of heme to apocytochromes with a CXXAH or AXXCH heme-binding motif and previous related studies (20Rıáos-Velázquez C. Cox R.L. Donohue T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar,21Sambongi Y. Stoll R. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is that in the earlier cases the products were unstable with respect to degradation. Thus is was not possible to determine unequivocally whether heme was in fact covalently attached by the bacterial Ccm system before the protein degraded. Moreover, there is no evidence that single cysteine proteins with covalently bound heme could ever actually form from the variant apocytochromes tested in the earlier studies. In the present work, we have used H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 together with mutants that are known to form holocytochromes and to be stable when expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli (Table I and Refs. 25Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholarand 26Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); the wild-type cytochrome is clearly also stable in the periplasm (Table II). Thus, our inability to observe variant holocytochromes in significant quantities in the periplasm is convincing evidence that the Ccm system cannot covalently attach heme to apocytochromes that do not have two cysteine residues in the heme-binding motif. Previous studies have shown that apocytochromec with a periplasmic signal sequence, even with substitutions in the heme-binding motif, is translocated into the periplasm independent of the heme attachment process (21Sambongi Y. Stoll R. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Single cysteine-attached cytochromes (XXXCH motif) have been isolated from some eukaryotic sources (44Pettigrew G.W. Leaver J.L. Meyer T.E. Ryle A.P. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7811-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) the formation of these cytochromes was catalyzed by a specific enzyme, cytochrome c heme lyase from yeast mitochondria, but the yields were low relative to protein with a CXXCH heme-binding motif. It may be that other mitochondrial heme lyases have evolved where necessary to cope with only having one thiol for heme attachment. No single cysteine-attached cytochromes c have been observed to date in bacteria, which is consistent with the inability of the Ccm system, one of two known bacterial cytochromec biogenesis systems (1Tho¨ny-Meyer L.

If any eukaryote were found to have both the Ccm system and single cysteine attachment of heme in a cytochrome c, then the present work would imply that the Ccm system can be modified when it operates outside bacteria to cope with a single cysteine heme-binding motif.

However, high level apoA-I binding is not observed on fibroblasts, HepG2 cells, or U937 cells (a macrophage cell line that does not efflux cholesterol to apoA-I or bind apoA-I on their respective ECM). Binding to the ECM of THP-1 or J774 macrophages depends on the presence of apoA-I C-terminal helices and is markedly reduced with a mutant lacking residues 187–243 (apoA-IΔ(187–243)), suggesting that the hydrophobic C terminus forms a hydrophobic interaction with the ECM. ApoA-I binding is lost upon trypsin treatment or with Triton X-100, a preparation method that de-lipidates the ECM. However, binding is recovered with re-lipidation, and is preserved with ECM prepared using cytochalasin B, which conserves the endogenous phospholipid levels of the ECM. We also demonstrate that specific cholesterol efflux to apoA-I is much reduced in cells released from their native ECM, but fully restored when ECM-depleted cells are added back to ECM in the presence of apoA-I.

Although the ECM is a minor component of most cell types, it has a crucial role in many cellular processes including cell growth, spreading and differentiation (18Getzenberg R.H. Pienta K.J. Coffey D.S. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 399-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and modulating the biological activities of growth factors (22Bissell M.J. Aggeler J. Prog. Clin. Biol.

There are also secreted proteins that reside on the ECM, such as sphingomyelinase (24Marathe S. Kuriakose G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Cardiol. 1996; 12: 1259-1267PubMed Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of understanding the function of the various components of the ECM. Additionally, the ECM has been demonstrated to play a role in binding of low density lipoprotein (LDL) (27Tabas I., Li, Y. Brocia R.W., Xu, S.W. Swenson T.L. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in mediating the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from LDL (38Buton X. Mamdouh Z. Ghosh R., Du, H. Kuriakose G.

In monocyte-derived THP-1 macrophages, cholesterol translocation is initiated by binding of apoA-I to a cell surface site via its C-terminal domain (39Burgess J.W. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Liang P. McManus D.C. Desforges M. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14524-14533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain-dependent binding is macrophage-specific and has not been observed in other cell types. In this report we show that trypsin-sensitive sites of the macrophage ECM bind apoA-I via the C-terminal domain and represent the major binding site for apoA-I on the cell surface. We further characterize this site and provide evidence that it participates in apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. 1-Palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL).

Human skin fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates as previously described (39Burgess J.W. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Liang P. McManus D.C. Desforges M. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L.

Human THP-1 and U937 monocytes were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm glutamine. To differentiate these cells into macrophages, the monocytes were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/well in the same medium containing 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) and incubated for 72 h (THP-1 cells) or 7 days (U937 cells). Mouse J774 macrophage were seeded in 12-well plates and grown in complete DMEM (high glucose) containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. ECM was prepared by the Triton X-100 or EDTA methods of Owensby et al. (41Owensby D.A. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with cytochalasin B as described previously (42Burgess J.W. Gould D.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5645-5654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 43Mai S. Chung A.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 152: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The purity of the fractions was assessed both microscopically for the absence of cells and particulate material and by Western blotting of the protein extracts with established markers of the ECM (fibronectin and laminin) and plasma membrane (TGFβR1 and LRP). To examine the relative amounts of 3H-labeled phospholipids and the effects of the different matrix preparation protocols on the matrix phospholipid content, J774 macrophages were labeled in DMEM containing 1% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and [3H]choline chloride (20 μCi/ml) for 48 h. The cells were then washed with warm DMEM to remove free choline chloride. Intact cells or ECM prepared by either Triton X-100 or cytochalasin B protocols were then solubilized overnight with 0.5 n NaOH. Phospholipids in the extracts were separated from free choline chloride by the method of Bligh and Dyer (44Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) prior to scintillation counting. To determine the relative amounts of ECM produced by different cell types, the cell proteins were labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine. Briefly, the cells at 90–95% confluence were incubated for 1 h in cysteine/methionine-deficient EMEM. The medium was then changed and replaced with the same medium including 20 μCi of 35S-PRO-MIX (Amersham Biosciences), containing 35S-labeled cysteine and methionine, and incubated for 24 h. ECM was then prepared as described above, and the associated radiolabel expressed as a percentage of the total cellular trichloroacetic acid-precipitable label. Macrophages, fibroblasts, or ECM prepared from these cells were washed three times with DMEM-BSA and then incubated at 4 °C with 125I-apolipoprotein (1 × 106cpm; representing ∼0.2 μg of protein) in DMEM containing 1% fatty acid-free BSA for 2 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I. The cells or ECM were washed three times with cold PBS containing 1.7 mmCaCl2, solubilized overnight in 0.5 n NaOH, and counted in a γ counter. Radioactivity and protein content of the cell extracts were determined, and the amounts of 125I-apoA-I or125I-apoA-IΔ(187–243) bound to cells were expressed as a function of cell protein. Binding of the apolipoproteins to ECM was expressed as femtomoles bound/well. In some experiments ECM, prepared by the Triton X-100 method described above, was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with DMEM-BSA containing Liposyn II or POPC micelles. Unbound lipid was removed by washing the wells three times with DMEM-BSA. The ECM was then incubated with radiolabeled apolipoproteins in DMEM containing 1% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. The ECM was washed three times with PBS and solubilized overnight in 0.5 n NaOH and then counted in a γ counter. Cholesterol-loaded and labeled suspension cells were prepared as follows. J774 cells were seeded into T-175 culture flasks and cholesterol-loaded in DMEM containing 1% FBS, the Sandoz ACAT inhibitor 58-035 (5 μg/ml), and [3H]cholesterol (20 μCi/ml final), which had been pre-incubated with acetylated LDL (75 μg/ml final) for 30 min at 37 °C. After labeling for 48 h, the cells were rinsed twice with warm DMEM-BSA and allowed to equilibrate for 3 h. Suspension cells were prepared from these flasks by the method of Owensby et al. (41Owensby D.A. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with warm PBS and then incubated with 3 mm EDTA in PBS for 5 min at 37 °C to disrupt the interactions between cells and ECM. Tapping the sides of the culture flask then dislodged the cells. The suspension cells were washed twice with DMEM-BSA (1300 rpm/Sorval RT 6000D centrifuge). Finally, the cells were re-suspended in DMEM-BSA to a concentration of 0.4 mg of cell protein/ml. Suspension U937 cells were cholesterol-loaded as above following PMA- induced differentiation to macrophages, and some preparations were labeled with [3H]cholesterol as described above. The ECM used for reconstitution studies was prepared in 12-well culture plates from unlabeled J774 or U937 cells by the cytochalasin B method described above. ECM or empty well controls were then pre-incubated with 50 μg of apoA-I or HDL in 0.5 ml of DMEM-BSA for 30 min at 37 °C to allow binding of apoA-I to the ECM. Cholesterol-labeled suspension cells (0.5 ml representing 0.2 mg of cell protein) were added to the wells to initiate cholesterol efflux. The incubation was continued for 3 h, after which time the entire reaction volume of 1 ml was collected and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min (Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge) to pellet the cells. A 0.9-ml sample of the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to pellet any remaining particulate matter. Finally, a 0.8-ml aliquot of the final supernatant was counted. To determine cholesterol efflux from attached cells, J774 macrophages or U937 macrophages were seeded in 12-well culture plates and cholesterol-loaded for 48 h and equilibrated as described above. There was ∼0.2 mg of cell protein/well. After washing, efflux was initiated with the addition of 50 μg of apoA-I or HDL. Medium was removed after 3 h and processed as described above. ECM was prepared as described above from J774 macrophages grown in 12-well culture plates (8 plates/matrix preparation). 1 ml of Laemmli sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) containing SDS (2%) and 2-mercaptoethanol (5%, w/v) was transferred sequentially from well to well at 25 °C, allowing a 1-min solubilization period per well. Whole cell extracts were prepared by adding 1 ml of Laemmli sample buffer to a single well representing ∼0.2 mg of protein. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and the cell or ECM proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% separating gel; 4% stacking gel) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Bio-Rad). PBS containing powdered milk (3%, w/v) was used to block the nitrocellulose membranes and to dilute antibody stocks. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with gentle rocking for 1 h at 25 °C with goat antiserum specific for fibronectin (Santa Cruz; sc-6953) or rabbit antiserum specific for TGFβR1 (Santa Cruz; sc-399), laminin (Sigma; L-9393), or human LRP or human ABCA1 (Novus Biochemicals). This was followed by an 1-h incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Peroxidase activity was detected using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals chemiluminescence method. The ECM prepared by the cytochalasin B method for J774 or U937 macrophages plated on coverslip dishes (glass-bottomed microwell dishes from MakTek Corp., Ashland, MA) was blocked in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 30 min, then incubated with 0.4 μg/ml Cy3-labeled apoA-I for 2-h at 37 °C. The ECM was washed three times in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse or a rabbit antibody directed toward fibronectin or laminin (1:200). This was followed by incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody-conjugated fluorescein IgG (1:200) and detected with an Olympus IX50 Microscope. Images were captured and saved using Winview. Lipoproteins were prepared from the plasma of normolipidemic subjects as described by Rall et al. (46Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Acetylated LDL was prepared as described by Basu et al.(47Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). HDL was iodinated by the iodine monochloride method (48Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Iodination of lipid-free apoA-I and apoA-IΔ(187–243) was performed by the IODOBEAD method (Pierce). Cy3 labeling of apolipoprotein A-I was carried out by the recommended procedure of the manufacturer (AmershamBiosciences product specification) and purified by size exclusion chromatography. The protein concentration of lipoproteins was determined by the Markwell-Lowry method (49Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar). Cell protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (50Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. We have previously demonstrated that an apoA-I deletion mutant lacking residues 187–243 of the C-terminal domain, herein referred to as Δ(187–243), exhibits both reduced cell surface binding and reduced ability to promote lipid efflux in THP-1 macrophages (39Burgess J.W. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Liang P. McManus D.C. Desforges M. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14524-14533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 1(panel A) demonstrates the variable binding of apoA-I and apoA-IΔ(187–243) to several macrophage cell lines and human fibroblasts at 4 °C. In agreement with our previous findings, full-length apoA-I bound efficiently to THP-1 macrophages whereas apoA-IΔ(187–243) did not. A similar pattern was observed in J774 macrophages. In contrast, both apoA-I and apoA-IΔ(187–243) bound poorly to human fibroblasts and U937 macrophages. Binding of apoA-I and apoA-IΔ(187–243) to the ECM from these cells prepared by treatment with Triton X-100 and re-lipidation with Liposyn II was also evaluated. The amount of protein in ECM represents a small proportion of the total cellular protein and therefore cannot be accurately assessed by conventional protein assays. To correct for potential variations in the amounts of ECM, and hence apoA-I binding, associated with these cell lines, we labeled the cells in the presence of [35S]cysteine/methionine for 24 h prior to preparing the ECM. ApoA-I binding to the ECM was then expressed as femtomoles bound as a function of 35S label associated with the ECM (Fig. 1, panel B). In J774 macrophage and THP-1 macrophage, the incorporation of [35S]cysteine/methionine into the ECM represented 0.29 ± 0.05% and 0.44 ± 0.15% of the total cellular trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts. In fibroblasts and U937 macrophages, the incorporation into the ECM was 1.9 ± 0.2% and 5.2 ± 1.8% of the total cellular counts, respectively. The pattern of binding to each ECM was very similar to that observed for the corresponding cells, with full-length apoA-I binding efficiently to the ECM of THP-1 and J774 macrophage cell lines, but not the ECM prepared from fibroblasts or U937 macrophages. In contrast, apoA-IΔ(187–243) bound poorly to the ECM of all cell types. This study indicates that apoA-I binds much better to the ECM of J774 and THP-1 macrophage and requires the presence of the C-terminal domain. We also examined the ECM fractions by Western blotting to ensure both the presence of matrix components and absence of plasma membrane contamination. Fibronectin and laminin are well defined components of the ECM and were visible in homogenates of J774 cells and in ECM prepared from these cells (Fig. 2). In these experiments the ECM was prepared from cell culture dishes representing a 96-fold greater surface area than the cell fractions. In contrast, the small 85-kDa subunit of LRP or the 55-kDa TGFβR1 receptor, although readily visible in cell homogenates, was not detected in ECM preparations even with longer exposures of the film. Negative results were also obtained for ABCA1, which could not be detected in ECM (data not shown). These results indicate that the matrix pre"

An in vitro selection procedure was used to select EGSs that direct human RNase P to cleave the mRNA encoding thymidine kinase (TK) of herpes simplex virus 1. One of the selected EGSs, TK17, was at least 35 times more active in directing RNase P in cleaving TK mRNAin vitro than the EGS derived from a natural tRNA sequence. TK17, when in complex with the TK mRNA sequence, resembles a portion of tRNA structure and exhibits an enhanced binding affinity to the target mRNA. Moreover, a reduction of 95 and 50% in the TK expression was found in herpes simplex virus 1-infected cells that expressed the selected EGS and the EGS derived from the natural tRNA sequence, respectively. Our study provides direct evidence that EGS molecules isolated by the selection procedure are effective in tissue culture.

The gene-targeting agents used can be a conventional antisense oligonucleotide, an antisense catalytic molecule (ribozyme or DNA enzyme), or an antisense molecule with an additional (guide) sequence that targets the mRNA for degradation by endogenous RNases such as RNase L and RNase P (1Rossi J.J.

Antisense molecules with guide sequences have several unique features as gene-targeting agents. Targeting with these molecules results in irreversible cleavage and the cleavage can be in a catalytic fashion. Moreover, this targeting approach uses the cellular endogenous RNases (e.g. RNase P) for degradation of the target mRNA and, therefore, assures the stability and efficiency of the targeting enzymes in the cellular environment. Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ribonucleoprotein complex found in all organisms examined. It is one of the highly active enzymes in cells and is responsible for the maturation of 5′ termini of all tRNAs, which account for approximately 2% of total cellular RNA (7Altman S. Kirsebom L.A.

Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). Human RNase P has at least nine polypeptides and a RNA subunit (H1 RNA) (7Altman S.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One of the unique features of RNase P is its ability to recognize the structures, rather than the sequences, of the substrates, which allows the enzyme to hydrolyze different natural substrates in vivo or in vitro. Accordingly, any complex of two RNA molecules that resembles a tRNA molecule can be recognized and cleaved by RNase P (Fig. 1, A and B) (11Forster A.C. Altman S. Science. 1990; 249: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Yuan Y. Hwang E. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8006-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One of the RNA molecules is called the external guide sequence (EGS).1 In principle, an mRNA sequence can be targeted for RNase P cleavage by using EGSs to hybridize with the target RNA and direct RNase P to the site of cleavage. The EGSs used to direct human RNase P for targeted cleavage resemble three-quarters of a tRNA molecule and consist of two sequence elements: a targeting sequence complementary to the mRNA sequence and a guide sequence, which is a portion of the natural tRNA sequence and is required for RNase P recognition (Fig. 1B) (11Forster A.C.

Subsequent studies have shown that expression of EGSs in human cells can reduce the expression of both cellular and viral genes (11Forster A.C. Altman S.

A. 1998; 95: 7327-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For example, we have previously shown that EGSs efficiently direct human RNase P to cleave the mRNA sequence encoding the thymidine kinase (TK) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in vitro (16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A reduction of 50–70% in the TK mRNA and protein expression was observed in HSV-1-infected cells expressing the EGSs. Targeted cleavage of mRNA by RNase P using EGSs provides a unique approach to inactivate any RNA of known sequence expressed in vivo. Further studies aimed at increasing the targeting activity of the EGSs are needed to develop the EGS-based technology as a general tool for use in gene-targeting applications. Although little is known about the rate-limiting step of EGS-targeting reactions in cultured cells, we believe that binding of the EGSs to the target mRNA as well as the efficiency of cleavage are important for the efficacy of the EGSs. Indeed, recent studies on ribozymes and antisense phosphothioate molecules suggest that binding of these molecules to their target RNAs appears to be rate-limiting in vivo(17Lee N.S. Bertrand E.

In our previous studies, EGS RNAs were used to target a region of TK mRNA that is accessible to modification by dimethyl sulfate in cell culture and is also accessible to EGS binding (16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, the EGSs were expressed primarily in the nuclei by using the promoter of small nuclear U6 RNA (12Yuan Y. Hwang E. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8006-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Bertrand E. Castanotto D. Zhou C. Carbonnelle C. Lee N.S. Good P. Chatterjee S. Grange T. Pictet R. Kohn D. Engelke D. Rossi J.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 75-88PubMed Google Scholar). This design would increase the probability for the constructed EGSs to bind to its target mRNA sequence and co-localize with RNase P, which is localized exclusively in the nuclei. Under such conditions, it is possible that the EGS efficacy in culture cells is dictated by the overall efficiency (Vmax/Km) of the EGS-induced RNase P cleavage. If this is the case, increasing the targeting activity of the EGS may lead to a more effective inhibition of the target mRNA expression in cultured cells. In the present study, we employed an in vitro selection procedure (23Burke J.M. Berzal-Herranz A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Gold L. Allen P. Binkley J.

One of the selected EGSs exhibited a targeting activity at least 35 times higher than that of the EGS derived from the natural tRNA sequence. When the selected EGS was expressed in cells infected with HSV-1, a reduction of 95% in TK expression was observed. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of developing effective EGSs for gene-targeting applications. DNA template coding for substrate tk46 was constructed by annealing oligonucleotide OliT7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) with OliTK46 (5′-ACCGCGCAGCCTGGTCGAACGCAGACGCGTGTTGATGGCAGGGGTCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′). The DNA sequence coding for the EGS TK-Ser was synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using DNA that encodes yeast tRNASer as the template (27Drainas D. Zimmerly S. Willis I. Soll D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and was cloned under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The 5′ and 3′ primer were oligo1 (5′-GTTAACGTCGGACAGACTC-3′) and oligo2 (5′-AAGCTTTAAACGTCTGCGGCAGGATTTG-3′), respectively. DNA sequence coding for TK17 was generated by PCR using the selected substrate construct C17 as the template, and oligonucleotides TK24EGS (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTAACGTC-3′) and TK23 (5′-AAACGTCTGCG-3′) as the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. C-TK-Ser and C-TK17 were derived from TK-Ser and TK17, respectively, and contained point mutations (5′-UUC-3′ → AAG) at the three highly conserved positions in the T loop of these EGSs (see Fig. 4, A and C). The DNA sequences coding for EGS C-TK-Ser and C-TK17 were generated by introducing point mutations into the TK-Ser and TK17 sequences, as described previously (16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Human RNase P was prepared from HeLa cellular extracts as described previously (10Bartkiewicz M. Gold H. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Yuan Y. Hwang E. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8006-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). EGS RNAs and substrate tk46 were synthesizedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and further purified on 8% urea-polyacrylamide gels. Subsequently, the EGS RNAs and32P-labeled tk46 were incubated with human RNase P. The cleavage reactions were carried out at 37°C in a volume of 10 μl in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 20 mmMgCl2) (12Yuan Y. Hwang E. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8006-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cleavage products were separated in denaturing gels and analyzed with a STORM840 PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Double-stranded DNA templates were synthesized by mouse Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), from two DNA oligonucleotides, TK21 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGACCCCTGCCATCAACACGCGTCTGCGTTCGACCAGGCTGCGCGGTTAACGTCG-3′) and TK22 (5′-AAACGTCTGCGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCGACGTTAA-3′). TK21 contains the leader sequence for the substrate (Fig.1E) and the promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase. TK22 contains a randomized sequence indicated as (N)25 and underlined (Fig. 1E). The general strategy for the design of these oligonucleotides followed that described by Yuan and Altman (6Yuan Y. Altman S. Science. 1994; 263: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The RNA substrate was incubated at 37 °C with human RNase P in buffer A. The 3′ proximal cleavage product was separated in and isolated from a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel, and was then used as template for reverse transcription to generate cDNA, in the presence of 20 mm primer oligodeoxynucleotide, TK23 (5′-AAACGTCTGCG-3′), and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The cDNA was subsequently amplified by PCR with oligodeoxynucleotide primers TK21 and TK23 and was used to generate RNA substrates for the next round of selection. TK21, the 5′ primer for PCR, allows restoration of the T7 promoter sequence and the leader sequence of the RNA substrates. Initially, 20 nmol of the pool of RNA substrates, which contained the randomized sequence and were synthesized in vitro, were digested by human RNase P in a volume of 2 ml. In subsequent cycles of selection, 5 pmol of substrate were used and digested with the appropriate enzyme in a volume of 20 μl. During the first four cycles of selection, substrates were incubated for 120 min at 37 °C with 100 units of RNase P. During the final five cycles of selection, incubation time was shortened to 10 min. The amount of human RNase P used was reduced by 200-fold. This strategy allowed enrichment of all sequences that exhibited similar susceptibility to cleavage. After nine cycles of selection, cDNA that contained substrate sequences was cloned into pUC19 and sequence analysis was performed. RNase T1, nuclease S1, and RNase V were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences or Invitrogen. The procedures for mapping the structure of tk46-EGS complexes were carried out as described previously (6Yuan Y. Altman S. Science. 1994; 263: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Trang P. Hsu A.W. Liu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4590-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RNases were diluted and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with the tk46-EGS complexes in buffer A that had been supplemented with 10 μg of bulk tRNA from Escherichia coliin a final volume of 10 μl. Cleavage products were separated in 10% polyacrylamide gels that contained 7 m urea. RNA substrates were incubated in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 20 mmMgCl2) at 37 °C with human RNase P and cleavage products were separated on 8% denaturing gels and quantitated with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. Assays to determine kinetic parameters were performed under multiple turnover conditions, as described previously (29Herschlag D. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10159-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 30Kilani A.F. Trang P., Jo, S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liu F. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 77: 1083-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (see supplemental data available on-line). In brief, the cleavage of substrates was assayed in buffer at various concentrations of substrates, both above and below the Km for each respective substrate. The amount of substrates are in large excess to that of the enzymes to assure that saturation with the substrate was achieved in the multiple-turnover conditions (see supplemental data). Aliquots were withdrawn from reaction mixtures at regular intervals and analyzed in polyacrylamide-urea gels. Values ofKm(apparent) and Vmax(apparent) were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots. The procedures to measure the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of complexes of the EGSs and the substrates were modified from Pyle et al. (32Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 8187-8191Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In brief, various concentrations of EGSs were preincubated in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) for 10 min before mixing with an equal volume of different concentrations of substrate RNA preheated under identical conditions. The samples were incubated for 10–120 min to allow binding, loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and run at 10 watts. The electrophoresis running buffer contained 100 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2 (32Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 8187-8191Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The value ofKd was then extrapolated from a graph plotting percentage of product bound versus EGS concentration. The values were the average of three experiments. Constructs pTK-Ser, pC-TK-Ser, pTK17, and pC-TK17 were generated by placing the DNA sequences that coded for EGS TK-Ser, C-TK-Ser, TK17, and C-TK17 under the control of the U6 promoter, respectively (16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Human 143tk− cells were cotransfected with pTK116 (containing the neomycin-resistant gene) and the EGS plasmids, with the aid of a mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). At 48 h after transfection, neomycin (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium in a final concentration of 400 μg/ml. Cells were subsequently selected under neomycin for 2 weeks and were eventually cloned. The level of EGS expression in individual cell clone was determined by Northern analyses with probes complementary to EGSs. Only those cell clones that expressed similar levels of EGSs were used for subsequent experiments. Approximately 106 cells in a T25 flask were either mock-infected or infected with HSV-1 in 1.5 ml of Medium 199 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) as specified under “Results.” At 8–16 h after infection, cells were harvested and RNA and protein extracts were prepared as described previously (33Liu F. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5149-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA probes used to detect TK mRNA and the transcripts of the α47, Us10. Us11 genes were synthesized from pTK129 and pTK141, and RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (34Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The protected RNA products were separated in 8% urea-polyacrylamide denaturing gels and quantitated with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. The denatured, solubilized polypeptides from cell lysates were separated on 9% (v/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels cross-linked withN, N″-methylenebisacrylamide (16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The separated polypeptides were transferred electrically to nitrocellulose membranes and reacted with the antibodies against HSV-1 TK (16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or ICP27 (purchased from Goodwin Institute of Cancer Research, Plantation, FL). The membranes were subsequently stained with a chemiluminescent substrate with the aid of a Western chemiluminescent substrate kit (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. Quantitation was performed in the linear range of RNA and protein detection (e.g. 2-fold changes in RNA and protein samples result in a 2-fold change in signal bracketing the range of experimental values; see supplemental data). The RNA substrate tk46 used in the selection experiment contains a 5′ TK mRNA sequence of 46 nucleotides (Figs. 1E and4A). This sequence has been shown to be accessible to modification by dimethyl sulfate and, presumably, to EGS binding in mammalian cell culture (16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have previously showed that EGSs derived from ptRNASer can direct human RNase P to cleave tk46 in vitro and inhibit HSV-1 TK expression in cultured cells (16Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the cleavage reaction is inefficient compared with the cleavage of a natural tRNA substrate (i.e.ptRNASer). It is believed that the acceptor stem and D stem and loop sequences within a natural tRNA molecule are involved in tertiary interactions with different parts of the tRNA (e.g.variable and T stem and loop regions) and are important for folding of the tRNA and interactions with RNase P (7Altman S. Kirsebom L.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 351-380Google Scholar, 8Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The reduced susceptibility of the tk46-EGS complex to be cleaved by RNase P, compared with a natural tRNA, is probably a result of replacing the natural tRNA sequence at the acceptor and D stem regions with the tk46 and its complementary sequence in the complex of tk46 and the EGS. These substitutions may disrupt some of the tertiary interactions that are potentially important in maintaining the proper tRNA-like conformation and in recognition by human RNase P. Restoration of these interactions or introducing additional interactions by changing other parts of the EGS sequence, such as those resembling the variable region, and T stem and loop, may increase the susceptibility of the mRNA-EGS complex to be cleaved by RNase P. To generate EGSs that are highly active in directing RNase P to cleave tk46, a pool of chimeric, covalently linked tk46-EGS substrates that contain partially randomized sequences was constructed (Fig.1E) and selected for the ability to be cleaved by human RNase P (Fig. 1D). The chimeric RNA, with its 5′ region consisting of the tk46 sequence, contains the sequences that base pair with tk46 at the regions resembling the acceptor and D stem of a tRNA and, in addition, a randomized sequence of 25 nucleotides at the positions corresponding to the regions resembling the variable and T stem and loop regions (Fig. 1E). The anticodon region, which is dispensable for EGS activity (6Yuan Y. Altman S. Science. 1994; 263: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), was not included in the chimeric substrate (Fig. 1, C and E). The pool of tk46-EGS chimeric substrates was synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase. In each round of selection, the pool of RNAs was digested with human RNase P in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 20 mmMgCl2) and the 3′ cleavage products were isolated in denaturing gels. cDNA molecules were then synthesized and amplified from these RNA molecules by reverse transcription followed by PCR and used as the templates for synthesis of EGS RNA molecules for the next round of selection. The 5′ primer for the PCR reaction contains the tk46 sequence as well as the T7 promoter sequence and, therefore, allows the restoration of these sequences for the next cycle of selection. The stringency of the selection was increased at each cycle by reducing the amount of human RNase P and the time allowed for the cleavage reaction, such that only those substrates that were rapidly cleaved by the enzyme were selected. The cleavage efficiency of the substrate population of each generation was monitored (Fig.2A). Moreover, EGSs were also constructed from the selected population of each generation and tested for their activity to direct human RNase P-mediated cleavage (Fig.2B). These results indicate that the susceptibility of the chimeric substrate as well as the targeting activity of the EGSs increase with each selection cycle (Fig. 2). The selection procedure was repeated nine times, until no apparent enhancement of the cleavage efficiency of the substrate population was observed after a short period of incubation (10 min) (Fig. 2A). Twenty-four sequences coding for the EGSs isolated after nine cycles of selection were cloned and determined (Table I). These EGSs were divided into two sets based on their primary nucleotide sequences. Each sequence in set 1 either had the same sequence or extensive homology to other sequences of the same set. In contrast, the three sequences in set 2 did not exhibit significant sequence homology to each other or to those in set 1.Table IPartial sequences of 24 substrates obtained after selection with human RNase P In our selection procedure, the tk46-EGS chimeric substrates were selected for their susceptibility to be cleaved by human RNase P. To determine whether the selected substrates can be cleaved by RNase P, one of the selected substrates, C17, which is the most abundant selected sequence (Table I), was assayed for cleavage by RNase P. Kinetic analyses indicate that human RNase P cleaved substrate C17 as efficiently as ptRNASer (Table II), suggesting that C17 may possess proper tertiary interactions and conformations, which are found in natural tRNA substrate and are required for optimal recognition by human RNase P.Table IIMeasurement of the kinetic parameters [Vmax(apparent), Km(apparent), and Vmax(apparent)/Km(apparent)] in the RNase P cleavage of tRNASer or tk46 in the presence of different EGSsSubstrateKm(apparent)Vmax(apparent)Vmax(apparent)/Km(apparent)Kdμmpmol/minpmol μm−1 min−1nmptRNASer0.015 ± 0.0030.04 ± 0.0072.7 ± 0.4C170.020 ± 0.0030.06 ± 0.0083.0 ± 0.5TK mRNA (tk46)+ TK-Ser0.5 ± 0.090.03 ± 0.0050.06 ± 0.011960 ± 110+ TK170.3 ± 0.040.65 ± 0.012.2 ± 0.417 ± 2+ C-TK-SerNDND<0.0001950 ± 120+ C-TK17NDND<0.000115 ± 3+ TK-G0NDND<0.0001ND Open table in a new tab To analyze the relationship between the EGS sequences from the selected tk46-EGS substrates and the capabilities of these EGSs to direct human RNase P for targeting cleavage, an EGS sequence, TK17, was constructed from the sequence of C17. Substrate tk46 was incubated with TK17 in the presence of human RNase P, and the cleavage products were analyzed in denaturing gels (Fig. 3). Kinetic analyses of the cleavage reactions directed by the selected EGS TK17 as well as by EGS TK-Ser, which was derived from the ptRNASer sequence, were performed under multiple-turnover conditions. Under these conditions, the amounts of substrates were in large excess to that of the enzyme to assure that saturation with the substrate was achieved (see supplemental data). The values ofKm(apparent) and Vmax(apparent) as well as the overall cleavage efficiency [Vmax(apparent)/Km(apparent)] were determined (Table II). Under the selection conditions (i.e. buffer A), TK17 was extremely efficient in directing human RNase P to cleave tk46 (Fig. 3, lane 3) and was at least 2 × 104-fold more active than the EGS molecules (i.e. TK-G0) that were derived from the initial randomized tk46-EGS chimeric substrate pool (G0) (Table II). Moreover, in the presence of TK17, RNase P-mediated cleavage of tk46 was at least 35-fold more efficient than that in the presence of TK-Ser (compare lanes 3and 2) (Table II). These observations indicate that highly active EGS RNAs were successfully selected using the in vitro selection procedure. Because TK17 is among the most abundant sequence found after nine cycles of selection and exhibits highly active targeting activity among the selected EGSs tested (Fig. 3, Table II, and data not shown), this EGS was further characterized and expressed in tissue culture to determine its efficacy in inhibiting TK expression (see below). In our selection, the mRNA-EGS chimeric molecules were subjected to digestion by RNase P and selected for their susceptibility to cleavage by RNase P. As the selection proceeded, the EGS sequence in the chimeric molecule was selected for"
https://openalex.org/W1964754320,"Despite the importance of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA ligation to the essential physiological functions of the enzyme, the mechanistic details of this important reaction are poorly understood. Because topoisomerase II normally does not release cleaved DNA molecules prior to ligation, it is not known whether all of the nucleic acid specificity of its cleavage/ligation cycle is embodied in DNA cleavage or whether ligation also contributes specificity to the enzyme. All currently available ligation assays require that topoisomerase II cleave the initial DNA substrate before rejoining can be monitored. Consequently, it has been impossible to examine the specificity of DNA ligation separately from that of scission. To address this issue, a cleavage-independent topoisomerase II DNA ligation assay was developed. This assay utilizes a nicked oligonucleotide whose 5′-phosphate terminus at the nick has been activated by covalent attachment to the tyrosine mimic, p-nitrophenol. Human topoisomerase IIα and enzymes with active-site mutations that abrogated cleavage activity ligated the activated nick by catalyzing the direct attack of the terminal 3′-OH on the activated 5′-phosphate. Results with different DNA sequences indicate that human topoisomerase IIα possesses an intrinsic nucleic acid specificity for ligation that parallels its specificity for DNA cleavage.

For topoisomerase II to carry out its catalytic DNA strand passage reaction, it must be able to cleave and ligate the genetic material in a tightly controlled fashion. DNA cleavage, the first of these reaction steps, is required to open the nucleic acid gate that is used for translocation of the second helix (2Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog.

During the scission event, topoisomerase II forms covalent bonds between its active site tyrosyl residues and the newly generated 5′-DNA termini (10Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This covalent intermediate is known as the cleavage complex. The loss of cleavage activity arrests the catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II prior to its DNA strand passage event, thereby blocking all of the catalytic functions of the enzyme (5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Cells can tolerate the partial loss of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, if the bulk of the enzyme molecules in a given cell are prevented from cleaving DNA, that cell ultimately will perish from mitotic failure (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). DNA ligation, the second of these reaction steps, is required to reseal the nucleic acid break generated by cleavage. Ligation is necessary to maintain chromosomal integrity throughout the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle. If this activity is impaired, cellular levels of topoisomerase II-associated DNA breaks rise (2Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Baguley B.C.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Because these transient breaks can be converted to permanent double-stranded breaks by the actions of DNA tracking systems, high levels of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes can initiate recombination events that generate chromosomal aberrations such as insertions, deletions, and translocations (2Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 495-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). When the concentration of these permanent DNA breaks overwhelms the cell, programmed death pathways are triggered (15Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 18Kaufmann S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of ligation by even a few molecules of topoisomerase II has the potential to instigate a number of deleterious physiological effects. The potentially lethal nature of topoisomerase II has led to the development of several clinically important anticancer drugs that target the enzyme (2Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Li T.K. Liu L.F.

Many of these drugs increase levels of topoisomerase II-associated DNA breaks specifically by inhibiting the DNA ligation reaction of the enzyme (2Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Osheroff N.

Sinding J. Andersen A.H. Alsner J. Jensen P.B. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of DNA ligation to the physiological and pharmacological functions of topoisomerase II, many critical issues have yet to be addressed. One of the more intriguing questions relates to the nucleic acid specificity of the enzyme. Is the specificity of topoisomerase II embodied entirely in its cleavage step, or does the enzyme also possess an intrinsic nucleic acid specificity for DNA ligation? It has long been known that topoisomerase II cuts DNA at a unique spectrum of sites. Because the enzyme forms a covalent attachment with its cleaved DNA intermediate and does not release products prior to resealing the nucleic acid break (10Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), topoisomerase II has evolved to ligate only those DNA sequences that it previously has cut. Thus, it is not clear whether the enzyme also maintains a built-in nucleic acid specificity for ligation. In other words, does topoisomerase II simply ligate DNA molecules because they have been cut by its scission reaction, or does it rejoin them because it has a distinct ability to recognize those molecules? Several experimental approaches have been used to study the DNA ligation reaction of topoisomerase II (12Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6157-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Bromberg K.D. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8410-8418Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, these approaches all suffer from the same shortcoming: they are restricted by the fact that topoisomerase II must cleave the initial DNA substrate before ligation can be monitored. This requirement has made it impossible to address the specificity of the ligation reaction separately from that of DNA cleavage. Therefore, to overcome the limitation of existing systems, a cleavage-independent topoisomerase II DNA ligation assay was developed. This system monitors the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to ligate a nicked oligonucleotide whose 5′-phosphate terminus has been activated by covalent attachment to the tyrosine mimic, p-nitrophenol. The results provide strong evidence that the human enzyme possesses an intrinsic nucleic acid specificity for DNA ligation. Furthermore, this ligation specificity parallels the sequence preference for cleavage and appears to be driven by chemical steps rather than the binding affinity of the enzyme for its DNA substrate. The protocol was similar to that described previously for the synthesis of 3′-pNP-linked DNA (28Woodfield G. Cheng C. Shuman S. Burgin A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3323-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 1-μmol scale, base-deprotected in concentrated NH4OH at 50 °C for 16 h, and driedin vacuo. Dried pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 100 mm MES (pH 5.5) and 2 mm MgCl2, and any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of 200 μl of 3 mp-nitrophenol (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) in acetonitrile and 0.048 g of 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethycarbodiimide-HCl (Aldrich) were added, and the resulting mixture was shaken at room temperature for 12 h. The aqueous layer was extracted three times with 500 μl of ethyl acetate, and DNA was ethanol-precipitated from the aqueous layer. The 5′-derivatized DNA was purified by anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography using a Dionex DNA-PAC column, 0–1m NH4Cl gradient buffered in 50 mmphosphate, pH 7.0. Pure fractions were concentrated in vacuoand stored in H2O at −20 °C. The following oligonucleotides were prepared on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. 1) A 47-mer corresponding to residues 80–126 of pBR322 and its complementary oligonucleotide. The sequences of the top and bottom strands were 5′-CCGTGTATGAAATCTAACAATG↓CGCTCATCGTCATCCTCGGCACCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGGTGCCGAGGATGACGATG↓AGCGCATTGTTAGATTTCATACACGG-3′, respectively. 2) A 48-mer corresponding to residues 1044–1091 of the MLL oncogene and its complementary oligonucleotide. The sequences of the top and bottom strands were 5′-TGAGCTATGATTGTACCACTGCAG↓TCCAGCCTGGGTGACAAAGCAAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTTGCTTTGTCACCCAGGC↓TGGACTGCAGTGGTACAATCATAGCTCA-3′, respectively. Points of DNA cleavage mediated by topoisomerase II in these two sequences are denoted by arrows. 3) A 50-mer corresponding to residues 31–80 of pBR322 and its complementary oligonucleotide. The sequences of the top and bottom strands were 5′-GCTTTAATGCGGTAGTTTATCACAGTTAAATTGCTAACGCAGTCAGGCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCCTGACTGCGTTAGCAATTTAACTGTGATAAACTACCGCATTAAAGC-3′, respectively. This sequence contains no cleavage site for topoisomerase II. Oligonucleotides spanning the 5′ terminus to the point of topoisomerase II scission on the top strand (arbitrarily, positions 31–55 in the third sequence) were synthesized, labeled on their 5′ termini with [γ-32P]phosphate, and purified as described previously (29Wilstermann A.M. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17727-17731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides spanning the point of scission to the 3′ terminus on the top strand were synthesized and activated with a 5′-terminal p-nitrophenol as described above. When necessary, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and [α-32P]3′-dATP were used to label single-stranded oligonucleotides on their 3′ termini. Activated DNA substrates were annealed by incubating equimolar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides at 70 °C for 10 min and cooling to 25 °C. Recombinatorial PCR was used to mutate the active site Tyr (Tyr-805) of the human TOP2αgene (30Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 62-66PubMed Google Scholar). A 736-bp fragment containing the codon for Tyr-805 was excised from YEpWOB6 (31Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar) with restriction endonucleasesKpnI and AvrII and subcloned into Litmus 28, yielding pLIT28TOP2α. PCR was carried out using the primer 5′-GGACTAGCAGAATCCTTGCCACCATGTAGCCTGGTACC-3′ and the overlapping (denoted by underline) mutagenic primers 5′-GGCAAGGATTCTGCTAGTCCACGATTCATCTTTACAATGCTCAGC-3′ (Tyr → Phe) or 5′-GGCAAGGATTCTGCTAGTCCACGAGCCATCTTTACAATGCTCAGC-3′ (Tyr → Ala). Altered codons are indicated in boldface. The mutagenized fragments were reinserted into YEpWOB6, and the sequences of the inserts and DNA junctions were confirmed. Wild-type human topoisomerase IIα was expressed and purified fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (31Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutant human topoisomerase IIα proteins containing an active site Phe (Y805F) or Ala (Y805A) were purified as above from an isogenic yeast strain carrying the top2-4 temperature-sensitive allele at the TOP2 chromosomal locus (33Holm C. Goto T. Wang J.C. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 41: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The TOP2-4 enzyme is inactive above 35 °C. Thus, the use of this strain eliminates any possible contaminating DNA cleavage by yeast topoisomerase II in ligation assays that used enzymes with altered active sites. DNA ligation reactions contained 200 nm wild-type or mutant human topoisomerase IIα and 10 nm activated nicked oligonucleotide in a total of 20 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 135 mm KCl, 7.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol). Ligation was initiated by the addition of topoisomerase IIα. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and ligation was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by 1 μl of 375 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Samples were digested with proteinase K, ethanol-precipitated, and resolved by electrophoresis in 7 m urea, 14% polyacrylamide gels. DNA ligation products were visualized and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). DNA cleavage assays were carried out as described previously (29Wilstermann A.M. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17727-17731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 200 nm wild-type human topoisomerase IIα and 10 nm double-stranded oligonucleotide in 20 μl of reaction buffer. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and cleavage intermediates were trapped by adding 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by 1 μl of 375 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Samples were treated and analyzed as described above for ligation reactions. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to monitor activated oligonucleotide binding to topoisomerase II. The reactions contained 0–200 nmY805F human topoisomerase IIα and 10 nm activated nicked oligonucleotide in 20 μl of reaction buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and loaded directly onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Samples were visualized and quantified as described above. Although the ability to catalyze efficient DNA ligation is critical to the essential functions of topoisomerase II, the mechanistic details of this reaction are poorly understood. Consequently, several different assays have been developed to study the DNA ligation reaction of topoisomerase II. One assay traps a kinetically competent cleavage complex by manipulating the divalent cation, making it possible to monitor a unidirectional religation reaction (12Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6157-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Others follow ligation by shifting cleavage complexes to sub-optimal salt or temperature conditions (26Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Bromberg K.D. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8410-8418Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A final assay utilizes “suicide substrates” for topoisomerase II that enable a cleaved DNA segment to dissociate from the enzyme and allow the ligation of the initial site to a separate acceptor molecule (25Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these assays have provided useful information, they all are restricted by the fact that topoisomerase II must cleave the initial DNA substrate before ligation can take place. This requirement has made it impossible to address many aspects of the ligation reaction. To overcome the limitation of the above systems, a cleavage-independent topoisomerase II DNA ligation assay was developed (Fig. 1). This system utilizes a duplex oligonucleotide that contains an internal nick. The terminal 5′-phosphate at the nick is activated by attachment to ap-nitrophenyl (5′-pNP) moiety, which is designed to mimic the linkage between the active site tyrosyl residue of topoisomerase II (Tyr-805 in human topoisomerase IIα (34Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Liu L.F. Liu A.A. Tewey K.M. Whang-Peng J. Knutsen T. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar)) and the terminal 5′-phosphate of the cleaved DNA. Previously, it has been shown that type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases were able to ligate similar 3′-activated substrates (28Woodfield G. Cheng C. Shuman S. Burgin A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3323-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Pan G. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12397-12399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pan G. Luetke K. Juby C.D. Brousseau R. Sadowski P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3683-3689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The underlying rationale of the above system (Fig. 1) is that the 5′-pNP moiety can replace Tyr-805 as the leaving group. This allows topoisomerase II to catalyze a phosphotransfer reaction in which the terminal 3′-OH at the nick attacks the terminal 5′-phosphate and seals the DNA break. By activating the 5′-phosphate with a synthetic group rather than the active-site tyrosine of the enzyme, it should be possible to monitor ligation under conditions that do not require prior cleavage of the DNA by topoisomerase II. The initial substrate used for the ligation assay was a double-stranded 47-mer (residues 80–126 from pBR322) that contained a strong, well characterized topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage site (10Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The activated nick was placed on the top strand at the bond normally cleaved by the enzyme (Fig. 1). Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage generates a 4-base 5′-overhang. The scissile bond on the complementary strand is shown for reference (Fig. 1, arrow). DNA ligation was monitored by following the conversion of the radiolabeled 22-mer (which terminates at the 3′-OH of the nick) to the full-length 47-mer. Results of a typical DNA ligation assay are shown in Fig.2. In the presence of wild-type human topoisomerase IIα, ∼40% of the activated DNA substrate was ligated over a 48-h time course. No ligation was observed in the absence of enzyme, indicating that strand sealing was being catalyzed by topoisomerase II. To ensure that ligation was completely independent of cleavage, two mutant human enzymes that lacked their active-site tyrosyl residues were generated. These mutant enzymes contained either phenylalanine (Y805F) or an alanine (Y805A) in place of Tyr-805. Neither displayed any ability to cleave pBR322 plasmid DNA or the oligonucleotide substrate (data not shown). Both mutant enzymes were able to catalyze the ligation reaction (Fig.2). The Y805F enzyme was ∼2-fold more efficient than wild-type topoisomerase II and ligated ∼80% of the activated oligonucleotide substrate over the course of the assay. The mechanistic basis for the superiority of the Tyr → Phe mutant is not known. However, it may be related to the decreased steric bulk or increased hydrophobicity of a phenylalanine compared with a tyrosine. In contrast, despite the small size of alanine, Y805A topoisomerase II was ∼2-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme. To confirm that ligation of the oligonucleotide substrate was dependent on the presence of the 5′-pNP moiety, the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to seal the nick when the terminal 5′-phosphate lacked the activating group was determined (Fig.3). No ligation was observed in the absence of topoisomerase II or in the presence of the wild-type or mutant enzymes. In contrast, the non-activated nick could be sealed byEscherichia coli DNA ligase (Fig. 3). When topoisomerase II cleaves DNA, it creates a break with an enzyme-linked 5′-phosphate and a free 3′-OH (10Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To assess whether ligation of the activated substrate reflects this critical attribute of the enzyme, the ability of topoisomerase II to ligate a nick containing a 3′-pNP moiety and a free 5′-OH was determined. Neither the wild-type nor the Y805F enzyme ligated this substrate (data not shown; the Y805A enzyme was not tested). Topoisomerase II-mediated ligation of the activated substrate may proceed by two distinct reaction pathways (Fig. 4). In the first pathway, the enzyme catalyzes the direct attack of the terminal 3′-OH on the pNP-linked 5′-phosphate without going through a covalent topoisomerase II-DNA intermediate. In the second pathway, Tyr-805 (or in the case of the mutant enzymes, an alternative amino acid) displaces the activating pNP moiety prior to the attack of the 3′-OH. These two pathways can be distinguished because only the latter requires the formation of a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. To determine which ligation pathway is being utilized by human topoisomerase IIα, the activated 25-mer oligonucleotide was labeled on its 3′ terminus with [α-32P]3′-dATP (Fig. 4, left panel) and used to monitor covalent attachment to the enzyme. Covalent attachment shifts the labeled oligonucleotide to the gel origin (Fig. 4, right panel, arrow). A minor amount of covalently linked oligonucleotide (∼2%) was observed in the reactions that included wild-type enzyme. Levels peaked at 6 h (shown in the gel) and decreased at longer times. In contrast, no DNA was linked to the Y805F enzyme at any time over a 48-h time course (Fig. 4 and data not shown). The enzyme-DNA complex detected with wild-type topoisomerase II may represent a requisite intermediate in the ligation reaction or merely scission of a previously ligated product. To differentiate between these two possibilities, the terminal 3′-OH at the nick was replaced with a 2′-OH. Human topoisomerase IIα is unable to cleave a 2′–5′ linkage. 2S. D. Cline and N. Osheroff, unpublished result. Consequently, any covalent enzyme-DNA complex generated with the 2′-OH substrate would have to represent an intermediate formed prior to the ligation of the activated substrate, as opposed to cleavage of a ligated product. As seen in Fig. 4, neither the wild-type nor the Y805F mutant enzyme were able to ligate the activated substrate that contained a 2′-OH at the nick. Furthermore, no covalent topoisomerase II-DNA complexes were observed with either enzyme. 3Because the 2′-OH substrate cannot be ligated, it is possible that the enzyme forms a fleeting and unstable covalent bond with the 5′-DNA terminus as part of an abortive reaction. However, if this were the case, the pNP-DNA linkage would be hydrolyzed, which would liberate the activating moiety and decrease the size of the labeled DNA. Because no change in the mobility of the labeled substrate was observed (Fig. 4), this possibility was excluded.Therefore, it is concluded that topoisomerase II catalyzes ligation of the 5′-pNP oligonucleotide by a direct attack of the 3′-OH on the activated 5′-phosphate and does not proceed through a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. Despite the importance of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and ligation to genomic integrity, the mechanistic details of these reactions remain enigmatic. Type II topoisomerases display a reproducible but poorly understood site specificity for DNA cleavage (10Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol.

One of the more intriguing aspects of ligation is whether the enzyme also maintains an intrinsic specificity for DNA strand joining. Is all of the nucleic acid specificity in the topoisomerase II cleavage/ligation cycle embodied in the DNA cleavage reaction, or does ligation also contribute specificity to the enzyme? Because topoisomerase II normally rejoins only DNA sequences that are covalently attached to its active-site tyrosines (10Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the enzyme may require no special recognition of molecules to be ligated. Conversely, topoisomerase II may possess a distinct ability to recognize these molecules, and this recognition may contribute to the efficiency of ligation. Because DNA scission normally is a prerequisite for ligation, it has been impossible to address this important mechanistic issue. However, using the cleavage-independent ligation assay described above, it is possible to discern between these two alternatives. First, the ability of Y805F topoisomerase II to ligate three different activated oligonucleotides was determined (Fig.5, left panel). One was the pBR322 sequence used for all previous experiments, which contained a strong DNA cleavage site (10Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Another was a sequence from theMLL oncogene, which contained a weak cleavage site located proximal to a leukemic breakpoint (32Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 42Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar). The third was an oligonucleotide that contained no cleavagesite (denoted NCS) for topoisomerase II (10Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of the corresponding intact duplex oligonucleotides by wild-type human topoisomerase IIα is shown in Fig. 5, right panel. In all of the cases, rates of ligation by the Y805F enzyme paralleled the ability of wild-type topoisomerase II to cleave the intact sequences. Second, the terminal 3′-base at the nick of the pBR322 sequence was changed from a G to an A, C, or T, respectively. A corresponding change was made in the complementary strand of each oligonucleotide to maintain base pairing. Levels of cleavage for all three substrates were decreased compared with the parent sequence such that G > A > C ≈ T (Fig. 5, right panel). As above, the rates of DNA ligation reflected changes in scission (left panel). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that human topoisomerase IIα has an intrinsic specificity for DNA ligation that mirrors the specificity of its cleavage reaction. To address the possibility that the results in Fig. 5 simply reflect the binding specificity of topoisomerase II for different oligonucleotides (as opposed to an intrinsic specificity for ligation), the ability of the Y805F enzyme to bind each of the activated oligonucleotides was assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 6). Topoisomerase II displayed a similar affinity for all of the oligonucleotides examined. Furthermore, ligation assays were carried out at a 20:1 ratio of enzyme:oligonucleotide, a ratio (and concentration) at which all of the oligonucleotides are completely bound by the enzyme. This finding leads to two conclusions. First, the results shown in Fig. 5 reflect the specificity of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA ligation rather than a differential binding affinity for the oligonucleotide substrates. Second, the nucleic acid specificity of human topoisomerase IIα appears to be determined by chemical steps in DNA cleavage and ligation as opposed to initial DNA binding. To extend the above conclusions, the positional specificity for ligation within the pBR322 cleavage site was investigated. For these experiments, the activated nick in the oligonucleotide was shifted either two or four nucleotides downstream from the point of scission. As seen in Fig. 7, neither the Y805F mutant nor wild-type human topoisomerase IIα was able to ligate these nicks. This is despite the fact that the wild-type enzyme cleaved both activated substrates at the original point of scission. Thus, the specificity of topoisomerase IIα is sufficiently strict that even within a strong cleavage site, the enzyme must interact in the proper register to catalyze ligation. In conclusion, a cleavage-independent assay was developed and used to study the DNA ligation reaction of topoisomerase II. The results indicate that human topoisomerase IIα possesses an intrinsic nucleic acid specificity for ligation. This specificity appears to be driven by chemical steps rather than initial DNA binding and is maintained throughout the cleavage/ligation cycle of the enzyme. Because the enzyme does not normally release cleaved DNA intermediates (2Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.C. Q.

However, by contributing to the efficiency of DNA rejoining, specificity may play an important role in helping to maintain genomic integrity during the double-stranded DNA passage reaction of topoisomerase II. Finally, the cleavage-independent assay provides a unique platform with which to further dissect the mechanism of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA ligation and the action of anticancer agents that target the enzyme.

GATE differs from the known IFN-stimulated elements in its primary sequence. Preliminary analysis has indicated that the GATE-dependent transcriptional response requires the binding of novel transacting factors. A cDNA expression library derived from an IFN-γ-stimulated murine macrophage cell line was screened with a32P-labeled GATE probe to identify the potential GATE-binding factors. A cDNA coding for a novel transcription-activating factor was identified. Based on its discovery, we named it as GATE-binding factor-1 (GBF-1). GBF-1 homologs are present in mouse, human, monkey, and Drosophila. It activates transcription from reporter genes carrying GATE. It possesses a strong transactivating activity but has a weak DNA binding property. GBF-1 is expressed in most tissues with relatively higher steady-state levels in heart, liver, kidney, and brain. Its expression is induced by IFN-γ treatment. GBF-1 is present in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments. These studies thus identify a novel transactivating factor in IFN signaling pathways.

Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman and Hall, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar). ISG induction has been attributed largely to the activation of the well established Janus tyrosine kinase-signal transducing activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, wherein tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs regulate the expression of downstream genes directly (2Darnell J.E., Jr. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar, 3Stark G.R.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition to STATs, some members of the IFN gene regulatory factor (IRF) family regulate IFN responses (5Kroger A. Koster M. Schroeder K. Hauser H. Mueller P.P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J.

It is now well established that Janus tyrosine kinase 1 and Tyk2, recruited to the ligand-engaged IFN-α/β receptor, induce the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. These then associate with ISGF3γ (p48 or IRF-9), a member of the IRF family of transcription factors (8Bluyssen A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the published literature describes the ISGF3γ protein as p48, it will be referred to as IRF-9 in the light of the unified nomenclature suggested by the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research. This trimeric complex, known as ISGF3, migrates to the nucleus and stimulates transcription after binding to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) (2Darnell J.E., Jr. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar, 3Stark G.R.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In a number of tumors and viral oncogene-expressing cell lines, down-regulation of the physical levels or inactivation of the components of ISGF3 serves as a mechanism for evading the action of IFNs (9Wong L.H.

Aebersold R. Darnell J.E., Jr. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with IFN-γ causes a robust activation of IFN-α-induced gene expression and consequent biological responses (15Lewis J.A. Huq A. Shan B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4569-4578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Levy D.E. Lew D.J. Decker T. Kessler D.S.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This latter effect is achieved through an elevation of cellular IRF-9 levels (14Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D., Fu, X.Y.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, its delayed expression and sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibitors, unlike other IRFs, suggest that the IRF-9 gene is regulated in an atypical manner (18Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previous investigations from this laboratory have revealed the molecular basis for such regulation. Analysis of the murine IRF-9 promoter led to the discovery that an unusual IFN-γ response element, GATE, and its cognate transacting factors regulate the transcription (18Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These studies did not reveal the molecular nature of these factors. In the present study using the GATE binding property as a basis, we have identified a GATE-binding factor (GBF) from an IFN-γ stimulated macrophage cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that it codes for a novel protein, which we have named GBF-1. It regulates GATE-dependent gene expression in an IFN-dependent manner. GBF-1 homologs are present in other species. Although recombinant GBF-1 alone does not bind DNA on its own, its expression in cultured cells permits DNA binding. Thus, GBF-1 is a novel factor that mediates the pleiotropic effects of IFN-γ. This study uncovers a novel mechanism of IFN action.DISCUSSIONIFN-γ is central to a wide spectrum of biological responses in vertebrates, including immune cell regulation and antiviral, antimicrobial, and antitumor activities (24Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar, 25Kaplan D.H. Shankaran V. Dighe A.S. Stockert E. Aguet M. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D.

The Molecular Basis of Cancer. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia2001: 503-534Google Scholar). A number of ISGs that mediate IFN action have been identified using a variety of techniques (27Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 28Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). All IFN responses are attributed to the activation of Janus tyrosine kinase-STAT signaling pathways, a transiently activated process (2Darnell J.E., Jr. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar, 3Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3360) Google Scholar). Although the activation of STATs and subsequent expression of certain ISGs are independent of de novo RNA or protein synthesis, induction of several IFN-γ-regulated genes requires the synthesis of other protein factors (1Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman and Hall, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar, 28Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike IFN-α/β, the IFN-γ-stimulated genes are induced with variable kinetics (1Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman and Hall, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar) and often require new protein synthesis. Additionally, induction of certain ISGs does not correspond to the kinetics of STAT-activation and down-regulation (1Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman and Hall, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar, 28Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Thus, factors other than STATs regulate the expression of these “late induced genes.” Indeed, recent analyses have shown that IFNs can induce some genes in cells lacking STAT1 (29Gil M.P. Bohn E. O'Guin A.K. Ramana C.V. Levine B. Stark G.R. Virgin H.W. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Han Y.

Although most IFN-α-induced genes are not stimulated in the absence of Janus kinase Tyk2, a fraction of the IFN-β response is retained in the U1A cells that lack Tyk2 (31Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Recent studies withTYK2−/− mice also showed only a partial impairment IFN-α/β signaling in the absence of Tyk2 (32Karaghiosoff M. Neubauer H. Lassnig C. Kovarik P. Schindler H. Pircher H. McCoy B.

These observations indicate the presence of other potential IFN-regulated pathways and genes, although these could be a minor population relative to the number of total ISGs. Indeed a number of such factors, such as hXBP1, RF-X, IRF-1, class II transactivator (CIITA), and IFN-consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) represent the secondary mediators of signals (7Tamura T.

However, these factors can only partially account for the pleiotropic nature of IFN response, and additional undefined IFN-induced regulators may exist.We have shown earlier that the murine IRF-9 gene is regulated by a novel IFN-γ response element GATE (18Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Others have shown IFN-induced expression of the chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) (41Cremer I. Ghysdael J. Vieillard V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and major histocompatibility complex class IB (42Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29813-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) are mediated by novel elements that appear to be dependent on transcription factors other than ISGF3. To define the transacting factors that interact with GATE we have screened a cDNA expression library derived from an IFN-γ-stimulated mouse macrophage cell line, using a method based on the Southwestern approach (Fig. 1), and we identified the candidate cDNAs. One of these is a known transcription factor, C/EBP-β (22Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X., Hu, J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An independent study also confirmed that C/EBP-β stimulates GATE-regulated transcription (23Xiao W. Wang L. Yang X. Chen T. Hodge D. Johnson P.F. Farrar W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23275-23281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized a novel factor, GBF-1. GBF-1 exhibits the characteristics of a GATE-binding protein: it binds to GATE, it is an IFN-γ-inducible protein, and it activates transcription. It also activates only GATE-driven reporters, not other IFN-responsive promoters. The last observation indicates the specificity of GBF-1 in mediating IFN-γ-induced transcriptional responses.GBF-1 exhibits a weak DNA binding property. Bacterially expressed GBF-1 does not bind to GATE. There could be several reasons for this inability: the recombinant protein lacks appropriate post-translational modifications; it requires other cellular factors for binding to GATE; it may have lower affinity for GATE under the conditions of EMSA experiments. Because we have isolated GBF-1 on the basis of its GATE property (Fig. 1), it is surprising to note that it does not bind to DNA in an EMSA. The DNA binding screen differs from EMSA in the following respects. In the former method a multimerized GATE is used to detect DNA binding. In contrast, a monomeric GATE is employed in the latter. Multimerized GATE may support a low affinity binding of GBF-1, whereas a monomeric GATE might not. Furthermore, the Southwestern detection of DNA-binding proteins (Fig. 1) is an in situmethod, whereas EMSA is an in vitro method. However, after expression in the mammalian cells, GBF-1 was able to bind to DNA. Our previous studies identified two GATE-binding complexes, GIF-1 and GIF-2, in the murine macrophage RAW cells (18Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We were unable to assign which of these two complexes contains GBF-1 because our antibodies are incapable of neutralizing or supershifting. A better quality antibody is required for examining this aspect. A number of other IFN-regulated transcription factors such as ICSBP (IRF-8) and CIITA do not bind to DNA on their own but can activate transcription very well. They form complexes with other factors to activate transcription (43Bovolenta C. Driggers P.H. Marks M.S. Medin J.A. Politis A.D. Vogel S.N. Levy D.E. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Coligan J.E. Ozato K.

CIITA additionally possesses histone acetyltransferase and GTP binding activities required for its transactivating function (46Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Der C.J. Ting J.P.

Lisowska-Grospierre B. Mach B. Science. 1994; 265: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ICSBP was also discovered (49Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Mak W.H.

Although defined as a repressor of ISRE-dependent transcription (50Nelson N. Marks M.S. Driggers P.H. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), subsequent studies showed that it activates transcription in a context-specific manner (51Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T.

A C/EBP-β consensus sequence (CBS) is present in GATE (Fig. 5B) and is necessary for stimulating transcription in a variety of cells (22Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X., Hu, J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Xiao W. Wang L. Yang X. Chen T. Hodge D. Johnson P.F. Farrar W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23275-23281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The fact that GM-1, GM-2, and GM-3 do not respond to IFN-γ and have a disrupted CBS indicates that C/EBP-β binding site plays a large role in regulating this promoter. The fact that GM-1, GM-2, and GM-3 do not respond to GBF-1 indicates that it acts as part of the complex formed on CBS with C/EBP-β for promoting transcription (Figs. 1 and 5). The weak but significant transactivation of GM-13 construct by GBF-1 suggests that it mediates a minor fraction of the IFN-γ response in association with a weak complex formed with another protein at GATE. Thus, GBF-1 requires part of the CBS and the adjacent sites for driving gene expression. Consistent with this, GBF-1 synergistically induces GATE-dependent reporter in the presence of C/EBP-β. 3Q. Meng, J. Hu, S. K. Roy, A. Raha, J. Hu, J. Zhang, K. Hashimoto, and D. V. Kalvakolanu, in preparation.However, it is also possible that GBF-1 may interact with other proteins to generate unknown biological responses, which need to be investigated further. This may include both transcriptional and nontranscriptional functions, given its location in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. The observation that IFN-γ stimulates GBF-1-dependent gene expression significantly further suggests that an inducible post-translational modification regulates its activity. This observation is consistent with our earlier studies, which showed that inhibitors of protein kinases block IFN-γ-induced expression from GATE (18Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our recent studies show that inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation suppress IFN-induced gene expression (54Hu J. Roy S.K. Shapiro P.S. Rodig S.R. Reddy S.P. Platanias L.C. Schreiber R.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies with mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2-specific and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-specific pharmacologic inhibitors do not significantly inhibit GBF-1-dependent IFN-γ-stimulated induction of the GM-13 reporter (data not shown). This observation is also consistent with the absence of any potential mitogen-activated protein kinase-specific phosphorylation sites in GBF-1 protein. It is likely that other factors may control its phosphorylation status. This aspect is currently being studied.The immunocytochemical analyses in mouse and human cells revealed that GBF-1 was present both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This observation suggests that GBF-1 might mediate other unknown biological responses in the cells. We have described one of its functions in this study, namely, the GATE-dependent transcriptional activation. GBF-1 protein has a well conserved redox center. This domain may play a role in regulating the transcription. Interestingly, other transcription factors also possess redox domains or are modulated by redox factors. For example, the upstream stimulating factor (55Pognonec P. Kato H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24563-24567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), D0, a RIPE3b1-like transacting factor (56Read M.L. Masson M.R. Docherty K.

Future studies are required for an understanding of the contribution of the gluatredoxin-like domain to the transactivating function of GBF-1.GBF-1 is also an IFN-inducible gene (Fig. 8). The induction of the GBF-1 gene is not a cell line-specific effect because it is also induced in various tissues by IFN-γ, in vivo (Fig. 9). Preliminary studies show that GBF-1 protein is also induced by other proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 and -6 (data not shown). Therefore, its expression may be uniquely regulated by IFN-γ and other cytokines. A computer-aided search of published interleukin-1- or -6-inducible gene promoters for GATE-like elements did not reveal any strong homologies. The only partial homology we could find was to the C/EBP-β binding sites, which was consistent with the data shown in Fig. 5. On a similar note, we did not find GATE-like elements in the promoters of the published ISG promoters. It is likely that there could be a separate set of genes controlled by GBF-1. A separate investigation is required to resolve these issues. Finally, the other physiological roles of GBF-1 can be realized only after generating a knockout mouse. Our study assigned one function to this novel protein, i.e. an enhancement of IFN-stimulated gene expression through GATE. While this paper was in review a new report showed that monkey GBF-1 has membrane-bound prostaglandin E synthase activity (67Tanikawa N. Ohmiya Y. Ohkubo H. Hashimoto K. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Ito S. Watanabe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The functional relevance between this enzyme activity and IFN-γ-activated transcription needs to be investigated further. Finally, other transcriptional targets and binding partners of GBF-1 need to be defined. The interferon (IFN)1 family of cytokines regulates antiviral, antitumor, and immune defenses in the vertebrates by inducing expression of a number of cellular IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman and Hall, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar). ISG induction has been attributed largely to the activation of the well established Janus tyrosine kinase-signal transducing activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, wherein tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs regulate the expression of downstream genes directly (2Darnell J.E., Jr. Science. 1997; 27"

Here we investigated the role of interaction between Rhp51 and Rad22, the fission yeast homologs of Rad51 and Rad52, respectively, on the function of each protein. We identified a direct association between the two proteins and their self-interactions both in vivo and in vitro. We also determined the binding domains of each protein that mediate these interactions. To characterize the role of Rhp51-Rad22 interaction, we used random mutagenesis to identify the mutants Rhp51 and Rad22, which cannot interact each other. Interestingly, we found that mutant Rhp51 protein, which cannot interact with either Rad22 or Rti1 (G282D), lost its DNA repair ability. In contrast, mutant Rad22 proteins, which cannot specifically bind to Rhp51 (S379L and P381L), maintained their DNA repair ability. These results suggest that the interaction between Rhp51 and Rad22 is crucial for the recombinational repair function of Rhp51.

Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The nonhomologous end-joining pathway joins adjacent broken DNA ends, resulting in errors in the junction region. In contrast, the homologous recombination (HR) pathway takes advantage of the undamaged homologous DNA strands, resulting in accurate repair of DSBs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAD52 epistasis group genes are involved in HR pathway (3Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Deletion of bothrad22+ and rti1+leads to more severe defects compared with each single mutant, suggesting that the role of ScRad52 would be diverged to Rad22 and Rti1.

Lysates of E. coli cells harboring pET22 (12Kim W.J. Lee S. Park M.S. Jang Y.K. Kim J.B. Park S.D. J. Biol.

The beads were precipitated and washed six times with the same buffer. The protein complexes were eluted and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Methods and conditions for co-immunoprecipitation of Rhp51 and Rad22 in S. pombewild type cells are described by Kim et al. (31Kim W.J. Lee H. Park E.J. Park J.K. Park S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The hydroxylamine mutagenesis method was employed (34Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Colowick S.P. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.in: Methods in Enzymology. 194. Academic Press, San Diego1991: 302-308Google Scholar, 35Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Cold Spring Harbor LaboratoryMethods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 167-168Google Scholar) to introduce random point mutations into rhp51+ orrad22+ genes. Plasmid DNA pBD51-(102–365) and pAD22-(310–469) harboring Rhp51 residues 102–365 in pGBT9–2 and Rad22 residues 310–469 in pDP12, respectively, were subjected to mutagenesis. Each plasmid was incubated in 0.5 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m hydroxylamine) at 75 °C for 30 min and purified by spun-column. After amplification throughE. coli, the mutagenized pBD51-(102–365) or pAD22-(310–469) plasmids were transformed into S. cerevisiae Y190 harboring pAD22 or pBD51, respectively, for yeast two-hybrid screening. Each transformant was replica plated onto solid media lacking histidine. The colonies showing a His−phenotype were subjected to a β-galactosidase color assay. Plasmid DNAs were recovered from the white colonies and recloned into the same intact plasmid to eliminate mutations in plasmid backbone. The changes of nucleotide sequence in insert DNAs were determined using Sequenase version 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In case multiple mutations were found in a single clone, they were separated into each mutation by restriction enzyme digestion or site-directed mutagenesis. Complementation of methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and UV sensitivity of rhp51Δ and rad22Δ strains by mutant rhp51 and rad22 genes has been described previously (31Kim W.J. Lee H. Park E.J. Park J.K. Park S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We examined the association of Rhp51 and Rad22 in the wild type cell by co-immunoprecipitation. Fig.1A shows that Rad22 protein can be co-precipitated with Rhp51, indicating that these two proteins can form a protein complex not only when they are overproduced (31Kim W.J. Lee H. Park E.J. Park J.K. Park S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) but also at normal levels. We also confirmed their interaction by GST pull-down assay. Recombinant Rad22 protein was co-eluted with GST-Rhp51 fusion protein but not with GST protein (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 4), indicating that these two proteins can associate directly without the help of any other proteins in S. pombe. The interaction between Rhp51 and Rad22 was also visualized by yeast two-hybrid β-galactosidase plate assay (Fig. 1C). As expected, cells harboring both reciprocal sets of Rhp51 and Rad22 proteins fused with GAL4AD and GAL4BD turned blue. In addition, both proteins were self-interacting. Taken together, these results indicate that Rhp51 and Rad22 proteins directly associate both in vivo and in vitro and that each of them also self-associates. To determine the region of Rhp51 required for association with Rad22 or with itself, a yeast two-hybrid assay was employed using various truncations of Rhp51 fused with GAL4BD (Fig.2). For interaction with Rad22, the carboxyl-terminal two-third of Rhp51 (residues 102–365, fragment 2) was required, which encompasses the central RecA homology region and the carboxyl-terminal region. On the other hand, for self-association of Rhp51, a shorter fragment (residues 102–312, fragment 12) was sufficient. Therefore the carboxyl-terminal 53 amino acids appeared to have the residues critical for Rad22 binding. However, the amino-terminal region (residues 1–102), which corresponds to the region of ScRad51 responsible for the interaction with ScRad52 or with itself (18Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was not required for the Rad22 binding to Rhp51. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was also applied to verify the region of Rad22 responsible for the interaction with Rhp51 or with itself (Fig. 3). Fusion proteins of GAL4AD with truncations of Rad22 and GAL4BD with Rhp51 or with Rad22 were subjected to a β-galactosidase plate assay. As shown in Fig. 3, the regions for Rhp51 and self-association were completely separated in the Rad22 protein. For self-interaction, the amino-terminal region (residues 1–162, fragment 6) was sufficient, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region (residues 310–469, fragment 11) dealt with the interaction with Rhp51. However, as the fragment became shorter, the signals for Rhp51 binding progressively decreased, suggesting that the entire structure may also be required for the interaction with Rhp51 or for stabilization of the protein expression. To identify the significance of Rhp51-Rad22 interaction in recombinational repair, we designed a screening method to identify mutations in Rhp51 that disrupt the interaction with Rad22 and vice versa. Based on the binding domain mapping, we introduced random point mutations into plasmids pBD51-(102–363) and pAD22-(310–469) by the hydroxylamine mutagenesis method. In yeast two-hybrid screening using these mutant libraries as prey and pAD22 or pBD51 as bait, we isolated five Rhp51 and four Rad22 mutant clones that did not show a blue color. We determined the causal mutations by nucleotide sequence analysis, separated multiple mutations in a single clone into single mutations by site-directed mutagenesis, and thereby acquired five rhp51and four rad22 mutant genes carrying single point mutation. All five mutations of the rhp51 gene were localized in the central RecA-homologous core region (Fig.4A). None of the mutations was found in the conserved ATP-binding motifs (36Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) or the corresponding residues of putative RecA DNA binding sites (37Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Except for one mutation that resulted in the stop codon (Q228NS), all four mutations caused single amino acid substitution. As shown in Fig. 4A, G177S, C179F, Q228NS, and G282D completely impaired the Rad22 binding of Rhp51, whereas the L274P mutation reduced its binding ability. Western blot analysis revealed that all mutant proteins except Q228NS were expressed well (data not shown), indicating that the failure in interaction was not caused by the lack of protein expression. Interestingly, all four mutations (S377F, S379L, P381S, and P381L) were found in very close proximity, and two were different substitutions of the same amino acid (Fig. 4B), suggesting that this region could be a binding epitope for Rhp51. We performed two-hybrid analysis employing Rhp51, Rad22, Rhp54, Rhp55, Rhp57, Rti1, and the large and middle subunits of RPA. These results revealed that Rhp51 interacts with itself, Rad22, Rhp54, Rhp57, and Rti1, whereas Rad22 interacts with itself, Rhp51, and Rti1. However, we could not find the interactions between Rad22 and the large or middle subunit of RPA that have been reported in S. cerevisiae (data not shown). Our results were similar to those of Tsutsui et al. (38Tsutsui Y. Khasanov F.K. Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Bashkirov V.I. Genetics. 2001; 159: 91-105PubMed Google Scholar), except that the self-interactions of Rhp51 and Rhp57 and the interaction between Rhp51 and Rti1 were newly found. Based upon these results, we examined whether the mutant Rhp51 could interact with its binding partners other than Rad22. All five mutations had different effects on the interaction of Rhp51 with its binding partners (Fig. 5A). The Rhp51 C179F could not bind with any of the proteins examined, indicating that this cysteine residue could be crucial for the entire structure of Rhp51, for example, by disulfide bridge formation. Rhp51 G177S and G282D, which had failed to interact with Rad22, also did not interact with Rti1, a Rad22 homolog, suggesting that Rad22 and Rti1 may bind a similar epitope in Rhp51. Rhp51 G177S also did not interact with Rhp54. Rhp51 Q228NS, the nonsense mutation, did not interact with itself or Rti1 and showed reduced interaction with Rad22 and Rhp54. Rhp51 L274P interacted with Rhp57, Rad22, and Rti1 but not with Rhp51 or Rhp54. These results showed that none of the five mutants was restricted to a single interaction. However, given that Rad22 and Rti1 are homologs, Rhp51 G282D could be considered a Rad22-specific mutant. In our two-hybrid analysis, Rad22 interacted not only with Rhp51 but also with itself and Rti1, a Rad22 homolog (data not shown). We also investigated the interactions of mutant Rad22 with Rad22 or Rti1 (Fig. 5B). Rad22 S379L and P381L interacted with Rad22 and Rti1. On the other hand, Rad22 S377F and P381S did not interact with Rad22 and Rti1. These results suggested that S379L and P381L specifically disrupted the interaction of Rad22 with Rhp51, leaving other interactions intact. Immunoblot experiment revealed that Rad22 S379L, S377F, and P381S were not detected with our antibody (data not shown). However, because anti-Rad22 antibody recognizes the carboxyl-terminal region of Rad22, it is unclear whether the immunoblot results reflect the lack of protein expression. Rather, it is likely that the structural change of these three proteins may cause the failure in detection of protein by immunoblot. To investigate the significance of protein-protein interactions on the function of Rhp51, we examined whether the mutant rhp51 genes could rescue the DNA damage sensitivity of the rhp51 deletion mutant (Fig.6A). All five mutantrhp51 genes barely rescued MMS and UV sensitivity of therhp51 deletion mutant. The complementation efficiency of these mutant rhp51 genes were slightly better than an empty plasmid, suggesting that these mutations severely impaired the DNA repair ability of Rhp51. Interestingly, Rhp51 G282D, which is specifically unable to interact with Rad22 homologs, were biologically inactive, indicating that the interaction with Rad22 homologs would be indispensable for the DNA repair function of Rhp51. However, we could not evaluate the significance of the individual interaction between Rhp51 and other binding partners because of the lack of specific mutation that disrupted each individual interaction. We also examined whether mutant rad22 genes could rescue DNA damage sensitivity of rad22 deletion mutants. As expected, Rad22 S377F and P381S were unsuccessful in complementing MMS and UV sensitivity. However, Rad22 S379L and P381L, which were specific to the interaction with Rhp51, were biologically active in their DNA repair function (Fig. 6B). These results suggested that the interaction with Rhp51 might not be essential for the DNA repair ability of Rad22. The amino-terminal region of ScRad51, where sequence homology exists between eukaryotic Rad51 homologs but is missing in RecA, is known as a domain of self-interaction and for ScRad52 binding (18Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, recent studies of ScRad51 and HsRad51 argued that the amino-terminal domain is not required for the interaction with either Rad52 or Rad51 but is responsible for the DNA binding (39Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 40Krejci L. Damborsky J. Thomsen B. Duno M. Bendixen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Kurumizaka H. Aihara H. Kagawa W. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In our mapping, we also found the binding region of Rhp51 for the Rad22 or itself located in the broad regions spanning the central RecA homology region and the carboxyl terminus but not in the amino terminus. In addition, point mutations that affect these interactions were distributed throughout the central RecA homology region of Rhp51. Therefore it is likely that binding domains would be constituted by the cooperation of several domains or that distantly located residues might shape a single domain. A comparison of multiple interactions between mutant Rhp51 and its binding partners revealed that a single mutation could affect multiple interactions. Among the mutations, at least three mutations appeared to have a severe influence on the global structure of protein by substitution of a cysteine residue (C179F), by introduction of proline (L274P), or by the truncation of polypeptide (Q228NS). In contrast, G177S and G282D seem to be involved specifically in the interactions of Rhp51 with Rad22 and Rti1. Amino acid sequence alignment of Rhp51, ScRad51, and HsRad51 demonstrated that both Gly177 and Gly282 are well conserved in Rad51 homologs (Fig. 7A, Table I). Interestingly, the neighboring residues of Gly177 and Gly282 were found to be involved in the Rad51-Rad52 interaction in ScRad51 and HsRad51. Mutation in Phe259 of HsRad51, which corresponds to Phe281 of Rhp51, disrupted the interaction with HsRad51-HsRad52 in a GST pull-down assay (41Kurumizaka H. Aihara H. Kagawa W. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional modeling by similar mutational study in ScRad51 revealed that Gly210, Gly211, and Ala320, which correspond to Gly175, Gly176, and Ala284 of Rhp51, constituted a single Rad52-binding domain (40Krejci L. Damborsky J. Thomsen B. Duno M. Bendixen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly likely that residues around Gly177 and Gly282 of Rhp51 could also comprise a single domain that is responsible for the Rad22 binding.Table IMutations that affect similar interactions in Rhp51, ScRad51, and HsRad51Rhp51ScRad51HsRad51MutationEffectMutationEffectMutationEffectRad22G210CRad52G177SRhp54G211SRad54Rti1L274PRhp51L310SRad54Rhp54G282DRad22A320VRad52F259VRad52Rti1 Open table in a new tab Unlike broad mapping of Rhp51 domains, those of Rad22 for Rhp51 binding and self-association were separately located in the carboxyl and the amino terminus, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the Rad51-binding domains of ScRad52 and HsRad52 also exist in their C-terminal regions (17Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 42Shen Z. Cloud K.G. Chen D.J. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 148-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, the existence of mutations that specifically disrupt binding with Rhp51 (S379L, P381L) also supports the possibility that the carboxyl-terminal region indeed forms Rhp51-binding domain. Because the carboxyl-terminal region lacks sequence homology between Rad52 homologs, Rad51-Rad52 interaction, although conserved from yeast to human, is likely to be species-specific. Interestingly, sequence alignment of Rad22 and Rti1 demonstrates that two short regions in the carboxyl terminus of Rad22 (residues 334–346 and 365–384) have a relatively higher sequence similarity than other regions in the carboxyl terminus (Fig.7B). Moreover, Ser379 and Pro381residues are conserved between Rad22 and Rti1. Because Rti1 also binds with Rhp51, these two regions may serve as an Rhp51-binding domain of Rad22 and Rti1. The lack of Rhp51 binding in the short fragments of residues 310–380 or 366–469 (Fig. 3) suggests that both of these regions are required and that they might comprise a single Rhp51-binding domain. All five mutant Rhp51 proteins were unable to interact with at least two binding partners and were nonfunctional in DNA repair. Therefore, although the significance of each individual interaction is uncertain, some or all of such interactions are likely to be required for the proper functioning of Rhp51. On the other hand, four Rad22 mutants were divided into two groups. Rad22 S379L and P381L were specifically defective in interaction with Rhp51 and biologically active, whereas Rad22 S377F and P381S had neither protein binding ability nor DNA repair activity. The latter phenotypes could be the result of a lack of protein expression because Rad22 S377F and P381S were not observed in immunoblot. However, because Rad22 S379L, which is functional, was not detected either by immunoblot and our anti-Rad22 antibody recognized the carboxyl terminus region of Rad22, these phenotypes are presumed to be caused by a severe change in protein structure rather than by lack of expression. In our experiments, the significance of Rhp51-Rad22 interaction appears to be different for each protein. Impairment of this interaction significantly affected Rhp51 function (Rhp51 G282D) but not that of Rad22 (Rad22 S379L and P381L). We can postulate at least two possibilities for this discrepancy. First, Rad22 S379L and P381L may retain enough binding activity to complement in vivo, although their Rhp51 binding is undetectable by yeast two-hybrid analysis; this is probably because we employed a multicopy plasmid with an attenuated nmt1 promoter for the complementation assay. Second, Rad22 S379L and P381L may interact indirectly with Rhp51 via a protein that can bind to both Rhp51 and Rad22. Rti1, a Rad22 homolog inS. pombe, fits this assumption well. In our two-hybrid analysis, Rti1 was the only protein that could evidently bind to both Rhp51 and Rad22. In addition, Rhp51 G282D lost its ability to interact with Rti1, whereas Rad22 S379L and P381L could bind to Rti1. Therefore, it is plausible that Rad22 S379L and P381L might interact with Rhp51 indirectly via Rti1, resulting in no effect in Rad22 function. Our observation that interaction between Rhp51 and Rad22 is essential to the DNA repair function of Rhp51 suggests that there would be an essential but unknown role of Rad22 other than as a co-factor of strand exchange reaction. One possible role of Rad22 in terms of interaction with Rhp51 is that of a mediator to direct Rhp51 into the site of action, as there are a few reports that Rad52 homologs bind to the end of duplex DNA. However, because there is a controversy on this property of Rad52, this possibility will require extensive verification. We thank Drs.
