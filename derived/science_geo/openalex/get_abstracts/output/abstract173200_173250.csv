https://openalex.org/W2107057154,"A distinct subset of sensory neurons are thought to directly sense changes in thermal energy through their termini in the skin. Very little is known about the molecules that mediate thermoreception by these neurons. Vanilloid Receptor 1 (VR1), a member of the TRP family of channels, is activated by noxious heat. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of TRPM8, a distant relative of VR1. TRPM8 is specifically expressed in a subset of pain- and temperature-sensing neurons. Cells overexpressing the TRPM8 channel can be activated by cold temperatures and by a cooling agent, menthol. Our identification of a cold-sensing TRP channel in a distinct subpopulation of sensory neurons implicates an expanded role for this family of ion channels in somatic sensory detection."

https://openalex.org/W1599389506,"The first structure of a flavivirus has been determined by using a combination of cryoelectron microscopy and fitting of the known structure of glycoprotein E into the electron density map. The virus core, within a lipid bilayer, has a less-ordered structure than the external, icosahedral scaffold of 90 glycoprotein E dimers. The three E monomers per icosahedral asymmetric unit do not have quasiequivalent symmetric environments. Difference maps indicate the location of the small membrane protein M relative to the overlaying scaffold of E dimers. The structure suggests that flaviviruses, and by analogy also alphaviruses, employ a fusion mechanism in which the distal beta barrels of domain II of the glycoprotein E are inserted into the cellular membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2076718555,"Restricted and regulated expression in mice of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal CA1 neurons lowers the threshold for eliciting a persistent late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This L-LTP has unusual properties in that its induction is not dependent on transcription. Pharmacological and two-pathway experiments suggest a model in which VP16-CREB activates the transcription of CRE-driven genes and leads to a cell-wide distribution of proteins that prime the synapses for subsequent synapse-specific capture of L-LTP by a weak stimulus. Our analysis indicates that synaptic capture of CRE-driven gene products may be sufficient for consolidation of LTP and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic tagging and synapse-specific potentiation."

The mechanisms underlying these differences are unknown. We studied the subcellular location of (a) oxidase subunits and (b) functionally active enzyme in unstimulated endothelial cells. Confocal microscopy revealed co-localization of the major oxidase subunits,i.e. gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox, in a mainly perinuclear distribution. Plasma membrane biotinylation experiments confirmed the predominantly (>90%) intracellular distribution of gp91phox and p22phox. After subcellular protein fractionation, ∼50% of the gp91phox (91-kDa band), p22phox, p67phox, and p40phox pools and ∼30% of the p47phox were present in the 1475 × g (“nucleus-rich”) fraction. Likewise, ∼50% of total NADPH-dependent O2⨪production (assessed by lucigenin (5 μm) chemiluminescence) was found in the 1475 × g fraction. Co-immunoprecipitation studies and measurement of NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species production (cytochrome c reduction assay) demonstrated that p22phox, gp91phox, p47phox, p67phox, and p40phoxexisted as a functional complex in the cytoskeletal fraction. These results indicate that, in contrast to the neutrophil enzyme, a substantial proportion of the NADPH oxidase in unstimulated endothelial cells exists as a preassembled intracellular complex associated with the cytoskeleton.

First, several studies have suggested that NADPH-dependent ROS production in endothelial cells occurs continuously at a low level even in the absence of cell stimulation by extrinsic agonists (3Mohazzab-H K.M. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2568-H2572PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zulueta J.J., Yu, F.-S. Thannickal V.J. Hassoun P.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

In contrast, the neutrophil oxidase is inactive in quiescent cells, and the continuous “basal” activity observed in endothelial cells has no obvious functional correlate in neutrophils (13Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a substantial proportion of the ROS generated in endothelial cells appears to be intracellular (6De Keulenaer G.W. Chappell D.C.

Res. 2000; 86: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas neutrophil O2⨪ generation during phagocytosis is thought to occur in the extracellular (phagosomal) compartment. The mechanisms underlining these differences between endothelial and neutrophil NADPH oxidase are unknown. However, an obvious possibility is that the structural assembly and subcellular location of the enzyme in endothelial cells may be different from that reported for neutrophils. The neutrophil NADPH oxidase comprises a plasma membrane-bound cytochrome b558 (which is a heterodimer of one p22phox and one gp91phox subunit) and at least four cytosolic subunits, namely p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac1 (13Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During neutrophil activation in response to various agonists, the cytosolic subunits translocate to and associate with the cytochrome b558, a process that results in oxidase activation. In cell-free assays, both cytochrome b558 and the cytosolic subunits are required for oxidase activity. Based upon the above information, it has been assumed but not proven that the endothelial NADPH oxidase should also comprise a predominantly plasma membrane-bound cytochrome b558 with the other units present in the cell cytosol. Accordingly, NADPH-dependent O2⨪production (or “NADPH oxidase activity”) is detectable in crude membrane preparations such as particulate cell fractions spun down at 29,000 × g (16Smith K.R. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L442-L449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these data do not provide direct evidence regarding the precise location of functional enzyme complexes or which subunits comprise these complexes. Furthermore, they do not explain why “constitutive” activity should exist in unstimulated cells. In a recent study where p22phox and gp91phox location was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in rat endothelial cells, we found that both subunits appeared to have a predominantly intracellular localization, contrary to the above speculations regarding a mainly plasma membrane location (12Bayraktutan U. Blayney L. Shah A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1093-1911Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a range of complementary methods including confocal microscopy, plasma membrane protein biotinylation, subcellular fractionation, and co-immunoprecipitation to investigate (a) the subcellular location of all of the main components of the NADPH oxidase in cultured endothelial cells and (b) where the functional O2⨪-generating oxidase is located. The results indicate that a substantial proportion of the NADPH oxidase in unstimulated endothelial cells exists as a functional intracellular complex associated mainly with the cytoskeleton. Culture media, fetal calf serum (FCS), glutamine, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. Endothelial cell growth supplement, recombinant human epidermal growth factor, and gelatin were from Sigma. Porcine iliac arterial endothelial cells (PIEC) and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were kindly provided by J. Fabre's research group (King's College London) (17Yun S. Gustafsson K. Fabre J.W. Transplantation. 1998; 66: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). BAEC and PIEC were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were prepared according to established methods (18Piper H.M. Cell Culture Techniques in Heart and Vessel Research. Spinger-Verlag, Berlin1990: 178-204Crossref Google Scholar). HUVEC were cultured in 0.1% (w/v) gelatin-coated flasks in Medium 199 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, heparin (5 IU/ml), hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), penicillin (50 units/ml), endothelial cell growth supplement (50 μg/ml), and human epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). HUVEC were used at passages 2–4. Endothelial cell identity was confirmed by their characteristic cobblestone appearance, positive expression of von Willebrand factor, and Dil-Ac-LDL uptake (18Piper H.M. Cell Culture Techniques in Heart and Vessel Research. Spinger-Verlag, Berlin1990: 178-204Crossref Google Scholar). All cells were studied at the stage when they had just achieved confluence (i.e. were not proliferating). HL-60 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. They were differentiated to neutrophils by incubation with 1.3% Me2SO for 7 days (19Hua J. Hasebe T. Someya A. Nakamura S. Sugimoto K. Nagaoka I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 216-224PubMed Google Scholar). Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood using a Percoll gradient (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies directed against NADPH oxidase subunits and their sources were as follows. An anti-p22phox monoclonal antibody (mAb449) was a kind gift from Dr. A. Verhoeven (Central Laboratory of Blood Transfusion, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (20Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G.J.M. Meerhof L.J. van Zwieten R. Keijer J. Weening R.S. Roos D. Blood. 1987; 73: 1686-1694Crossref Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1 and against a 30-amino acid C-terminal fragment of gp91phox(Pep37) were kindly provided by Dr. F. Wientjes (University College London) (21Wientjes F. Segal A. Hartwig J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Separate rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant p47phox (R360) and p67phox (R1469), p22phoxholoprotein (R3179), and a 12-amino acid C-terminal fragment of gp91phox (R2085) were kindly provided by Dr. M. T. Quinn (Montana State University) (22Jesaitis A.J. Buescher E.S. Harrison D. Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Livesey S. Linner J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Woodman R.C. Ruedi J.M. Jesaitis A.J. Okamura N. Quinn M.T. Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Anti-p47phox and anti-p67phox monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The goat anti-CD31 (PECAM-1) and rabbit anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 polyclonal and the anti-VE-cadherin monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. For immunoblotting, equal amounts (25 μg) of protein were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk, PBS, 0.2% Tween 20. Membrane protein extracted from activated human neutrophils (a gift from F. Wientjes) was used as a positive control for p22phox and gp91phox expression. The protein extract from human phagocytic U937 cells, after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, was used as a positive control for the other subunits. Cell samples were prepared as described previously (24Li J.-M. Brooks G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2213-2224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, endothelial cells were cultured onto four-chamber slides precoated with 1% gelatin until nearly confluent. Cells were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized, and fixed with methanol/acetone (50% each, v/v). For staining with antibody to α-tubulin (Fig. 8), cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde plus 10% Me2SO, 1% glucose, and 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. Slides were blocked with 20% fetal calf serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS three times with gentle shaking and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted (1:50 to 1:250) in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution) were used as the secondary antibody and incubated for 30 min. Specific antibody binding was detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (green fluorescence) or TRITC-labeled (red fluorescence) extravidin. Normal rabbit or mouse IgG (5 μg/ml) was used instead of primary antibody as negative control in each case. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad 1024 system. Optical sections were taken at 0.5-μm intervals, and images were captured and stored digitally for analysis. Fluorescein isothiocyanate was excited with a 488-nm argon ion laser line, and TRITC was excited with a 543-nm green helium/neon laser line. The emission filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC were HQ 515/30 and HQ 580/40, respectively. To avoid bleed-through, while allowing optimal emission filters to be used, sequential acquisitions were performed (i.e. fluorescein isothiocyanate first followed by TRITC). Cell surface protein biotinylation and streptavidin-agarose purification of biotinylated proteins were performed as described previously (25Tanaka K. Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33979-33984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PIEC monolayers that had just reached confluence in 60-mm culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0), and EZ-link™ sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.5 mg/ml in PBS, pH 8.0; Pierce) was added for 20 min on ice. The solution was removed, and the cross-linking procedure was repeated. After aspiration, the remaining biotin was blocked with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS (pH 8.0) for 10 min on ice with occasional agitation. Cells were washed twice with PBS and scratched into 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were pelleted, rinsed, and resuspended in buffer A. Cells were sonicated for 2 × 15 s, and 1% Triton X-100 was added into the solution and extracted on ice for 20 min. Solubilized proteins were diluted 1:1 in buffer B (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors as described above) and incubated with 25 μl of prewashed streptavidin-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant containing nonbiotinylated proteins was removed into a new tube. The beads were washed four times with buffer B and once with PBS before resuspending in Laemmli sample buffer with 0.6% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled for 5 min to release bound, biotinylated proteins for immunodetection. To ensure that p22phox and gp91phox expressed on the plasma membrane were amenable to biotinylation, differentiated HL-60 cells and freshly isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (2 × 106/ml) were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 ng/ml for 30 min), and then underwent surface protein biotinylation in the same way as described for PIEC. Differential centrifugation based on standard protocols was used for isolation of subcellular fractions (26Hinton R.H. Mullock B.M. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 31-69Google Scholar, 27Mohazzab K.M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L815-L822PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent endothelial cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and scratched into a 12-ml Falcon tube. Cells were pelleted and resuspended (20 × 106/ml) in MOPS-KOH buffer (20 mm MOPS-KOH, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), EDTA (0.1 mm), leupeptin (2 μm), and pepstatin (2 μm). Cells were disrupted by quick freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by two cycles (20 s each) of homogenization (Polytron PT 2100) and two cycles of sonication at 100 W for 15 s on ice. The homogenate was quickly centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min to remove any possible unbroken cells. The nuclei-enriched fraction (N fraction) was pelleted by centrifugation at 1475 ×g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged for 15 min at 10,800 × g to obtain primary mitochondria and other large organelles (C fraction). The supernatant of C fraction was centrifuged for 15 min at 29,000 × g to obtain a pellet of submitochrondrial particles, smaller organelles, and some microsomes (D fraction). The supernatant of D fraction was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g to sediment a pellet of microsomes, microperoxisomes, and membrane fractions (E fraction). The supernatant of E fraction includes the soluble cytoplasmic protein (S fraction). All pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer and washed once again using the original centrifugation conditions before resuspending in 100 μl of MOPS-KOH buffer. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad kit. Proteins from each fraction (100 μg) were analyzed for NADPH-dependent oxidase activity by lucigenin chemiluminescence (see below). The rest of the protein fractions were dissolved in SDS buffer and used for immunoblotting. To evaluate the degree of “purity” of the different subcellular fractions, especially with regard to partitioning of the plasma membrane, a number of marker enzyme activities were assayed in each fraction. As a plasma membrane marker, 5′-nucleotidase activity was determined using a Sigma Diagnostic Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications of sample volumes. Fumarase activity (EC 4.2.1.2) and lactate dehydrogenase activity (EC 1.1.1.27) were used as marker enzymes for mitochondria and the cytosol, respectively. Their activities were measured spectrophotometrically according to the methods of Stitt (28Stitt M. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 359-362Google Scholar) for fumarase and Vassault (29Vassault A. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis.

Confluent PIEC were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and detached by scratching. Cells (4 × 107) were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer containing Hepes/Tris (20 mmeach), NaCl (0.12 m), KCl (5 mm), glucose (10 mm) at pH 7.4 plus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), EDTA (0.1 mm), leupeptin (2 μm), pepstatin (2 μm) and 2% Triton X-100. Cells were disrupted by quick freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by two cycles of sonication at 100 W for 15 s on ice. The whole cell homogenate was extracted on ice for 20 min. A proportion of the whole cell homogenate at this stage was kept for measurement of NADPH oxidase activity by cytochrome c reduction assay. The Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatant (Triton X-100-soluble fraction) was removed to a new tube, and the pellet (Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton fraction) was washed with Triton buffer to eliminate the residual soluble element (the supernatant from wash was reserved for the assay of residual NADPH activity). The cytoskeleton fraction was then resuspended in 0.5 ml of Triton buffer, and the soluble protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad kit. Aliquots of protein samples were boiled in SDS buffer for immunoblotting. O2⨪production by endothelial cell protein fractions was measured using either lucigenin (5 μm) chemiluminescence or cytochrome c reduction assay as described previously (9Sohn H.-Y. Keller M. Gloe T.

For chemiluminescence studies, we used a 96-well microplate luminometer (model Lucy 1; Rosys Anthos, Wals, Austria). Briefly, protein fractions were diluted in modified HEPES buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mmHEPES, and 1% glucose (pH 7) and distributed (100 μg/well) onto the microplate. NADPH (100 μm) and dark-adapted lucigenin (5 μm) were added into the well just before reading. Light emission was recorded and expressed as mean arbitrary light units/min over 20 min. The specificity of O2⨪ thus measured was confirmed either by adding superoxide dismutase (200 units/ml) or Tiron (10 mm), a nonenzymatic scavenger of O2⨪ to quench the O2⨪-dependent chemiluminescence. In some experiments, cell homogenates were preincubated with one of the following agents: (a) the flavoprotein inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (100 μm); (b) an NO synthase inhibitor, N-ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 100 μm); (c) a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, oxypurinol (100 μm); or (d) a mitochondrial inhibitor, rotenone (50 μm). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. For cytochrome c reduction assays, cell protein (final concentration 100 μg/well) diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red was distributed in 96-well flat bottom culture plates (final volume 200 μl/well). Cytochrome c(500 μm) and NADPH (100 μm) were added in the presence or absence of Tiron (10 mm) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cytochrome c reduction was measured by reading absorbance at 550 nm on a microplate reader. O2⨪production in nmol/mg protein was calculated from the difference between absorbance with or without Tiron and the extinction coefficient for change of ferricytochrome c to ferrocytochrome c (i.e. 21.0 mmol·liter−1·cm−1). Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed using methods described previously (33Li J.-M. Poolman R.A. Brooks G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H814-H822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The whole cell protein extract and Triton X-100-insoluble protein fractions extracted from PIEC were used for the experiments. Protein samples (250 μg in a final volume of 750 μl) were diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.05m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin.

The model accounts for the formation, expression, and propagation of the vitamin K-dependent procoagulant complexes and extends our previous model by including: (a) the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-mediated inactivation of tissue factor (TF)·VIIa and its product complexes; (b) the antithrombin-III (AT-III)-mediated inactivation of IIa, mIIa, factor VIIa, factor IXa, and factor Xa; (c) the initial activation of factor V and factor VIII by thrombin generated by factor Xa-membrane; (d) factor VIIIa dissociation/activity loss; (e) the binding competition and kinetic activation steps that exist between TF and factors VII and VIIa; and (f) the activation of factor VII by IIa, factor Xa, and factor IXa. These additions to our earlier model generate a model consisting of 34 differential equations with 42 rate constants that together describe the 27 independent equilibrium expressions, which describe the fates of 34 species. Simulations are initiated by “exposing” picomolar concentrations of TF to an electronic milieu consisting of factors II, IX, X, VII, VIIa, V, and VIIII, and the anticoagulants TFPI and AT-III at concentrations found in normal plasma or associated with coagulation pathology. The reaction followed in terms of thrombin generation, proceeds through phases that can be operationally defined as initiation, propagation, and termination. The generation of thrombin displays a nonlinear dependence upon TF, AT-III, and TFPI and the combination of these latter inhibitors displays kinetic thresholds. At subthreshold TF, thrombin production/expression is suppressed by the combination of TFPI and AT-III; for concentrations above the TF threshold, the bolus of thrombin produced is quantitatively equivalent. A comparison of the model with empirical laboratory data illustrates that most experimentally observable parameters are captured, and the pathology that results in enhanced or deficient thrombin generation is accurately described.

The blood coagulation system is composed of a set of pro- and anticoagulant systems that maintain the balance of blood fluidity. Defects in this balance can result in either thrombotic or bleeding tendencies. Qualitative or quantitative alterations in this hemostatic balance can have devastating effects, producing hemorrhagic diseases (hemophilia A, hemophilia B, hemophilia C, para-hemophilia, hypoprothrombinemia) (1Mannucci P.M.

The initial protein components involved in the essential coagulation cascade and its stoichiometric regulation includes 10 species. However, during thrombin generation by the tissue factor (TF)-initiated reaction, multiple transitory species are produced, bringing the total to 27, many of which play multiple roles at different stages of the process. An example of these multiple roles is presented in the activation of prothrombin. The product, thrombin, participates in feed back processes leading to its own generation by activating factor V, factor VIII, and factor VII; using a different binding partner, it initiates the anticoagulation cascade through protein C activation (11Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is in the balance of this complex interplay that the response to each injury or stimulus is determined. antithrombin III tissue factor pathway inhibitor tissue factor phospholipid vesicles composed of 25% phosphatidylserine and 75% phosphatidylcholine The rational design of therapeutic antihemorrhagic and antithrombotic strategies has primarily relied upon intuitive approaches to judge how qualitative or quantitative alterations in a natural product or a therapeutic agent might behave in this complex reaction milieu. These estimates are usually made on the basis of oversimplifications, which ignore the dynamic interplay between coagulation factor reactions; consequently, judgments are made based upon the presumption of isolated defective functions. In even the simplest cases, such as the single gene deficiencies (hemophilia A or B) in which a fundamental knowledge of the defect is available, less than satisfactory algorithms exist for determining the dosage required of the missing factor. Even less obvious is the case in which an otherwise “normal” individuals present with complex disorders such as venous or coronary thrombosis, or an unaccounted for bleeding diathesis (12Zoller B. Garcia de Frutos P. Hillarp A. Dahlback B. Haematologica. 1999; 84: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar, 13de Moerloose, P., Bounameaux, H. R., and Mannucci, P. M. (1998) Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis(1998) 24, 321–327Google Scholar). A more complete understanding of the interplay between the pro- and anticoagulant factors involved in hemostasis should permit the kinetics of “composite” deficiencies to be better understood. Toward this end, we have extended our numerical model (14Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23367-23373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the thrombin generation reaction by including the stoichiometric inhibitor systems and updating the mechanism to the current level of knowledge. Over the past 25 years, a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the inventory of the proteins and the associated biophysical and enzymologic processes involved in blood clotting has been developed through the efforts of numerous investigators (15Mann K.G. Gaffney D. Bovill E.G. Lichtman M.A. Coller B.S. Kipps T.J. Williams Hematology. 5th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1206-1226Google Scholar). A large body of rigorously obtained data describes association states, membrane binding thermodynamics, enzyme complex assembly kinetics, and reaction kinetics for the inventory of processes (16Lawson J.H. Krishnaswamy S. Butena S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 177-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This in turn has led to the description of an increasingly overwhelming network of pathways and interactions (17Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Broze G.J., Jr. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 19Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). In the face of this complexity, intuition frequently leads to paradox. For example, increasing the concentration of a procoagulant factor such as factor VII “should” lead to an increase in thrombin generation and decreased clotting time. In empirical studies and in laboratory experiments, the opposite is true (20van't Veer C. Golden N.J. Mann K.G. Blood. 2000; 95: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Computational modeling provides the opportunity to integrate and quantify reaction details, which, in turn, aids in the design of the more expensive empirical “wet” experiments. Rapid advances in mathematical algorithm development and computational power have enabled modeling of ever more complex systems (21Nesheim M.E. Tracy R.P. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

These technologies, when coupled with the expanding base of empirically defined mechanism, allow the development of rational models that predict the product generation profiles to be expected for diverse experimental conditions. The construction of models also provide the ability to look into reactions at a “microscopic” level, at which the concentrations of substrates and products being investigated are below detection limits accessible through direct analysis. Such evaluations can provide estimations of the initiating events in a process and lead to the design of laboratory experiments that are designed to explore unforeseen computational results. Our laboratory provided one of the first computational models successful in predicting empirical outcomes in the biochemistry of the TF-initiated procoagulant pathway (14Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23367-23373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent empirical studies have evaluated the influence of combinations of the stoichiometric and dynamic anticoagulant systems on the thrombin generation process (27Butenas S. van't Veer C.

Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which adequately account for empirical observations, has enabled undertaking the integration of the stoichiometric anticoagulation system into a more comprehensive model of the coagulation system. The present model includes 34 species, 42 rate constants, and accounts for the peculiar inhibitory “thresholds” produced by combinations of TFPI and AT-III. A software package was written to enable rapid transformation of chemical equilibrium expressions to the necessary time-dependent partial differential equations required for this model and their solution. The software package Speed Rx utilizes an Internet-based interface with a generally applicable fourth order Runge-Kutta solver that provides solutions to a family of time-dependent differential equations. After the user inputs the chemical equations, initial concentrations, and rate constants for all relevant species and steps, the software generates a series of time-dependent concentration profiles for any/all reactants over any time frame of interest. A set of simulations can be developed representing titration of individual species or varying individual rate constants to represent qualitative or quantitative alterations in the reactant. The results of each simulation are stored in a relational data base architecture utilizing SQL standards. For this work all computations were carried out on a Pentium III computer running LINUX (RedHat version 7.1); however, the software may be installed on any computer capable of running UNIX. The validity of our implementation of the fourth order Runge-Kutta solver was tested through use of the freely available backward differentiational formula in the livermore solver for ordinary differential equations (LSODE) that utilizes third order polynomials (www.llnl.gov/casc/odepak). LSODE utilizes dynamic step sizing and a matrix of partial differential equations to approach the solution. Utilizing the Livermore algorithm, we were able to demonstrate exact correspondence to the solutions obtained with our Runge-Kutta solver. This correspondence was found between both simple chemical systems and numerous pre-publication versions of the coagulation model. The present effort is based upon our prior publications describing a procoagulant model of blood coagulation (14Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23367-23373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive revisions were made to incorporate additional steps to our procoagulant system. In all cases the processes and rate constants described are representative of reaction paths and rates experimentally observed under the condition of saturating phospholipid concentrations. In the instances for which experimental data are not available for the processes modeled, rate constants and mechanisms were incorporated by analogy with similar processes within the coagulation cascade. The entire model, in tabular form, is presented as Table I. The rate constants are presented in Table II, and the initial (“normal”) concentrations for all reactants are presented in Table III.Table IChemical expressions for the coagulation cascadeLineChemical expressions1TF + VII <1–2> TF==VII2TF + VIIa <3–4> TF==VIIa3TF==VIIa + VII-5 > TF==VIIa + VIIa4Xa + VII-6 > Xa + VIIa5IIa + VII-7 > IIa + VIIa6TF==VIIa + X <8–9> TF==VIIa==X-10 > TF==VIIa==Xa7TF==VIIa + Xa <11–12> TF==VIIa==Xa8TF==VIIa + IX<13–14>TF==VIIa==IX-15 > TF==VIIa + IXa9Xa + II-16 > Xa + IIa10IIa + VIII-17 > IIa + VIIIa11VIIIa + IXa <18–19> IXa==VIIIa12IXa==VIIIa + X <20–21> IXa==VIIIa==X-22 > IXa==VIIIa + Xa13VIIIa <23–24> VIIIa1 · L + VIIIa214IXa==VIIIa==X-25 > VIIIa1 · L + VIIIa2 + X + IXa15IXa==VIIIa-25 > VIIIa1 · L + VIIIa2 + IXa16IIa + V-26 > IIa + Va17Xa + Va <27–28> Xa==Va18Xa==Va + II <29–30> Xa==Va==II-31 > Xa==Va + mIIa19mIIa + Xa==Va-32 > IIa + Xa==Va20Xa + TFPI <33–34> Xa==TFPI21TF==VIIa==Xa + TFPI <35–36> TF==VIIa==Xa==TFPI22TF==VIIa + Xa==TFPI-37 > TF==VIIa==Xa==TFPI23Xa + ATIII-38 > Xa==ATIII24mIIa + ATIII-39 > mIIa==ATIII25IXa + ATIII-40 > IXa==ATIII26IIa + ATIII-41 > IIa==ATIII27TF==VIIa + ATIII-42 > TF==VIIa==ATIIIThe notation -2> signifies a forward reaction dictated by rate constant “2” (Table II).

This process requires that the R3 photoreceptor precursor of each ommatidium have a higher level of Frizzled signaling than its neighboring R4 precursor. We show that two cadherin superfamily members, Fat and Dachsous, and the transmembrane/secreted protein Four-jointed play important roles in this process. Our data support a model in which the bias of Frizzled signaling between the R3/R4 precursors results from higher Fat function in the precursor cell closer to the equator, which becomes R3. We also provide evidence that positional information regulating Fat action is provided by graded expression of Dachsous across the eye and the action of Four-jointed, which is expressed in an opposing expression gradient and appears to modulate Dachsous function."

Recent research has also focused upon a potential physiological role of Hb relating to its interactions with nitric oxide (NO) during conditions of oxidative stress. Several examples of physiologically important reactions involving Hb and NO now exist: 1) Bacterial and yeast flavohemoglobins scavenge NO resulting from oxidative bursts, protecting these cells from the host immune response to infection (1Gardner P.R.

Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). In addition, there is mounting evidence that Hbs are involved in cell survival during hypoxia. Human neuroglobin (NGb) has recently been linked to tissue protection during hypoxic ischemia injury (10Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 47: 677-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition to potentially new physiological functions, hxHbs use an alternative mechanism to regulate ligand binding which involves reversible intramolecular coordination of the heme iron; prior to the discovery of this mechanism, an open coordination site was believed necessary for reversible ligand binding in Hbs (Fig. 1). Despite this apparent hindrance to entering ligands, hxHbs are capable of reversibly binding oxygen and other heme ligands with unusually high affinities (21Hargrove M. Brucker E. Stec B. Sarath G. Arredondo-Peter R. Klucas R. Olson J. Phillips G. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1005-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The molecular details of the hexacoordination mechanism are not known with certainty. Biophysical examination of the details of this reaction is necessary to distinguish whether hexacoordination is a mechanism for regulating ligand affinity or a requirement for a novel biochemical reaction. Despite the prevalence of hxHbs, the physiological function(s) of these proteins is unknown. However, there is growing evidence linking hxHbs with NO scavenging and a protective role during hypoxia (10Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 21Hargrove M. Brucker E. Stec B. Sarath G. Arredondo-Peter R. Klucas R. Olson J. Phillips G. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1005-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). If hxHbs serve to protect cells from damage during the generation of NO or other reactive oxygen species, their expression in a wide range of tissues could be expected. Plants are known to contain two or three different hxHbs expressed in a variety of tissues (11Taylor E.R. Nie X.Z. Alexander W.M. Hill R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Trevaskis B. Watts R.A. Andersson C.R. Llewellyn D.J. Hargrove M.S. Olson J.S. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12230-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), but the human hxHb NGb is essentially expressed only in the brain (14Burmester T. Welch B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). When coupled with a link to hypoxia in plant hxHbs and NGb, this suggests that humans may harbor more than one hxHb. Our inquiry into this possibility has led to the discovery of histoglobin (HGb), a hxHb expressed ubiquitously in human tissues with behavior unique compared with the other human Hbs. The HGb gene was identified utilizing ALLGENE (22Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, ALLGENE, Version 2.2 2001, Center for Bioinformatics, University of PennsylvaniaGoogle Scholar) to mine the publicly available express sequence tag (EST) and genomic sequencing data on Mus musculus and Homo sapiens for predicted genes harboring a globin domain. The resulting data were reduced by selection for genes with a GenBank identified EST clone. Of the remaining candidate genes, all coding for proteins containing more than 250 residues were culled because currently identified hxHbs are composed of ∼200 or fewer amino acids. The final candidates were then evaluated based on sequence homology with the vertebrate Hbs to eliminate those likely originating from splicing errors of the known globin genes. This process identified the putative gene DT.40262016 (ALLGENE identification number) as a potential novel mammalian Hb. The IMAGE EST clone R87866 corresponding to DT.40262016 was purchased from Incyte Genomics. The human HGb cDNA sequence was found through sequencing of R87866. Intron determination and chromosome localization were performed using the public human genome data base. The complete cDNA sequence has been posted by the NCBI annotation project (accession no. XM058818). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to incorporate NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively. The HGb cDNA was synthesized by PCR using these primers and then cloned into the Novagen expression vectors pET29a (no-tag) and pET28a (His6-tagged) to generate constructs for recombinant protein generation. The protein alignment (Fig. 2A) was generated using the ClustalW algorithm and cross-checked against previously published sequence alignments of the human Hbs. Human HGb was expressed in Z-competent (Zymo Research) Escherichia coli BL21(λDE3)-CodonPlus-RP cells (Stratagene), using both a previously described fermentation apparatus (23Trent III, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and 2-liter culture flasks. Recombinant expression cultures were grown at 37 °C for a period of 14–16 h postinoculation in 2× YT nutrient medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. These cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were lysed with two passages through an Avestin EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer at 25,000 p.s.i. The nontagged HGb was purified from lysate using a four-stage process composed of ammonium sulfate fractionation (40 and 70%), phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography (1.5 m (NH4)2SO4 binding, 0.75m (NH4)2SO4 elution), DEAE-cellulose column chromatography (0 mm NaCl binding, 50 mm NaCl elution), and a final size exclusion chromatography step (Sephacryl S-200). The protein solution was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, after the phenyl-Sepharose separation and before the DEAE-cellulose purification step. The His6-tagged protein was purified using an affinity column (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid) followed by a desalting column (G-25). Purification was at 4 °C, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was included in the lysis buffers (50 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0; nontagged HGb, 50 mmKPO4, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.5; His6-tagged HGb) and other purification buffers, except that used in the final size exclusion or desalting step (100 mm KPO4, pH 7.0). All protein experiments were initially conducted in quadruplicate, utilizing His6-tagged and nontagged green and red HGb. All species of HGb exhibited functionally identical behavior, excluding the obvious spectral difference between the green and red protein samples. In light of this, further replications were conducted using the red versions of the protein, with the exception of those experiments explicitly describing the green protein. Reduced protein spectra were obtained in N2-sparged sample buffer after reduction of the protein with sodium dithionite. A human adult normal tissue RNA Dot-Blot I (BioChain Institute) was screened using32P-labeled probes generated with random hexamer primers and HGb or NGb cDNA. Hybridization buffer consisted of PerfectHYB Plus (Sigma) with 0.1 mg/ml sheared, denatured salmon testis DNA as a blocking reagent. The membrane was prehybridized for 1 h at 60 °C, and hybridization was allowed to proceed for 12 h at 60 °C. The membrane was washed once (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 5 min at 25 °C, followed by two washes (0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 20 min at 60 °C and a final wash (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 60 °C. The membrane was then sealed in saran wrap and exposed to a PhosphoImager for 30 h. The membrane was first probed with HGb, then stripped, and the identical procedure outlined above was repeated using the probe generated from NGb. The NGb hybridized membrane required a 48-h exposure to the PhosphoImager. The data illustrated in Fig. 4B were obtained from 1-liter cultures grown in 2× YT medium at 37 °C for 12 h. Each culture was inoculated simultaneously then differentially aerated by varying agitation speeds (rpm). After 12 h these cultures were harvested, and the HGb protein was purified. Protein samples were reduced with sodium dithionite, and a visible spectrum was taken. The 0% saturation data illustrated in Fig. 4C was obtained using a sealed 1-liter 2× YT culture where the media and flask were sparged with N2 both before and immediately after inoculation. The 100% saturation data illustrated in Fig. 4C were obtained using a 1-liter 2× YT culture aerated with a 1-liter/min flow of pure O2. Both cultures were agitated at 150 rpm. The heme cofactor was removed from samples of both red and green HGb using the methyl ethyl ketone method to produce the corresponding “green” or “red” apoprotein (24Ascoli F. Rosaria M. Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Titrating the apoprotein sample with hemin chloride solubilized in 0.1 m NaOH generated reconstituted holoproteins. All kinetic experiments were performed at 20 °C, and protein samples were buffered in 100 mmpotassium phosphate at pH 7.0, unless otherwise specified. Rapid mixing experiments were conducted using methods described previously (25Olson J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Goodman M.D. Hargrove M.S. J.

Oxygen dissociation rate constants were measured using both the ligand displacement reaction (mixing oxygenated samples with carbon monoxide) and direct observation of oxygen dissociation rate constants (mixing oxygenated samples with solutions of carbon monoxide and sodium dithionite). The flash photolysis apparatus and the methods used to measure the hexacoordination and bimolecular association rate constants have been described previously (18Hvitved A.N. Trent III., J.T.

The search described under “Experimental Procedures” yielded a candidate gene corresponding to the EST sequence identified by GenBank as R87866. Cloning and subsequent sequencing of R87866 resulted in a 573-bp cDNA coding for the 190-residue protein we term histoglobin. The primary sequence identity shared by HGb with the other principal human Hbs is less than 30%, as is illustrated in the alignment shown in Fig. 2A. Comparative sequence analysis of the HGb cDNA with the NCBI human genomic data base indicates that the gene is located at chromosome 17q25 on the minus strand. The HGb gene structure concomitantly deduced during this analysis indicates that there are four exons interrupted by three introns, as is diagrammed in Fig. 2B. DNA hybridization results for HGb and NGb are found in Fig. 3. The tissue types corresponding to each dot in this figure are listed in Table I. Fig. 3A indicates that HGb is expressed to a varying degree in all of the tissues represented in Table I. The expression results for NGb (Fig. 3B) are in agreement with previously published data showing that this protein is expressed predominantly only in the tissues of the brain (14Burmester T. Welch B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T.

The cell pellets from these cultures, as well as the protein purified from them, were red in appearance. Scaling up recombinant protein production by use of the fermentation apparatus resulted in both cell pellets and HGb protein with a deep pine green color. The visible spectra of the red and green proteins are shown in Fig. 4A. The green protein derives its color from an absorbance band at 630 nm which is lacking in red HGb and is irreversible in the purified protein. The principal difference between the cultures grown in the fermentation apparatus and those grown in shake flasks is the level of oxygen because the fermentation apparatus is aerated using pure oxygen. A series of cultures was grown under conditions that varied the level of oxygen, and the relative color of the resulting proteins was assessed by spectroscopy. The data from these growths are plotted in Fig. 4,B and C. The data in Fig. 4C demonstrate that it is oxygen concentration and not some other aspect of culture agitation speed which influences the generation of green HGb. A correlation between the abundance of oxygen during recombinant protein expression and the amount of green protein generated is evident. To assess whether the difference in color originates in the heme cofactor or the globin, apoHGb was generated by removing heme from the red and green proteins. Upon removal, heme from the green protein was green and that from the red protein, red. Reconstitution of the apoprotein generated from green HGb with heme b resulted in holoprotein having a visible spectrum identical to red HGb, as is shown in Fig. 4A. This indicates that the oxygen level-dependent modification giving rise to the green color is associated with the heme cofactor. Additional support of this is the identical size measured for both red and green proteins using SDS-PAGE (data not shown). However, this modification of the heme cofactor had no observable impact on either protein purification or kinetic characteristics of the red and green proteins. Fig. 5 presents an overlay of the absorbance spectra of reduced, deoxygenated sperm whale Mb, human NGb, and HGb. The split peak in the visible region is characteristic of a hexacoordinate heme iron and a signature of the hxHb class of proteins (29Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Sarath G. Moran J.F. Lohrman J.

The HGb absorbance peaks are nearly identical to those of NGb, suggesting bis-histidyl coordination in the ferrous deoxygenated form. Time courses for bimolecular ligand recombination with pentacoordinate Hbs after flash photolysis are described by a single exponential decay. However, the time courses for ligand binding to hxHbs such as NGb are not monoexponential because intramolecular coordination competes with rebinding of the exogenous ligand as described by Reaction 1. In this reaction, the subscripts H, P, and L refer to the hexacoordinate, pentacoordinate, and ligand-bound forms of the Hb, respectively.HbH ⇄kHk−H HbP →kL′ [L] HbLREACTION 1Analysis of ligand binding under these circumstances is possible by using a procedure described in detail previously (27Hargrove M.S.

Time courses for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to HGb after flash photolysis were initially analyzed using this method. Yet, unlike the obviously biexponential behavior exhibited by NGb (28Trent III, J.T. Watts R.A. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30106-30110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the ligand binding time courses for HGb were well described by a single exponential decay. Figs. 6A and 7A are the overlaid residuals from single and biexponential fits to the CO and O2 rebinding time courses shown in Figs. 6B and7B. These residuals are indistinguishable from one another and indicate that fitting these data to a biexponential decay is not warranted. To assess the bimolecular association rate constant for each ligand, rate constants extracted from single exponential fits were plotted against concentration as shown in Fig. 6C (CO) and Fig. 7C (O2). The slopes of the linear fitted curves to these data are reported as the HGb bimolecular rate constants in Table II.Figure 7O2 flash photolysis ligand binding kinetics.A, residuals from single exponential (circles) and double exponential (crosses) fitted curves to the low [O2] time course (top residuals) and the high [O2] time course (bottom residuals) in B.

Open table in a new tab The intercept of these linear fits should be zero if the data reflect either a simple bimolecular binding reaction (with a slow dissociation rate constant), or a reaction in which the bimolecular rate constant is substantially greater than all other binding events (k′L[L]≫kH +k−H) (27Hargrove M.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The linear fit to the oxygen binding data has an intercept within error of zero, indicating that the reaction measured reflects only the oxygen rebinding event. However, the linear fit to the CO data in Fig. 6C has a non-zero intercept at 440 s−1. This suggests that the time courses giving rise to these data measure a reaction more complex than simple bimolecular rebinding of CO. As spectroscopic data indicate HGb is hexacoordinate at equilibrium, the rate constants associated with the hexacoordination reaction are a likely source of the additional complexity observed. To investigate the possibility that HGb possesses a hexacoordination dissociation rate constant (k−H) too slow to be measured with the flash photolysis method, CO binding was examined using rapid mixing to initiate the reaction. The time courses for CO binding to the ferrous, deoxygenated protein at several different concentrations of CO are shown in Fig. 8A. Although [CO] ranges between 25 and 500 μm, the appearance of the ligand binding time courses does not show a 20-fold change in reaction half-time. This phenomenon has been described previously in hxHbs and is the typical behavior of these proteins (23Trent III, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These time courses require fitting to a three-exponential decay curve to be described accurately. The fastest of the rate components was assigned as the hexacoordination dissociation rate constant (k−H) in accordance with the mechanism described in Reaction 1. The slower rate components of these reactions have been discussed previously in the context of a model for ligand binding to hxHbs (23Trent III, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fastest rate component extracted from the CO binding time courses is plotted against [CO] in Fig. 8B. As these values reach an asymptote at ∼5 s−1, this value is reported for k−H in Table II. This interpretation of the data indicates that the non-zero intercept in Fig. 6C arises from time courses with a hexacoordination contribution composed predominantly of the association reaction, and this is reflected in the reported value of 430 s−1 for kH in Table II. The HGb O2 and CO dissociation rate constants reported in Table II were measured with ligand replacement reactions initiated by stopped-flow rapid mixing (25Olson J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Quillin M.L., Li, T. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N., Jr. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Regan R. Carlson M. Gibson Q.H., Li, H. Elber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 416-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Reactions using 1,000 μm [CO] as the displacing ligand and protein samples saturated under different concentrations of oxygen (262 and 1,250 μm O2) provide corroborating values of 0.35 s−1 for kO2. CO dissociation experiments used 2,000 μm NO as the displacing ligand and protein samples in less than 50 μmCO. Under these conditions, kobs is equivalent to kCO and was measured to be 0.003 s−1 for HGb. Human Hb and Mb are proteins whose physiological roles in oxygen transport and respiration are among the most clearly defined and well understood. Yet, hxHbs have thus far demonstrated oxygen affinities that preclude their functioning within these roles (12Trevaskis B. Watts R.A. Andersson C.R. Llewellyn D.J. Hargrove M.S. Olson J.S.

X-ray fiber diffraction and electron diffraction analyses have shown that a transition from random coil to a cross-β-sheet structure underlies the assembly of α-synuclein into filaments (15Serpell L.C.

However, γ-synuclein also harbors a hydrophobic stretch similar to that of α-synuclein (and especially a homologous portion to residues 71–82 of α-synuclein) although γ-synuclein poorly assembles into filaments (14Biere A.L.

Here we have shown that α-synuclein filaments assembled in vitro or recovered from MSA brains that are morphologically similar to each other share the following biochemical characteristics: (i) insolubility in detergents (Triton X or Sarkosyl) but high solubility in urea or SDS, and (ii) resistance of a subdomain of α-synuclein against proteinase K treatment. We propose that the proteinase K-resistant 7-kDa fragment comprised of residues 31–109 of α-synuclein may represent the core unit of α-synuclein filaments, which contributes to the structural stability of these filaments.RESULTSPrevious studies have shown that recombinant α-synuclein forms filaments that closely resemble those isolated from brains of patients with PD, DLB, and MSA in vitro. To verify the morphological and biochemical characteristics of synthetic α-synuclein filaments, we have compared their ultrastructure and solubility with those isolated from brains of patients with MSA (Fig. 1 B). Incubation of purified recombinant α-synuclein at 37 °C for 48 h with continuous shaking resulted in the formation of abundant filaments (Fig. 1 C). These filaments were 50–700 nm long and 5–10 nm wide, as previously documented (15Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). These filaments appeared as straight filaments that were very similar to those extracted from MSA brains.To biochemically characterize the α-synuclein filaments, we performed differential extraction of α-synuclein from brain tissues and in vitro assembled filaments. Frozen tissues from control and MSA brains were sequentially extracted with Tris-HCl buffer, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Sarkosyl, and 8 m urea. Extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with LB509. A 15-kDa polypeptide strongly immunoreactive for LB509 was detected in Tris-soluble and Triton-soluble fractions from both control and MSA brains. The amounts of α-synuclein in these fractions were slightly smaller in MSA brains compared with control brains. In contrast, LB509 immunoreactive polypeptides migrating at similar positions to normal α-synuclein were detected in the Sarkosyl-insoluble, urea-soluble fraction of MSA brain (Fig. 1 D), whereas no α-synuclein immunoreactivities were observed in the same fractions of control brains. Immunoelectron microscopic observation of the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction from MSA brains showed filaments that were labeled by multiple anti-α-synuclein antibodies. The extraction patterns of α-synuclein aggregates in MSA brains were similar to that observed by Dickson et al. (11Dickson D.W. Liu W.-K. Hardy J. Farrer M. Mehta N. Uitti R. Mark M. Zimmerman T.

Mizusawa, T. Iwatsubo, and M. Hasegawa, unpublished observations. suggesting that filamentous α-synuclein aggregates deposited in synucleinopathy brains exhibit similar insolubility profiles (i.e.Sarkosyl-insoluble and urea-soluble). The amounts of Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein appeared to correlate with the density of GCIs as judged by semiquantitative evaluation of the amount of α-synuclein-positive aggregates by immunostaining of the smears of the brain homogenates (data not shown).Similarly, in vitro assembled α-synuclein filaments were sequentially extracted by Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Sarkosyl, and 8 m urea, together with unassembled α-synuclein incubated without shaking and analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1 E, unassembled α-synuclein was totally recovered in Tris-HCl and Triton X-soluble fractions, without any immunoreactive substances detected in Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions. In sharp contrast, a ∼15-kDa protein as well as additional polypeptides migrating at ∼25–30 kDa in a Sarkosyl-insoluble, urea-soluble fraction of in vitro assembled α-synuclein showed strong immunoreactivity for LB509, the latter presumably representing α-synuclein dimers. Electron microscopic observation of the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of in vitro assembled α-synuclein confirmed the preservation of filamentous structures after extraction with 1% Triton X and 1% Sarkosyl. Taken together, synthetic α-synuclein filaments share a number of biochemical as well as morphological characteristics (i.e. solubility profiles, molecular size, and ultrastructure) with those recovered from inclusion bodies in synucleinopathy brains.We next examined the structural stability of α-synuclein filaments by treating them with proteinase K. Tris-soluble fractions from control brains containing abundant normal α-synuclein and Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from MSA brains rich in insoluble α-synuclein filaments were treated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K, and digestion of α-synuclein was monitored by immunoblotting with LB509. Immunoreactivities for α-synuclein in Tris-soluble fractions disappeared after proteinase K treatment for 30 min. In contrast, the amount as well as banding patterns of α-synuclein in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction remained almost unchanged until 60 min of treatment (Fig. 2 A). Soluble α-synuclein added to Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from control brains was also readily degraded by proteinase K treatment (data not shown), indicating that the stability of Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein to proteinase K is not due to interference by contaminants in this fraction. These results suggest that the filamentous form of α-synuclein in Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions is resistant to proteinase K digestion.Figure 2Proteinase K treatment of Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein from MSA brains and in vitro assembled filaments from recombinant α-synuclein. A, Tris-soluble fractions from control human brain (left panel) and Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from MSA brain (right panel) were treated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 0, 30, and 60 min and analyzed by immunoblotting with LB509. B, Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from MSA brain prior to (0 min) and after treatment with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min were analyzed by immunoblotting with NAC1 (left panel) and LB509 (right panel). C, Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from MSA brain prior to (0 min) and after treatment with 100, 500, and 1,000 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min were analyzed by immunoblotting with NAC1. D, in vitro assembled filaments from recombinant α-synuclein were treated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 0, 30, and 60 min and analyzed by immunoblotting with Syn102, LB509, and NAC1. E, in vitro assembled filaments from recombinant α-synuclein and unassembled controls were treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min and analyzed by immunoblotting with Syn102, LB509, and NAC1. Note that ∼7–9-kDa bands were detected after proteinase K treatment by NAC1 both in Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of MSA brain (B, arrowheads) and assembled α-synuclein (E, arrowheads), but Syn102 or LB509 failed to label these polypeptides. F, unassembled and assembled recombinant α-synuclein treated by proteinase K (10 μg/ml, 30 min) were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Amino acid sequences derived from polypeptides migrating at 9, 8, and 7 kDa, as well as the corresponding amino-terminal positions in human α-synuclein, are shown at the right of the panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein from MSA brains was further analyzed by immunoblotting with an additional anti-α-synuclein antibody NAC1, which recognizes the central hydrophobic region (i.e. NAC domain, residues 75–91) of α-synuclein, using higher concentrations of proteinase K (Fig. 2 B). Prior to proteinase K treatment, NAC1 reacted with the major ∼15-kDa polypeptide (migrating at the same position as full-length α-synuclein), as well as with additional minor bands migrating at ∼6–12 kDa. After treatment with 100 μg/ml proteinase K, NAC1 exclusively reacted with ∼7–9-kDa polypeptides (Fig. 2 B, arrowheads), whereas α-synuclein immunoreactive bands migrating at higher molecular weight ranges (including full-length α-synuclein) were almost completely abolished. The ∼7–9-kDa bands were not recognized by LB509, the epitope of which is located around residues 121/122 at the carboxyl terminus of α-synuclein. The 7-kDa band was still detected after the treatment with 500 μg/ml proteinase K with NAC1, although it disappeared by the 1,000 μg/ml proteinase K treatment (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that these ∼7–9-kDa polypeptides corresponded to the core portion of α-synuclein filaments that acquired high resistance to protease digestion. To further characterize the proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein fragments, in vitro assembled filaments were treated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 30–60 min and analyzed by immunoblotting with Syn102, LB509, and NAC1. Immunoreactivities of Syn102 or LB509 were almost completely abolished by the proteinase K treatment for 60 min, whereas ∼7–11-kDa bands were detected in the assembled filament fraction with NAC1 (Fig. 2 D). Similar results were obtained in the experiment with 10 μg/ml proteinase K treatment for 30 min. NAC1 detected ∼7–9-kDa polypeptides in the assembled filament fraction (Fig. 2 E, arrowheads), exhibiting a similar pattern to those observed in the proteinase K-treated Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of MSA brains (Fig. 2 B, arrowheads), whereas antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of α-synuclein (i.e. LB509 and Syn102) only labeled the ∼10–15-kDa bands. Unassembled α-synuclein digested by 10 μg/ml proteinase K did not yield any immunoreactive fragments, suggesting that α-synuclein was totally degraded in this condition (Fig. 2 E).To further analyze these proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein fragments by protein chemical methods, larger amounts (18 μg) of α-synuclein proteins in assembled or unassembled states were treated with proteinase K (10 μg/ml), separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The amino-terminal sequences of the three major bands migrating at 7, 8, and 9 kDa detected in proteinase K-treated α-synuclein filaments were directly analyzed by a protein sequencer. Analysis of amino acid sequences of the 7- and 8-kDa bands revealed an identical amino-terminal sequence, GKTKEGVLYV, that corresponded to residues 31–40 of α-synuclein. The 9-kDa band gave two sequences,i.e. AEKTKQGVAE and EKTKQGVAEA, which corresponded to residues 19–28 and 20–29 of α-synuclein, respectively (Fig. 2 F). Thus, both the 7- and 8-kDa proteinase K-resistant fragments consisted of polypeptides starting at the same amino terminus (i.e. residue 31 of α-synuclein) but ending at different carboxyl-terminal positions.To investigate the relationship between the proteinase K-resistant ∼7–9-kDa fragments and the integrity of α-synuclein filaments, we examined the ultrastructure as well as immunoreactivities of α-synuclein filaments prior to and after proteinase K treatment by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 3). Prior to proteinase K treatment, the filaments were positively labeled by antibodies against the amino- (Fig. 3 A, no. 36) and carboxyl- (Fig. 3 E, Syn102) terminal portions of α-synuclein, whereas NAC1 failed to label them (Fig. 3 C). After proteinase K treatment, these filaments still retained their filamentous nature, but the mean diameters were decreased by ∼20% (untreated, 12.3 ± 0.5 μm; proteinase K-treated, 9.8 ± 2.3 μm), and immunoreactivities for the amino (no. 36) and carboxyl (Syn102) termini were abolished. In sharp contrast, the filaments became immunoreactive for NAC1, which recognizes the mid-portion of α-synuclein. These results suggest that both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of α-synuclein are structurally labile and cleaved off from the filaments by proteinase K digestion, whereas the central region containing the hydrophobic NAC portion represents the core structure of filaments that is resistant to protease treatment.Figure 3Immunoelectron microscopic analysis of assembled α-synuclein filaments with or without proteinase K treatment. In vitro assembled filaments from recombinant α-synuclein prior to (A, C, E) or after proteinase K treatment (B, D, F) were immunolabeled by no. 36 (A and B), NAC1 (C and D), and Syn102 (E and F), followed by decoration with 5-nm gold particles and observed by negative staining. Scale bar represents 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To unequivocally define the structure of the minimal fragment that constitutes the protease-resistant core of α-synuclein filaments,in vitro assembled α-synuclein filaments were treated with various concentrations of proteinase K ranging from 2 to 1,000 μg/ml. The NAC1 immunoreactive 7-kDa polypeptide remained undigested even by treatment with 1,000 μg/ml proteinase K, whereas other fragments including the 6-kDa species disappeared with increasing concentrations of proteinase K (Fig. 4 A). This strongly suggested that the 7-kDa fragment corresponds to the highly stable, protease-resistant core unit of the α-synuclein filaments. To determine the exact structure of the proteinase K-resistant 7-kDa polypeptide, assembled α-synuclein filaments and unassembled α-synuclein proteins were treated with 500 μg/ml proteinase K, and the digests were dissolved in 6 mguanidine HCl and separated by reverse phase-HPLC. When the HPLC profiles of unassembled and filamentous α-synuclein were carefully compared after treatment with 500 μg/ml proteinase K, one peak was unique to assembled filament digests (Fig. 4 B, peak 9); other peaks were derived from fragments of proteinase K, because identical peaks were observed by incubation without α-synuclein (data not shown). Immunoblotting of these HPLC fractions with NAC1 confirmed that the 7-kDa α-synuclein fragment was recovered in fraction 9 (Fig. 4, B and C). MALDI-TOF mass analysis of fraction 9 gave signals corresponding to a molecular mass of 7873.5, which nearly matched to that of residues 31–109 of human α-synuclein (predicted average mass: 7869) (Fig. 4 D). These results strongly suggested that residues 31–109 of α-synuclein represent the proteinase K-resistant core unit of α-synuclein filaments.Figure 4Purification and mass spectrometric analysis of the proteinase K-resistant 7-kDa fragment of α-synuclein filaments.

It has been shown that recombinant α-synuclein can assemble into filaments that closely resemble the abnormal α-synuclein filaments in synucleinopathy brains (12Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, in vitro modeling of α-synuclein assembly is a useful strategy for the study of the molecular mechanisms of α-synuclein fibril formation as well as for screening of small molecules that affect the formation of pathological α-synuclein filaments.In this study, we have shown that the in vitro assembled α-synuclein filaments closely resemble the pathological filaments of synucleinopathy brains in their biochemical and structural characteristics. In vitro assembled α-synuclein filaments and those from synucleinopathy brains shared very similar solubility profiles, i.e. insolubility in detergents (Triton X and Sarkosyl) and effective solubilization in high concentrations of urea. Furthermore, proteinase K treatment revealed that these two types of α-synuclein filaments show very similar resistance profiles to protease digestion.Biochemical analysis of the proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein filament cores strongly suggested that the ∼7–9-kDa fragments truncated at amino and carboxyl termini constitute the core portion of α-synuclein filaments. Giasson et al. (24Giasson B.I. Murray I.V.J. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

We and others have previously reported that human tumor-derived p53 mutants can engage in a physical association with different isoforms of p73, inhibiting their transcriptional activity. Here, we report that human tumor-derived p53 mutants can associate in vitro and in vivo with p63 through their respective core domains. We show that the interaction with mutant p53 impairs in vitro and in vivo sequence-specific DNA binding of p63 and consequently affects its transcriptional activity. We also report that in cells carrying endogenous mutant p53, such as T47D cells, p63 is unable to recruit some of its target gene promoters. Unlike wild-type p53, the binding to specific p53 mutants markedly counteracts p63-induced growth inhibition. This effect is, at least partially, mediated by the core domain of mutant p53. Thus, inactivation of p53 family members may contribute to the biological properties of specific p53 mutants in promoting tumorigenesis and in conferring selective survival advantage to cancer cells.

Approximately half of human tumors bear p53 mutations (1Hollstein M. Soussi T. Thomas G. von Brevern M.C. Bartsch H. Rec. Results Cancer Res. 1997; 143: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The most prevalent type of these mutations consists of missense mutations that are frequently accompanied by loss of the remaining wild-type p53 (wt-p53) 1The abbreviations used are: wt-p53wild type p53FCSfetal calf serummAbmonoclonal antibodyGSTglutathione S-transferaseChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation 1The abbreviations used are: wt-p53wild type p53FCSfetal calf serummAbmonoclonal antibodyGSTglutathione S-transferaseChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation allele (2Hainaut P.

Thus, mutant p53 proteins are unable to specifically bind DNA and to activate specific wt-p53 target genes. One certain outcome of p53 mutations is the loss of wild type activities such as growth arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation. However, at variance with other tumor suppressor genes, cells with p53 mutations maintain expression of full-length protein. This may suggest that, at least, certain mutant forms of p53 can gain additional functions through which they contribute actively to cancer progression (6Prives C. Hall P.A. J.

The respective deficient mice have provided further insights into the physiological role of p73 and p63. p73-deficient mice exhibit severe defects in the development of nervous and immune systems (38Yang A.

Their skin does not progress from early stages of development, lacking stratification as well as expression of differentiation markers. The mammary glands, hair follicles, and teeth are absent in p63-deficient mice (39Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A.

In agreement with this phenotype, p63 was recently found mutated in patients affected by autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ectrodactyly, ectodermal dyspalsia, and facial clefts (41Celli J.

Recent findings indicate that the association between mutant p53 and p73 can be, at least partially, governed by a common polymorphism at codon 72 of p53 that encodes Arg or Pro (34Marin M.C.

Therefore, we have further investigated the physical association between human tumor-derived p53 mutants and p63. We found that this association occurs under physiological conditions as shown by reciprocal co-precipitation experiments performed either in T47D breast cancer cells and HaCat immortalized keratinocytes. The core domain of mutant p53 and the DNA binding domain of p63 mediate this association. We also report that binding of mutant p53 strongly impairs in vitro and in vivo the binding of p63 to its target gene promoters and consequently affects its transcriptional activity. Indeed, we found that in cells carrying endogenous mutant p53, such as T47D cells, p63 is unable to recruit some of its target gene promoters. Similar to wt-p53, overexpression of p63 strongly inhibits colony formation of SAOS2 cells. The concomitant expression of specific p53 mutants, such as p53His175 and p53His273, but not p53Gly281, counteracts the p63-mediated growth suppression. Such an effect requires the binding of p63 to mutant p53 and is not exerted by the coexpression of wt-p53. Of note, the core domain of mutant p53 can also exert such an impairment. Thus, protein-protein interactions between members of the p53 family might impact on growth and drug resistance of cancer cells. The H1299 cell line is derived from a human large cell lung carcinoma. H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen) (19Blandino G. Levine A.J. Oren M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The H1299-p53His175#41 cell line was generated as previously reported (43Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B.

SAOS2 osteosarcoma cells (a gift from M. Fanciulli) and HaCat immortalized keratinocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS.

McKeon) and pcDNA3-HA-p63γ. pcDNA3-HA-p63γ-(141–321) was obtained by PCR followed by subcloning into pcDNA3-HA vector. Sequences of the oligonucleotides and primers are available on request. Overexpression of mutant p53 was achieved by transfection of the following plasmids: pcDNA3-p53His175, pcDNA3-p53His273, pcDNA3-p53Trp248, pcDNA3-p53His175-(22–23), pcDNA3-p53His175-Δproline, pcDNA3-p53His175-(1–338), and pcDNA3-p53His175-(1–355). Overexpression of the core domain of mutant p53 was achieved by transfection of pEGFP-p53His175-(74–298). The double mutants of p53His175 and its core were prepared as previously described (43Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M.

Transient transfections were done in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS by the calcium phosphate method in the presence of BES (N, N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, sodium salt) (Sigma). The precipitates were left for 12 h, after which the medium was changed again to RPMI plus 10% FCS. The cells were harvested at 36 or 48 h, respectively (43Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M. Blandino G. J. Biol.

H1299 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates with 8 μg of DNA and harvested at 36 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in 900 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors), and the extracts were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations were determined by a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). After preclearing for 1 h at 4 °C with Protein G, immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating 1.5 mg of whole-cell extract with 1.5 μg/sample of anti-p63 polyclonal antibody (H-129 that maps at the carboxyl terminus of human p63α) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or with anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody or with a mixture of anti-p53 mAbs DO1 and 1801 or with anti-IgG polyclonal antibody (Cappel). Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose beads (KPL, Guilford, CA). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of wash NET-gel buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The excess liquid was aspirated, and 40 μl of 5× sample buffer was added. Immunoprecipitates as well as 1% of each extract were resolved by SDS-10% PAGE. Protein gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius). For p53 detection, a mixture of p53 mAbs DO1 and 1801 (1:40 dilution) or anti-p53 FL393 (1 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used respectively; for c-Myc detection, we used anti-c-Myc (9E10) (Pharmingen) at 2 μg/ml; for maltose-binding protein (MBP)-p63α detection, we used anti-MBP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) at 2 μg/ml; for p21waf1 detection, we used anti-p21 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:20,000 dilution; for p53His175-(74–298) (GFP-tagged) we used an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:5000. T47D and HaCat cells were lysed as previously described. Aliquots of cell extracts containing 2.5 mg of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-p63 polyclonal antibody, with anti-IgG polyclonal antibody, or with a mixture of anti-p53 mAbs DO1 and 1801. For p53 detection, a mixture of p53 mAbs DO1 and 1801 was used at 1:40 dilution. For reciprocal co-precipitation experiments, T47D and HaCat cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53FL393 and with a mixture of anti-p53 mAbs DO1 and 1801, respectively. For p63 detection, an anti-p63 monoclonal antibody (4A4 that was raised against amino acids 1–205 of p63) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:100 dilution. Western blot analysis was performed with the aid of the enhanced chemiluminescence Supersignal West Pico Stable Peroxidase Solution (Pierce). Recombinant proteins employed in the pull-down assay were produced as previously described (36Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Castagnoli L. Shaul Y. Sacchi A. Oren M. Sudol M. Cesareni G. Blandino G.

Pull-down assays were performed using 20 μg of immobilized purified GST fusion proteins or wild type GST that were incubated with 2 mg of total cellular proteins prepared from H1299 cells transiently transfected with p53His273, p53Trp248, or p53His175-(74–298), from H-175#41 and T47D cells. The immunoblots were probed with a mixture of anti-p53 mAbs DO1 and 1801 or with anti-p53 mAb 240 or with anti-MBP antibody. Detection was performed with the aid of the enhanced chemiluminescence Supersignal West Pico Stable Peroxidase Solution (Pierce). H1299–175#41 cells were treated with ponasterone A to induce the expression of p53H175 for 24 h. DNA and proteins were cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde (1% final concentration) 20 min before harvesting. Formaldehyde cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine, pH 2.5 (125 mm final concentration), for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were scraped off of the plates, resuspended in hypotonic buffer, and passed through a 26-gauge needle. Nuclei were spun down, resuspended in 300 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and a protease inhibitor mixture), and sonicated to generate 500–2000-bp fragments. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 MM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysate was precleared by incubation at 4 °C with 50 μl of Protein A beads preadsorbed with sonicated single-stranded DNA and bovine serum albumin. The cleared lysates were incubated overnight with an anti-p63 polyclonal antibody (H-137, whose epitope corresponds to amino acids 15–151 of the DNA binding of ΔNp63α) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with a control antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A beads preadsorbed with sonicated single-stranded DNA and bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation, the beads were washed and the antigen was eluted with 1% SDS, 100 mm sodium carbonate. DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4–5 h, and DNA was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Levels of Bax, p21waf1, 14-3-3ς, and p53AIP1 promoter DNAs were determined by PCR using oligonucleotides spanning the p53 binding sites. The following specific oligonucleotides were used: Bax (down, 5′-CTG GGC AAC ATA GAG AGA CCT CAT; up, 5′-CCA GCC AGG ACG TTA TAG ATG ACT); p21waf1 (down, 5′-CAT TGT TCC CAG CAC TTC CTC TC; up, 5′-AGA AAG CCA ATC AGA GCC ACA G); 14-3-3ς (down, 5′-CAT CAG AGTAAG ACC CTA TCT C; up, 5′-AAT GCT ACA GGG TTT CCA AGG); and p53AIP1 (down, 5′-TGG GTA GGA GGT GAT CTC ACC; up, 5′-GAG CAG CAC AAA TGG ACT GG). Oligonucleotides specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (down, 5′-AAA AGC GGG GAG AAA GTA GG; up, 5′-TCT CTT TGG GCC CTC CGA TC) were used as negative control. For the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) performed on T47D cells, the following oligonucleotides were used: 14-3-3ς (down, 5′-CTG TAC TTC AGC CTG CAG ATC AGA G; up, 5′-CCG ACC TAA TAG TTG AGC CAG GAT); Bax (down, 5′-CTG GGC AAC ATA GAG AGA CCT CAT; up, 5′-CCA GCC AGG ACG TTA TAG ATG ACT); cyclin G (down, 5′-GAT CTG ATA TCG TGG GGT GAG GT; up, 5′-CCC ACA CCA ACT AAA GAC AGG AAG); and Mdm2 (down, 5′-GCA GGT TGA CTC AGC TTT TCC TCT; up, 5′-GTG GTT ACA GCC CCA TCA GTA GGT A-3′). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed in a 20-μl DNA binding reaction, which contained 30 μg of whole cell extract, 4 fmol of labeled duplex oligonucleotide, binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and 300 μg of salmon sperm. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 10 min, and the protein-DNA complexes were subjected to native electrophoresis on 5% acrylamide, 0.5× TBE gel. Anti-p73 polyclonal antibodies C-17 and C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-p63 polyclonal antibody H-129 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the labeled oligonucleotide and incubated on ice for 15 min. The following oligonucleotide was used: TCA CAA GTT AGA GAC AAG CCT GGG CGT GGG CAT TAT T. H1299 cells (3 × 105/60-mm plate) were transfected with reporter plasmid together with the indicated combinations of plasmids. An equal number of pCMV-β-gal plasmids was added to each transfection reaction mixture. 36 h later, cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in cell lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Insoluble material was spun down, and luciferase activity was quantitated using a commercially available kit (Promega) with the aid of a TD-20E luminometer (Turner). The values were normalized for β-galactosidase and protein contents. Cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed with cold methanol and incubated at −20 °C for 30 min. After rehydration with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, the cells were stained for 1 h with a mixture of p53 mAbs DO1 and 1801. Staining with the secondary antibody and with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was performed as described before (19Blandino G. Levine A.J. Oren M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), followed by visualization under a fluorescence microscope. SAOS2 cells were plated and transiently transfected as reported above. 24 h after the transfection, cells were detached and replated in triplicate at 3 × 104/60-mm dish. Two days later, puromycin (2 μg/ml) was added to each plate and maintained for 72 h. Two weeks later, colonies were fixed in methanol and stained with Giemsa solution followed by washing with water. To determine the biological relevance of the association between mutant p53 and p63, we performed coprecipitation experiments using T47D breast cancer cells and HaCat skin-derived immortalized keratinocytes carrying endogenous mutant p53Phe194 and mutant p53Y179/W282, respectively, as well as endogenous p63 (34Marin M.C.

Rapid quenching approaches under single-turnover conditions identified 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose as the enzymatic product, whereas 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose was formed by intramolecular transesterification after enzymatic release into bulk solvent, where 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose exist in equilibrium (48:52). In addition to 1H and 13C chemical shift assignments for each regioisomer, heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy was used to assign unambiguously the position of the acetyl group. These findings are highly significant, because they differ from the previous conclusion, which suggested that 1′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose was the solution product of the reaction.

A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and others (20Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) had shown that histone/protein deacetylase activity was tightly coupled to the formation of a previously unidentified product, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Initial mass spectral data were consistent with the formation of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the deacetylation of substrate and the formation of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose were exquisitely coupled (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that O-acetyl-ADP-ribose could serve an important function in manifesting the previously reported biological effects of Sir2. In addition to this interesting possibility, it is important to understand how this reaction is accomplished by the Sir2 enzymes. To address this question, a detailed analysis of the produced O-acetyl-ADP-ribose is essential. The structure of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose was previously assigned as 1′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), although other possibilities could be envisioned (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 20Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on precedent for the chemistry at the anomeric carbon of ribose. However, the exact position of the acetate on ADP-ribose had not been proven definitively. In the current study, we present the structure of the proposed enzymatic product derived from the β-NAD+-coupled deacetylation of histone tails, using rapid quenching techniques, mass spectrometry (MS), 1The abbreviations used are: MSmass spectrometryCOSYcorrelation spectroscopyDQFdouble quantum filteredHMBCheteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopyHSQCheteronuclear single-quantum correlationHDOmonodenterated waterHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyP/CAFp300/CBP-associated factorDdeuterium and NMR structural analysis. Initial MS/MS analyses of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose indicated that the acetate moiety resided on the ribose ring to which nicotinamide had been attached in β-NAD+. Purification of the steady-state enzymatic reaction products revealed the generation 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (Fig. 1) and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, which were identified and thoroughly characterized by one- and two-dimensional NMR techniques to assign the 1H spectrum and obtain 13C chemical shift data. To unequivocally identify the location of the acetate moiety in both compounds,13C-enriched (carbonyl carbon) 2′- or 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose was generated by employing a coupled enzymatic system involving [2-13C]pyruvate, pyruvate dehydrogenase, the histone acetyltransferase P/CAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), and the yeast Sir2 homologue HST2. The13C-labeled 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose molecules were analyzed by HMBC, which revealed correlations only between the carbonyl carbon of acetate and the proton at C-2′ or C-3′, respectively. Using rapid quenched flow methodology, we trapped 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose on the enzyme surface, identifying this regioisomer as the authentic enzymatic product while demonstrating that 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose exist in rapid equilibrium in neutral or slightly alkaline solutions. mass spectrometry correlation spectroscopy double quantum filtered heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy heteronuclear single-quantum correlation monodenterated water high performance liquid chromatography p300/CBP-associated factor deuterium [2-13C]Pyruvic acid (a minimum of 99 atom % 13C) and deuterium oxide (a minimum of 99.99 atom % 2H) were purchased from Isotec Incorporated. β-NAD+, thiamine pyrophosphate, coenzyme A, and pyruvate decarboxylase were purchased from Sigma. Histone H3 peptide, NH2-ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLC-COOH, and the Lys-14-acetlyated H3 peptide (AcLys-14), corresponding to the 20 amino-terminal residues of human histone H3, was synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Lab at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). For later experiments, truncated H3 peptide, NH2-KSTGGK(Ac)APRKQ-COOH was purchased from SynPep (Dublin, CA). Dithiothreitol was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals Corporation. All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher unless otherwise noted and were of the highest purity possible. The reagents were used without further purification. The procedure used in the expression and purification of histidine-tagged full-length HST2 is a modification of that described by Tanner et al. (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In short, the plasmid containing His-tagged HST2 was transformed into BL21-DE3 competent cells and plated on 2× YT agar medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Single colonies were used to inoculate 1 liter of 2× YT production flasks containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and incubated on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm at 35 °C until an A600 nm of 0.8 was obtained. The bacteria was induced by the addition of 100 mg of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside/liter of production broth and incubated at room temperature on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm for 8 h. Cell lysis was accomplished using a French pressure cell with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 4 °C), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Clarified cell-free extract was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (10-ml bed volume) for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was transferred to a small column and washed with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 4 °C) containing 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. HST2 was eluted using a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–500 mmimidazole in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 4 °C) containing 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the location and purity of HST2. Fractions containing greater than 90% HST2, based upon densitometry, were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 37 °C), 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme concentration was determined using the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar), and the enzyme was stored at −25 °C until needed. A Beckman Biosys 510 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system and a Vydac C18 (1.0 × 25 mm) small pore preparative column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) were used throughout the study. Compounds from the enzymatic reaction were separated using a gradient system comprising 0.05% aqueous tetrafluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.02% tetrafluoroacetic acid (solvent B) using a constant flow rate of 4 ml/min. All of the mobile phases were filtered through a Millipore 0.20-μm nylon filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) prior to use. Upon injection of the sample (up to 1 ml), the HPLC was run isocratically in solvent A for 5.0 min followed by a linear gradient of 0–8% B over a 20-min period with the detector set at 260 nm. The gradient was then increased to 40% solvent B over a 20-min period. At 21 min after injection, the detector was switched to 214 nm to detect acetylated and deacetylated H3 peptide. The products derived from β-NAD+ (excluding ADP-ribose) had retention times (tR) of 15–16 min, whereas the acetylated and deacetylated 20-amino acid H3 peptide had retention times of 28.1 and 28.8 min, respectively. The 11-amino acid H3 peptides had retention times of 18.3 and 21 min for the deacetylated and acetylated peptides, respectively. The compounds and peptides were collected directly from the HPLC after passage through the detector. The assay conditions utilized in this study are modified from those published by Tanner and co-workers (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In short, HST2 (25 μm) was mixed with β-NAD+(350 μm) and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 5 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5 at 37 °C). The AcLys-14 H3 peptide (525 μm) was then added, and the reaction mixture (final volume, 1 ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of tetrafluoroacetic acid for a final concentration of 1%. The products derived from β-NAD+ as well as deacetylated and acetylated H3 peptide were isolated using the HPLC protocol mentioned above. A 1-ml HST2 reaction was purified by HPLC using the above-mentioned protocol, and the two compounds having retention times of 15.3 (compound A) and 16.5 min (compound B) were isolated, respectively (3-ml sample volumes were obtained). A total of 200 μl of the solution containing either compound A or B was reinjected into the HPLC and analyzed as previously described for the enzyme assays. Verification that each compound can be isolated independently of the other was achieved by co-injecting 200 μl of the solution containing the 16.4-min compound (compound B) with 100 μl of the solution containing the 15.5-min compound (compound A) using the HPLC conditions described above. To determine whether the two compounds are interconvertible, 200 μl of the solution containing either compound A or B was diluted in 800 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 37 °C) buffer and incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 10 min. The 1-ml sample was then analyzed by HPLC using the above-described method. A non-amine containing buffer was also examined. Specifically, Tris buffer was exchanged for phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm sodium chloride, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 4.3 mmdibasic sodium phosphate, and 1.4 mm monobasic potassium phosphate, pH 7.3) and used to dilute a 200-μl sample containing either the 15.5- or 16.5-min compound to a final volume of 1 ml. The sample was then analyzed by HPLC using the conditions mentioned above. Quenched flow analysis was performed under single-turnover conditions using HST2 to determine the enzymatic product. HST2 (20 μm) and AcLys-14 H3 peptide (260 μm) were rapidly mixed with 10 μmβ-NAD+ at room temperature in Tris buffer (pH 7.5 at 37 °C) in a Hi-Tech rapid quenched flow device, RQF-63 (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK). After various times between 1 and 8 s, the reactions were quenched with tetrafluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%, and the resulting sample (referred to as a “slug”) was collected. Each time point was analyzed eight times, the slugs were combined (total volume, ∼900 μl), and the entire sample was analyzed by HPLC using the above-mentioned protocol. The synthesis of 13C-labeled K14-acetyl H3 peptide utilized a modified version of the coupled assay system reported by Kim et al. (22Kim Y. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction contained 5.0 mmβ-NAD+, 0.7 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7.4 mm [2-13C]pyruvate, 63 μmCoA-SH, 0.88 mm histone H3 peptide, 0.09 units of pyruvate dehydrogenase (1 unit of pyruvate dehydrogenase is defined by the manufacturer to be the conversion of 1.0 mmol of β-NAD+to β-NADH per min at pH 7.4 at 30 °C in the presence of saturating levels of coenzyme A), 5.5 μm P/CAF, 50 mmTris (TBA buffer) (pH 7.5) in a total volume of 1 ml. A 10-fold stock solution containing β-NAD+, thiamine pyrophosphate, MgCl2, and dithiothreitol was prepared fresh daily. A 10-fold stock solution of pyruvate dehydrogenase in 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.5 at 25 °C) was also prepared fresh prior to use. All of the assay components except coenzyme A were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of coenzyme A, and the reaction was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 20 min followed by the addition of 10 μl of tetrafluoroacetic acid. The synthesized [2-13C]acetyl H3 peptide was purified by HPLC using the same conditions outlined previously. Based upon the HPLC chromatogram, up to 95% conversion of H3 peptide to acetylated peptide was achieved. The labeled peptide was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to determine the presence of the 13C label. ADP-ribose (Sigma) or 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose that were obtained using the HPLC protocol outlined above were lyophilized in D2O (99.996% atom % D; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) containing 0.05% tetrafluoroacetic acid-d1 (99.5 atom % D; Aldrich). All NMR samples were dissolved in Me2SO-d6(99.9 atom % D; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.), which was also used as an external chemical shift reference (CH3 = 2.50 ppm, CH3 = 39.51 ppm). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were obtained at 400.0 MHz on a Bruker DPX400 spectrometer. A two-dimensional double quantum filtered COSY (DQF-COSY) spectrum was obtained on a Bruker DPX400 spectrometer using a phase-sensitive mode with the spectral width of 1905.488 Hz. The spectrum was acquired with 512 and 2048 data points in frequency 1 and frequency 2 domains, respectively. The data matrix was zero-filled to 4,000 × 4,000 and processed with a shifted sine square function. 13C NMR spectra were obtained at 100.62 Hz on a Bruker DPX400 spectrometer. A two-dimensional heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum was obtained on a Bruker DPX400 with the spectral widths of 20124.256 and 1905.488 Hz for the 13C and 1H dimensions, respectively. The data matrix was zero-filled to 2,000 × 4,000 and processed with a shifted sine square function. A two-dimensional HMBC spectrum was obtained on a Bruker DPX400 with the spectral widths of 20124.256 and 1905.488 Hz for the 13C and 1H dimensions, respectively. The data matrix was zero-filled to 2,000 × 4,000 and processed with a shifted sine square function. O-Acetyl-ADP-ribose is a natural product produced from the coupled deacetylation of histones/proteins and the concomitant cleavage of β-NAD+ by the Sir2 family of histone/protein deacetylases (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 20Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). From the known chemistry of the anomeric carbon of ribose, we had initially proposed α-1′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose as the enzymatic product produced by the Sir2 family of histone/protein deacetylases. However, the location of the acetate moiety was not determined from the initial mass spectral data (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). To provide evidence that the acetate moiety is located on the ribose ring from which nicotinamide had been attached, we initially used mass spectrometry to analyze enzymatically produced O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Using authentic ADP-ribose as a generalized structure, it was conceivable that the acetate moiety resides on other potential acetylation sites within the ADP-ribose core structure. Analysis of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose using post-source decay MS/MS afforded molecular ions having masses that corresponded to that of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (m/z 602, M + 1), adenosine diphosphate (m/z 428, M + 1), adenosine monophosphate (m/z 349, M + 1), adenine (m/z 136, M + 1), ribose-5-phosphate (m/z 232, M + 1), and acetylated ribose-5-phosphate (m/z 274, M + 1). The presence of acetylated ribose-5-phosphate in the mass spectrum indicated that the acetate moiety resided only on the ribose ring (either the anomeric carbon at C-1′, C-2′, or C-3′), formally attached to nicotinamide. To identify the exact location of the acetate moiety in the enzymatically derived product, the procedure reported by Tanner et al. (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) was modified to obtain pure O-acetyl-ADP-ribose for analysis by NMR. When this new protocol was employed, we observed two products (compound A, tR = 15.4; compound B,tR = 16.5 min) that were found to flank the β-NAD+ (tR = 16.0 min) in the HPLC elution profile (Fig. 2). To determine which compound was the acetylated ADP-ribose derivative, both of the samples were submitted for mass spectral analysis and found to have identical molecular weights of 601 (m/z 602, M + 1). This indicated that the product might be a mixture of two different stereoisomers or regioisomers. By analogy, α-NAD+ and β-NAD+ have significantly different retention times using this HPLC protocol, suggesting that compound A and B could also be stereoisomers. The ratio of the two compounds was determined as 52%:48% for compound A (tR = 15.4 min) and compound B (tR = 16.5 min), respectively, calculated from integration of the two peaks from the HPLC chromatogram. Collectively, these observations suggested either that both compounds were enzyme-derived or that one was enzyme-derived and the other was solvent-derived (nonenzymatic). To determine whether either compound A or compound B could be interconverted nonenzymatically, stability and equilibrium studies of the two O-acetyl-ADP-ribose species were conducted in a variety of buffers and conditions. When either compound was purified by HPLC and subsequently reinjected into the instrument, no interconversion was observed (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained for compound B. However, when the compounds were isolated, lyophilized, and resuspended in either water or a slightly alkaline buffer (Tris (pH 7.5 at 37 °C) or phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2–7.3)), interconversion of the two compounds was observed within 5 min and was maintained at the 52:48 ratio described previously (data not shown). The equilibrium process could be slowed, however, if the compounds were stored at low temperature (4 or −25 °C) in water containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. When compound A was stored in water at 4 or −25 °C containing 0.05% tetrafluoroacetic acid for up to 4 h, less than 10% of the total material was present as compound B, based upon integration of the HPLC chromatogram. These observations indicated that the two compounds were in rapid equilibrium under neutral or slightly alkaline conditions and suggested that at least one of the compounds could be purely solvent-derived. Because both compounds A and B existed in a rapid equilibrium under slightly alkaline reaction conditions, it was critical to determine which compound is formed by the enzyme and, therefore, the true enzymatic product of the reaction. Using a rapid quenched flow technique, single-turnover experiments were performed. HST2 and excess acetylated H3 peptide were rapidly mixed with substoichiometric amounts of β-NAD+ and subsequently quenched with trifluoroacetic acid at different time points. Several samples were taken for each time point, combined, and analyzed by HPLC using the modified protocol outlined under “Materials and Methods.” Chromatograms from each time point (Fig. 4) indicated a clear decrease in the amount of β-NAD+ over time, whereas only compound B (tR = 16.4 min) was detected and correlated with β-NAD+ consumption. No significant amounts of compound A were detected using this method. When the O-acetyl-ADP-ribose derived from the quenched flow experiment (tR = 16.4 min) was isolated, lyophilized, and resuspended in Tris buffer, both species were observed upon subsequent HPLC analysis (data not shown). To verify that the species produced in the quenched flow experiment was the same as that observed under steady-state conditions, the quenched flow species was collected and co-injected with purified compound B. Upon co-injection, the HPLC chromatogram revealed co-elution of the two species, indicating that both were identified as compound B. These experiments provided strong evidence that compound B is formed on the enzyme surface and, upon release from the active site into bulk solvent, exists in an equilibrium with compound A. To help provide the proper assignments in the NMR structural analyses of products A and B, we carried out first a complete characterization of authentic ADP-ribose, the parent molecule of products A and B. We reasoned that the 1H and13C NMR spectra of both compounds would be very similar to that of ADP-ribose, with the only major differences expected with the proton that is directly attached to the carbon baring the acetate moiety. Because the acetate moiety is more electron-withdrawing than the corresponding hydroxyl group, a downfield shift in the resonance of the proton directly attached to the carbon baring the acetate moiety would be observed. This would also be the case concerning the13C spectrum. Because no chemical shift data of ADP-ribose could be found in the literature, ADP-ribose was first characterized using both one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments. Instead of D2O, Me2SO-d6 was selected as the NMR solvent of choice, eliminating many problems associated with the location of the water signal (HDO = 4.8 ppm) and lack of an external 13C reference. Initially using D2O as the solvent, the water signal was located among the resonances associated with the compound, making interpretation more difficult. In addition, greater stability of the acetylated compounds was observed in Me2SO-d6. Also of significance, the α- and β-isomers of ADP-ribose existed as roughly a 55:45 mixture in D2O, but that ratio was shifted to ∼80:20 when the solvent was switched to Me2SO-d6, further simplifying the spectra. Using Me2SO-d6, the1H NMR spectrum of ADP-ribose (see the supplemental material) was assigned based upon correlations observed in the DQF-COSY (see the supplemental material) as presented in Table I. The 13C chemical shift data were assigned using a HSQC (see the supplemental material) experiment, which detects coupled heteronuclear spins across single bonds such as 1H-13C, in conjunction with13C NMR.Table I1H and 13C data for ADP-ribose Position1H chemical shift1-aChemical shifts were assigned using correlations observed in the DQF-COSY experiment.13C chemical shift1-bChemical shifts were assigned in part using correlations observed in the HSQC and 13C NMR experiments.ppmppmAdenosine unit 28.42 (s, 1H)139.3 4152.5 5118.7 6155.9 88.15 (s, 1H)149.4 1""5.91 (d, 1H, J= 6.6 Hz)86.9 2""5.06 (dd, 1H, J = 5.8, 9.7 Hz)96.0 3""4.92 (dd, 1H, J = 9.7, 10.6 Hz)101.6 4""4.54 (m, 1H)73.3 5a"", 5b""3.90, 4.27 (m, 2H)70.0Ribose unit (α-anomer) 1′4.93 (d, 1H, 2.10 Hz)101.6 2′3.64 (dd, 1H,J = 2.32, 7.0 Hz)75.0 3′3.95 (dd, 1H,J = 6.8, 9.1 Hz)70.5 4′3.81 (m, 1H)80.2 5a′, 5b′4.53–4.02 (m, 2H)NA1-cNA, not applicable.1-a Chemical shifts were assigned using correlations observed in the DQF-COSY experiment.1-b Chemical shifts were assigned in part using correlations observed in the HSQC and 13C NMR experiments.1-c NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab For the characterization of compounds A and B by NMR, rigorous purification of the HST2-catalyzed reaction was performed, affording compounds A and B as white flocculent residues. When analyzing compound A in D2O containing 0.05% tetrafluoroacetic acid-d1, a small amount of conversion to compound B (tR = 15.5 min) was observed over the course of 12 h (data not shown). However, switching the NMR solvent to Me2SO-d6 further minimized the conversion of A to B. The 1H NMR of compound B showed a mixture of compound A and B in both D2O and Me2SO-d6, indicating that a conversion from compound B to compound A had occurred during the brief sample preparation period before NMR analysis. This was evident by the presence of two distinct doublets at 4.98 and 5.04 ppm, respectively (Fig. 5A). Compound B was further characterized by DQF-COSY (see the supplemental material) and HSQC experiments (see the supplemental material) to assign both the1H spectrum and obtain 13C chemical shift data (Table II). As initially proposed, the proton at C-2′ was located much further downfield in comparison with the same proton found in ADP-ribose. The large downfield change in the chemical shift of proton C-2′ in compound B, compared with the identical proton at C-2′ of ADP-ribose, strongly suggested the presence of the acetate moiety at C-2′.Table II1H and 13C data for 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribosePosition1H chemical shift2-aChemical shifts were assigned using correlations observed in the DQF-COSY experiment.13C chemical shift2-bChemical shifts were assigned in part using correlations observed in the HSQC, HMBC, and 13C NMR experiment.ppmppmAdenosine unit 28.47 (s, 1H)142.2 4NA2-cNA, not applicable. 5NA 6NA 88.22 (s, 1H)153.8 1′5.94 (d, 1H, J = 7.4 Hz)88.0 2′4.57 (dd, 1H, J = 7.7, 9.0 Hz)74.4 3′4.24 (dd, 1H, J = 7.8, 9.8 Hz)70.9 4′4.09 (m, 1H, J = 9.2 Hz)84.1 5a′, 5b′3.93–4.01 (m, 2H)67.6Ribose unit (α anomer) 1""5.04 (d, 1H, 2.0 Hz)99.9 2""4.74 (dd, 1H,J = 1.9, 7.9 Hz)78.2 3""4.20 (dd, 1H,J = 8.2, 9.7 Hz)69.7 4""3.83 (m, 1H,J = 9.3 Hz)81.6 5a"", 5b""3.81–4.12 (m, 2H)NAAcetate unit 10170.0 112.02 (s, 3H)22.12-a Chemical shifts were assigned using correlations observed in the DQF-COSY experiment.2-b Chemical shifts were assigned in part using correlations observed in the HSQC, HMBC, and 13C NMR experiment.2-c NA, not applicable.

Open table in a new tab To unambiguously determine the location of the acetate residue within compounds A and B, the samples were analyzed by HMBC spectroscopy. The HMBC experiment detects proton-carbon connectivities through couplings over two or three bonds (nJCH,n = 2 or 3) and will unambiguously identify the location of the acetate moiety within the compound. These bonds can be carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom (nitrogen or oxygen). Two bond couplings typically have magnitudes of 5–60 Hz, whereas three bond couplings are typically much smaller in magnitude (<5 Hz). Four bond couplings are difficult to observe because the magnitude of the carbon-hydrogen coupling is typically less than 1 Hz. As a comparison, typical single bond carbon-hydrogen couplings, as are observed in the HSQC experiment, are in the range of 100–150 Hz. The long range couplings that are expected for 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose are presented in Fig. 6. Regardless of the actual location of the acetate residue, the important correlation that will identify the location of the acetate occurs between the carbonyl carbon of acetate and the coupled hydrogen located on one of the carbon atoms of the ribose ring. To increase the sensitivity of the HMBC experiment for the analysis of 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, the enzymatic synthesis of enriched [1-13C]acetate-labeled ADP-ribose was initiated. [1-13C]Acetyl H3 peptide was first prepared using a coupled enzyme assay that was originally developed in the laboratory (22Kim Y. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose were enriched with13C at the acetate carbonyl using 1-13C-labeled H3 peptide generated as presented in Fig. 7. Briefly, [1-13C]acetyl coenzyme A is initially generated through the use of pyruvate dehydrogenase and [2-13C]pyruvic acid. The labeled acetyl-CoA thus formed is consumed in the subsequent coupled reaction by the acetyltransferase P/CAF to specifically acetylate Lys-14 of the H3 peptide. The resulting13C-labeled H3 peptide was purified by HPLC using the standard protocol (17Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and 13C incorporation confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). The labeled peptide was used to generate 1-13C-labeled compounds A and B, which were combined with unlabeled 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose to obtain up to 14% enriched material. Analysis of 13C-labeled compound A by HMBC resulted in a strong correlation observed between the carbonyl carbon of acetate (169.9 ppm) and the proton at 4.91 as presented in Fig. 8A. This proton resonance, as reported in Table III, corresponds to the H3′ proton of 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and confirmed that the acetate moiety resides on C-3′ of the ribose ring from which nicotinamide had been attached. Also observed was a very small correlation between the acetate carbonyl (169.9 ppm) and the H2′ proton of 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, indicating that the slight interconversion between 3′- and 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose had occurred during the preparation of the sample. This was confirmed upon reinjection and analysis by HPLC. Analysis of 13C-labeled 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (compound B) by HMBC resulted in a major correlation between the proton at 4.74 ppm and the acetate carbonyl at 170.0 ppm (Fig. 8B). A smaller correlation was observed between a proton at 4.91 ppm and the acetate carbonyl at 169.9 ppm, representing a slight amount of 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, which had interconverted during the work-up. Again, this was verified by reinjection and analysis by HPLC. The presence of strong correlations between the acetate carbonyl and the proton at C-2′ for 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose or C-3′ for 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose unequivocally identifies the location of the acetate moiety in both compounds. Collectively, these results indicate that 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose is the authentic enzymatic product and, upon expulsion of 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose from the active site, rapidly equilibrates to form 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose through an intramolecular transesterification reaction. In the present study, we have identified 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose as the enzymatic products produced by the Sir2 family of histone/protein deacetylases. The structures of 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose have been confirmed using both one- and two-dimensional NMR techniques. Interestingly, 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose are not stable regioisomers, because both were shown to exist in a rapid equilibrium with the other. Using rapid quenched flow techniques, we demonstrated that 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose is formed by the enzyme and equilibrates to 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose in aqueous solvents. During the preparation of this manuscript, an independent research group published an accelerated report on the structural analysis of 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (23Sauve A.A. Celic I. Avalos J. Deng H. Boeke J.D. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15456-15463Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Their structural conclusions were based upon nuclear Overhauser effects observed between the methyl hydrogens of acetate and the hydrogen atoms residing at C-2′ or C-3′. Unfortunately, because this is an indirect structural method, it is difficult to make unambiguous assignments. Nuclear Overhauser effects result from through-space interactions between hydrogen atoms and, as such, can be misleading when various structural conformations can produce different nuclear Overhauser effects. The HMBC experiment utilized in our study is a direct technique that relies on scalar couplings within the molecule and therefore specifically identifies only those nuclei that are coupled, precisely pinpointing the location of the acetate residue."

We examined transcripts for Kv1.3, h-erg, h-eag, and BEC1 genes in primary lymphocytes and leukemias and in several hematopoietic cell lines. Surprisingly, BEC1, formerly thought to be brain-specific, was present in all the primary leukemias examined, in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in proliferating activated tonsillar cells, lymphocytes from Sjögren's patients, and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cells. Only h-erg mRNA was up-regulated in the cancer cells, but this was not due to proliferation per se, because it was not elevated in any of the proliferating noncancerous lymphocyte types examined. Nor did h-erg transcript levels correlate with the B-cell subset, because it was elevated in immature neoplastic B-CLL cells (CD5+) and in a CD5− Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji) but not in Sjögren's syndrome cells (enriched in CD5+ B-cells) or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cells, which are mature CD5− B-cells.

There are many channels in the Kv superfamily, which is divided into Shaker (Kv1–Kv4) and ether-a-go-go(eag) families. In normal T lymphocytes, Kv1.3 channels have been clearly demonstrated as important for proliferation and volume regulation (for reviews, see Refs. 7Kotecha S.A. Schlichter L.C. J.

For instance, in the human myeloid leukemia cell line, ML-1, the nonselective Kv channel blocker 4-aminopyridine reduced proliferation and induced differentiation (15Lu L. Yang T. Markakis D.

The specific Kv channel or mechanism of involvement was not identified. In direct contrast to these findings, it was proposed that the absence of a delayed rectifier (Kv) current contributed to the malignant state of megakaryocytes from myelogenous leukemia patients and in a human erythroleukemia cell line (18Kapural L. Feinstein M.B. O'Rourke F. Fein A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of Kv channels has been detected in some cancers of nonhematopoietic origin. The most compelling evidence for a role in cell transformation, and thus a therapeutic potential, exists for the eag family. eag transcripts and protein are present in numerous primary human cancers, such as endometroid adenocarcinomas, and in several human and murine cell lines (19Bianchi L.

Evidence for their oncogenic potential is that overexpression of eag in CHO or NIH3T3 cells induced several features characteristic of malignant transformation (faster growth, loss of growth factor and substrate dependence, and loss of contact inhibition), and antisense reduction of eag mRNA expression decreased the proliferation of several tumor cell lines (20Pardo L.A. del Camino D.

In the present study we examined expression of Kv1.3 and two eag family members, h-erg and the recently cloned BEC1, in a broad range of human hematopoietic cell lines, in cells from several chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, and in peripheral blood lymphocytes from several normal individuals.h-erg was expressed in all of the hematopoietic cell types examined, except Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cells.h-erg expression (but not BEC1 or Kv1.3) was consistently higher in all the cancer cells than in the noncancer cells. We detected macroscopic HERG currents in three human leukemic cell lines: the T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, CEM, the chronic myelogenous leukemia, K562, and the histiocytic leukemia, U937, and the average current amplitude correlated with the amount of protein detected by Western blot analysis. Using the specific HERG blocker E-4031, we show that the HERG current plays a role in proliferation of these leukemic cell lines. Normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes were generated in the F. Tsui laboratory. Primary cells from patients with Sjögren's syndrome and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) were obtained from Dr. A. Bookman (Toronto Western Hospital) and Dr. J. Scott (Toronto General Hospital). Permanent human cell lines representing Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CEM), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (U937 and HL-60) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Primary tonsillar lymphocytes were activated by a 72-h incubation in 1% (w/v) of the mitogen, phytohemagglutinin (Sigma). All cells were cultured in endotoxin-free α-minimal essential medium that was supplemented with 26 mmNaHCO3, 100 mg/l streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cultures were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were counted each day with a hemacytometer using 0.4% trypan blue and then passaged every 2 days to maintain them in the exponential growth phase (i.e. maintained at 1–2 × 105 cells/ml). All of the cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. For all primary cells and cell lines the total mRNA was extracted using the TRIzol® method (Invitrogen). Total mRNA (0.5 μg) was reverse transcribed at 37 °C for 30 min in 1× RT buffer (50 mmKCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.01% gelatin) with 1 mm dNTP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 units/μl RNasin, 100 μg/ml oligo(dT), and 50 units SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. After first-strand cDNA synthesis, the PCR amplifications were conducted using the GeneAmp PCR 9600 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the following primers. For h-erg the forward primer was 5′-CAGCGGCTGTACTCGGGCACAG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CAGAAGTGGTCGGAGAACTC-3′ (product size, 567 bp). For Kv1.3, the forward primer was 5′-TCGAGACGCAGCTGAAGAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GGTACTCGAAGAGCAGCCAC-3′ (product size, ∼350 bp). For h-eag, the forward primer was 5′-CGCATGAACTACCTGAAGACG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TCTGTGGATGGGGCGATGTTC-3′ (data not shown). For BEC1, the forward primer was 5′-CACTGTCTCTGGCCCTGCG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TGTCCACCTCTGCAGAGCCT-3′ (product size, 366 bp). The PCR mixture was incubated for 1 min at 95 °C, and then 0.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, a 15-s denaturing phase at 94 °C, a 15-s annealing phase (at 62 °C for h-erg, 60 °C for Kv1.3, and 64 °C for BEC1), and a 15-s extension phase at 72 °C, with a final extension phase of 6 min at 72 °C. The resulting DNA products were resolved in 2% agarose gels labeled with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide, and their fluorescence intensities were measured with a fluorescence reader (Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager). The identities of the RT-PCR-amplified products were confirmed by sequencing (ACGT, Toronto, Canada). The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3V04, 1 mm NaF, and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and one protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The protein content of the supernatant was measured with the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of 20–50 μg of each lysate were boiled for 3 min in 3× sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and then incubated with anti-HERG antibody (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel; APC-062, residues 1106–1159 of HERG) overnight at 4 °C. After two washes with TBST and two washes with TBS, the membranes were incubated (for 1 h at room temperature) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000; Cedarlane Labs, Hornby, Canada). Following another two washes with TBST and two washes with TBS, labeled proteins were visualized using ECL on high performance chemiluminescence film (HyperfilmTM; AmershamBiosciences). Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from CEM, K562, U937, Raji, and HL-60 cells using an Axopatch 200 or 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), using 5-kHz filtering and on-line compensation for series resistance and capacitance. All of the signals were analyzed using pCLAMP 6.0 or 8.0 software (Axon Instruments). The data were stored on a computer and displayed using the Origin program (version 6.1; Origin Labs, Northampton, MA). Pipettes with resistances of 3–5 MΩ were made from thin walled borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI, Sarasota). While HERG currents were being recorded, the cells were superfused with an extracellular solution containing 130 mm potassium aspartate, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted to 300 mOsm with sucrose. The pipette solution contained 130 mm potassium aspartate, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm K2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES, titrated with KOH to pH 7.2, and adjusted to 290 mOsm with sucrose. Aspartate was used as the major anion to reduce potential contamination by Cl− currents. All of the recordings were made at 20–23 °C. At normal [K+]o outward HERG K+ currents are difficult to detect because of rapid inactivation of the channels at depolarized potentials (36Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T.

However, the currents can be amplified and inward currents can be measured at hyperpolarized potentials by using high extracellular K+ concentrations; we used 130 mm (Nernst potential, ∼0 mV), and hyperpolarizing steps from a holding potential of +20 mV. Stock solutions of CsCl (50 mm) and BaCl2 (1 mm) were made in distilled water and kept at room temperature. The selective HERG channel blocker, E-4031 (Alomone Laboratories) (39Zhou W. Cayabyab F.S.

The CyQUANT® cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (41Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol.

This nucleic acid-based fluorescent assay for determining the number of cells exhibits a linear response between about 50 and 50,000 cells/well (42Jones L.J. Gray M. Yue S.T. Haugland R.P. Singer V.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 254: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which was confirmed in our hands. For K562 and U937 cells, 5,000 cells were loaded into each well of 96-well plates (Sarstedt, Newton, NC). For the nonadherent HL-60 and CEM cells, the plates were coated with 5 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma), and 10,000 cells/well were used. After each cell type was incubated with or without 1 μm E-4031 for 48 h, the fluorescence intensity measured with the CyQUANT® assay was compared with intensities from 5000 or 10000 cells (the starting number of cells) of the same type. An increase in fluorescence signal in any well (compared with the starting number of cells) indicates an increase in cell numbers; i.e. proliferation. The fluorescence intensities, with or without E-4031, were compared to assess the effect of blocking HERG on the normal proliferation of each cell line. Our data from the CyQUANT assay are expressed as means ± S.E., and a paired Student's t test was used to assess the ability of E-4031 to suppress proliferation, with p < 0.05 taken as statistically significant. RT-PCR was used to detect transcripts for HERG, Kv1.3, and BEC1 channels (h-erg, Kv1.3, BEC1), and β-actin in cells from leukemia patients, several leukemic cell lines, and normal human lymphocytes (Fig. 1). To compare expression between different cell types (Table I), the fluorescence intensity of each ethidium bromide-labeled product was first normalized to the β-actin signal from the same sample. Then the mRNA expression in the primary leukemic cells and leukemic cell lines was compared with expression in normal (i.e. unstimulated) mature PBL. All nine patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia had substantially higher h-erg transcript levels (9–15-fold higher) than normal PBL. All the hematopoietic cells lines (except HL-60 and Ramos) had elevated h-erg transcript levels: 6-fold higher in the two Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (Raji, BL2), 10-fold higher in the pro-myelocytic leukemia, U937, 18-fold higher in the pro-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, CEM, and 19-fold higher in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia, K562.Table ITranscript levels for the Kv channels, HERG, BEC1, and Kv1.3Cell typeCell lineh-ergBEC1Kv1.3BLBL261-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1.1Raji61-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.Ramos11-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1CMLK562191-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.PMLU937101-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.HL-6011-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1ALLCEM182.71-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.B-CLL9–150.4–1.10.7–1.8EBV1-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.TON11-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.1-aLevels less than those in normal PBL.SS0.7–20.7–1.21.4–1.5The numbers represent the transcript levels in human hematopoietic cell lines, primary leukemia cells, and nonleukemic primary lymphocytes standardized to the levels in unstimulated normal PBL from six donors.

Three cell types were used to assess whether h-erg up-regulation simply corresponds with an activated, proliferative state. h-erg mRNA was not up-regulated in activated primary tonsillar cells, which are mostly proliferating T lymphocytes, or in highly proliferating EBV-transformed B-cells (CD5−mature B-cells) where h-erg transcripts were nearly undetectable. Finally, the h-erg level was not increased in PBL from Sjögren's syndrome patients (n = 3) compared with normal PBL. Sjögren's syndrome is classified as a disorder that lies between hyperplasia and neoplasia, but the highly proliferative mature lymphocytes are not cancerous. h-erg mRNA was 6–11-fold higher in the immature neoplastic B-CLL cells (95% CD5+ B-cells) than in Sjögren's syndrome cells, which are enriched in CD5+ B-cells (and CD4+ T-cells). These comparisons also rule out the possibility that h-erg up-regulation depends on the B-cell type (CD5+ versus CD5−). In contrast with up-regulated h-erg expression,Kv1.3 transcripts were not significantly increased in any of the cell types. The primary leukemia cells and activated tonsillar cells had normal levels of Kv1.3 mRNA expression, the levels were lower in the cell lines than in PBL (Table I), and Kv1.3 was not detected in K562 cells (Fig. 1).BEC1 was present in all of the primary leukemias and lymphocytes examined but was not detected in the cell lines, except for CEM and MOLT-4. As a further indication that h-erg was selectively up-regulated among the Kv channels expressed, transcripts for the related channel, h-eag, were not detected in any primary leukemic cells or nontransformed lymphocytes examined and only at low levels in K562 and the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, MOLT-4 (data not shown). The presence of HERG protein was assessed in CEM, K562, U937, and HL-60 cells using a polyclonal anti-HERG antibody and Western blot analysis. We detected immunoreactive doublets at ∼130 and 140 kDa, with the highest level in K562 cells, followed by CEM and then U937 cells, and with very low levels in HL-60 cells (Fig. 2). A doublet with similarly sized bands has been previously reported for both endogenous and heterologously expressed HERG (24Hofmann G. Bernabei P.A. Crociani O. Cherubini A. Guasti L. Pillozzi S.

In a search for novel transcriptional mediators of this process, we used differential display PCR analysis of undifferentiated primary ES cells and cells stimulated with 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP). We now report on the role of forkhead homologue in rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR), a recently described member of the forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor family, as a mediator of endometrial differentiation. Sustained 8-Br-cAMP stimulation resulted in the induction and nuclear accumulation of FKHR in differentiating ES cells. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that endometrial stromal expression of FKHR in vivo is confined to decidualizing cells during the late secretory phase of the cycle and coincides with the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). Reporter gene studies showed that FKHR potently enhances PKA-dependent activation of the tissue-specific decidual prolactin (dPRL) promoter, a major differentiation marker in human ES cells. Transcriptional augmentation by FKHR was effected through functional cooperation with C/EBPβ and binding to a composite FKHR-C/EBPβ response unit in the proximal promoter region. Furthermore, FKHR and C/EBPβ were shown to interact directly in a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. These results provide the first evidence of regulated expression of FKHR and demonstrate that FKHR has an integral role in PKA-dependent endometrial differentiation through its ability to bind and functionally cooperate with C/EBPβ.

During the menstrual cycle, ovarian estradiol and progesterone stimulate the ordered growth and differentiation of endometrial tissue compartments. In the human, this includes synchronous growth and coiling of the spiral arteries, secretory transformation of glandular epithelium, migration of bone marrow-derived cells, and decidualization of the stroma, which is thought to be essential for blastocyst implantation and subsequent formation of a hemochorial placenta.

Previous studies have shown that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), a member of the C/EBP subfamily of basic region/leucine zipper transcription factors, is induced during ES cell differentiation (4Pohnke Y. Kempf R. Gellersen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24808-24818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBPβ participates in the formation of a nucleoprotein complex that binds the proximal dPRL promoter region upon PKA activation (4Pohnke Y. Kempf R. Gellersen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24808-24818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although other members of the C/EBP family are expressed in cultured human ES cells, including C/EBPα and δ, C/EBPβ is the major and cAMP-inducible form (4Pohnke Y. Kempf R. Gellersen B. J. Biol.

To establish the identity of additional factors relevant to the decidual process, we used differential display PCR and isolated FKHR (forkhead homologue inrhabdomyosarcoma) as a cAMP-inducible gene in differentiating human ES cells. Forkhead or “winged helix” transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in cell differentiation, embryogenesis, and oncogenesis (8Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech.

The capping apparatus is the first of the assemblies to act on the nascent pre-mRNA. Although recruitment of the capping enzymes to the transcription complex is dependent on phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the Rpb1 subunit of polymerase II (Pol-II), there may be additional levels of control that coordinate capping with elongation. Here we show that the triphosphatase (Pct1) and guanylyltransferase (Pce1) enzymes of the fission yeast capping apparatus bind independently to the elongation factor Spt5. The C-terminal domain of the 990-amino acid Schizosaccharomyces pombe Spt5 protein, composed of repeats of a nonapeptide motif (consensus sequence TPAWNSGSK), is necessary and sufficient for binding to the capping enzymes in vivo (in a two-hybrid assay) and in vitro. As few as four nonamer repeats suffice for Spt5 binding to Pct1 in vitro, whereas six repeats are required for Spt5 binding to Pce1. A 116-amino acid fragment of the guanylyltransferase Pce1 suffices for binding to the Spt5 C-terminal domain (CTD) but not for binding to the Pol-II CTD. Pct1 and Pce1 can bind simultaneously to the Spt5 CTD in vitro. We find that Spt5 is essential for viability of S. pombe and that it interacts in vivo with S. pombe Spt4 via a central domain distinct from the Spt5 CTD. We suggest that Spt5-induced arrest of elongation at promoter proximal positions ensures a temporal window for recruitment of the capping enzymes.

We suggest that Spt5-induced arrest of elongation at promoter proximal positions ensures a temporal window for recruitment of the capping enzymes. mRNA capping occurs cotranscriptionally by a series of three enzymatic reactions in which the 5′ triphosphate terminus of the pre-mRNA is cleaved to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase, then capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase, and methylated at the N7 position of guanine by RNA (guanine-7) methyltransferase (1Shuman S.

The mammalian capping enzyme (Mce1) is a bifunctional polypeptide composed of an N-terminal RNA triphosphatase domain linked to a C-terminal guanylyltransferase domain. The guanylyltransferase domain per se binds to Pol-II CTD-PO4, but the triphosphatase domain does not (5Ho C.K. Sriskanda V. McCracken S. Bentley D. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9577-9585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,11Ho C.K. Shuman S. Molecular Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe employs a unique strategy of cap targeting whereby the triphosphatase (Pct1) and guanylyltransferase (Pce1) enzymes of the capping apparatus are not associated physically with each other (as they are in budding yeast and metazoans) but instead bind independently to the phosphorylated Pol-II CTD (12Pei Y. Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28075-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although interactions between Pol-II and capping enzymes offer a satisfying explanation for the specific capping of nascent pre-mRNAs, it is conceivable that other factors are also involved in linking capping to transcription. For example, Wen and Shatkin reported that hSpt5, the human homolog of yeast transcription elongation factor Spt5, interacts directly with the mammalian capping enzyme (13Wen Y. Shatkin A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). hSpt5 translated in vitro binds independently to the N-terminal triphosphatase and C-terminal guanylyltransferase domains of Mce1. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) employs yet another mechanism to recruit the capping enzyme to the HIV transcription unit, whereby the viral Tat protein binds directly and independently to the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase domains of Mce1 and up-regulates both catalytic activities (14Chiu Y.L. Coronel E. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12959-12966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Spt5 and Tat are intimately connected to the regulation of HIV gene expression. hSpt5 (a 1087-amino acid polypeptide) and its binding partner hSpt4 (a 117-amino acid polypeptide) comprise the transcription elongation regulatory factor DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor) (15Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H.

DSIF binds to Pol-II and, in concert with the negative elongation factor (NELF), represses elongation at promoter-proximal positions in the transcription unit (17Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T.

Escape from the repressive effect of DSIF/NELF requires the action of P-TEFb (Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b), a DRB-sensitive protein kinase that phosphorylates both the CTD of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II and the Spt5 subunit of DSIF (19Wada T.

P-TEFb is composed of two subunits, Cdk9 and cyclin T, and it binds to the HIV Tat protein via the cyclin T subunit (20Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In the case of HIV, it has been suggested that: (i) Spt5-induced arrest at promoter-proximal sites prolongs the opportunity for recruitment of the mammalian capping enzyme to the elongation complex through a multiplicity of Mce1 interactions with Tat, Spt5, and the Pol-II CTD and (ii) Tat directly enhances the efficiency of capping of the HIV pre-mRNA (14Chiu Y.L. Coronel E. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12959-12966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear whether and how the capping apparatus fits into the Spt5 regulatory axis during gene expression in yeast. By studying the macromolecular interactions of the S. pombe capping apparatus in vivo using a two-hybrid approach, we have identified the essential S. pombe Spt5 protein as a binding partner of the triphosphatase (Pct1) and guanylyltransferase (Pce1) components of the fission yeast capping machinery. We show that the C-terminal nonapeptide repeat domain of S. pombe Spt5 binds avidly and independently to Pct1 and Pce1 in vitro. A discrete domain of Pce1 suffices for binding to Spt5. We hypothesize that the purpose of the Spt5/capping enzyme interaction is to ensure timely capping of the nascent pre-mRNA before committing Pol-II to processive elongation. The screen was performed as described previously using binding domain (BD)-Pce1 and BD-Pct1 as the bait (12Pei Y. Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28075-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA recovered from the strains that tested positive for both HIS3 and lacZ expression was used as the template for PCR amplification of the S. pombe DNA insert with flanking primers specific for the activation domain (AD) fusion plasmid. The PCR products were gel-purified and then sequenced. The AD plasmid clones were recovered after transformation into E. coli DH5α. Gene fragments encoding N-terminal-truncated versions of S. pombe Spt5 were generated by PCR amplification using sense primers that introduced a BamHI site at the 5′ end of the truncated Spt5 coding region and an antisense primer that introduced an XhoI site immediately downstream of the stop codon. Gene fragments encoding C-terminal-truncated versions of Spt5 were generated by PCR amplification using antisense primers that introduced stop codons in lieu of the codons for amino acids 961, 925, 899, or 801, and a XhoI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and then inserted into the two-hybrid AD fusion vector pGAD-GH. Gene fragments encoding N-terminal truncated versions of Pce1 were generated by PCR amplification using sense primers that introduced an NcoI site at the 5′ end of the truncated coding region and an antisense primer that introduced a BamHI site immediately downstream of the stop codon. Gene fragments encoding C-terminal truncated versions of Pce1 were generated by PCR amplification using antisense primers that introduced stop codons in lieu of the codons for amino acids 351, 301, or 251 and a BamHI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted into the two-hybrid BD fusion vector pAS2–1. Gene fragments encoding N-terminal-truncated versions of Pct1 were generated by PCR amplification using sense primers that introduced an NdeI site at the codons for amino acids 21, 41, 51, 61, or 77. The antisense primers introduced a BamHI site immediately downstream of the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into pAS2–1. The full-length S. pombe SPT4 gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using primers that introduced an NdeI site at the start codon and a BamHI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into pAS2–1. All of the inserts were sequenced to ensure that the truncated SPT5, PCT1, or PCE1 genes were fused in-frame to BD or AD and that no unwanted coding changes had been introduced during amplification and cloning. S. pombe guanylyltransferase Pce1 and RNA triphosphatase Pct1 were produced in E. coli as N-terminal His10-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously (12Pei Y. Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28075-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Pce1 without an affinity tag was produced as follows. A DNA fragment containing the complete PCE1 cDNA with a BamHI restriction site at each end was inserted into the bacterial expression vector pET28-His6-Smt3 so as to fuse the PCE1 cDNA in-frame to His6-Smt3. The resulting plasmid pET28-Smt3-PCE1 was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). A 200-ml culture was grown from a single kanamycin-resistant transformant at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 60 μg/ml kanamycin until the A600reached 0.5. The culture was placed on ice for 30 min and then adjusted to 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% (v/v) ethanol. Incubation was continued for 20 h at 18 °C with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mmNaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml; the suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min and then sonicated for 30 s. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and sonication was repeated to reduce the viscosity of the lysate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 17,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extract was applied to a 1-ml column of Ni-NTA-agarose that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The His6-Smt3-Pce1 fusion protein was retained on the column and recovered predominantly in the 100 mm imidazole fraction. The eluate was dialyzed overnight against buffer B to remove imidazole. The fusion protein was then digested with purified recombinant Ulp1 (25Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) at a Ulp1/His6-Smt3-Pce1 ratio of 1:200 (w/w) for 2 h on ice. The digested material was applied to a 1-ml column of Ni-NTA-agarose that had been equilibrated with buffer B. Native Pce1 (1 mg) was recovered in the flow-through fraction. Protein concentrations were determined by using the BioRad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The open reading frames encoding Spt5(801–990), Spt5(801–898), Spt5(845–898), and Spt5(845–880) were PCR-amplified using primers that introduced an NcoI site at the 5′ end and an XhoI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and XhoI and inserted into the pGEX-KG vector. The resulting plasmids encode glutathione-S-transferase (GST)–Spt5 fusion proteins. The inserts were sequenced to verify that no unwanted coding changes had been introduced during amplification and cloning. Plasmids encoding GST and the GST-Spt5 fusion proteins were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Single transformants were grown at 37 °C in 100 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.5. The cultures were placed on ice for 30 min and then adjusted to 0.5 mmisoprooyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% (v/v) ethanol. Incubation was continued for 20 h at 18 °C with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. GST and the GST–Spt5 fusion proteins were purified from soluble lysates by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin according to the instructions of the vendor (Pharmacia). GST and the GST–Spt5 fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with buffer containing 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The elutes were dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100 and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant Spt5(801–990) without an affinity tag was produced by cloning the open reading frame into the bacterial expression vector pET28-His6-Smt3 so as to fuse Spt5(801–990) in-frame to His6-Smt3. The His6-Smt3-Spt5(801–990) protein was produced in bacteria, purified by nickel-agarose chromatography, and digested with Ulp1 to remove the tag. The Spt5(801–990) protein was then purified free of the tag using methods described above for His6-Smt3-Pce1. 20 μg of purified His-Pct1 or His-Pce1 was adsorbed to 50 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) during a 1-h incubation at 4 °C in 500 μl of binding buffer 1 (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.005% Tween 20). The beads were washed once with 0.5 ml of binding buffer 1 to remove any unbound protein. The beads were then mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of purified GST or GST-Spt5 in 300 μl of binding buffer 1. The beads were then concentrated by microcentrifugation, and the supernatant was withdrawn. The beads were resuspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer 1 and subjected to two rounds of concentration and washing. After the second wash, the bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of binding buffer 1 containing 250 mm imidazole. Aliquots (25 μl) of the input and the bead-bound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 20 μg of purified GST or GST-Spt5 fusion protein was adsorbed to 50 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads during a 1-h incubation at 4 °C in 300 μl of binding buffer 2 (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.03% Triton X-100). The beads were then washed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer 2 to remove unbound protein. Then the beads were mixed with 5 μg of purified His-Pct1 or His-Pce1 for 1 h at 4 °C in 50 μl of binding buffer 2. The beads were then concentrated by microcentrifugation, and the supernatant was withdrawn. The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer 2 and subjected to two rounds of concentration and washing. After the second wash, the bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of binding buffer 2 containing 10 mm glutathione. Aliquots (25 μl) of the input and the bead-bound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For detection of ternary complex formation, a mixture containing either: (i) 20 μg of His-Pct1 and 40 μg of Spt5(801–990), (ii) 20 μg of His-Pct1 alone, or (iii) 40 μg of Spt5(801–990) alone was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose beads in 300 μl of binding buffer 3 (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.005% Tween 20). The beads were then washed once with 0.5 ml of binding buffer 3 to remove any unbound protein. Then the beads were incubated with 10 μg of purified Pce1 in 100 μl of binding buffer 3. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were concentrated by microcentrifugation, and the supernatant was withdrawn. The beads were resuspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer 3 and subjected to two rounds of concentration and washing. After the second wash, the bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of binding buffer 3 containing 250 mm imidazole. Aliquots (25 μl) of the input and the bead-bound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A two-hybrid screen of ∼200,000 transformants for guanylyltransferase-interacting proteins using a Gal4 DNA-BD-Pce1 fusion as bait yielded 11 His+ isolates, two of which contained plasmids encoding the Gal AD fused in-frame to C-terminal fragments of a predicted 990-amino acid S. pombe polypeptide with extensive similarity to human Spt5. Two different AD-Spt5 fusion clones were isolated: AD-Spt5(165–990) and AD-Spt5(556–990) (Fig. 1). Control experiments showed that the His+ and lacZ+ phenotypes required cotransformation with BD-Pce1 and AD-Spt5(165–990) plasmids and that neither fusion plasmid was able to drive expression of the HIS3 or lacZ reporter genes when cotransformed with the BD or AD vectors (Fig. 2A).Figure 2Specificity of the Pce1–Spt5 and Spt4–Spt5 two-hybrid interactions. The BD-Pce1, BD-Spt4, and AD-Spt5(165–990) fusion plasmids and the BD and AD vectors without inserts were transformed pairwise into S. cerevisiae Y190. Single Trp+ Leu+ isolates containing the indicated plasmid pairs were selected and streaked on SD(−Trp, −Leu, −His, 3-AT) agar medium. The plates were photographed after incubation for 5 days at 30 °C. Trp+ Leu+ isolates containing the indicated plasmid pairs were patched on SD(−Trp, −Leu) agar medium. The cell patches were photographed after incubation for 1 day at 30 °C (Growth). The cell patches were then tested for β-galactosidase activity using the colony-lift filter assay.

Two different AD-Spt5 fusion clones were isolated: AD-Spt5(628–990) was recovered three times and AD-Spt5(772–990) was isolated once (Fig. 1). Control experiments confirmed that HIS3 and lacZ expression required cotransformation with the BD-Pct1 and AD-Spt5(628–990) plasmids (not shown). The AD-Spt5 fusions that interacted in vivo with Pce1 or Pct1 contained at their C termini 18 tandem copies of a nonapeptide repeat (consensus sequence TPAWNSGSK), plus a variable segment of the Spt5 protein upstream of the start of the repeats (Figs. 1 and 4A). To gauge the role of the non-reiterative protein segment, we engineered a series of AD-Spt5 clones in which the fusion junction was moved incrementally toward the start of the repeat region. These clones were tested in a directed two-hybrid assay paired with BD-Pce1 and BD-Pct1. We found that the Spt5 interaction with both capping enzymes persisted when the AD fusion started from position 801 and contained little more than the C-terminal repeats per se (Fig. 1). Thus, the entire N-terminal 800-amino acid segment was dispensable for interaction with the capping enzymes. On the other hand, deletion of the C-terminal 190-amino acid segment containing all of the nonamer repeats, i.e. in the fusion clone AD-Spt5(165–800), completely abolished the two-hybrid interaction with Pce1 and Pct1 (Fig. 1). To define the minimal segment of the Spt5 C-terminal domain (Spt5 CTD) capable of interacting with the capping enzymes, we tested a finer series of deletion variants in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1). We found that the Spt5 interaction with the RNA triphosphatase Pct1 persisted with undiminished strength (as gauged by colony size during selection for His+) after elimination of the proximal six nonamer repeats, i.e. in Spt5(863–990), but was abolished after deletion of the next eight and six nonamer repeats in Spt5(899–990) and Spt5(917–990), respectively (Fig. 1). Apparently, the C-terminal twelve repeats sufficed for Spt5 binding to Pct1 in vivo, but the C-terminal eight and six repeats did not. From the opposite direction, we found that elimination of three, five, or eight nonamers from the C terminus of Spt5 had no effect on its interaction with Pct1 (Fig. 1). Thus, the first ten repeats (upstream of amino acid 898) were sufficient for Pct1 binding in vivo. This analysis indicates that the proximal (801–898) and distal (863–990) nonamer arrays of the Spt5 CTD are functionally redundant with respect to Pct1 binding. The two-hybrid interaction of Spt5 with the guanylyltransferase Pce1 displayed a more stringent requirement for Spt5 CTD length. Binding of Pce1 was abolished by deletion of as few as three upstream nonamers (in Spt5(836–990)) indicating that the remaining 15 C-terminal nonamers were insufficient. Pce1 binding persisted, albeit with diminished strength, upon elimination of three, five, or eight nonamers from the C terminus of Spt5 (Fig. 1). Thus, with respect to Pce1 binding the proximal and distal repeats are functionally distinct. Note that the proximal nonamers adhere more closely to the consensus sequence than do the distal repeats (Fig. 4A). There have been no antecedent studies of Spt5 from fission yeast. Thus, we asked two questions. (i) Is Spt5 essential in S. pombe? (ii) Does S. pombe Spt5 interact with a homolog of Spt4? To address the first issue, we constructed a deletion allele of S. pombe spt5+ in which the coding sequences for amino acids 1–990 was removed and replaced by the bacterial kanamycin resistance gene. The spt5::kanMX construct was transformed into a diploid strain of S. pombe and chromosomal integrants containing one copy of wild-type spt5+ and one of spt5::kanMX were selected on medium containing G418. Correct integration was confirmed by diagnostic PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the heterozygote. We then sporulated the heterozygote, dissected tetrads, and scored for spore viability and the presence of the kanMX marker. We found that 10 of the 10 tetrads yielded only two viable spores, and all of the viable haploids were G418-sensitive, i.e. none contained the spt5::kanMX allele. We conclude that the spt5+ gene, which we isolated in the two-hybrid screen against the capping enzymes, is essential for cell growth in S. pombe. The fission yeast gene encoding a 104-amino acid homologue of human Spt4 (GenBankTM accession no. AL157918) was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, and the resulting BD-Spt4 construct was tested in a directed two-hybrid assay for interaction with S. pombe Spt5. Their interaction in vivo was evinced by histidine prototrophy and lacZ expression in yeast cells cotransformed with the BD-Spt4 and AD-Spt5(165–990) plasmids (Fig. 2B). Neither plasmid alone was able to activate HIS3 or lacZ. An additional experiment showed that the C-terminal deletion variant Spt5(165–800), which lacks the entire nonamer repeat array, retains its interaction with Spt4 in the two-hybrid assay as does the even shorter fragment Spt5(165–400) (not shown). Thus, there are distinct and non-overlapping binding sites for Spt4 and the mRNA capping enzymes on the S. pombe Spt5 protein. The S. pombe guanylyltransferase Pce1 is a 402-amino acid monomeric protein (26Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The active site of nucleotidyl transfer is composed of six motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, V, and VI) that are co"

Previously, we have shown a direct, estradiol-dependent interaction between the DRIP205 subunit of the DRIP complex and the estrogen receptor (ER) AF2 domain. Here we demonstrate the in vivo recruitment of other endogenous DRIP subunits to ER in response to estradiol treatment in MCF-7 cells. To explore the relationship between DRIP and p160 coactivators, we examined the kinetics of coactivator recruitment to the ER target promoter, pS2, by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We observed a cyclic association and dissociation of coactivators with the promoter, with recruitment of p160s and DRIPs occurring in opposite phases, suggesting an exchange between these coactivator complexes at the target promoter."

Integrins are α/β heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that have widespread essential functions in development, tissue organization, and the immune system (1Sheppard D. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Integrins recognize a variety of extracellular matrix and cell-surface ligands; however, ligand recognition is frequently not constitutive but is instead under strict cellular control by “inside-out” signaling. Acquisition of the active state has also been shown to require divalent cations. For β1 integrins, ligand binding is promoted by Mg2+ or Mn2+ but only weakly by Ca2+ (2Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A well known but unexplained property of Mn2+ is its ability to mimic the process of inside-out signaling to strongly up-regulate integrin function (3Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J.

To investigate the mechanisms of integrin activation, we employed a recently described system for expression of recombinant soluble α5β1 (13Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35854-35866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For these particular studies, we have used a truncated version of α5β1, α5-(1–613)β1-(1–455), fused to the Fc region of human IgGγ1 (hereafter referred to as trα5β1-Fc). This heterodimer contains the ligand-binding head and thigh domains of the integrin (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) and has been shown to retain the properties of the full-length receptor (13Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D.

In contrast to previous mutagenesis-based analyses of integrin function, which have largely employed cell-expressed integrins, this system is ideal (a) because it permits the rapid analysis of the effects of mutations and (b) because the effects of mutations that normally preclude expression at the plasma membrane can be studied. 12G10 is a previously characterized activating mAb directed against the β1 A-domain, whose binding to α5β1 is modulated by divalent cations and ligand (10Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Askari J.A. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The binding of 12G10 to trα5β1-Fc was promoted by Mn2+and to a lesser degree by Mg2+, whereas Ca2+was inhibitory (Fig. 1A). The effects of these cations on 12G10 binding closely paralleled their effects on ligand binding (Fig. 1B). Importantly, as for the native integrin, ligand binding is strongly activated by Mn2+ and more weakly by Mg2+, whereas Ca2+ is a very poor activator (16Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These results show that the βA-domain undergoes conformational changes in response to cation binding (reported by modulation of the 12G10 epitope) that correspond with changes in the activation state of the integrin. The identity of the cation-binding site(s) involved in activation of β1integrins by Mn2+ and Mg2+ is unknown. The MIDAS is a strong candidate for this site, but this has been difficult to test experimentally because mutation of the MIDAS residues completely abrogates ligand recognition (although expression is unaffected; Refs. 17Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In agreement with these previous studies, trα5β1-Fc with MIDAS mutations did not bind ligand under any cation conditions, even though such mutants (e.g. D130A) retained all the epitopes of conformation-sensitive α5 and β1 mAbs (Table I). Because mAb binding was retained, we tested the effect of the D130A mutation on the ability of divalent cations to regulate 12G10 binding to trα5β1-Fc (Fig. 2). The binding of 12G10 to the D130A mutant in the absence of divalent cations was similar to the wild-type integrin (comparing Fig. 1A with Fig. 2); however, the ability of Mn2+ and Mg2+ to stimulate 12G10 binding was totally lost in the MIDAS mutant. Interestingly, the inhibition of 12G10 binding by Ca2+ seen for the wild-type integrin was enhanced in the MIDAS mutant. Similar results were obtained with a “double” MIDAS mutation D130A/S132A (data not shown). Conversely, mutation of cation-binding sites in the α5 subunit β-propeller did not affect the capacity of Mn2+ or Mg2+ to modulate 12G10 binding (20Kline A.D. Analysis of Integrin Activation and Divalent Cation Binding by Site-directed Mutagenesis. Ph.D. thesis. University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom2001Google Scholar). Hence, these data demonstrate that the MIDAS is a Mn2+/Mg2+-binding site and that occupancy of this site induces conformational movements that are detected by changes in 12G10 binding.Table ISummary of mAb reactivity with β1 A-domain mutantsβ1mutantAnti-α5Anti-β1P1D616SNAKA5213TS2/16P4C104B412G10D130A+++++++++++++++++++++++N151A++++++++++++++++++++++++M153A++++++++++++++++++++++++R154A++++++++++++++++++++++R155A+++++++++++++++++++++++I156A++++++++++++++++++++++++R154R/AS++++++++++++++++++++++/−CHO L761h cells were transfected with α5-(1–613)-Fc and wild-type or mutant β1-(1–455)-Fc.

None of the mutations (except D130A) affected recognition of the III6–10 fragment of fibronectin (data not shown). The epitopes of all function-altering mAbs that map to the β1 A-domain include one or more residues in the sequence Asn207–Lys218 (21Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which based on homology to β3 is predicted to form the α2 helix (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar,22Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The epitope of 12G10 also maps to this region and includes Lys218 as part of its epitope (11Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, among these regulatory mAbs, 12G10 has the unique property of showing strong cation modulation of binding (11Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, part of the 12G10 epitope may be distinct from that of the other βA-domain mAbs. While investigating the mechanism of integrin activation using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, 2A. P. Mould, J. A. Askari, S. Barton, and M. J. Humphries, manuscript in preparation. we found two mutations that selectively perturbed 12G10 binding (Table I). Mutation of Arg154 or Arg155 to Ala reduced 12G10 binding by ∼65 and ∼35%, respectively, whereas mutation of surrounding residues (Asn151, Met153, Ile156) had no effect. A double mutation R154R/AS reduced 12G10 binding by >80% but did not perturb the binding of other function-modulating mAbs against the β1 A-domain (Table I), and also had no effect on the apparent affinity of ligand binding (data not shown). Therefore, Arg154 and Arg155appear to form part of the 12G10 epitope. 3In further support of this proposal, 12G10 reacts only weakly with a chimeric β1 containing Asn207–Lys218 of human β1 in a backbone of chicken β1 (CH mutant; Ref. 21Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to the other function-modulating mAbs, which show good reactivity. In chicken β1 Arg154 and Arg155 are both altered to Glu and Lys, respectively, whereas other residues in this region are unchanged (W. Puzon-McLaughlin, Y. Takada, A. P. Mould, and M. J. Humphries, unpublished observations). By homology to the structure of the β3 A-domain (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), Arg154/Arg155 lie at the base of the α1 helix and these residues would be predicted to be in sufficiently close proximity to Lys218 in the α2 helix for all three residues to contribute to the 12G10 epitope (23Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The above data suggest that Arg154 and Arg155form part of the 12G10 epitope, but these residues do not contribute to other A-domain epitopes. Hence, do Arg154/Arg155 form the cation-regulated region of the 12G10 epitope? To test this proposal, we compared the effects of divalent cations on 12G10 binding to the R154R/AS mutant and wild-type trα5β1-Fc. The results (Fig. 3A) showed that the abilities of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ to modulate 12G10 binding were strongly attenuated by the R154R/AS mutation. The mutation did not affect the cation regulation of ligand binding (Fig. 3B) or of α5 epitopes (Ref. 11Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar; data not shown), suggesting that the mutation does not itself affect cation-induced conformational changes but rather that the ability of 12G10 to detect these changes is specifically compromised by the mutation. Therefore, the portion of the 12G10 epitope that is responsive to cation binding lies in the α1 helix, indicating that the position of this helix is different in the active and inactive states. Using the anti-β1 mAb 12G10 as a probe of βA-domain conformation, we have shown that: (i) the βA-domain undergoes shape changes that correlate with changes in the activation state of the integrin, (ii) occupancy of the MIDAS site in the βA-domain by Mn2+ or Mg2+ induces these changes, and (iii) βA-domain activation involves movement of the α1 helix. Taking these results together, we propose that the βA-domain can exist in at least two conformational states: an “active” conformation with the α1 helix in a position characterized by high 12G10 binding and an “inactive” conformation with the α1 helix in a different position, characterized by low 12G10 binding. Movement of the α1 helix appears to form an essential part of the activation mechanism of the βA-domain because α1 movement closely parallels the activation state and a lack of α1 movement (in the Ca2+-occupied integrin) corresponds to low activity. Furthermore, the epitopes of function-blocking anti-chicken β1 mAbs have been shown to include residues in the α1 helix (24Shi D.T. Boetigger D. Buck C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2619-2628PubMed Google Scholar), and the epitopes of function-altering anti-human β1 mAbs include residues in the α2 helix, which lies adjacent to α1 (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 21Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on previous analyses of the mode of action of regulatory anti-integrin mAbs (2Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it appears that they are likely to function allosterically by stabilizing the position of α1 in either the active or inactive conformation. Additionally, it has been shown that mutation of residues in the α1 helix can activate ligand binding (26Bajt M.L. Loftus J.C. Gawaz M.P. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22211-22216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data provide evidence that the MIDAS is primarily a Mn2+/Mg2+ binding site and suggest an explanation for the opposing effects of Mn2+ and Ca2+ on β1 integrin function. Mn2+ can induce a large shift in the equilibrium between active and inactive states because of its ability to promote α1 helix movement upon binding to the MIDAS site. On the other hand, Ca2+ is unable to cause the same conformational change. It is likely that Ca2+ can occupy the MIDAS site because Ca2+ can support low affinity ligand binding to α5β1 and high affinity binding of activation-independent ligands to α4β1(34Chen L.L. Whitty A. Scott D. Lee W.C. Cornebise M. Adams S.P. Petter R.C. Lobb R.R. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36520-36529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, Ca2+ binding to sites other than the MIDAS appears to shift the equilibrium toward the inactive conformation (low 12G10 binding), as shown by the strong inhibition of 12G10 binding by Ca2+ in the D130A mutant. Some integrins contain an A-domain in their α subunits (e.g. the β2 family). These domains can exist in inactive (“closed”) or active (“open”) states dependent upon movement of the C-terminal helix (α7). The open form can be induced in the presence of a ligand or pseudo-ligand, or by locking the position of α7 (9Lee O.-J. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 27Emsley J. Knight G.C. Farndale R. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). There appear to be some differences between the activation mechanism of αA-domains and the βA-domain. First, the nature of the metal ion at the MIDAS does not directly influence the equilibrium between inactive and active states in αA-domains (4Lu C. Shimoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 28Xiong J.-P., Li, R. Essafi M. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38762-38767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas, based on data reported here for the βA-domain, the nature of the divalent ion can markedly affect this equilibrium. Second, in contrast to the βA-domain, there is no evidence for allosteric regulation of activity by mAbs to αA-domains whose epitopes include residues in the α1 helix (30Oxvig C., Lu, C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Third, although in αA-domains the open form can be induced by mutation of residues that form a hydrophobic pocket surrounding α7 (31Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A.S. Lupher M.L., Jr. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), mutation of the equivalent residues in β1 does not alter integrin activity.2 Fourth, the crystal structure of the β3 A-domain indicates that the α7 helix is unlikely to undergo large conformational movements (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). All these findings suggest that the βA-domain is regulated differently to the αA-domains in that movement of the α1 helix (rather than α7) is a key feature of βA-domain activation. Nevertheless, comparison of the open and closed forms of αA-domains shows that there is an inward shift of the α1 helix in the open form (9Lee O.-J. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and a similar movement could take place in the βA-domain (Fig. 4). In integrins that contain an A-domain in the α subunit, the βA-domain does not participate directly in ligand binding (4Lu C. Shimoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Mn2+ and mAbs to the βA-domain can strongly modulate the activity these integrins (3Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 4Lu C. Shimoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The epitopes of activating and inhibitory anti-β2 mAbs have also been shown to contain residues in the α1 helix of the β2A-domain (4Lu C. Shimoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21514-21524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Xiong Y.-M. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19340-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, movement of the α1 helix may also regulate the activation state of this class of integrin. Is α1 helix movement involved in the activation of integrins by inside-out signaling? It has been shown that the expression of the 12G10 epitope correlates with the activity of cell-surface β1 integrins, whereas expression of other β1 A-domain epitopes is constitutive (35Belkin A.M Retta S.F. Pletjushkina O.Y. Balzac F. Silengo L. Fassler R. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 36Mastrangelo A.M. Homan S.M. Humphries M.J. LaFlamme S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 112: 217-229Google Scholar). Because 12G10 differs from the other A-domain mAbs in having part of its epitope in the α1 helix, these data imply that inside-out signaling alters the position of α1. Inside-out signaling may also cause a shift in the conformation of the α1 helix in β2integrins. For αLβ2 and αMβ2, activating cytoplasmic domain mutations led to the induction of the mAb 24 epitope, which includes Arg122 in the α1 helix of the β2 A-domain (4Lu C. Shimoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 37Lu C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It has often been questioned whether Mn2+-induced integrin activation accurately mimics physiologic activation. However, a common feature of both types of activation appears to be movement of the α1 helix; hence, their molecular mechanisms may be very similar. Finally, how might α1 helix movement be important for activation? The top (MIDAS) face of the βA-domain interacts closely with the upper surface of the α subunit β-propeller domain (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). In particular, loops on the top face of the A-domain close to the α1 helix (notably the α2-α3 loop) contact loops on the β-propeller domain that participate in ligand recognition. Hence, α1 helix movement is likely to affect the α subunit/β subunit interface, potentially leading to changes in exposure of the ligand binding loops. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that divalent cations affect the binding of inhibitory mAbs on the α subunit (11Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); the epitopes of these mAbs include residues in the same loops that are important for ligand recognition (12Burrows L. Clark K. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20337-20345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In integrins with an A-domain in the α subunit, there is evidence that the MIDAS face of the βA-domain is in contact with the lower face of the αA-domain (40Zang Q., Lu, C. Huang C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 22202-22212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar); hence, conformational changes in the βA-domain could affect the position of the α7 helix in the αA-domain and thereby alter the activation state of this domain. In summary, we have shown that a conformational shift in the α1 helix of the βA-domain is involved the regulation of integrin activity. Integrins are important therapeutic targets in many inflammatory and vascular disorders (41Curley G.P. Blum H. Humphries M.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and our findings suggest a novel way in which highly specific regulators of integrin activity could be developed. A more complete understanding of the activation mechanism will require crystallization of an integrin in both active and inactive states. After this manuscript was accepted for publication, the crystal structure of integrin αvβ3 in complex with an RGD ligand was reported (Xiong, K.-P., Stehle, T., Zhang, R., Joachimiak, A., Frech, M., Goodman, S., and Arnaout, M. A. (2002) Science 296, 151–155). The pivotal conformational change between the unliganded (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) and liganded structures is an inward movement of the α1 helix in the βA-domain. This conformational change appears to be causally linked to occupancy of the MIDAS site by a Mn2+ion in the liganded structure. We thank A. Coe, P. Stephens, and M. Robinson for the α5 and β1 constructs. We are grateful to K. Yamada, E. Wayner, and F. Sánchez-Madrid for mAbs, K. Yamada and S. Aota for the III6–10 construct, A.

Jurassic mammals from Gondwanaland are so far only known from Tanzania and Madagascar, and from trackway evidence from Argentina. Here we report a Jurassic mammal represented by a dentary, which is the first, to our knowledge, from South America. The tiny fossil from the Middle to Late Jurassic of Patagonia is a representative of the recently termed Australosphenida, a group of mammals from Gondwanaland that evolved tribosphenic molars convergently to the Northern Hemisphere Tribosphenida, and probably gave rise to the monotremes. Together with other mammalian evidence from the Southern Hemisphere, the discovery of this new mammal indicates that the Australosphenida had diversified and were widespread in Gondwanaland well before the end of the Jurassic, and that mammalian faunas from the Southern Hemisphere already showed a marked distinction from their northern counterparts by the Middle to Late Jurassic."
https://openalex.org/W2109204822,"The motion of our Galaxy through the Universe is reflected in a systematic shift in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background-because of the Doppler effect, the temperature of the background is about 0.1 per cent higher in the direction of motion, with a correspondingly lower temperature in the opposite direction. This effect is known as dipole anisotropy. If our standard cosmological model is correct, a related dipole effect should also be present as an enhancement in the surface density of distant galaxies in the direction of motion. The main obstacle to finding this signal is the uneven distribution of galaxies in the local supercluster, which drowns out the small cosmological signal. Here we report a detection of the expected cosmological dipole anisotropy in the distribution of galaxies. We use a survey of radio galaxies that are mainly located at cosmological distances, so the contamination from nearby clusters is small. When local radio galaxies are removed from the sample, the resulting dipole is in the same direction as the temperature anisotropy of the microwave background, and close to the expected amplitude. The result therefore confirms the standard cosmological interpretation of the microwave background."
https://openalex.org/W1982205123,"The following two theories for the mechanism of ABCA1 in lipid efflux to apolipoprotein acceptors have been proposed: 1) that ABCA1 directly binds the apolipoprotein ligand and then facilitates lipid efflux and 2) that ABCA1 acts as a phosphatidylserine (PS) translocase, increasing PS levels in the plasma membrane exofacial leaflet, and that this is sufficient to facilitate apolipoprotein binding and lipid assembly. Upon induction of ABCA1 in RAW264.7 cells by cAMP analogues there was a moderate increase in cell surface PS as detected by annexin V binding, whereas apoAI binding was increased more robustly.

Annexin V did not act as a cholesterol acceptor, and it did not compete for the cholesterol acceptor or cell binding activity of apoAI. ApoAI binds to ABCA1-expressing cells, and with incubation at 37 °C apoAI is co-localized within the cells in ABCA1-containing endosomes.

The exact mechanism of this lipid efflux pump and the location of the lipid transfer and assembly onto apolipoprotein acceptors have yet to be determined definitively. It has been shown previously that ABCA1 expression leads to increased cell surface binding and uptake of apoAI (2Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Protein cross-linking studies have shown that cell surface ABCA1 is closely associated with exogenously added apoAI (3Wang N.

Thus, one theory of ABCA1 action is that the apolipoprotein ligand is bound directly to the ABCA1 receptor, which can then mediate lipid assembly to form a nascent lipoprotein. An alternative theory of ABCA1 function has been put forth by Chimini and co-workers (5Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J.

Phosphatidylserine (PS) is normally asymmetrically distributed on the plasma membrane such that most of it is sequestered on the inner leaflet. Increased levels of PS in the exofacial leaflet have been demonstrated in ABCA1 transiently transfected cells, thus providing evidence that ABCA1 may function as a PS translocase to pump PS from the cytoplasmic leaflet to the exofacial leaflet (5Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar).This activity is referred to as “floppase” activity to distinguish it from the “flippase” activity that pumps PS from the outer to inner plasma membrane leaflets (7Serra M.V. Kamp D. Haest C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1282: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These authors propose that PS translocase activity is sufficient to lead to apoAI binding to and lipid efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells and that the cross-linking of apoAI with ABCA1 might be circumstantial (6Chambenoit O.

They also used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to demonstrate that apoAI had mobility on the cell surface, which indicated that it was not bound to an integral membrane protein on ABCA1 transfected cells and thus supported the hypothesis that apoAI was bound to cell surface PS (6Chambenoit O.

We found that induction of ABCA1 in RAW cells led to a modest but significant increase in cell surface PS as measured by fluorescent annexin V binding and that cell surface redistribution of phospholipids induced by apoptosis was also associated with a dramatic increase in apoAI binding. However, increased cell surface PS induced by apoptosis was not sufficient to lead to lipid efflux. Furthermore, the PS-binding protein annexin V did not compete with apoAI for binding to ABCA1-expressing cells, and annexin V did not act as (or inhibit the ability of apoAI to act as) a cholesterol acceptor. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching demonstrated that apoAI bound to ABCA1-expressing cells did not behave as if it were bound to phospholipids. Thus, the increase in cell surface PS found in ABCA1-expressing cells does not appear to be sufficient to account for the mechanism by which ABCA1 mediates apoAI binding and lipid efflux. RAW264.7 cells were trypsinized and plated in high glucose DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum on Permanox Lab-Tek 4-chamber tissue culture plastic slides (Nunc) at a density of 50,000 cells/chamber. One day after plating, cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% BSA in the presence or absence of 0.1–0.3 mm 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma), used to induce ABCA1. Staurosporine treatments took place during the last 4 h of this incubation period. ApoAI (BioDesign) was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml, labeled with Cy5 (a fluorescent dye that absorbs maximally at 649 nm and emits maximally at 670 nm; Amersham Biosciences, Mono-Reactive Dye Pack) as previously described (6Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and passed through a 0.22-μm filter prior to use. For the initial cell binding studies 0.5 μg/ml Cy5-annexin V (Biovision) or 3 μg/ml Cy5-apoAI was incubated with the cells for 10 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm calcium chloride. For the competitive binding studies, the Cy5-labeled ligands were used at 1 μg/ml, and the unlabeled competitors were used at 40 μg/ml. The cells were then washed, fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, and coverslipped prior to analysis by confocal microscopy using a 633-nm He laser on an upright Zeiss LSM510 system. All gain and offset settings were kept constant within each experiment. For quantitative analysis of ligand binding, images were captured using a broad 5-μm focal plane and adjusting the focus for maximal illumination. A brightfield image was also captured to count the cell number in each field. 5–10 random fields were captured, the images were exported to Photoshop software (Adobe) for intensity analysis, and the average fluorescence per cell was calculated for each image. For Cy5-apoAI uptake studies, this ligand was incubated at 37 °C for 5 or 60 min with cells in serum-free medium containing 0.2% BSA. After fixation, 0.6-μm confocal sections were obtained throughout the cell. On day 1, RAW264.7 cells were plated onto a 24-well plate at a density of 250,000 cells/well. All subsequent incubations were performed in serum-free medium containing 0.2% BSA. On day 2, the cells were cholesterol-labeled and loaded for 24 h with 0.33 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol and 50 μg/ml acetylated low density lipoprotein. This labeling medium was prepared by directly adding [3H]cholesterol dissolved in ethanol to the acetylated low density lipoprotein, preincubating at 37 °C for 20 min, and diluting in serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% BSA. On day 3, the cells were washed and incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 0.1–0.3 mm 8-Br-cAMP. On day 4, the cells were chased with 3 μg/ml apoAI for 4 h. At the end of this chase period, the radioactivity in the medium and cells was determined by liquid scintillation counting, and the percent efflux was calculated as 100× the total medium dpm divided by the sum of the total medium and cellular dpm. All treatments were performed in triplicate. Other variations on this protocol are described in the individual figure legends. The mouse ABCA1 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR using RNA from 8-Br-cAMP-treated RAW cells. The entire clone was sequenced and found to contain only minor differences compared with the GenBanktm sequence AF287263. An in-frame green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the C terminus of ABCA1 was engineered by PCR in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). This expression vector was transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Two days later the cells were trypsinized and plated at low density in p100 dishes for selection of neor colonies in medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Colonies were examined by epifluorescence to confirm GFP expression and were subsequently picked and expanded. RAW cells were plated on collagen-coated coverslip bottom p35 dishes (MatTek). On the following day the cells were treated for 24 h in DMEM, 0.2% BSA with 50 μg/ml acetylated low density lipoprotein, 0.3 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and (for some dishes) 0.05–0.2 mm NBD-PC (diluted directly into this medium from a 10 mm stock in ethanol; Molecular Probes, catalog no. N-3786). Prior to FRAP, the NBD-PC-containing medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once and preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in serum-free DMEM. For the apoAI FRAP study, 1–3 μg/ml Cy5-apoAI was incubated for 10 min to 1 h at 21 °C with either 8-Br-cAMP or staurosporine-pretreated RAW cells. The cells were washed prior to FRAP. For the annexin V FRAP, RAW cells were treated with staurosporine for 4 h and then incubated with 1 μg/ml Cy5-annexin V for 10 min at 21 °C. FRAP was performed at 21 °C with a ×63 W lens using an inverted LSM510 system (Zeiss). NBD-PC photobleaching used three to five iterations of the Ar/Kr 488 laser set to 50% intensity. A time series captured images prior to and at regular intervals after the bleaching using 0.1% laser intensity, which did not lead to additional bleaching during the capture period. The Cy5-apoAI and Cy5-annexin V photobleaching was performed with 3–20 iterations using the 633 laser at 80–100% power. A time series captured images prior to and at regular intervals after the bleaching using 1–3% laser intensity, which did not lead to additional bleaching during the capture period. The luminosity of the bleach area was determined by the LSM510 software, and the data were exported for non-linear regression analysis. Two-tailed Student's t tests, analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls post-test, and non-linear regression analysis were performed using Prism software (GraphPad). We have demonstrated previously that 8-Br-cAMP treatment of RAW267.4 cells leads to ∼50-fold induction of ABCA1 mRNA, which in turn mediates cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to extracellular lipid-free apoAI or apoE (10Zheng P. Horwitz A. Waelde C.A. Smith J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1534: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether 8-Br-cAMP-mediated ABCA1 induction in RAW cells was associated with PS floppase activity, cell surface PS was assessed in adherent cells by the binding of Cy5-labeled annexin V, a calcium ion-dependent PS-binding protein. RAW cells were grown on plastic slides and treated with or without 0.1 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 24 h or (for a positive control) for 4 h with 5 μm staurosporine, an apoptosis-inducing reagent. Treatment of RAW cells with the cAMP analogue induced a 64% mean increase in annexin V binding per cell as determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). This finding is qualitatively similar to the 40% increase in Cy5-annexin V binding previously reported using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of trypsinized ABCA1-transfected cells (5Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Staurosporine treatment led to a much larger increase in annexin V binding, thus validating the annexin V binding assay (Fig. 1A). Binding of Cy5-labeled apoAI was also examined under similar conditions. Pretreatment of RAW cells with 8-Br-cAMP led to a 173% increase in Cy5-apoAI binding (Fig. 1, C and D), a 2.7-fold larger increase than was observed for binding of annexin V to the cAMP-treated cells. When the cells were treated with staurosporine, there was also a dramatic increase in Cy5-apoAI binding (Fig. 1C). Thus, apoptotic cells with increased levels of exofacial PS are competent to bind large amounts of Cy5-apoAI; however, whether the apoAI is actually binding to the cell surface PS cannot be determined from this experiment and will be addressed below. Because staurosporine treatment was effective in inducing Cy5-apoAI binding to cells, the ability of staurosporine to induce cholesterol efflux to apoAI was also assessed. In the absence of staurosporine, a 16-h pretreatment with 8-Br-cAMP led to a 7.7-fold increase in [3H]cholesterol efflux to 3 μg/ml apoAI during a 4-h chase period at 37 °C (Fig. 2). 1.25 μm staurosporine was added during the entire 4-h chase period or during the last 1 or 2 h of this chase. In the absence of 8-Br-cAMP pretreatment, staurosporine treatment for 1–4 h failed to elicit cholesterol efflux to apoAI (Fig. 2). In the presence of 8-Br-cAMP, staurosporine treatment partially inhibited the cAMP-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoAI by ∼30%. Thus, cells treated for varying times with staurosporine still retained most of the ability to release cholesterol to apoAI after induction by 8-Br-cAMP, and the failure of staurosporine by itself to induce efflux to apoAI cannot be totally attributed to the death of the cells. Staurosporine doses between 1.25 and 5.0 μm yielded similar results, and all of these doses were capable of leading to increased levels of plasma membrane exofacial PS in a 4-h treatment as determined qualitatively by Cy5-annexin V binding (data not shown). An experiment was then performed to look at the ability of annexin V to act as a cholesterol acceptor or to alter the cholesterol acceptor activity of apoAI. RAW cells were cholesterol-loaded, pretreated with 8-Br-cAMP, and chased for 4 h in the presence or absence of apoAI with the addition of 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 μg/ml annexin V. Annexin V in the absence of apoAI was not capable of acting as a cholesterol acceptor, and in the presence of apoAI annexin V did not inhibit or stimulate cholesterol efflux (Fig. 3). Thus, annexin V does not compete for or cooperate with apoAI as a lipid acceptor. The ability of apoAI and annexin V to compete with each other for binding to RAW cells was examined next. Cells pretreated with 8-Br-cAMP were incubated for 10 min with 1 μg/ml Cy5-apoAI or Cy5-annexin V. Binding of Cy5 apoAI was inhibited 76% by co-incubation with 40 μg/ml apoAI, but it was not inhibited by co-incubation with 40 μg/ml annexin V (Fig. 4A). This competition by unlabeled apoAI brought Cy5-apoAI binding down to the levels observed in cells that were not exposed to 8-Br-cAMP pretreatment (data not shown). Conversely, the binding of 1 μg/ml Cy5-annexin V to the 8-Br-cAMP-pretreated cells was not inhibited by co-incubation with 40 μg/ml apoAI but was inhibited 79% by co-incubation with 40 μg/ml annexin V (Fig. 4B). Thus, annexin V and apoAI do not compete with each other for binding to ABCA1-expressing cells, which implies that apoAI binding is not mediated by interaction with cell surface PS. A similar study was undertaken with apoptotic RAW cells that had been pretreated with staurosporine for 4 h. Cy5-apoAI and Cy5-annexin V bound efficiently to the apoptotic cells as observed above; however, when co-incubated with excess unlabeled annexin V only the Cy5-annexin V binding was competed off (Fig. 5). This implies that apoAI does not bind to cell surface PS on apoptotic cells.Figure 5Annexin V competition for Cy5-apoAI and Cy5-annexin V binding to apoptotic cells pretreated for 4 h with 5 μm staurosporine. Cy5-apoAI (5 μg/ml) or Cy5-annexin V (AnnV) (0.5 μg/ml) was incubated with cells in the absence (open bars) or presence (filled bars) of 40 μg/ml annexin V for 10 min at 21 °C. For each fluorescent ligand binding was normalized to that in the absence of competitor (mean ± S.E.; n = 5 fields of cells each; *, p = 0.001 compared with Cy5-annexin V binding in the absence of competitor).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the site of interaction of apoAI with ABCA1, fluorescently labeled apoAI was incubated with cells that either did or did not express ABCA1. 8-Br-cAMP pretreatment of RAW cells to induce ABCA1 led to a large increase in the cellular uptake of Cy5-apoAI during a 1-h incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 6, A and B). Confocal slices through ABCA1-expressing cells demonstrated that Cy5-apoAI was on the cell surface as well as within the cell in what appear to be endocytic vesicles (Fig. 6B). Similar findings were obtained with apoAI labeled with either rhodamine or NBD (data not shown). To co-localize apoAI with ABCA1, stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing a murine ABCA1-EGFP fusion protein were prepared. Compared with non-transfected cells, these ABCA1-GFP-expressing cells have robust cholesterol efflux to apoAI (Fig. 7A). Confirming previous reports of transfections with human ABCA1-GFP fusion expression vectors (5Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F.

Cy5-apoAI was incubated with these cells at 37 °C for 5 or 60 min. After 5 min Cy5-apoAI was bound to the plasma membrane, often in large aggregates (Fig. 7B). After 60 min Cy5-apoAI was found on both the plasma membrane and in punctate ABCA1-GFP-containing vesicles within the cell, as demonstrated by confocal sectioning (Fig. 7C).Figure 7Co-localization of apoAI and ABCA1 in ABCA1-GFP stably transfected cells.A, cholesterol efflux over 16 h in the absence (open bars) or presence (black bars) of 3 μg/ml apoAI from wild-type 293 cells (WT) or cells stably transfected with an expression vector for an ABCA1-GFP fusion protein.

To assess lipid diffusion in the plasma membrane, cells were labeled with NBD-PC, a fluorescent phospholipid. The NBD-PC was highly mobile in the plasma membrane at 21 °C as indicated by the rapid diffusion during the photobleaching period leading to incomplete bleaching in the bleached area and partial bleaching beyond the perimeter of the bleach area. Thus, the fluorescence recovery in the bleach area was not complete, because the total fluorescence in the adjacent donor membrane was also decreased (Fig. 8A). The partial fluorescence recovery occurred quite rapidly (Fig. 8, A and B), with an average t1/2 of 4.2 ± 1.4 s (n = 18, combined from two independent experiments). Cy5-apoAI was preincubated with ABCA1-expressing, 8-Br-cAMP-pretreated RAW cells for periods ranging from 10 min to 1 h at 21 °C, which led to binding to the cell surface in both large patches and punctate aggregates (the latter of which are not shown). In contrast to NDB-PC, bleaching of Cy5-apoAI in large patches on the cell surface led to a distinct area of bleaching because there was little diffusion during the photobleaching (Fig. 8C). Over the course of the subsequent 60 s, no discernable fluorescent recovery was observed in multiple assays during repeated experiments (Fig. 8, C and D). A similar result was found with NBD-labeled apoAI (not shown). Although some lateral mobility of the punctate fluorescent apoAI aggregates was observed over a 1-min time course, there was also no fluorescence recovery after the bleaching of these structures (not shown). Thus, apoAI bound to ABCA1-expressing cells did not behave as if it were floating freely in the lipid phase of the plasma membrane. To determine the FRAP behavior of a comparably sized protein that is bound directly to plasma membrane lipids, staurosporine-pretreated RAW cells were incubated for 10 min with Cy5-annexin V (Fig. 8, E and F). After bleaching, the Cy5-annexin V fluorescence recovered with an average t1/2 of 3.0 ± 0.9 s (n = 9). Thus, the annexin V bound to apoptotic cells did behave as if it were floating freely in the lipid phase of the plasma membrane. We also noted that Cy5-apoAI bound for 10 min at 21 °C to staurosporine-pretreated cells did not exhibit fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (not shown), and in contrast to annexin V, which was bound exclusively to the cell exterior (Fig. 8E), apoAI was found throughout the cell despite this short incubation period at room temperature (Fig. 9). Thus, Cy5-apoAI could quickly penetrate the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells and adhere to intracellular structures that were relatively immobile during the first minute after photobleaching.Figure 9Orthogonal confocal projection through an unfixed apoptotic cell treated for 10 min at 21 °C with 1 μg/ml Cy5 apoAI.

Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This distribution is mediated by proteins that can translocate phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets. The inward-directed flippase activity that normally keeps aminophospholipids in the inner leaflet is reportedly mediated by a P-type ATPase aminophospholipid translocase (12Bevers E.M. Comfurius P.

The ABCB1 (also known as MDR1 or P-glycoprotein 1) gene product can translocate a broad variety of short chain phospholipids and ceramides and can export platelet-activating factor (15van Helvoort A.

Phospholipid floppase activity has also been claimed for the ABCC1 gene (MRP-1) product known to be needed for leukotriene C4 export, although the floppase activity might be an artifact caused by the analogues used in these studies (17Dekkers D.W.

Cell. 1998; 93: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Luciani and Chimini (20Luciani M.F. Chimini G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) have performed a series of studies indicating that ABCA1 has PS floppase activity, which is implicated in both apoptosis and lipid efflux to apoAI, and they propose that ABCA1 may function as the mammalian CED-7 homologue. A polyclonal antibody to the ABCA1 first ATP binding cassette stains phagocytes with ingested apoptotic bodies in the developing limb of mouse embryos, and when introduced into cultured macrophages by osmotic shock this antibody inhibited engulfment of apoptotic thymocytes (20Luciani M.F. Chimini G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Glyburide or oligomycin treatments of macrophages inhibited engulfment of apoptotic cells as well as the exposure of PS on irradiated thymocytes (21Marguet D. Luciani M.F. Moynault A. Williamson P. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We speculate that these results might be caused by inhibition of a different mammalian ABC transporter because neither the polyclonal antibody nor the drugs have absolute specificity for ABCA1. In addition, our blastp analysis revealed that the human or mouse ABCA2 protein has greater identity to the C. elegans CED-7 protein than does the human or mouse ABCA1 protein, thus doubting the identity of ABCA1 as the mammalian homologue of CED-7. Chimini's laboratory reported less engulfment of apoptotic cells in situ and ex vivo in ABCA1-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice (5Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, ABCA1-deficient mice did not display any gross morphological defects that can be attributed to defective apoptosis, implying that normal developmental apoptosis can proceed without an intact ABCA1 gene. Transfection of active versus mutant ABCA1 into HeLa cells was found to increase the fraction of cells competent to engulf apoptotic prey by approximately 2-fold (5Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although this effect may be caused by PS translocase activity, it may also be due to other effects on phagocytosis or actin- or microtubule-based membrane trafficking because ABCA1 recently has been noted to effect both receptor-mediated endocytosis and membrane trafficking from the Golgi (22Zha X.

Chambenoit et al. (6Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol.

In the current study using adherent cells in which endogenous ABCA1 was induced by 8-Br-cAMP, we confirm this prior result. We observed a 64% increase in fluorescent annexin V binding to adherent RAW264.7 cells treated with cAMP analogues, which induces ABCA1 mRNA levels by ∼50-fold (10Zheng P. Horwitz A. Waelde C.A. Smith J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1534: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly treated cells had a 173% increase in fluorescent apoAI binding. In addition, we found that staurosporine-induced apoptosis of RAW cells, which results in increased cell surface PS, also led to a dramatic increase in cell-associated apoAI. These results together seem to support the hypothesis from Chimini's laboratory that ABCA1 functions as a PS floppase and that cell surface PS is sufficient for apoAI binding, with apoAI floating freely in plasma membrane lipids (6Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, when we examined this in more detail several inconsistencies were found. First, although apoAI bound to staurosporine-treated cells, it was not bound to the cell surface where annexin V binding was observed, but it was found throughout the cell. Secondly, apoptosis-induced exofacial PS did not lead to lipid efflux to apoAI. Thirdly, the PS-binding protein annexin V did not compete for the ability of apoAI to bind to either staurosporine-treated or ABCA1-expressing cells, and it did not inhibit cholesterol efflux to apoAI from ABCA1-expressing cells. Fourthly, FRAP analysis failed to confirm that apoAI was floating freely in plasma membrane lipids. Chambenoit et al. (6Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) determined the mobility of apoAI by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using ABCA1-GFP-expressing cells incubated for 5 min with Cy5-apoAI. In this procedure (designed for solution studies) confocal optics are used to scan the fluctuation of fluorescent emissions in a very small volume (∼1 femtoliter). The diffusion of individual fluorescently labeled molecules into and out of this small area gives rise to this fluctuation, and the diffusion rate can be calculated. These authors determined that Cy5-apoAI diffused at room temperature on the cell surface more rapidly than would be expected if it were bound to an integral membrane protein; however, they did not display any micrographs of Cy5-apoAI bound to the ABCA1-GFP-expressing cells (6Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Chambenoit et al. (6Chambenoit O.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) speculate based on the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy study that ABCA1 induction of cell surface PS is sufficient to allow for binding of apoAI to the lipid phase of the plasma membrane without a direct ligand-receptor interaction with ABCA1. In the current study, we found that most of the cell surface apoAI was in large aggregates after a 5-min incubation of Cy5-apoAI with HEK293 cells expressing an ABCA1-GFP fusion protein. Thus, it is possible that the rapid diffusion of Cy5-apoAI measured by Chambenoit et al. (6Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) may be caused by diffusion within the aggregates and not the lateral diffusion of single apoAI molecules on the cell surface. If this is the case then the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy study could not definitively assess the characteristics of apoAI bound to the cell surface. In the current study, FRAP was used to directly visualize Cy5-apoAI mobility on the cell surface; we conclude that apoAI does not diffuse rapidly, and we speculate that it is either directly or indirectly tethered to an integral membrane protein, possibly ABCA1. By analogy with other ABC transporters (18Borst P. Zelcer N. van Helvoort A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), it is possible that ABCA1 pumps lipids from within the cell to either the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or perhaps into a recycling endosome. However, the lipids that may be the substrate for ABCA1 transport have not been clearly defined. Our data demonstrate that apoAI binding to ABCA1-expressing or apoptotic cells does not appear to be mediated by cell surface PS because we did not observe any competition between annexin V and apoAI for binding to these cells. Another lipid may be the substrate for ABCA1 floppase activity, and this lipid might initially interact with apoAI, although our data suggest that apoAI is then directly (or perhaps indirectly through a lipid bridge) bound to an integral membrane protein. An alternate hypothesis is that ABCA1 is a regulatory protein that directs membrane trafficking. This activity may also influence the plasma membrane lipid bilayer asymmetry by altering both the lipid and protein composition of the plasma membrane (for example, by altering the ratio of phospholipid flippases and floppases that are trafficked to the plasma membrane). Recently, the notion that ABCA1 functions as a regulator rather than a pump has been supported by the finding of very low ATPase activity of ABCA1 in isolated membrane preparations (8Szakacs G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orso E. Schmitz G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is possible that ABCA1 has two distinct activities: 1) functioning as a PS translocase, which appears not to play a direct role in apoAI binding or lipid efflux and 2) functioning as a protein that can directly or indirectly bind apoAI and facilitate the assembly of lipids on to the apoAI. Our finding of ABCA1 and Cy5-apoI co-localized within cells is consistent with our prior hypothesis that endocytosis and resecretion is part of the ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux pathway (2Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, we cannot distinguish whether the observed co-localization is part of the lipid efflux pathway or part of a regular endosome to lysosome degradative pathway. We speculate that endocytosis might be a required step in ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux to allow for conditions in which a nascent lipoprotein can dissociate from cellular membranes and/or integral membrane proteins in a loose analogy to the release of iron from bound transferrin in acidic endosomes."

Interestingly, unlike other ribosome-associated factors, eEF1A also interacts with polypeptides after their release from the ribosome. We demonstrate that eEF1A does not bind to correctly folded full-length proteins but interacts specifically with proteins that are unable to fold correctly in a cytosolic environment.

To ensure fidelity in this highly complex process, eukaryotic cells contain sophisticated targeting and translocation machinery for the transport of proteins to different intracellular destinations and a system of chaperones and chaperonins to help the protein fold correctly. Both protein transport and folding have been major topics of research for the last decade, and we have a fairly detailed understanding of both processes (4Naylor, D. J., and Hartl, F. U.

To the best of our knowledge, nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is the first non-ribosomal protein that the growing NC encounters. Its major function is to shield the NC from premature encounters as it emerges from the ribosome. NAC is also involved in regulating ribosome binding to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (12Lauring B. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As the NC lengthens, NAC binding can be competed by other ribosome-associated factors (RAFs) such as signal recognition particle (SRP). NAC, which is highly abundant, has a low affinity for the ribosome nascent-chain complexes (RNCs), regardless of which NC is being translated. Unlike NAC, SRP is of low abundance (∼20 nm) but has high affinity (Kd ∼10−10 m) specifically for the hydrophobic residues present in a signal peptide (17Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). SRP binding is essential for co-translational translocation into the lumen of the ER and entrance of proteins into the secretory pathway (6Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Many proteins that remain in the cytosol must bind to chaperones such as HSP70/40 to avoid inappropriate aggregation and acquire the correct conformation. Chaperones may be able to bind to NCs as they emerge from the ribosome but clearly can also associate with proteins post-translationally and can also protect proteins that are denatured under conditions of stress. Members of the HSP70 family of chaperones are also involved in post-translational transport of proteins into the ER and mitochondria (7Paschen S.A. Neupert W. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Sci. 1988; 13: 384-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Several of the known RAFs, including SRP and NAC, were initially characterized as associating with NCs by demonstrating that they could be photo-cross-linked to NCs (19Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Girshovich A.S. Bochkareva E.S. Bielka H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1986; 320: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Here, we identify and characterize a 50-kDa RAF as eEF1A. eEF1A is implicated in several cellular processes. It is well known to play a principal role in translation by catalyzing GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site at the ribosome. eEF1A has also been demonstrated to bind actin (21Condeelis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 169-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and to sever microtubules, a prerequisite for cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur during the cell cycle (22Shiina N. Gotoh Y. Kubomura N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E. Science. 1994; 266: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here we show that eEF1A binds to RNCs and to unfolded polypeptides that are no longer associated with the ribosome but not to correctly folded proteins. Based on these data as well as previous reports that eEF1A stimulates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of N-acetylated proteins (23Gonen H. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Kahana C. Merrick W.C. Chakraburtty K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7648-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we suggest that eEF1A may also play a role in quality surveillance of newly synthesized proteins. The truncated polypeptides and full-length proteins used in these studies are summarized in Table I, which notes the positions of all methionines and lysines and the restriction enzymes used to produce the truncated templates. Firefly luciferase (ffLuc) polypeptides are encoded by the plasmid pT3-luciferase, a gift of Dr. M. Strauss. Wild-type bovine pre-prolactin (pPL) is encoded by pSPBP4, whereas pPL-M is encoded by pGEM4-PPL/SSKO, and they are gifts of Drs. P. Walter and B. Dobberstein, respectively. In pPL-M, the signal peptide has been altered by three aa substitutions (leucine 15 to proline, valine 19 to glutamic acid, and leucine 23 to arginine) that destroy its ability to bind SRP. pPL-MN was constructed starting with pPL-N, the kind gift of Drs. W. Mothes and T. A. Rapoport (24Mothes W. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3973-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). pPL-N encodes pPL in which every lysine codon has been mutated to an arginine or asparagine as follows: lysines 4, 9, 72, and 78 to arginine and lysines 99, 136, and 154 to asparagine. To make pPL-MN, the DNA encoding the signal sequence (aa 1–30) of pPL-N was excised and replaced with the corresponding sequence from pPL-M. As seen in Table I, this produced a plasmid-encoding pPL with lysines only at positions 4 and 9 and additionally with a non-functional signal sequence.Table IProtein nomenclature and positions of relevant amino acidsProteinPositions ofRestriction enzymeMethioninesLysines85 aa β-actin1, 16, 44, 47, 8218, 50, 61, 68, 84Bgl II133 aa β-actin1, 16, 44, 47, 82, 119, 123, 13218, 50, 61, 68, 84, 113, 118SnaBI221 aa β-actin1, 16, 44, 47, 82, 119, 123, 132, 153, 19018, 50, 61, 68, 84, 113, 118, 191, 213, 215XbaI77 aa ffLuc1, 30, 59, 675, 8, 9, 28, 31, 68Hin fI197 aa ffLuc1, 30, 59, 67, 90, 118, 152, 164, 1965, 8, 9, 28, 31, 68, 130, 131, 135, 141, 142, 148, 155, 190EcoRI550 aa ffLuc1, 30, 59, 67, 90, 118, 152, 164, 196, 249, 265, 396, 398, 4935, 8, 9, 28, 31, 68, 130, 131, 135, 141, 142, 148, 155, 190, 206, 281, 297, 303, 321, 329, 358, 364, 372, 380, 414, 439, 443, 445, 491, 496, 510, 511, 524, 529, 534, 541, 543, 544, 547, 549*1-a* indicates full-length of the protein.229 aa pPL-M1, 54, 66, 83, 111, 135, 160, 1624, 9, 72, 78, 99, 136, 154, 172, 189, 211, 217*86 aa pPL-MN1, 54, 66, 834, 9PvuII169 aa pPL-MN1, 54, 66, 83, 111, 135, 160, 1624, 9EcoRI229 aa pPL-wt1-bwt, wild type.1, 54, 66, 83, 111, 135, 160, 1624, 9, 72, 78, 99, 136, 154, 172, 189, 211, 217*1-a * indicates full-length of the protein.1-b wt, wild type.

Translation reactions included 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (specific activity ∼1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and 4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)diazirino] benzoic acid-lysyl-tRNA as described in detail by Görlich et al. (27Görlich D. Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Rapoport T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In general, the translation initiation was allowed to proceed for 5 min and then be blocked by the addition of aurintricarboxylic acid and 7-methylguanosine-5′-monophosphate (Sigma) to 75 μm and 2 mm, respectively, followed by further incubation at 26 °C for 15 min. The only exception was the experiment shown in Fig. 5 A in which the inhibitors were added after 3 min to concentrations of 50 μm and 1.8 mm. The addition of inhibitors of initiation effectively synchronized the translations and uniformly produced NCs translated to the limit of the truncated mRNA. The reactions were stopped on ice, irradiated when indicated, and then treated with RNase A and analyzed on 6% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel in MES buffer and visualized by autoradiography (XAR-5, Eastman Kodak Co.) except as noted. To strip RAFs from ribosomes, translation reactions were diluted into 10 volumes of ice–cold high salt buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 700 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.4 units/μl placental RNase inhibitor). After 10-min incubation at 4 °C, samples were isolated by centrifugation (100,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, TLA 120.1 rotor, Beckman) through a high salt-sucrose cushion (0.5 m sucrose in high salt buffer). The ratio of the volumes of sucrose cushion to sample was ∼2:1. RNCs were resuspended in one-volume translation blank buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmDTT, protease inhibitor mixture as described by Erickson and Blobel (28Erickson A.H. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and 0.4 units/μl placental RNase inhibitor), and the high salt stripping was repeated as described above to completely remove associated proteins. The isolated high salt-stripped RNCs were incubated at 26 °C for 5 min with buffer A (50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm DTT), rabbit reticulocyte lysate (precipitated with 66% ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against buffer A), or purified protein in buffer A supplemented with RNase inhibitor and protease inhibitors. RNCs were incubated on ice for 30 min with 2 mm puromycin and then at 26 °C for 10 min with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A to release the newly synthesized polypeptides. After treatment, the reaction mixture was centrifuged (100,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, TLA 120.1 rotor) through a low salt-sucrose cushion (0.5 m sucrose in translation blank buffer) to separate ribosomes (pellet) from released polypeptides and RAFs (supernatant). eEF1A was isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate prepared as described previously (26Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). After sedimentation of the ribosomes by centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman rotor TLA 100.4, proteins were precipitated with 66% ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against buffer A overnight, and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The flow-through was applied to an S-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 10–1000 mm potassium acetate in buffer A. A single protein was obtained at 390–450 mm potassium acetate concentration. The protein was dialyzed against 15% glycerol in buffer A. From 35 ml of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 200 μg of purified eEF1A was obtained. A plasmid encoding a GST-eEF1A fusion protein is a generous gift of J. Condeelis (29Liu G. Tang J. Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Levin S. Condeelis J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with this plasmid, and a 2-liter culture in 2× YT was incubated at room temperature until it reached an optical density of 0.8 (600 nm) followed by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.2 mm. After 7–8 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 ml of buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor), and broken by one pass through an Avestin cell disrupter (Ottawa, Canada) at greater than 10,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation of the lysate at 12,000 rpm for 10 min in a SA600 rotor (Sorvall), the resulting supernatant was spun at 35,000 rpm in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman) for 60 min. The supernatant was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). After centrifugation and wash, the beads were resuspended in 1 ml of glutathione elution buffer (AmershamBiosciences) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min to elute the GST-eEF1A fusion protein from the beads. Finally, the beads were sedimented, and the GST-eEF1A fusion protein was recovered from the supernatant. To cleave the GST from eEF1A, the GST-eEF1A protein was treated with thrombin (4 units/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 16 h. Thrombin was inactivated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and AEBSF (0.5 mm) for 30 min followed by dialysis against buffer A containing 15% glycerol. Recombinant eEF1A protein was recovered from the supernatant after incubation of the mixture with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Firefly luciferase (10 μm) (Promega) was denatured in 6 mguanidinium-HCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2 mm DTT at 25 °C for 1 h. For refolding assays, denatured luciferase was diluted 200-fold into refolding buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm DTT), supplemented as indicated in Fig. 6. The rabbit reticulocyte lysate contained ATP, GTP, and creatine kinase and creatine phosphate (Promega). After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots were diluted 5-fold into luciferase assay reagent. Luciferase activities were measured using a Promega luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RAFs can be identified by their ability to co-fractionate with ribosomes under physiological salt conditions. We are interested specifically in a subset of these RAFs, which physically interact with NCs emerging from the ribosome. Previously, we and others have identified several proteins to be in contact with NCs including SRP, DnaJ, NAC, and Ssb (17Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 19Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Girshovich A.S. Bochkareva E.S. Bielka H. Rapoport T.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our approach was to combine the co-purification of RAFs with a site-specific photo-cross-linking technology where the cross-linker is positioned in a known position of the growing polypeptide chain (for review see Ref.27Görlich D. Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Rapoport T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This technique to probe the environment of the NC for RAFs requires the formation of a stable RNC with photoactivatable cross-linker in the NC followed by UV irradiation to activate the cross-linking reagent. To accomplish this task, a truncated mRNA is generated in vitro using restriction enzyme-cut DNA as template (25Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and then translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and lysyl-tRNA derivatized with 4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)diazirino] benzoic acid at the ε-amino group of the lysine. In the absence of a stop codon on the mRNA, the NC remains stably associated with the ribosome. Subsequent photoactivation by UV irradiation results in the formation of a highly reactive carbene on the derivatized lysines. The chemical instability of the carbene ensures that only molecules closely associated with the NC will be cross-linked. The high specificity of this photo-cross-linking approach comes with the disadvantage that this reagent also rapidly reacts with water molecules, generally resulting in a low efficiency of cross-linking (32Brunner J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) especially for ribosome-associated molecules with fast on and off rates of binding. The experiment illustrated in Fig. 1 used a truncated mRNA-encoding 169 aa pPL-MN, which carries only two lysines at positions 4 and 9 (see Table I). At this distance from the peptidyltransferase center, NAC is not efficiently cross-linked to NCs. Instead, we observed two major cross-linked products of ∼70 and 140 kDa representing cross-linking partners of ∼50 and 120 kDa, respectively. The focus of this study is the identification and characterization of the 50-kDa protein. By definition, RAFs but not components of the ribosome are removed by treatment with high salt. The separation of the RNCs from released factors is accomplished by incubation of the translation mixture with high salt followed by centrifugation over a high salt-sucrose cushion (see “Materials and Methods”). Such high salt stripping of 169 aa pPL-MN RNCs greatly reduced the intensity of both cross-linking products to the level of the non-irradiated control (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 4). The addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate to the high salt-stripped RNCs before irradiation restored the cross-link to the 50- and 120-kDa proteins (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 5). Collectively, these results indicate that the 50- and 120-kDa proteins are salt-extractable proteins and can rebind to the 169 aa pPL-MN NC after extraction. The rebinding of the 50-kDa protein provided an assay that we have used for its purification. The 50-kDa protein that cross-links to 169 aa pPL-MN NC was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate as follows. The supernatant from a high speed centrifugation to sediment the ribosomes was precipitated with 66% ammonium sulfate, dialyzed, and applied to a Q-Sepharose column. The flow-through, which contained the 50-kDa cross-linking partner (Fig. 2 A), was applied to an S-Sepharose column and eluted with a gradient of potassium acetate (10–1000 mm, the fraction shown is 390–450 mm). Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4, shows the silver stain of the protein pattern after SDS-PAGE for the different purification steps. In addition, samples were assayed for cross-linking to 169 aa pPL-MN NCs as shown in Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–10. High salt-stripped RNCs irradiated in buffer alone (Fig. 2 A, lane 6) show that the removal of the 50-kDa cross-linking partner was efficient. Fig. 2 A, lane 10, shows the cross-linking products obtained with the active fractions from the S-Sepharose columns. The only major cross-link observed is at 70 kDa, indicating a 50-kDa cross-linking partner. The faint band at ∼120 kDa is most probable a double cross-link to this protein. The active fraction from the S-Sepharose chromatography analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealed a single band of 50 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Mass spectrometry of seven peptides obtained from the excised protein from the SDS gel identified the purified protein as eEF1A. The experimental data found are in good agreement with the predicted sizes shown in parentheses (in daltons): 466.2 (466.25), 537.2 (537.29), 652.3 (652.32), 765.4 (765.40), 878.4 (878.48), 979.5 (979.53), and 1078.6 (1078.60). However, the possibility remained that eEF1Α, an abundant cytosolic protein, is contaminated by another protein that is the actual cross-linking partner. To rule out this possibility, we purified recombinant eEF1A expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli (see “Materials and Methods”) and assayed it for cross-linking to 169 aa pPL-MN NCs. We found that both GST-eEF1Α fusion protein and eEF1A produced by limited thrombin digestion of the fusion protein were able to cross-link to the 169 aa pPL-MN NC (Fig. 2 B). These data prove that it is indeed eEF1A that interacts with the RNCs. We next examined whether eEF1A can interact with other NCs of varying lengths and amino acid sequences. Both purified eEF1A and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were assayed for the production of cross-links to the following NCs: 85 and 221 aa β-actin (Fig. 3 A), 86 and 169 aa pPL-MN (Fig. 3 B), and 77 and 197 aa ffLuc (Fig. 3 C). Purified eEF1A cross-linked to all NCs tested (Fig. 3, A–C, lanes 2 and 5, arrow). In general, the incubation of RNCs with rabbit reticulocyte lysate also produced the cross-linking product expected of eEF1A (Fig. 3, A–C, lane 6, and C, lane 3, arrow). However, in two cases, 85 aa β-actin (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) and 86 aa pPL-MN (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), the expected band was faint, but the longer versions of the same NCs 169 aa pPL-MN and 221aa β-actin did cross-link efficiently with eEF1A in the reticulocyte lysate. Given that the shorter NCs cross-linked to purified eEF1A, this finding suggests that other components in the reticulocyte lysate may compete for binding to the NCs and that eEF1A competes better for binding to the longer NCs. In agreement with this hypothesis, rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) incubated with NCs clearly yields other cross-linked products such as αNAC for 85 aa β-actin (Fig. 3 A, lane 3), p120 for 86 aa pPL-MN (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), and both NAC subunits and p120 for ffLuc (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). In some cases, the decreased intensity of the cross-link to eEF1A for the shorter NC may be because of fewer lysines available for cross-linking. For example, 85 aa β-actin has only five lysines compared with 10 lysines in 221aa β-actin (see Table I). However, this is not the case for pPL-MN, which has only two lysines at positions 4 and 9, the same for 86 aa pPL-MN as for 169 aa pPL-MN. This finding suggests that eEF1A may be more effective than other factors at binding to the distal end of the NC where it is no longer associated with the ribosome. An extension of this reasoning is to ask whether eEF1A can bind to newly synthesized polypeptides even after their release from the ribosome. To test this idea, high salt-stripped 133 aa β-actin RNCs were incubated with purified eEF1A or rabbit reticulocyte lysate, depleted of ribosomes. Puromycin and RNase A were then added to release the NCs from the ribosome. After centrifugation through a high salt-sucrose cushion, the ribosomes with bound NCs were obtained in the pellet, and the released NCs together with the RAFs were recovered from the supernatant. Both fractions were collected and then irradiated in parallel. Without puromycin or RNase A, very few NCs were released from the ribosome, and consequently, neither β-actin nor a cross-linked band was detected in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 8). In the presence of puromycin and RNase A, a larger fraction of NCs was released from the ribosome, and a band of puromycin-released 133 aa β-actin cross-linked to eEF1A was detected in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 9). Note that more than half of the released 133 aa β-actin polypeptide cross-links to eEF1A regardless of whether purified protein (Fig. 4, lane 5) or reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 4, lane 9) was used. These results indicate that eEF1A still associates with polypeptide chains even after their release from the ribosome. Similar results were obtained when the NCs were first released and then eEF1A was added (data not shown). It has been shown previously that most RAFs interactin"
https://openalex.org/W2093362260,"Using a transgenic approach, we studied the role of GATA-3 in T cells. As previously shown, enforced GATA-3 expression in transgenic mice inhibits Th1 differentiation of CD4 T cells, but unexpectedly, both type 1 (interferon γ) and type 2 (interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13) cytokine genes were activated in the transgenic CD8 T cells. Because IL-13 gene expression was highly enhanced in vivo by GATA-3 expression, we studied the human and the mouse IL-13 gene promoters and found an evolutionary-conserved association of a consensus GATA binding site and two GATG motifs. We showed that efficient GATA-3 binding to this regulatory sequence required these three motifs and that the affinity of the GATA zinc fingers for this association was five times higher than for the consensus GATA binding site alone. Transfections in a T cell line or transactivation by GATA-3 showed that the combination of the three sites was required for full transcriptional activity of the IL-13 gene promoter. Finally we showed that this association of binding sites causes a very high sensitivity of the IL-13 gene promoter to small variations in the level of GATA-3 protein. Altogether, these results indicate an important role of GATA-3 in CD8 cytokine gene expression and demonstrate that a critical network of GATA binding sites highly modulates GATA-3 activity."

The bone-specific activation and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhancement of osteocalcin (OC) gene transcription are both functionally linked to modifications in nucleosomal organization. The initiation of tissue-specific basal transcription is accompanied by the induction of two DNase I hypersensitive sites, and this chromatin remodeling event requires binding of the key osteogenic factor RUNX2/CBFA1 to the OC promoter. Here, we analyzed the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 when the OC gene is active (in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells) or inactive (in fibroblastic ROS24/1 cells) using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We find that acetylated histone H3 and H4 proteins are associated with the OC promoter only when the gene is transcriptionally active and that the acetylation status is relatively uniform across the OC locus under basal conditions. Acetylation of H4 at the OC gene is selectively increased following vitamin D3 enhancement of OC transcription, with the most prominent changes occurring in the region between the vitamin D3 enhancer and basal promoter. Thus, our results suggest functional linkage of H3 and H4 acetylation in specific regions of the OC promoter to chromatin remodeling that accompanies tissue-specific transcriptional activation and vitamin D enhancement of OC gene expression.

Therefore, we have assessed in this study whether acetylation or deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the regulatory regions of a bone-related mammalian gene is linked mechanistically to steroid hormone-dependent modifications in osteoblast-specific gene expression. Steroid hormone-dependent transcriptional control of bone-specific genes necessitates functional modifications in chromatin organization (4Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Gene. 2000; 246: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 30Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Understanding chromatin structure of the osteocalcin gene is fundamental in characterizing the molecular and genetic mechanisms of bone cell differentiation. We have previously shown that developmental modifications in the nucleosomal organization of the OC gene are functionally coupled to the establishment of a local promoter architecture containing two nuclease hypersensitive sites separated by a positioned nucleosome (17Montecino M. Pockwinse S. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These sites span the distal VD3 enhancer and the proximal basal promoter, and increased nuclease hypersensitivity of both sites accompanies vitamin D enhancement of OC gene transcription (17Montecino M.

In this study, we have addressed the mechanisms by which vitamin D3 mediates chromatin remodeling of the OC gene to promote steroid hormone enhancement of OC gene transcription. The key results of this study are that the OC gene promoter is associated with acetylated histones H3 and H4, when transcriptionally active, and that the relative level of histone H4 acetylation is increased during vitamin D3enhancement of transcription. ROS 17/2.8 and ROS 24/1 osteosarcoma cells (32Majeska R.J. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) were plated at 0.5 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish and grown in F-12 medium plus 5% fetal calf serum. Cells reached confluence at approximately day 6. Cells were treated with 10−8 m 1,25-(OH)2D3 (a gift from Dr. M. Uskokovic, Hoffmann-La Roche) in F-12 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, which was growth factor- and steroid hormone-depleted using charcoal (“stripped serum”). Samples were collected at the indicated times following 1,25-(OH)2D3 administration, and the medium of each sample was collected for radioimmunoassay to measure osteocalcin levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed with antibodies recognizing acetylated histones. The anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology (UBI), Lake Placid, NY, catalog no. 06866) is a rabbit antiserum containing a polyclonal IgG directed against a tetra-acetylated peptide (AGG(K*)GG(K*)GMG(K*)VGA(K*)RHSC, where K* is acetylated lysine) that spans the highly conserved residues 1–19 of histone H4 (H4-Ac1, 2) (33Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes multiple acetylated forms of histone H4. The anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (UBI, catalog no. 06599) is a protein A-purified rabbit polyclonal IgG that is directed against the diacetylated peptide (ARTKQTAR(K*)STGG(K*)APRKQLC) spanning the highly conserved N-terminal residues 1–20 of histone H3. It has been noted that phosphorylation of Ser-10 decreases the affinity of this antibody for deacetylated histone H3 (34Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell.

The antibody that recognizes hyperacetylated histone H4 (H4-Ac3,4) (UBI, catalog no. 06946) is a rabbit antiserum containing a polyclonal IgG directed against a synthetic substrate related to residues 2–19 of Tetrahymena histone H2A. This antibody recognizes multiple acetylated forms of histone H4 and, to a lesser degree, triacetylated histone H4 (35Lin R. Leone J.W. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J.

Whole cell lysates were prepared from ROS17/2.8 and ROS 24/1 cells by washing monolayers in ice-cold PBS and resuspending cells in SDS-lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cell pellets were boiled and the lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE in 18% (40:1) polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry electroblotter. After transfer, nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.9 mmNaH2PO4, 0.137 m NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C. Western blot analyses were performed with the anti-acetylated H3 and H4 IgG antibodies (UBI, catalog no. 06599 and 06598, respectively), as well as with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated histone H3. This antibody is a protein A-purified rabbit polyclonal IgG directed against a peptide phosphorylated on serine residue 10 and spanning amino acids 7–20 of histone H3 (37Hendzel M.J. Wei Y.

Antibodies against HDAC1 and p300 (UBI, catalog no. 06-720 and 05-257) and antibodies against CDK2, lamin B, and CPB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, catalog no. SC-163, SC-6217, and SC-1211) were obtained from the indicated suppliers. Primary antibodies (as indicated in the figure legends) were added in PBS-T buffer at a 1:10,000 dilution, and the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibody was detected using a secondary anti-rabbit immunoglobulin coupled to horse-radish peroxidase at a 1:10,000 dilution, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using the substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol by autoradiography. ChIP assays were performed with ROS 17/2.8 and ROS 24/1 osteosarcoma cells that were grown with or without 1,25-(OH)2 D3. Prior to harvest, cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in incomplete F-12 medium containing 1% formaldehyde. This step stabilizes nucleosomes by the reversible cross-linking of histones with DNA. Cells were washed and harvested in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mg/ml TPCK, 4 mg/ml bestatin, 17 mg/ml calpain, 1 mg/ml E64, and 10 mm sodium butyrate). Cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, with protease inhibitors as above) for 10 min on ice. Samples were sonicated to reduce the DNA length to 0.1–0.6 kbp (median length = 0.4), and cells were cooled on ice between pulses. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman J-21 centrifuge with a J-20 rotor. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 16.7 mm NaCl) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmleupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mg/ml TPCK, 4 mg/ml bestatin, 17 mg/ml calpain, and 1 mg/ml E64). Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). The chromatin solution was distributed into multiple 1-ml aliquots that were used as the starting material for all subsequent steps. DNA-coated protein A/G-agarose was prepared by incubating 500 μl of beads with dilution buffer containing 10 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. Excess DNA was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 3,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C followed by four sequential washes of the beads with dilution buffer. Prior to chromatin immunoprecipitations, the 1-ml chromatin aliquots were pre-cleared with 100 μl of a 25% (v/v) suspension of DNA-coated protein A/G-agarose in the absence of antibody. The supernatant was recovered following brief centrifugation at 3,000 rpm in the Eppendorf microcentrifuge and was used directly for immunoprecipitation experiments with a 1:200 dilution of the acetylated histone H3 or H4 antibodies described above. A nonspecific antibody against the unrelated hemagglutinin epitope tag was used as a negative control. Chromatin immunoreactions were allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Immune complexes were mixed with 100 μl of a 25% precoated protein A/G-agarose suspension followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C while rotating. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant of this step in the procedure is designated the “unbound DNA fraction.” The bead pellets were sequentially washed with 1 ml each of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1). The beads were then washed twice using 1 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The immunocomplexes were eluted by adding a 250-μl aliquot of a freshly prepared solution of 1% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3. The sample was briefly vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min with rotation. Following recovery of the supernatant by microcentrifugation, the beads were washed with a second aliquot, and the resulting supernatant was carefully pooled with the first aliquot. Samples were sequentially digested with RNase A (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h and proteinase K (20 mg/ml) at 42 °C for 2 h to remove RNA and protein. The cross-linking reaction was reversed by overnight incubation of the sample at 68 °C, and the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extractions. The DNA was precipitated with two volumes of ethanol using 20 mg/ml glycogen as carrier. Each DNA pellet was dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer (designated the “bound DNA fraction”). An aliquot (3 μl) of each DNA fraction was used for quantitative PCR to detect the presence of specific DNA segments. For each immunoprecipitation, an aliquot of the starting material was digested with RNase A (10 mg/ml) and proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubated overnight at 68 °C to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated with 20 mg/ml glycogen, and finally dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer (designated the “input DNA fraction”). Aliquots (1 μl) of this input DNA preparation were used for quantitative PCR and Southern blot analysis. PCR primer pairs were generated to detect DNA segments located between nt −1377 and +466 of the rat osteocalcin promoter (nt +1 is the mRNA cap-site) (Fig. 1 a). We also designed PCR primers to detect a rat histone H4 (His4) gene coding region (Fig. 1 b) to facilitate the normalization of PCR signals obtained with OC-derived primers. Each PCR reaction was performed with a 10% aliquot (3 μl) of the bound DNA fraction from the ChIP assay or a 1% aliquot (1 μl) of the unbound fraction. DNA was amplified with each primer at 0.4 mm, each dNTP at 0.18 mm, and 0.5 μl of Taq polymerase (5 u/μl) in 1× buffer provided by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a PerkinElmer 480 thermocycler. The PCR thermocycler was programmed as follows: preincubation at 95 °C for 1 min, 26 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s at the optimal annealing temperature for each primer pair (see Fig. 1 c), and 30 s at 72 °C, with one final incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were separated in 2.0% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA bands were visualized using ultraviolet light and recorded as tagged image file format (TIF) files using a high resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) camera linked to an AlphaImager gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). TIF files of ethidium bromide-stained gels were subjected to densitometric analysis by Image J, developed by Wayne Rasband (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Values were imported into Microsoft Excel for numerical analysis and data plotting. The osteocalcin gene is constitutively expressed in ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells, and its promoter displays an active chromatin conformation reflected by the presence of two DNase I hypersensitive sites (17Montecino M. Pockwinse S. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To assess whether acetylated histones are associated with the OC gene when it is transcriptionally active, we performed ChIP assays with antibodies recognizing mono- and diacetylated histone H3 (H3-Ac) and multiple acetylated forms of histone H4 (H4-Ac1,2 and H4-Ac3,4). These antibodies were used in whole cell lysates to precipitate sonicated chromatin that was obtained following formaldehyde cross-linking of DNA to histones in vivo. DNA fragments that co-precipitated with acetylated histones were purified upon reversal of histone/DNA cross-links and used as the template for PCR reactions with gene-specific primers (Fig. 1). We adjusted the number of PCR cycles to remain within the linear range of PCR amplification. The resulting DNA products were resolved by agarose electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and quantitated by digital image analysis (Fig. 2). Chromatin immunoprecipitates were analyzed with a series of PCR primers covering the OC locus between –1.4 and +0.5 kb relative to the mRNA cap-site (Fig. 1, a and c). In each experiment, the specificity of the PCR procedure was assessed by appropriate positive and negative control reactions in which either specific primers or templates were omitted. Furthermore, the authenticity of the PCR products was validated by Southern blot analysis with probes spanning the OC gene (data not shown). For comparison, we also tested PCR primers spanning the coding region of a cell growth regulated rat histone H4 (His4) gene (Fig. 1 b), which is expressed in a broad range of proliferating cells and tissues (39Wolfe S.A. Anderson J.V. Grimes S.R. Stein G.S. Stein J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the acetylation status of histones within the region of the OC promoter that contains the distal nuclease hypersensitive site and the vitamin D enhancer (nt −773/−433), as well as the nucleosomal region between the proximal and distal promoters (nt −459/−118) (Fig. 2 a). The results show that all three acetylated histone antibodies (H3-Ac, H4-Ac1,2, and H4-Ac3,4) precipitate fragments from the OC gene and also the His4 gene. However, no signal was detected in precipitates obtained with an antibody recognizing the unrelated hemagglutinin epitope (panel NS, Fig. 2 a), which provides a negative control for our chromatin immunoprecipitations. These results indicate that different acetylated forms of histones H3 and H4 are specifically associated with nucleosomes in the vicinity of the transcriptionally active OC and His4 genes. The PCR signals for the His4 gene are relatively uniform for the three acetylated histone antibodies (Fig. 2 a). Thus, we normalized the values for the OC primers with those for the His4 primers and expressed our results as OC/His4 ratios (Fig. 2 b). We find that the OC/His4 ratios for the OC −773/−433 and OC −459/−118 primer pairs are lowest for the H3-Ac antibody (OC/His4 ratios of 0.2 to 0.4) and ∼2-fold higher for the H4-Ac1,2 and H4-Ac3,4 antibodies (OC/His4 ratios of 0.4 to 0.8). These results indicate quantitative differences in the relative representation of acetylated histones H4 and H3 at the OC gene as compared with the His4 locus. These differences suggest that the OC gene promoter is preferentially associated with acetylated histone H4 compared with the His4 gene. To understand the relative distribution of acetylated histones across the OC gene promoter, we performed additional PCR experiments using primers upstream from the vitamin D-dependent enhancer region and downstream at the proximal promoter and OC coding region (Fig. 2 c). We analyzed immunoprecipitates with the H3-Ac, H4-Ac1,2, and H4-Ac3,4 antibodies using chromatin isolated from ROS 17/2.8 cells. The results indicate that the OC promoter regions −1047/−827 and −198/−28 contain on the average 1.5–3-fold higher levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 than the OC segments in the far distal promoter (−1377/−1176) and the OC coding sequence (+289/+466) (Fig. 2 d). Thus the relative level of acetylation of histones H3 and H4 gradually declines in chromatin upstream from −1.0 kb and downstream from the mRNA cap-site. The levels of acetylated forms of H4 are significantly higher than those for acetylated histone H3 throughout the OC locus. The level of histone H4 acetylation is highest in the −1047/−827 and −198/−28 regions and is reduced by 1.5–2-fold in the −1377/−1176 and +289/+466 regions (Fig. 2, c and d). These data indicate that there are transitions in the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 that correspond with the regulatory boundaries of the OC gene promoter. Our findings further indicate that the promoter region from approximately −1.0 to 0.0 kb, which encompasses the principal regulatory elements and two major nuclease hypersensitive domains of the OC promoter, contains relatively high levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4. To gain insight into the acetylation status of histones at the OC locus when the gene is transcriptionally inactive, we carried out ChIP assays with histone-DNA complexes iso"
https://openalex.org/W2061148101,"Infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts by avian reovirus induces an increase in the permeability of the host plasma membrane at late, but not early, infection times. The absence of permeability changes at early infection times, as well as the dependence of late membrane modification on both viral protein synthesis and an active exocytic route, suggest that a virus-encoded membrane protein is required for avian reovirus to permeabilize cells. Further studies revealed that expression of nonstructural p10 protein in bacterial cells arrested cell growth and enhanced membrane permeability. Membrane leakiness was also observed following transient expression of p10 in BSC-40 monkey cells. Both its permeabilizing effect and the fact that p10 shares several structural and physical characteristics with other membrane-active viral proteins indicate that p10 is an avian reovirus viroporin. Furthermore, the fusogenic extracellular NH2-terminal domain of p10 appears to be dispensable for permeabilizing activity, because its deletion entirely abolished the fusogenic activity of p10, without affecting its ability to associate with cell membranes and to enhance membrane permeability. Similar properties have reported previously for immunodeficiency virus type I transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. Thus, like gp41, p10 appears to be a multifunctional protein that plays key roles in virus-host interaction.

Thus, like gp41, p10 appears to be a multifunctional protein that plays key roles in virus-host interaction. Cytolytic viruses induce profound injurious effects in susceptible host cells, resulting in morphological, structural, and biochemical changes and in cell degeneration. A widespread phenomenon during viral infection is the alteration of the permeability of the host plasma membrane (reviewed in Refs. 1Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Carrasco L. Otero M.J. Castrillo J.L. Pharmacol.

Viruses can modify the membranes of their host cells in at least two ways: (i) by promoting membrane fusion between virus and cell and/or between cell and cell and (ii) by altering the permeability of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 4Knipe D.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virus-Host Cell Interactions: Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 273-299Google Scholar). The latter can occur at two different stages of infection: either during virus entry or at late infection times. Early membrane permeabilization is induced by input virus particles during the process of virus entry and uncoating, and causes structural and functional changes in the membrane. The extent and degree of these modifications vary with the virus-cell system and with the multiplicity of infection. On the other hand, enhanced permeability at late infection times requires virus gene expression and is manifested as a general increase in permeability to ions and small molecules, but not to macromolecules, suggesting the formation of hydrophilic pores in the plasma membrane. Recent evidence suggests that these pores are formed by specific viral proteins, whose ultimate function is to disorganize the membrane and kill the infected cell. These membrane-perturbing viral proteins, termed viroporins, share several physical and structural characteristics (reviewed in Ref. 1Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Avian reoviruses are members of the Orthoreovirus genus, one of the nine genera of the Reoviridae family. These agents replicate in the cytoplasm and contain a genome formed by 10 segments of double-stranded RNA enclosed within a double protein capsid shell, but lack a lipid envelope (5Nibert M.L.

The infection of cultured cells by avian reoviruses causes strong cytopathic effects, manifested by shrinkage, rounding, and detachment from the plate. The cytopathic effects of avian reovirus infection are rather complex, involving syncytia formation and apoptosis (7Duncan R. Murphy F.A. Mirkovic R.R.

Virology. 2000; 274: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that there is a close association between nonstructural p10 protein and the syncytial phenotype displayed by avian reoviruses (11Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This protein is a small transmembrane type-I (N-out) protein, and mutagenic analysis revealed that a region of its extracellular NH2-terminal domain displays a sequence-dependent effect on the fusogenic activity of p10 (Ref. 15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). open reading frame chicken embryo fibroblast hygromycin B isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside plaque-forming unit maltose-binding protein In this study we have investigated the capability of avian reovirus to alter the permeability of the host plasma membrane. We found that infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) by avian reovirus S1133 causes membrane leakiness at late infection times, and that this alteration is dependent on both viral protein synthesis and protein translocation through the vesicular system. We also found that expression of avian reovirus nonstructural p10 protein in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells induces destabilization of the cell membrane, and that this function is not abolished by deletion of its extracellular fusogenic domain. Primary cultures of CEF were prepared from 9–10-day-old chicken embryos and grown in medium 199 supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth and 5% calf serum. Monkey BSC-40 cells were grown in monolayers in medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Strain S1133 of avian reovirus was grown in semiconfluent monolayers of primary CEF, as described previously (16Grande A. Benavente J. J. Virol. Methods. 2000; 85: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Preparation of polyclonal antibodies against the three S1-encoded avian reovirus proteins has been described previously (11Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the purified nonstructural protein μNS were raised in our laboratory. Cloning of ORF1 into prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression vectors has also been described (11Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To generate ORF1*, ORF2, and ORF3 DNA inserts, the recombinant plasmid pBsct-S1 (11Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was subjected to PCR amplification with the following primers. For ORF1*, the forward primer was 5′-CGGAATTCACGATGGCTCAGAACACGGCAGGT-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and the reverse primer was 5′-CCCGTCGACTCAAACGTCGTATGGCGGAG-3′ (SalI site underlined). For ORF2, the forward primer was 5′-CGGAATTCGTAAGCGCAATGGAATGGCTC-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and the reverse primer was 5′-CCCGTCGACTCATAGATCGGCGTCAAATCG-3′ (SalI site underlined). For ORF3, the forward primer was 5′-CGGAATTCTTCATTGGGATGGCGGG-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and the reverse primer was 5′-CCCGTCGACTTAGGTGTCGATGCCGGTAC-3′ (SalI site underlined). Forward primers were designed to contain an initiation AUG codon with a strong context for translation initiation (17Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The resulting amplification products were digested and cloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of expression vectors pMalC and pCIneo. The correct orientation of the inserts was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the recombinant plasmids. Overnight cultures of either BL21(DE3) or BL21(DE3)pLysE cells containing the indicated plasmid, grown at 37 °C in LB medium, supplemented either with 0.2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin for BL21(DE3) cells or with 0.2% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol for BL21(DE3)pLysE cells, were diluted 100-fold in the same supplemented medium. When an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm was reached, cultures were induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). Infection of CEF by avian reovirus S1133 and transient expression of viral proteins in BSC-40 cells have been described previously (11Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For assessing permeabilization of eukaryotic cells to hygromycin B (HB) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), the inhibitor was added, at a final concentration of 1.5 mm, to the cultured medium 45 min before the start of radioactive labeling. For protein radiolabeling, the cultured medium was supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine-cysteine (1.45 Ci/mmol, AmershamBiosciences) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 3× Laemmli sample buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography. For metabolic radiolabeling in bacteria, cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.4 mm HB and 70 μCi/ml [35S]methionine-cysteine. Labeled cells were then collected and lysed in 3× Laemmli sample buffer. Uridine preloading of cultured cells and subsequent estimation of release were done essentially as described previously (19Aldabe R. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23134-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Pérez M. Garcia-Barreno B. Melero J.A. Carrasco L. Guinea R. Virology. 1997; 235: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For eukaryotic cells, 14 h before infection or transfection, semiconfluent cell monolayers were incubated for 14 h at 37 °C in medium containing 2 μCi/ml [5,6-3H]uridine (32 Ci/mmol,Amersham Biosciences). The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to either viral infection or lipofection. At the indicated times, the culture medium was collected, centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was mixed with scintillation mixture (989, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The radioactivity was then quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. For bacterial cells, 90 min before IPTG induction, cultures were incubated for 1 h in medium supplemented with 4 μCi/ml [5,6-3H]uridine. The cells were then pelleted and washed twice with prewarmed isotope-free culture medium, resuspended in the initial volume of growth medium, and incubated at 37 °C. After IPTG induction, 0.3-ml aliquots of the culture were collected and cells were pelleted. Quantification of the radioactivity in the supernatant was done as above. Fractionation of transfected BSC-40 cells and Western blotting analysis were done as described previously (11Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Isolation of bacterial membranes was essentially done as described by Lama and Carrasco (21Lama J. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 30 min after IPTG induction, bacteria were pelleted and washed twice with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 100 mmNaCl. Cells were finally resuspended in buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) and lysed by sonication. The resulting extracts were clarified by low speed centrifugation (2,500 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant was centrifuged again (100,000 × g for 30 min). The pelleted membrane fraction was resuspended in buffer A, and proteins in this fraction and in the supernatant fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. To analyze membrane permeability changes in response to avian reovirus infection, several assays were performed. First, the ability of HB to cross the membrane of avian reovirus-infected cells was investigated at different infection times. HB, which does not normally trespass the membrane barrier of intact cells, does penetrate cells with permeabilized membranes, causing strong inhibition of intracellular protein synthesis; it is therefore widely used to study changes in membrane permeability (1Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2A indicate that, although HB was unable to cross the plasma membrane of both uninfected CEF (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2) and early-infected CEF (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–6), it readily penetrated S1133-infected CEF at late infection times, blocking protein synthesis (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 7 and 8). These results indicate that viral infection induces enhanced membrane permeability at late, but not early, infection times. To determine whether the perturbed plasma membrane also allows increased efflux of compounds, we next examined the leakage of radioactivity from [3H]uridine-preloaded cells. As can be observed in Fig. 2B, a substantially greater amount of radioactivity was released from infected cells at 9 h after infection than at 0 or 2 h after infection. These data clearly illustrate that the plasma membrane of avian reovirus-infected cells is permeabilized bidirectionally at late infection times, allowing increased entry and exit of metabolites. We next performed experiments to assess whether newly synthesized viral proteins are required for the late permeability changes induced by avian reovirus. First of all, we checked whether the onset of viral protein synthesis and membrane modification are concurrent, by performing infections at two different multiplicities of infection (Fig. 3). When cells were infected with a multiplicity of 5 pfu/cell, viral protein synthesis and enhanced permeability to HB were both first detected at 9 h after infection, as shown by 35S-metabolic labeling and immunoblot analysis of the nonstructural viral protein μNS in HB-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Increasing the multiplicity of infection up to 100 pfu/cell accelerated both processes; onset of both viral protein synthesis and membrane leakiness was now detectable at 6 h after infection (Fig. 3,C and D). The fact that the onsets of these two events are concurrent suggests a cause-effect relationship. To confirm this, membrane permeabilization to HB was analyzed in infected cells cultured in the presence of ribavirin. Ribavirin is a guanosine nucleoside analog that has been shown to inhibit avian and mammalian reovirus gene expression, at the level of virus transcription, without affecting the expression of cellular genes (22Rankin J.T.Jr. Eppes S.B. Antczak J.B. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1989; 168: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).1 We have shown previously that the presence of ribavirin in the culture medium of uninfected CEF cells, at concentrations up to 400 μm, does not affect either the viability of the cells for at least 3 days or their protein synthesis capacity, analyzed 16 h after addition of the inhibitor. In the same study we also showed that ribavirin, when added to avian reovirus-infected cells at the start of the infection, does not prevent viral uncoating, indicating that the drug does not affect the capacity of the avian reovirus to penetrate and uncoat within endosomes. The results shown in Fig. 4 (A and B) reveal that ribavirin does not inhibit protein synthesis in uninfected cells (compare lanes 1 and 2), but induces a drastic reduction in the synthesis of viral polypeptides, but not cell polypeptides, in avian reovirus-infected cells (compare lanes 5 and 6). This result demonstrates that ribavirin is a specific inhibitor of reoviral, but not cellular, gene expression. Analysis of HB internalization in ribavirin-treated cells showed that, although ribavirin did not promote the entry of HB into uninfected cells (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 4), its presence prevented HB internalization in late-stage infected cells (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 7 and 8). Likewise, HB internalization did not take place in cells infected with UV-treated, replication-incompetent reovirions (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that viral gene expression is required for avian reovirus to permeabilize the host plasma membrane and also suggest that late membrane leakiness is induced by a viroporin. Because viroporins are transmembrane proteins that exert their permeabilizing effect when inserted into the cell membrane, we next investigated whether an active exocytic route is required for membrane permeabilization in avian reovirus-infected cells. With this end, we investigated the effect of brefeldin A on the capacity of HB to penetrate late-stage infected cells (Fig. 4C). Brefeldin A is a macrolide antibiotic that has been shown to inhibit vesicle transport to the cell surface, by causing the resorption of the Golgi complex into the endoplasmic reticulum (23Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 24Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25Pelham H.R. Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). At the concentration of 5 μg/ml, brefeldin A did not inhibit protein synthesis in uninfected CEF (compare lanes 1 and 2) and caused only a minor reduction in protein synthesis in avian reovirus-infected cells (compare lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, the presence of brefeldin A only induced a slight decrease in the intracellular production of infectious viral particles (data not shown), indicating that this antibiotic hardly affects virus replication and reovirion assembly. Similar results regarding the effect of brefeldin A have been reported previously for the replication of avian reovirus 176 in the continuous quail fibrosarcoma cell line QT6 (26Duncan R. Chen Z. Walsh S. Wu S. Virology. 1996; 224: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the presence of brefeldin A abrogated the ability of the virus to induce both membrane permeabilization to HB (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 7 and 8) and syncytia formation (data not shown), indicating that an active exocytic system is required for avian reovirus to induce these alterations. We have recently shown that the two nonstructural proteins, p10 and p17, encoded by the tricistronic avian reovirus S1 gene become associated with cell membranes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (11Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A priori, then, these two proteins appear to be good candidates for involvement in membrane permeabilization. To assess the permeabilizing activity of the S1-encoded proteins, we first used an inducible Escherichia coli expression system that has been shown to be suitable for the characterization of other membrane-active viral proteins. In this study we used E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE cells, which contain an IPTG-inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene within the chromosome as well as the pLysE plasmid that constitutively expresses high levels of the T7 phage lysozyme (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A. Dunn J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzimol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). This system, therefore, allows us to test for permeabilization of the inner bacterial membrane, because, when intact, intracellular lysozyme cannot reach the cell wall, whereas a perturbed membrane will allow lysozyme to gain acces to and degrade the cell wall peptidoglycan, giving rise to rapid cell lysis. As a first approach to analyzing the effect of the three S1-encoded proteins on bacterial membranes, their open reading frames were individually cloned into the maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene fusion vector, pMalC, and the resulting recombinant plasmids were used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysE E. coli cells. Electrophoretic analysis of extracts from recombinant bacteria showed that MBP and all three MBP-fused polypeptides were expressed in IPTG-induced bacteria (Fig. 5C, odd lanes), but not in uninduced bacteria (data not shown). The growth rates of the transformed bacterial cells were analyzed spectrophotometrically by measurement of optical density at 600 nm. The results shown in Fig. 5A revealed that, whereas bacteria transformed with pMalC, pMalC-ORF3, or pMalC-ORF2 grew exponentially during the 180-min period following IPTG induction, a drastic arrest of cell growth followed IPTG induction of pMalC-ORF1-transformed bacteria. This finding indicates that expression of p10 enhances the permeability of the inner membrane to intracellular lysozyme, giving rise to rapid cell lysis. On the other hand, the expression of MBP-p10, but not of the other two MBP-fused proteins, promoted the release of substantial amounts of radioactivity from [3H]uridine-preloaded cells (Fig. 5B) and rendered cells susceptible to HB inhibition (Fig. 5C, compare odd lanes with even lanes). To gather more evidence on the permeabilization activity of p10, we next compared the capacity of p10 and p17 to induce membrane leakiness in eukaryotic cells. First of all, the p17- and p10-encoding ORFs were individually cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCIneo, and the resulting recombinant plasmids were lipofected into monolayers of BSC-40 monkey cells. The Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 6 (A and B) demonstrates that the two proteins were synthesized in transfected cells, as previously reported (11Bodelon G. Labrada L. Martinez-Costas J. Benavente J. Virology. 2001; 290: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A subsequent electrophoretic analysis of 35S-radiolabeled cell extracts revealed that, although HB could readily penetrate cells transformed with pCIneo-ORF1 (Fig. 6C, lane 3), this inhibitor was unable to cross the plasma membrane of cells lipofected with either the empty vector or the pCIneo-ORF2 recombinant vector (Fig. 6C,lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, the amount of radioactivity released from [3H]uridine-preloaded cells was much greater in pCIneo-ORF1-transformed cells than in cells lipofected with either pCineo or pCIneo-ORF2 (Fig. 6D). These data demonstrate that p10, but not p17, possesses permeabilizing activity in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It has been recently shown that p10 is a type I transmembrane protein that causes cell-cell fusion when transiently expressed in mammalian cells, and that deletion of a region of its extracellular NH2-terminal domain abrogates the fusogenic activity of p10, without affecting its ability to associate with cell membranes (15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As a first approach to assessing whether this “fusogenic sequence” is also involved in membrane permeabilization, a 5′-truncated version of the ORF1 (ORF1*) was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pMalC or the eukaryotic vector pCIneo. The resulting recombinant vectors pMalC-ORF1* and pCIneo-ORF1*, as well as their corresponding empty vectors and the recombinant vectors containing nontruncated ORF1 inserts, were then introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. The experiments carried out with bacterial cells are shown in Fig. 7. Both electrophoretic and immunoblot analysis of cell extracts demonstrated that MBP, MBP-p10, and MBP-p10* were all expressed in the corresponding transformed bacteria after IPTG induction (Fig. 7, A and B, lanes 2,6, and 10), but not in uninduced bacteria (lanes 1, 5, and 9). Fractionation of the extracts from induced bacteria (I) into supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions revealed that, whereas most MBP is associated with the soluble fraction (Fig. 7,A and B, compare lanes 3 and 4), both MBP-p10 and MBP-p10* segregated almost exclusively with the pelleted fraction (Fig. 7, A and B, compare lanes 7 and 11 with lanes 8 and 12), suggesting that they become associated with the bacterial membrane. Furthermore, IPTG induction of bacteria transformed with pMalC-ORF1 and with pMalC-ORF1*, but not with the empty plasmid pMalC, caused arrest of cell growth (Fig. 7C), suggesting that both p10 and p10* facilitate access of the intracellular lysozyme to the cell wall, by permeabilizing the inner membrane. Finally, both HB internalization and leakage of radioactivity from [3H]uridine-preloaded bacteria were observed in cells transformed with the two recombinant plasmids, but not in cells transformed with the empty plasmid pMalC (Fig. 7, D and E). From these results, we conclude that both p10 and p10* have the ability to permeabilize bacterial membranes. A similar conclusion was reached from the results of the experiments performed with eukaryotic cells (Fig. 8). Thus, whereas p17, p10, and p10*, but not ςC, segregate exclusively with the membrane fraction when transiently expressed in BSC-40 monkey cells (Fig. 8A), only p10 and p10* are able to promote both HB internalization and uridine release (Fig. 8, B and C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the fusogenic amino-terminal fragment of p10 is dispensable for membrane association and for membrane permeabilization. However, this fragment is indeed required for the fusogenic activity of p10, because its deletion abrogated the syncytia formation capacity of p10 (Fig. 8D), as reported previously (15Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The alteration of membrane permeability is a common feature of infection by cytolytic animal viruses, and such alterations not only exert profound effects on the metabolism of the infected cell, they also contribute to the development of the cytopathic effect. Early alterations of the membrane allow low molecular weight compounds as well as macromolecules to enter cells together with viral particles. Late membrane leakiness requires virus gene expression and allows the passage of ions and small molecules, but not macromolecules (reviewed in Ref. 1Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the first part of the present study, we examined host membrane alterations in r"

Escherichia coli employs two separate pathways that use NADPH to reduce cytosolic disulfides: the thioredoxin and the glutaredoxin systems. The thioredoxin system consists of thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxins 1 and 2 (Trx1 and Trx2). 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGrxglutaredoxinGRglutathione reductasePAPS3′-phosphoadenylsulfateArsCarsenate reductaseRRribonucleotide reductasePBSphosphate-buffered saline 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGrxglutaredoxinGRglutathione reductasePAPS3′-phosphoadenylsulfateArsCarsenate reductaseRRribonucleotide reductasePBSphosphate-buffered saline In the glutaredoxin system electrons are transferred from NADPH to glutathione reductase (GR), then to glutathione (GSH), and finally to glutaredoxins 1, 2, and 3 (Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3). Thioredoxins reduce their substrates by employing a dithiol mechanism provided by an active site of two redox-active cysteines separated by two other amino acids (e.g. C XXC). Glutaredoxins use the dithiol mechanism and an additional monothiol (e.g. active site CGFS) with GSH in solution serving as the other thiol (1Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Trx1 was discovered as the reductant of ribonucleotide reductase 1a (RR1a), the essential enzyme for the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides during E. coli aerobic growth. Trx1 can also reduce 3′-phosphoadenylsulfate (PAPS) reductase and methionine sulfoxide reductase. PAPS reductase is the key enzyme in the reduction of sulfate to sulfite, whereas methionine sulfoxide reductase reduces methionine sulfoxide to methionine (2Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The more recently discovered Trx2 can also reduce RR1a and PAPS reductase in vitro (3Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E.

Grx1 (encoded by grxA) can also reduce RR1a and PAPS reductase (6Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combined null mutants for trxA and grxA provided evidence for Grx2 (encoded by grxB) and Grx3 (encoded by grxC), which contributes to more than 80% of total GSH oxidoreductase activity using β-hydroxyetyl disulfide as substrate (7Åslund F.

In this study we have determined the actual protein levels of the two thioredoxins and the three glutaredoxins by ELISA. The aim was to obtain more information on the specific role of the five presently known cytosolic redoxins of E. coli.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this work was to further characterize the interactions and compensations of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems of E. coli. Measuring the relative amounts of the final effectors of the two systems, the two thioredoxins and the three glutaredoxins, could provide information on their overlapping functions. For example, the compensatory role of Grx1 as an alternative electron donor to RR1a has been suggested by measuring the levels of Grx1 in null mutants for trxA (12Miranda-Vizuete A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).General Redoxin LevelsThe striking finding is that Grx2, an atypical large glutaredoxin with structure similar to glutathione S-transferase (24Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Xia B. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), exists in the cell in amounts as high up as 1% of total protein. Grx3 was also found at relatively high levels (0.5%), as was Trx1 especially at the stationary phase (0.3%). The best characterized Grx1 comprises at best (300–600 ng/mg) one-tenth of the amount of Grx2 and Grx3 found under normal conditions; this is worth pointing out because Grx2 and Grx3 still have a relatively unknown function(s). The levels of the redoxins under normal growth suggest that Trx1 and Grx2 are stationary phase proteins, whereas Grx1 is a protein of the exponential phase.Response after Treatment with Hydrogen Peroxide, Mercaptoethanol, and ArsenateThe lack of Grx2 leads to an increase of carbonylated proteins after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (8Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The same effect, but to a much lesser extent, is noticed for Grx3 but not for Grx1 (8Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings suggest an antioxidant role for Grx2. In this work, the levels of all three glutaredoxins were elevated in catalase minus strains, suggesting an antioxidant role for all of them. However, the administration of peroxide resulted in a decrease in Grx2 (and Grx3) levels, whereas the addition of mercaptoethanol increased the amounts of both Grx2 and Grx3. What could be the explanation for this finding especially in view of the “normal” antioxidant response for Trx1, Trx2, and Grx1 after the addition of peroxide? The first explanation is that OxyR, which regulates the transcription of the other redoxins, does not control transcription of Grx2 and Grx3. There is no OxyR DNA binding consensus upstream of grxB or grxC. It could also be that Grx2 and Grx3 revert to oxidants during intense oxidative stress, making their presence deleterious for the cell. Grx1 for example can turn to a general oxidant of disulfides in null mutants for gortrxA(8Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition a protein may be more rapidly degraded when exposed to oxidative stress (33Fisher M.T. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1872-1880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the protein synthesis might be affected under oxidative conditions. The up-regulation of Grx2 and Grx3 after the addition of mercaptoethanol suggests that Grx2 and Grx3 can revert to oxidants/reductants according to their redox environment and that their transcription is not regulated by OxyR. The latter finding is in agreement with measurements of the global transcriptional response of E. coli genes after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (8Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,34Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar).Treatment with arsenate gave similar changes in the levels of Grx2 and Grx3, as did treatment with peroxide but only in the strain lacking arsenate reductase. No changes were found in the “wild type” strain. In view of the survival of grxAgrxBgrxC null mutants in media with arsenate (10Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that these dithiol glutaredoxins may not be the main in vivo reducers of arsenate reductase. The decrease of Grx2/Grx3 levels in the a rsC minus strain may reflect the turning of glutaredoxins to oxidants in the presence of arsenate.Levels of Redoxins in Different Genetic BackgroundsApart from great increases in the levels of Grx1 in trxAtrxC and trxAtrxBtrxC null mutants, the levels of all other redoxins were relatively stable in all genetic backgrounds examined. These data suggest that only Grx1 and Trx1 have strictly overlapping and specific functions, presumably the reduction of ribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase.Thymidine IncorporationMeasurements of thymidine incorporation in the DNA of the different mutants show that null mutants for grxA have the highest levels of labeled DNA, followed by trxAgrxA, and finally by trxA strains. Grx1 and Trx1 are not known to be involved directly in the synthesis of DNA, and null mutants in neither of these genes grow any faster than the wild type (8Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to justify the apparent higher levels of DNA synthesis. Therefore the data for the DNA labeling must be envisaged in terms of the ability of RR1a of the different strains to provide deoxyribonucleotides for the replication of DNA. In strains with lower deoxyribonucleotide pools, there is a limited supply of available deoxythymidine for incorporation into the DNA. As a consequence, the radioactive thymidine provided for the labeling of DNA will be preferentially incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and give higher counts. Hence, these results reflect the ability of RR1a to supply deoxyribonucleotides to DNA; the more the labeling, the lower the overall activity of RR1a. Under this approach Grx1 is likely to be the major supply of electrons to RR1a followed by Trx1. A similar conclusion could be drawn from the in vitro reactivity of Trx1 and Grx1 with RR1a. Grx1 has a 10-fold lower Kmwhen compared with Trx1 for the reduction of RR1a, whereas the Vmax for the two enzymes is very similar (35Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trx2, Grx2, and Grx3 do not seem to be involved (according to our data) in the reduction of RR1a. In vitro data show that Grx2 does not react directly with RR1a; Grx3 has 5% of the catalytic activity of Grx1 (7Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas Trx2 has slightly lower catalytic efficiency for the reduction of RR1a than Trx1 (3Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The increased levels of Grx1 at the exponential phase of growth are in accordance with the protein having a pivotal role in ribonucleotide reduction. Cells need more DNA precursors, i.e. higher RR1a activity at their log phase of growth than later when they enter stationary phase. The complete lack of the thioredoxin system (trxAtrxBtrxC minus strain) did not seem to affect the activity of RR1a, presumably because of the 30-fold elevation of Grx1 (Table IV). However, the lack of both Grx1 and Trx1 did not inhibit the activity of RR1a as much as the lack of Grx1 alone. This suggests that there must be another system to reduce ribonucleotides that is not based on Trx1 or Grx1. Trx2 could be such a potential redoxin. Trx2 levels were elevated 2–3-fold in the trxAgrxAgrxBgrxC null mutant. Another system that could partially compensate for RR1a is the RR1b system from the nrdHIEF operon (14Monje-Casas F. Jurado J. Prieto-Alamo M.J. Holmgren A. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18031-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This particular operon is highly transcribed in minimal media (14Monje-Casas F. Jurado J. Prieto-Alamo M.J. Holmgren A. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18031-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), where the thymidine incorporation measurements were performed.Glutathione Reductase ActivityExpression of GR is regulated at the exponential phase by OxyR (16Christman M.F. Morgan R.W. Jacobson F.S. Ames B.N. Cell. 1985; 41: 753-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and at stationary phase by ppGpp (31Becker-Hapak M. Eisenstark A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 134: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). Both factors are involved in the up-regulation of antioxidant proteins. Our findings show a simultaneous elevation of GR activity and the glutaredoxins (katEkatG and katEkatGtrxB null mutants) that would fit well with the need to reduce their increased glutathione disulfide occurring as a byproduct of increased glutaredoxin activity in the particular strains.Flow of Electrons between the Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin SystemsWe initiated these experiments wondering whether glutaredoxins would reduce thioredoxins and vice versa. This could be of importance in view of the relatively large amounts of Grx2, which is known not to reduce RR1a. Thioredoxin reductase alone or in the presence of thioredoxins was a very poor reductant of Grx1, whereas GSH and glutaredoxins gave very low rates for the reduction of oxidized Trx1 (data not shown). These data suggest that the two systems are “isolated,” i.e. the channeling of electrons is meant to be exclusive to each system. This puts further emphasis on the discovery of the electron acceptors of Grx2 and Grx3. Escherichia coli employs two separate pathways that use NADPH to reduce cytosolic disulfides: the thioredoxin and the glutaredoxin systems. The thioredoxin system consists of thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxins 1 and 2 (Trx1 and Trx2). 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGrxglutaredoxinGRglutathione reductasePAPS3′-phosphoadenylsulfateArsCarsenate reductaseRRribonucleotide reductasePBSphosphate-buffered saline 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGrxglutaredoxinGRglutathione reductasePAPS3′-phosphoadenylsulfateArsCarsenate reductaseRRribonucleotide reductasePBSphosphate-buffered saline In the glutaredoxin system electrons are transferred from NADPH to glutathione reductase (GR), then to glutathione (GSH), and finally to glutaredoxins 1, 2, and 3 (Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3). Thioredoxins reduce their substrates by employing a dithiol mechanism provided by an active site of two redox-active cysteines separated by two other amino acids (e.g. C XXC). Glutaredoxins use the dithiol mechanism and an additional monothiol (e.g. active site CGFS) with GSH in solution serving as the other thiol (1Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). thioredoxin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay glutaredoxin glutathione reductase 3′-phosphoadenylsulfate arsenate reductase ribonucleotide reductase phosphate-buffered saline thioredoxin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay glutaredoxin glutathione reductase 3′-phosphoadenylsulfate arsenate reductase ribonucleotide reductase phosphate-buffered saline Trx1 was discovered as the reductant of ribonucleotide reductase 1a (RR1a), the essential enzyme for the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides during E. coli aerobic growth. Trx1 can also reduce 3′-phosphoadenylsulfate (PAPS) reductase and methionine sulfoxide reductase. PAPS reductase is the key enzyme in the reduction of sulfate to sulfite, whereas methionine sulfoxide reductase reduces methionine sulfoxide to methionine (2Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The more recently discovered Trx2 can also reduce RR1a and PAPS reductase in vitro (3Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E.

Grx1 (encoded by grxA) can also reduce RR1a and PAPS reductase (6Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combined null mutants for trxA and grxA provided evidence for Grx2 (encoded by grxB) and Grx3 (encoded by grxC), which contributes to more than 80% of total GSH oxidoreductase activity using β-hydroxyetyl disulfide as substrate (7Åslund F.

https://openalex.org/W1966750012,"Androgen receptor (AR)-interacting protein 3 (ARIP3/PIASxα) is a coregulator capable of modulating transcriptional activity of various steroid receptors. We have characterized functional regions of ARIP3 and studied its interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1). We find that the potential zinc-binding domain is critical for ARIP3 to function as a coactivator; the deletion of amino acids 347–418 or the mutation of the conserved cysteines 385 and 388 to serines converts ARIP3 to a transcriptional repressor from AR-dependent minimal promoters and abolishes its ability to activate GR. By contrast, mutations in the two L XXLL motifs of ARIP3 have relatively minor effects on its ability to regulate AR or GR function. ARIP3 is able to interact with different regions of GRIP1, but the strongest interaction is detected with the C-terminal region (amino acids 1122–1462) of GRIP1. The interaction of ARIP3 with the latter GRIP1 domain or full-length GRIP1 and the ability of ARIP3 to cooperate with GRIP1 in the regulation of AR- or GR-dependent transcription are dependent on the ARIP3 zinc-binding region. We also find a strong synergism between GRIP1 and two other PIAS family members, Miz1 and PIAS1. Taken together, our results suggest that PIAS proteins and GRIP1 interact functionally in transcriptional regulation."

DNA damage in eukaryotic cells leads to arrest of the cell cycle and activation of the genes involved in DNA repair (1Weinert T. Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The DNA damage checkpoint pathway responsible for activation of DNA damage-inducible genes in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the focus of intensive research during the past decade (2Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). The emerging conservation between the DNA damage checkpoint pathway in yeast and humans promotes a better understanding of this vital process (3Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6135-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 4Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). One of the frequently used tools in the dissection of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway in S. cerevisiae has been the gene RNR3 (5Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This gene is induced 5–10-fold (6de la Torre Ruiz M.A. Lowndes N.F.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), in response to DNA damage. In addition, it is not essential, and the rnr3 null mutation has no phenotype under all studied conditions (5Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These properties of the RNR3 have been exploited in the identification of a number of important genes involved in the DNA damage checkpoint function such as CRT1, TUP1, SSN6, and DUN1 (9Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Genetics. 1992; 131: 851-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Huang M. Zhou Z.

On the basis of homology with the RNR1 gene encoding the large subunit of yeast ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), 1The abbreviations used are: RNRribonucleotide reductase4-NQO4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide it has been proposed that RNR3 encodes a second large subunit of the yeast RNR (5Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, it was demonstrated that overexpression of RNR3 could rescue rnr1 null mutants (5Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ribonucleotide reductase 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide Ribonucleotide reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in DNA precursor biosynthesis present in all living cells (13Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). All RNRs use free radical chemistry to reduce ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Based on the nature of the cofactor providing the free radical for the reaction, RNRs were divided into three classes (14Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Nearly all eukaryotes have an RNR belonging to class I in which the enzyme is thought to be an α2β2 heterotetramer. The homodimer α2 is referred to as the large subunit, and the homodimer β2 is referred to as the small subunit. Both subunits are required for activity. The small subunit contributes a tyrosyl free radical essential for catalysis. The large subunit contains one catalytic active site and two allosteric sites on each α polypeptide; the allosteric specificity site regulates the balance among the four dNTP pools, and the allosteric activity site regulates the total dNTP pool size by monitoring the dATP/ATP ratio (15Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When the dATP pool reaches a certain level, the RNR is down-regulated by dATP feedback inhibition. In addition to allosteric regulation, the activity of yeast RNR is controlled by binding of a protein inhibitor, Sml1, to the large RNR subunit (16Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 17Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36679-36683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Sml1-dependent mechanism is so far unique for the yeast RNR. During S phase and after DNA damage, decreased Sml1 levels result in derepression of the RNR activity (18Zhao X. Georgieva B. Chabes A. Domkin V. Ippel J.H. Schleucher J. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9076-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,19Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The decrease of Sml1 levels is caused by post-transcriptional regulation and requires Mec1/Rad53-dependent phosphorylation. Mec1 and Rad53 protein kinases are essential proteins and central players in DNA damage response in yeast (2Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Deletion of SML1 rescues the lethality of a mec1 or rad53 strain, and removal of Sml1 during the S phase defines the essential function of Mec1 and Rad53 proteins (19Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae RNR system consists of the following four RNR genes: RNR1 and RNR3, which encode the polypeptides of the large subunit, and RNR2 and RNR4, which encode the polypeptides of the small subunit (20Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Huang M. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Wang P.J. Chabes A. Casagrande R. Tian X.C. Thelander L. Huffaker T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6114-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The RNR genes are located on different chromosomes (V, IX, X, and VII, respectively), and expression of all four genes is induced by DNA damage (11Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated before that, in contrast to other class I RNRs the active form of the yeast small subunit is a ββ′ heterodimer containing Rnr2 and Rnr4 (23Chabes A. Domkin V. Larsson G. Liu A. Graslund A. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2474-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rnr4, thus far a unique variant of the small subunit polypeptide, does not form a tyrosyl radical; its role is to correctly fold and stabilize the radical-storing Rnr2. A nucleotide sequence comparison of RNR1 and RNR3 shows 80% identities and 90% similarities of the coding sequences. However, the expression patterns of RNR1 and RNR3 are completely different (5Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). RNR1 is essential for mitotic viability, and its transcription is cell cycle-regulated with maximal mRNA levels present during S phase. The RNR3 transcript is nearly absent during normal growth but appears after DNA damage. Thus, during normal growth the large subunit is an α2 homodimer containing only Rnr1. Although the transcriptional regulation of the RNR3 gene has been studied in great detail, the biochemical properties and the amount of the Rnr3 protein in a yeast cell after DNA damage are unknown; also unknown is the ratio between the Rnr1 and Rnr3 proteins. We wanted to understand the role of DNA damage-inducible Rnr3 in dNTP metabolism of yeast. In this paper we present an in vivo and in vitro characterization of the Rnr3 protein. After DNA damage, the levels of highly induced Rnr3 never reached more than one-tenth of the Rnr1 levels, which increased ∼2-fold. The Rnr3 protein showed less than 1% of the activity of the Rnr1 in an assay with the Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer. However, a strong synergism between Rnr1 and Rnr3 was observed (most clearly demonstrated in assays in which Rnr3 was allowed to form a complex with a catalytically inactive form of Rnr1). Interestingly, whereas the Rnr1-catalyzed CDP reduction was inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor dATP, the CDP reduction catalyzed by Rnr3 was stimulated by dATP. The reaction catalyzed by Rnr3 together with catalytically inactive Rnr1 showed an intermediate sensitivity to dATP inhibition, indicating cross-talk between the allosteric sites in Rnr1 and the catalytic site in Rnr3. Rnr1 and the His6-Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using the pET expression vector (Novagen) as described previously (23Chabes A. Domkin V. Larsson G. Liu A. Graslund A. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2474-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rnr1 was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and affinity chromatography on dATP-Sepharose as described (24Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The co-expressed His6-Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by chromatography on a Bioscale Q10 column (Bio-Rad) (23Chabes A. Domkin V. Larsson G. Liu A. Graslund A. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2474-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rnr3 was purified from the rnr1 deletion strain Y609 (25Desany B.A. Alcasabas A.A. Bachant J.B. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2956-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) (MAT a trp1–1 ura3–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 ade2–1 can1–100 Δrnr1::HIS3) containing a 2-μ plasmid with the RNR3 gene (Apr TRP1 2 μ GAP-RNR3) under a strong and constitutive glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Yeast cells were disrupted in a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK), and the rest of the purification was carried out as described for the bacterially expressed Rnr1. To construct the Rnr1-C428A, the pET RNR1 expression plasmid (23Chabes A. Domkin V. Larsson G. Liu A. Graslund A. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2474-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was mutagenized using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATC AAG TCA TCA AAC TTAGCC TGT GAA ATT GTT GAA TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA TTC AAC AAT TTC ACA GGC TAA GTT TGA TGA CTT GAT-3′. The correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Expression and purification of Rnr1-C428A were carried out as described for Rnr1 (24Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rnr1, Rnr1-C428A, Rnr3, and mixtures of these proteins were assayed in the presence of pure Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer as described (23Chabes A. Domkin V. Larsson G. Liu A. Graslund A. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2474-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sedimentation of Rnr1 or Rnr3 in the absence or presence of dTTP or ATP in a 5–20% linear gradient of sucrose was performed as described previously (23Chabes A. Domkin V. Larsson G. Liu A. Graslund A. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2474-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All gradients were calibrated by the addition of catalase (s20,w = 11.4 S). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were made against the peptides EKAAPIVDDEET(C) (Rnr1 from amino acid residues 852–863) and TETIKEDSDEKKC (Rnr3 from amino acid residues 850–862) by Sigma. The anti-Rnr1 antibodies did not cross-react with Rnr3 or vice versa (data not shown). The yeast strain W1588–4C (MAT a ade2–1 can1–100 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1) (the W303 background) was grown in YPDA at 30 °C. Treatment of yeast with 0.25 mg/liter 4-NQO was started at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. After a 3-h incubation with or without drug, 3.6 × 1010 cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm pepstatin, 0.6 mm leupeptin, and 2 mm benzamidine). The cells were then suspended in 20 ml of the same buffer and disrupted in a Bead-Beater. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30,000 ×g for 20 min followed by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h). The total amount of protein as determined by the Bradford assay was ∼74 mg. After electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel, immunoblotting was performed basically as described (26Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with the specific anti-Rnr1 or anti-Rnr3 antibodies. The immunocomplexes were detected by incubation with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase followed by visualization with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. To understand better the contribution of Rnr3 to ribonucleotide reduction, we estimated the levels of the Rnr1 and Rnr3 proteins in yeast before and after DNA damage using Western blotting with specific Rnr1 and Rnr3 antipeptide polyclonal antibodies. The expression of RNR genes was induced by a 3-h incubation of a yeast culture in YPDA medium containing 4-NQO, and then samples were withdrawn for analyses and compared with samples from a yeast culture grown without drug. As seen in Fig. 1, the level of Rnr1 increased from about 50 to 100 ng of protein per 37 μg of yeast protein extract (equivalent to 1.8 × 107 cells). There was a pronounced increase also in the level of Rnr3, from undetectable levels in the uninduced cells to about 10 ng of protein per 37 μg of yeast protein extract in induced cells. Rnr3 was purified from the rnr1 deletion strain Y609 (25Desany B.A. Alcasabas A.A. Bachant J.B. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2956-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) containing a 2-μ plasmid with the RNR3 gene under a strong and constitutive glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Using this strain ensured a complete absence of endogenous Rnr1 contamination and resulted in 1.5 mg of highly purified Rnr3 per liter of yeast culture (Fig. 2). The activity of Rnr3 in the presence of an excess of Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer was highly dependent on the concentration of Rnr3 (Fig. 3). However, the specific activity of the Rnr3 even when assayed at 0.5 mg/ml, which is a very high concentration for an RNR assay, was only approximately 1% of the specific activity of Rnr1 assayed at a similar concentration (data not shown). The addition of increasing amounts of Rnr3 to a series of RNR assay mixtures all containing a constant amount of Rnr1 and an excess of Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer demonstrated a clear synergism between Rnr1 and Rnr3 in ribonucleotide reduction (Fig. 3). Total RNR activity in these assays was up to 58% higher than the sum of the Rnr1 and Rnr3 activities assayed separately. This synergistic effect was most pronounced in assay mixtures with a very low concentration of Rnr1 and a high concentration of Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer.Figure 3Catalytic activity of Rnr3 assayed in the presence of an excess of Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer before and after the addition of a constant amount of Rnr1. Increasing amounts of Rnr3 were assayed for 30 min at 30° C in the presence of 5 mmATP and 8.4 μg of Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer (▪—▪). The experiment was repeated as before, but 0.3 μg of Rnr1 was added to each reaction mixture (▴—▴). The middle curve (▪ − − ▪) represents the calculated sum of activities of 0.3 μg of Rnr1 and increasing amounts of Rnr3 assayed separately.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results presented above suggest that in a complex with Rnr1, Rnr3 has a much higher specific activity than when it is assayed alone. To address the contribution of the Rnr1/Rnr3 interaction in the stimulation of Rnr3 activity and exclude the contribution of Rnr1 activity, we decided to create and use a catalytically inactive form of Rnr1. We replaced cysteine 428 (corresponding to the catalytically essential cysteine 439 in the E. coli R1 protein (27Åberg A. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Larsson A. Ormö M. Ahgren A. Sjöberg B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12249-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) with an alanine in the recombinant Rnr1 (Fig. 1). Rnr1-C428A was totally inactive when assayed in the presence of Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer (Fig. 4A); however, the addition of increasing amounts of the inactive Rnr1-C428A to assay mixtures containing a constant amount of Rnr3 and Rnr2p/Rnr4 heterodimer resulted in a pronounced stimulation of RNR activity (Fig. 4). Maximal Rnr3 specific activity was obtained when the ratio of Rnr1-C428A/Rnr3 was approximately 7:1, which gave a value of 11 nmol/min per mg of Rnr3. This specific activity is approximately 5% of the maximal specific activity of wild-type Rnr1. Surprisingly, no inhibition of Rnr3 activity was observed with higher amounts of Rnr1-C428A. These data show that the presence of catalytically inactive Rnr1-C428A increases the endogenous activity of the Rnr3 by at least 10-fold. We therefore propose that Rnr3 alone has a poor ability to form an active complex with the Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer. Interestingly, the addition of increasing amounts of Rnr1-C428A to Rnr1-containing assay mixtures resulted in a slight stimulation of RNR activity and almost no inhibition at up to 34× molar excess of Rnr1-C428A over Rnr1 (Fig. 4B). We compared the temperature optimum for reactions catalyzed by Rnr1, Rnr3, or the Rnr1-C428A/Rnr3 mixture in the presence of the small subunit (Fig. 5). There was a distinct difference between the various RNR complexes with the Rnr1 showing the highest temperature optimum followed by the Rnr1-C428A/Rnr3 complex and the Rnr3. These data support the notion that the Rnr1-containing RNR complex is the most stable followed in stability by the Rnr1-C428A/Rnr3- and Rnr3-containing RNRs. It was shown earlier for the mouse RNR complex that allosteric effectors strongly influence subunit interaction (28Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reduction of CDP by yeast RNR containing the Rnr1 was stimulated by ATP with maximal activity around 5 mm ATP (Fig. 6A). The optimal ATP concentration for CDP reduction catalyzed by RNR containing Rnr3 was 15–20 mm, whereas the optimal ATP concentration for RNR containing Rnr3/Rnr1-C428A was the same as observed for Rnr1 alone (i.e. approximately 5 mm (Fig. 6A)). The Rnr1-catalyzed CDP reduction in the presence of 5 mmATP was inhibited by dATP at concentrations above 50 μm, whereas the CDP reduction catalyzed by Rnr3 was stimulated by dATP instead. Interestingly, the CDP reduction catalyzed by Rnr3/Rnr1-C428A showed dATP inhibition typical for Rnr1 despite the fact that the catalytic site resides on Rnr3 (Fig. 6B). This result, together with the ATP optima, indicates cross-talk between the allosteric activity site on the inactive Rnr1 and the catalytic site on Rnr3. When analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, Rnr1 without allosteric effectors sedimented as a mixture of monomers and dimers (Fig. 7A). Upon addition of dTTP, the sedimentation pattern was dominated instead by dimers and tetramers. Finally, in the presence of ATP most Rnr1 sedimented as tetramers with a pronounced tailing. In contrast, Rnr3 alone sedimented as monomers, and the addition of dTTP induced only a minor dimer peak. However, the most pronounced difference was observed in the presence of ATP where Rnr3 sedimented as an unresolved mixture of monomers and dimers with no significant tetramer peak (Fig. 7B). The low levels of Rnr3 protein in yeast cells even after DNA damage induction, in combination with the very low catalytic activity of a complex between Rnr3 and the Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer, explain why an rnr3 null mutant has no phenotype under laboratory conditions. Is Rnr3 a redundant protein that has no function in yeast metabolism? Why is it induced strongly in response to DNA damage? The complex between Rnr3 and Rnr1 has a much higher catalytic activity than Rnr3 alone. The presence of such a complex in vivo is observed in a two-hybrid assay (18Zhao X. Georgieva B. Chabes A. Domkin V. Ippel J.H. Schleucher J. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9076-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If the levels of Rnr1 are limiting for ribonucleotide reduction during DNA damage, the expression of Rnr3 may increase total RNR activity. Furthermore, the resistance of Rnr3-catalyzed ribonucleotide reduction to dATP inhibition might confer a selective advantage for yeast growing in natural ecological niches under permanent DNA-damaging conditions. Why is the catalytic activity of RNR containing Rnr3 so much lower than the activity of RNR-containing Rnr1, and why is the activity improved in the presence of inactive Rnr1? Studies on mouse RNR have shown that to form a complex with the small subunit, the polypeptide chains of the large subunit have to dimerize (28Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The highly concentration-dependent catalytic activity shown by Rnr3 in contrast to Rnr1 (23Chabes A. Domkin V. Larsson G. Liu A. Graslund A. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2474-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the lower temperature stability of an Rnr3-containing RNR compared with an Rnr1-containing enzyme indicate that Rnr3 is less efficient in forming a stable active complex with the Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer. This may be either because Rnr3 does not readily dimerize or because the Rnr3 dimer has a low affinity to the Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer. An Rnr3/Rnr1 complex makes a more stable RNR than Rnr3 alone. The sucrose gradient centrifugation experiments indicate that Rnr3 is less efficient in forming oligomeric structures than Rnr1, and we believe that this weakness is a major reason for the low catalytic activity of Rnr3 compared with Rnr1. Addition of increasing amounts of inactive Rnr1-C428A to an assay mixture containing Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer and Rnr3 or Rnr1, to our surprise, did not result in inhibition as a consequence of competition for the small subunit. Such an inhibition is clearly observed when inactive E. coli R1-C439A protein is added to an assay mixture containing bacterial R1 and R2 proteins (29Mao S.S. Yu G.X. Chalfoun D. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9752-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Obviously, the inactive Rnr1-C428A protein is not very effective in competing with active Rnr1 dimers for the Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer. A difference between the yeast and bacterial RNR systems is that in yeast, maximally only 50% of the complexes between an Rnr1/Rnr1-C428A dimer and the Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimer are active because Rnr4 completely lacks the catalytically essential tyrosyl radical. The initial stimulation of the catalytic activity observed when inactive Rnr1-C428A was added to Rnr1-containing RNR suggests that there is a preferential formation of enzyme complexes in which active Rnr1 is binding to the catalytically active, tyrosyl radical-containing Rnr2, while inactive Rnr1-C428A is binding to the catalytically inactive Rnr4 in the Rnr2/Rnr4 heterodimers. The mechanism for this apparent active site-dependent orientation is not known. The inability of the inactive Rnr1-C428A to compete efficiently for the small subunit may be explained by the same mechanism. Stimulation of the Rnr3-catalyzed CDP reduction by dATP indicates that Rnr3 lacks a functional allosteric activity site. This behavior is similar to that of the mouse R1 D57N protein with a mutation in the allosteric activity site (15Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, similar to ATP, dATP may only bind to the allosteric specificity site where both nucleotides induce pyrimidine nucleotide specificity. The lack of a functional allosteric activity site may explain the inefficient binding of Rnr3 to the small subunit because effector binding increases affinity between the large and small subunits in mouse RNR (28Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A low affinity for nucleotide effector binding to Rnr3 is apparent from the ATP stimulation curve in Fig. 6A where the Rnr3-catalyzed reduction shows an S-shaped activity curve with increasing ATP concentrations, and Rnr1 and Rnr3/Rnr1-C428A show hyperbolic curves. A low Rnr3 affinity for effector nucleotides also explains the high concentrations of ATP/dATP required for maximal activity and the rather limited effect of ATP on the oligomerization of Rnr3 as compared with Rnr1. The unexpected observation that the allosteric regulation of Rnr3/Rnr1-C428A-containing RNR is very similar to the allosteric regulation of Rnr1-containing RNR (but not to Rnr3-containing RNR) strongly indicates that the allosteric activity site present in the catalytically inactive Rnr1-C428A cross-talks with the catalytic site in Rnr3. Such a cross-talk between two polypeptide chains of the large subunit of RNR has been suggested earlier but never before demonstrated in direct experiments. Binding of dATP to the allosteric activity site of Rnr1-C428A must signal to the catalytic site of Rnr3 through conformational changes in the two polypeptide chains.

https://openalex.org/W2041473308,"Fluorescence is a powerful biophysical tool for the analysis of the structure and dynamics of proteins. Here, we have developed two series of new fluorescent probes of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor, representing structurally related peptide agonists and antagonists. Each ligand had one of three distinct fluorophores (Alexa488, nitrobenzoxadiazolyl, or acrylodan) incorporated in analogous positions at the amino terminus just outside the hormone's pharmacophore. All of the probes bound to the CCK receptor specifically and with high affinity, and intracellular calcium signaling studies showed the chemically modified peptides to be fully biologically active. Quenching by iodide and measurement of fluorescence spectra, anisotropy, and lifetimes were used to characterize the response of the fluorescence of the probe in the peptide-receptor complex for agonists and antagonists. All three fluorescence indicators provided the same insights into differences in the environment of the same indicator in the analogous position for agonist and antagonist peptides bound to the CCK receptor. Each agonist had its fluorescence quenched more easily and showed lower anisotropy (higher mobility of the probe) and shorter lifetime than the analogous antagonist. Treatment of agonist-occupied receptors with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue shifted the receptor into its inactive low affinity state and increased probe fluorescence lifetimes toward values observed with antagonist probes. These data are consistent with a molecular conformational change associated with receptor activation that causes the amino terminus of the ligand (situated above transmembrane segment six) to move away from its somewhat protected environment and toward the aqueous milieu.

Cell surface receptors present on essentially every excitable cell of the body are important targets for pharmacotherapy. A detailed understanding of the structure of these molecules and the molecular basis of their activation should contribute to the rational design and refinement of ligands for these receptors. Receptor-bound, environmentally sensitive fluorescent reporters can provide information regarding ligand-binding domains (1Turcatti G. Vogel H. Chollet A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this work, we utilize this approach to gain insight into agonist- and antagonist-binding domains of the type A cholecystokinin (CCK) 1The abbreviations used are: CCKcholecystokininHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyNBD7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-ylacrylodan6-acryloyl 2-dimethylaminonapthaleneCCKRtype A cholecystokinin receptorCHOChinese hamster ovaryKRHKrebs-Ringers-HEPES mediumACAaminocaproic acidd-Trp-OPEGly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl esterFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylGppNHpguanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate trisodium salt receptor, a physiologically important member of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors. cholecystokinin high performance liquid chromatography 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl 6-acryloyl 2-dimethylaminonapthalene type A cholecystokinin receptor Chinese hamster ovary Krebs-Ringers-HEPES medium aminocaproic acid Gly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl ester N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate trisodium salt The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors represents the largest group of membrane receptors. They are remarkable for the diversity in structure of the natural agonist ligands that can activate them and initiate intracellular signaling cascades. These range in size from small photons and odorants to peptides, proteins, and even large viral particles. Tertiary structure determination by x-ray crystallography has provided the most incisive insight into the structure of superfamily members, which bind small ligands in the intramembranous helical bundle domain (2Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.Le. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5037) Google Scholar). As the ligands get larger, receptor domains involved in binding tend to be located on the extramembranous portion of the receptor, i.e. in the external tail and loop domains (3Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 4Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the molecular details of the binding of such ligands and mechanisms of receptor activation are still limited. We have been interested in the CCK receptor that is activated by a natural peptide hormone. This is a physiologically important receptor involved in regulating various processes related to nutrient homeostasis. Its activation stimulates gallbladder contraction, stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion, inhibits gastric emptying, and elicits satiety. Consistent with the theme described above, mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling studies have suggested the importance of loop and tail domains of this receptor for CCK binding (5Ji Z. Hadac E.M.

Although such studies provide useful insights for the docking of ligand to receptor to establish a conformational complex, they provide little information about the presumed conformational changes occurring upon receptor activation. In this report, we have used fluorescence to gain insight into differences between active and inactive conformations of the receptor. We have developed two series of fluorescent probes, built on structurally related peptide agonist and antagonist of the CCK receptor, placing three distinct fluorescence indicators in analogous positions. The fluorophore was positioned at the amino terminus of these probes, just outside of the pharmacophore of the ligand. This location of the probe was critical to accommodate the relatively bulky and structurally diverse fluorophores without disturbing agonist or antagonist action. We had previously shown that a photolabile moiety incorporated into an analogous position in peptide full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist of the CCK receptor allowed retention of biologic effect, and, moreover, the probes covalently labeled the same general domain of the receptor (cyanogen bromide fragment) (9Dong M.

Fluorescent probes similarly placed should provide more sensitive indicators of the microenvironment and mobility of this site, and allow comparisons of how this receptor's conformation adapts to agonist or antagonist binding, i.e. information on conformational features of the active and inactive states of this receptor. The results suggest that the fluorophore in this position in the probes sensed different environments depending, apparently, on the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the fluorophore and the nature of the ligand. Despite apparently occupying distinctive environments, the behavior of the probes showed consistent patterns for the active and inactive receptor states, respectively. We inferred that, upon receptor activation, the amino terminus of the peptide ligand was more exposed to the aqueous solvent and further removed from the lipid bilayer. Treatment with non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues that shift the agonist-occupied receptor into its inactive low affinity state (10Molero X. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 150-156PubMed Google Scholar) moved the amino terminus of the peptide ligand back into a more protected environment, analogous to the position it occupied in the antagonist peptide. Synthetic CCK-8 was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Fura-2AM, acrylodan, NBD-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, and Alexa488-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fetal clone 2 was from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Probe design was based on established structure-activity considerations for CCK analogues (11Bodanszky M. Natarajan S. Hahne W. Gardner J.D. J. Med. Chem. 1977; 20: 1047-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Bodanszky M. Tolle J.C. Gardner J.D. Walker M.D. Mutt V. Int. J. Pept. Protein.

We designed two series of peptides, representing agonists and antagonists of the CCK receptor, that incorporated three different fluorescent reporter groups in analogous positions, at the amino terminus, just outside of the hormone pharmacophore (Fig. 1). The agonist probes utilized Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] (14Pearson R.K. Powers S.P. Hadac E.M. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as template, whereas the antagonist probes utilized Gly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl ester (d-Trp-OPE) (15Roettger B.F. Ghanekar D. Rao R.V. Toledo C. Yingling J. Pinon D. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 357-362PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The fluorophores included Alexa488, acrylodan, and nitrobenzoxadiazolylaminocaproic acid (NBD-aca), with each possessing distinct chemical and fluorescence characteristics. These range from most hydrophobic (acrylodan) to most hydrophilic (Alexa). Each is sensitive to the polarity of its environment. Full structures include the following: Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] (Alexa-agonist), acrylodan-Cys-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] (acrylodan-agonist), NBD-aca-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] (NBD-agonist), Alexa488-Gly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl ester (Alexa-antagonist), acrylodan-Cys-Gly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl ester (acrylodan-antagonist), and NBDaca-Gly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl ester (NBDantagonist). In the synthesis, Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] and Gly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl ester were prepared as previously reported (14Pearson R.K. Powers S.P. Hadac E.M. Gaisano H. Miller L.J.

Both peptides have only a single reactive amino group. For each probe, the free amino group was derivatized in solution with N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of Alexa488, Fmoc-cysteine, or NBD-aminocaproic acid. For the acrylodan probes, the Fmoc-cysteine peptides were allowed to react with acrylodan and were deprotected. Each of the peptides was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC, and was characterized by mass spectrometry. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line that was engineered to express the rat type A CCK receptor (CHO-CCKR) was used as a source for receptor in this study (17Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This cell line has previously been fully characterized, establishing its expression of functional receptors that bind CCK and signal normally (17Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal clone 2 in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were passaged approximately two times per week. A particulate fraction enriched in plasma membranes was prepared from semi-confluent cells by mixing the cell suspension with 0.3m sucrose containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicating for 10 s at setting 7 with a Sonifier Cell Disrupter (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, NY). The sucrose concentration of the cell suspension was adjusted to 1.3 m, placed at the bottom of a tube, and overlayered with 0.3 m sucrose prior to centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The enriched membrane band at the sucrose interface was then harvested, diluted with ice-cold water, and pelleted by centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes were then re-suspended in Krebs-Ringers-HEPES (KRH) medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and were stored at −80 °C until use. Each probe was functionally characterized to determine its ability to bind to the CCK receptor and to stimulate intracellular signaling in CCK receptor-bearing cells. CCK receptor-binding activity was determined in a standard competition binding assay, using conditions that were previously established (17Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For this, enriched plasma membranes prepared from the CHO-CCKR cells (5–15 μg per tube) were mixed with 1–2 pm radioligand (the CCK-like agonist,125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33], was used in agonist binding assays, whereas its antagonist analogue,125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl ester, was used in antagonist binding assays) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled fluorescent peptides. The tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h to achieve steady-state binding. Bound radioligand was rapidly separated from free radioligand using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with receptor binding filtermats. Bound radioactivity was quantified with a gamma spectrometer. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (18Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) and were graphed using the non-linear least-squares curve-fitting routine in the Prism suite of programs by GraphPad (San Diego, CA). The ability of the probes to stimulate or inhibit CCK-stimulated signaling events was determined using a well-established assay of intracellular calcium concentration in Fura-2-loaded CHO-CCKR cells (19Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, ∼2 million receptor-bearing cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM in Ham's F-12 medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and stimulated with varied concentrations of the receptor probes at 37 °C, and fluorescence was quantified in a Perkin-Elmer Life Science LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer. Emission was determined at 520 nm after excitation at 340 and 380 nm, and calcium concentration was calculated from the ratio of the two intensities (20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The peak intracellular calcium concentration was utilized to determine the agonist concentration dependence of this biological response. For antagonists, after demonstrating the absence of intracellular calcium responses in cells that were directly stimulated with these compounds, their abilities to inhibit CCK-stimulated calcium responses were determined in mixing experiments. In these assays, a constant stimulatory concentration of CCK (0.1 nm) was used in conjunction with increasing concentrations of the potential antagonist probes in standard intracellular calcium assays. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorophotometer (SPEX industries, Edison, NJ) at 20 °C using a 1-ml quartz cuvette. Unless stated otherwise, fluorescence measurements were made using cell membrane preparations at ambient temperature. Solvents and buffers were degassed by bubbling nitrogen to prevent quenching of fluorescence by soluble oxygen. Under the conditions employed, fluorescence emission was also stable to photobleaching. For measurements of the fluorescence of receptor-bound probes, CCK receptors on CHO-CCKR cell membranes (50 μg) were allowed to bind fluorescent probe during incubation at room temperature for 20 min in KRH buffer, pH 7.4. This suspension was then cooled, and the membranes were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The ligand-bound membrane fraction was then washed with iced buffer, centrifuged, and resuspended in cold KRH buffer for fluorescence measurements. This was accomplished with the membranes held in suspension with continuous stirring. Fluorescence emission spectra were rapidly acquired from these samples to ensure maximal ligand occupation of the receptor. Analogous incubations and measurements were performed with cell membranes that had not been exposed to the fluorescent probes. The latter were used to determine the effects of light scattering and background on the measurements, with these data subtracted from the experimental sample spectra. Full fluorescence emission spectra were acquired for each of the probes free in aqueous solution and bound to the CCK receptor (in the absence or presence of 100-fold molar excess of non-fluorescent CCK as a competitor to saturate the receptor). For fluorescence collisional quenching, anisotropy, and lifetime studies, we utilized the following pairs of excitation and emission wavelengths (with 6.8-nm bandwidth): acrylodan, 380 and 455 nm; NBD, 470 and 542 nm; and Alexa488, 482 and 518 nm. Fluorescence quenching with the hydrophilic reagent, potassium iodide (KI), was performed as follows. Samples with receptor-bound fluorescent probe (50 μg of membrane protein per tube) were prepared as described above. Fluorescence was measured (using appropriate wavelengths noted above) after sequential additions to the cuvette of freshly prepared KI (1m stock in 10 mmNa2S2O3 to prevent air-induced oxidation of the iodide). The dilution and ionic strength effects on fluorescence were calibrated by adding 1 m potassium chloride (KCl) to the control sample and measuring the fluorescence. Corrected data were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation,Fo/F = 1 +KSV[Q], where Fo/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of iodide. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant, KSV, was determined from the slope of Fo/F as a function of the iodide concentration [I−]. This value was then utilized with the value of the average fluorescence lifetime (〈τ〉, as described below) to determine the bimolecular quenching constant Kq (Kq =Ksv/〈τ〉). Steady-state anisotropy measurements were recorded using an Edinburgh spectrofluorophotometer equipped with polarizers and a thermostatically regulated cuvette. Measurements were performed with constant optimal wavelengths for excitation and emission of each fluorophore that are noted above. Emission intensities were measured with excitation-side polarizer in the vertical position (V) and emission-side polarizer in the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) positions. Excitation wavelengths were 380 nm for acrylodan, 470 nm for NBD, and 482 nm for Alexa. In each situation, this was in a region of relative plateau at or near the maximum in the absorbance spectrum of the probe. The measurements were performed at 4 °C, 20 °C, and 37 °C. Anisotropy was calculated according to the equation, A = (IVV −GIVH)/(IVV + 2 GIVH), where IVV is the intensity measured with both the excitation-side and emission-side polarizers in the vertical positions, and IVH is the intensity measured with the excitation-side polarizer in the vertical position and the emission-side polarizer in the horizontal position. The value of G was calculated by the equation,G =IHH/IHV. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured by use of time-correlated single photon counting (21Ghiggino K.P. Lee A.G. Meech S.R. O'Connor D.V. Phillips D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5381-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Doust T.A. Phillips D. Porter G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Receptor-bound probes were analyzed in a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Samples were excited using a pulse-picked, frequency-doubled titanium-sapphire picosecond laser source (Coherent Mira 900, Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescence emission was collected through interference filters with 6.8-nm bandwidth. Measurements were taken at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was tunable (depending on the fluorophore to be analyzed) with a pulse width of ∼2 ps full-width half-maximum. Data were collected in 1080 channels, with a width of 10.05 ps/channel. Fluorescence intensity decay analysis was performed using the GLOBALS Unlimited program package (23Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Models of a single exponential and two discrete exponential lifetime components were utilized. The quality of fit was judged by the value of Chi-square (χ2) statistics. We assumed the fluorescence decay to be a sum of discrete exponentials, as in, I(t)=∑i αie−t/τiEquation 1 where I(t) is the intensity decay, τi is the decay time of the i th component, and αi is a weighting factor (amplitude) representing the contribution of the particular lifetime component to the fluorescence decay. The decay parameters were obtained using the non-linear least squares iterative fitting procedure based on the Marquardt algorithm. The fractional fluorescence of the i th component at wavelength λ(ƒi(λ)) was calculated from, fi(λ)=αi(λ)τi/∑αi(λ)τ1Equation 2 The mean average lifetime (〈τ〉) for the bi-exponential decays of fluorescence were calculated with, 〈τ〉=∑i fiτiEquation 3 where 〈τ〉 is the average lifetime, ƒi is the fraction of the i th decay component, and τi is the correspondent lifetime of the i th decay component. Data were analyzed using Student's t test for unpaired values. Significant differences were considered to be at the p < 0.05 level. Each of six fluorescent ligand probes were synthesized and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC. Their structures were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. These probes were also studied functionally. Each was found to bind to the CCK receptor saturably and specifically, with high affinity. Competition binding curves are shown in Fig. 2, with pharmacological binding parameters listed in Table I. The three fluorescence analogues of the agonist peptide, Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] (14Pearson R.K. Powers S.P. Hadac E.M. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were indeed shown to be able to stimulate full intracellular calcium responses in CCK receptor-bearing cells, not different from maximal responses to CCK itself (Fig 3 and Table I). The three fluorescent analogues of the antagonist peptide, Gly-[(d-Trp30,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]-phenylethyl ester (15Roettger B.F. Ghanekar D. Rao R.V. Toledo C. Yingling J. Pinon D. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 357-362PubMed Google Scholar), were not able to stimulate any increase in intracellular calcium in these cells using ligand concentrations as high as 1 μm.

The acrylodan probes were most sensitive to their environment, demonstrating the most marked spectral shifts. The maximum emission shifted from 470 nm while in solution to 454 nm for the bound agonist and 448 nm for the bound antagonist. Spectra were also acquired for the probes in a series of solvents having distinct polarities (aqueous, acetonitrile, Me2SO, and n-butanol). The Alexa fluorescence intensity decreased with decreasing polarity of the solvent, whereas the fluorescence intensities of the acrylodan and NBD increased in solvents of decreasing polarity (data not shown). This series of experiments was performed to further characterize the environment of each of the fluorophores at the amino terminus of ligands when bound to the CCK receptor. Fig. 5 shows Stern-Volmer plots for the quenching of the fluorescence of each of the receptor probes using the aqueous-phase reagent, potassium iodide. The bimolecular quenching constant values (Kq), shown in Table II, correlate with extent of solvent exposure. The nature of the fluorophore in this position within the ligand appears to be the major determinant of its environment, with the most hydrophilic indicator, Alexa, much more readily quenched by iodide than the more hydrophobic indicators. This suggests that that the position at the amino terminus of the probes, just outside of the pharmacophoric region, allows some mobility of these fluorophores without interfering with the binding or functional characteristics of the probes. The other consistent observation is the higher value of Kq for each of the fluorophores when part of a full agonist than that when in an analogous position in the antagonist. This is true for each of the three fluorophores, despite their individual differences in hydrophobicity and the impact of this on their microenvironment. This suggests that this position within the ligands moves into a less protected environment that is more amenable to iodide quenching upon receptor activation, than the analogous position in the antagonist occupying an inactive conformation of the receptor.

To elucidate the mechanism of the signaling, we previously isolated rrs mutants that were unable to respond to a secretory defect, and we cloned RRS1 encoding a nuclear protein that was required for ribosome biogenesis (Tsuno, A., Miyoshi, K., Tsujii, R., Miyakawa, T., and Mizuta, K. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol.20, 2066–2074). We identified duplicated genes encoding ribosomal protein L11, RPL11B as a wild-type allele complementing the rrs2 mutation, and RPL11A in two-hybrid screening using RRS1 as bait. Rpl11p was copurified with Rrs1p in immunoprecipitation analysis. Ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that Rrs1p associated fairly tightly with 60 S preribosomal subunits. These results suggest that signaling in response to a secretory defect requires the normal assembly of 60 S ribosomal subunits including Rrs1p and Rpl11p. A secretory defect leads to transcriptional repression of both ribosomal protein and rRNA genes in yeast. To elucidate the mechanism of the signaling, we previously isolated rrs mutants that were unable to respond to a secretory defect, and we cloned RRS1 encoding a nuclear protein that was required for ribosome biogenesis (Tsuno, A., Miyoshi, K., Tsujii, R., Miyakawa, T., and Mizuta, K.

Yeast ribosome consists of 4 rRNAs and 78 ribosomal proteins (RP). 1The abbreviations used are: RPribosomal proteinrrsregulator of ribosome synthesisSCsynthetic completeHAhemagglutinin The amounts of the components are coordinately regulated corresponding to cell growth mainly at the level of transcription (1Warner J.R.

Furthermore, ribosome synthesis appears to be coupled with membrane synthesis; a secretory defect causes specific and significant repression of transcription of both RP and rRNA genes (3Mizuta K.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the regulation in response to a secretory defect, we isolated mutants, named rrs (regulator of ribosomesynthesis), in which a secretory defect was unable to cause transcriptional repression of RP genes. RRS1, a previously unidentified gene, was cloned as the wild-type allele complementing one of the mutants. We demonstrated that Rrs1p was essential for growth, localized in the nucleus, and required for ribosome biogenesis, especially for 25 S rRNA maturation and 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggested that the mechanism of the signaling in response to a secretory defect was closely linked to normal regulation of ribosome biogenesis. ribosomal protein regulator of ribosome synthesis synthetic complete hemagglutinin By different approaches, other factors in the secretory signaling have been found. We demonstrated that the C-terminal region of Rap1p, a DNA-binding protein, was also essential for the transcriptional repression of both RP and rRNA genes due to a secretory defect (7Mizuta K. Tsujii R. Warner J.R. Nishiyama M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Miyoshi K. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3297-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rap1p is involved in both transcriptional activation of many genes including most RP genes and silencing such as the telomere position effect. It is unknown how Rap1p is responsible for the repression due to a secretory defect. Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that plasma-membrane stretch caused by the elevated internal turgor pressure is a trigger of the signaling (5Li Y. Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I.K. Warner J.R. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and that protein kinase C (Pkc1p) is required for the signaling (9Nierras C.R. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13235-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade of the cell integrity pathway was not required for this response, and components downstream of Pkc1p remain unknown. In this study, we cloned RPL11B, which encodes ribosomal protein L11 (Rpl11p), as a responsible gene for the rrs2 mutation. We also isolated RPL11A in yeast two-hybrid screening using RRS1 as bait. Rpl11p is encoded by the duplicated genes RPL11A (YPR102c) and RPL11B(YGR085c), formerly named RPL16B and RPL16A(10Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M.

The RPL11A gene is expressed at twice the level of RPL11B (10Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford J.L., Jr. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rpl11Ap and Rpl11Bp differ only at their third amino acid residues, alanine and threonine, respectively (14Leer R.J. Raamsdonk-Duin M.M. Mager W.H. Planta R.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8295-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and there is no functional distinction between the Rpl11Ap and Rpl11Bp (10Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford J.L., Jr. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rpl11p is necessary for the assembly of 60 S ribosomal subunits and is localized near the top surface of the central protuberance, where the 60 S subunit potentially contacts the 40 S subunit (16Tsay Y.-F. Shankweiler G. Lake J. Woolford J.L., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7579-7586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that disruption of either the RPL11A or RPL11B gene attenuates transcriptional repression of both RP and rRNA genes in response to a secretory defect. Rpl11p shows physical interaction with Rrs1p, which may have a central role for the signaling in response to a secretory defect. These results suggest that 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly machinery containing Rpl11p and Rrs1p is essential for the signaling. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Deletion-insertion mutations of RPL11A or RPL11B were constructed in diploids, W303 or KM007, as described by Rotenberg et al. (10Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford J.L., Jr. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YPD-rich medium, synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose (SC), or SC dropout medium depending on the plasmid markers (17Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed by a lithium acetate procedure (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A library consisting of partial Sau3A fragments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA inserted into a single-copy yeast vector YCp50 was generously provided by M. D. Rose (19Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar).Table IYeast strains used in this study Open table in a new tab Mutants were isolated as described previously (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, a plasmid (see Fig. 1 A) in which the HIS3 gene was driven by the promoter of the ribosomal protein gene RPL28 (formerly called CYH2) was transformed into a temperature-sensitive his3 sly1 strain, which is defective in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking (3Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cells are phenotypically His+ at 25 °C, but at 31 °C, just below the non-permissive temperature for sly1, they grow extremely slowly on SC lacking histidine (SC/−His) plates containing 3-aminotriazole because the HIS3 transcription is repressed. The cells were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate to a survival frequency of 25% and grown on SC/−His plates containing 3-aminotriazole at 31 °C. A mutant defective in the signaling pathway was expected to grow much faster than the parental strain. Of an estimated 8 × 104cells plated, 24 colonies that grew rapidly were picked up. Each mutant was tested for its ability to repress transcription of RP genes,RPL28 and RPL3 (formerly named TCM1), in response to a secretory defect. A mutant allele of the chromosomal gene was isolated by PCR. Total chromosomal DNA was isolated from wild-type and rrs2 mutant cells. DNA fragments including RPL11A or RPL11B were amplified by PCR using two sets of primers (5′-tggaagggaaggtgaaccaagaac and 5′-gtacaataacatagagtttcatcttgg, 5′-tacccttgaaagcccaacatatac and 5′-ttgatgttgtcactgactataccg) and cloned into the pGEM-T vector. The DNA sequence was determined by using two independent clones of respective genes. pBTM116-RRS1 (20Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was introduced into L40 cells (kindly provided by R. Sternglanz), a his3 strain carrying the lexA-HIS3 construct as a reporter gene. This strain was then transformed with the pACT-based S. cerevisiae cDNA library. After 3–7 days of incubation at 25 °C, His+ transformants were selected, and the DNA insert of pACT in the cells was characterized. The DNA fragments containing the RPL11A or RPL11B open reading frame were amplified by PCR using two sets of primers (5′-tttgaattcctgccaaagctcaaaaccctatgcg and 5′-tttctcgagttatttgtccaaaacatcagcatcg, 5′-tttgaattcctactaaagcccaaaaccctatgc and 5′-tttctcgagattatttatcgagcacatcagcg), and amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The digested fragments were introduced into pACTII to produce Gal4p activation domain-Rpl11Ap and -Rpl11Bp fusion proteins. Two plasmids for the production of lexA binding domain-fusion proteins and Gal4p activation domain-fusion proteins were cotransformed into L40 strain cells. Leu+ Trp+ transformants were selected, and serial dilutions of the cell cultures were stamped on SC/−Leu, Trp, and His plates containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole and incubated at 28 °C for 3 days. Yeast cells were grown in SC-selective media to a mid-log phase, collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold immunoprecipitate (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and resuspended in 100 μl of IP buffer. The cells were broken with glass beads by using a vortex mixer at 4 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged twice at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge rotor. The supernatants were incubated with the anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-Myc (Berkeley Antibody) monoclonal antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C and then precipitated by centrifugation. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with IP buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed separately with the anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies. Signals were visualized with the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as instructed by the manufacturer. Northern blot and [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analyses were carried out as described previously (3Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After the addition of cycloheximide at the concentration of 100 μg/ml followed by the addition of crushed ice, yeast cells were harvested and resuspended in complex stabilization buffer (CSB) (21Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) containing 300 mm sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Glass-bead lysates of the cells were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge rotor. Supernatants (500 μl; 20 A260 units) were overlaid on 2 ml of sucrose cushions (CSB containing 500 mm sucrose instead of sorbitol) and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. Ribosome pellets were resuspended with CSB containing cycloheximide and various concentrations of LiCl, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. Ribosome pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Yeast cells were grown in 2 liters of medium to mid-log phase and harvested immediately following the addition of cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) and crashed ice. The pellet was washed twice with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 50 μg of cycloheximide/ml, 200 μg of heparin/ml) and suspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mmNH4Ac, 15 mm MgAc2). After glass-bead lysis of yeast cells, the crude ribosome pellet was prepared by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 3 h in a Beckman 90 Ti rotor and resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer B. Aliquots of the suspension were overlaid on top of 12 ml of 8–45% (w/v) sucrose gradient made in buffer B and centrifuged for 3.5 h at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 40 Ti rotor. The gradients were monitored at 260 nm and fractionated. Fractions containing the 80 S monosomes were pooled and analyzed by the second sucrose density gradient centrifugation under the same conditions as the first centrifugation. For immunoblot analysis, proteins of each fraction were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, dried, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the signaling in response to a secretory defect, we obtained rrs(regulator of ribosome synthesis) mutants in which a secretory defect did not cause transcriptional repression of RP genes (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the reporter gene, shown in Fig. 1 A, was introduced into a his3 sly1 strain, a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking. Mutants were isolated on an SC/−His plate containing 3-aminotriazole at the semipermissive temperature of sly1. Previously, we analyzed rrs1 mutant and showed that RRS1 encoded a nuclear protein essential for 25 S rRNA maturation and 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, rrs2 was chosen for further analysis. In rrs2 sly1 cells, the transcriptional repression of RP genes was significantly attenuated when the cells were transferred to the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1 B). Genetic analysis showed that the mutation is recessive; when the mutant cells were crossed to parental sly1 cells of the opposite mating type, RP genes RPL28 and RPL3 were significantly repressed at the restrictive temperature (data not shown). To isolate a gene complementing the rrs2 mutation, we examined phenotypes of the rrs2 mutant cells and found that rrs2 mutant cells exhibited cycloheximide sensitivity. The cycloheximide sensitivity segregated 2:2 in tetrads from RRS2/rrs2 diploid cells, and every cycloheximide-sensitive clone in three sets of tetrads showed the signaling defect detected by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). By using cycloheximide-sensitive phenotype of rrs2, we succeeded in cloning the RRS2 gene as described below. The rrs2 cells were transformed with a library of yeast genomic DNA constructed in a centromere-based vector, YCp50 (19Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Of 1.3 × 104 Ura+transformants, 35 colonies could grow on a YPD plate containing 0.12 μg of cycloheximide/ml. In 11 of the 35 strains, the complementing activity was plasmid-linked. Restriction maps of the plasmid DNAs recovered from these transformants revealed that ten plasmids had an identical 3.8-kb insert (named pRT-1) and one plasmid had an 11.9-kb insert (named pRT-2). We determined a partial DNA sequence of the plasmids. To identify the region of pRT-1 required for complementation, three subclones were constructed, and their complementing activities for the cycloheximide-sensitivity of rrs2 were checked. The complementing activity was fully recovered in the plasmid containing RPL11B. Subcloning of pRT-2 revealed that RPL11A was responsible for the complementing activity. Northern analysis showed that the plasmids containing RPL11A or RPL11B also complemented the signaling defect of rrs2 (data not shown). To determine the mutated allele in the rrs2 mutant, the RPL11A and RPL11B genes were amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA prepared from the mutant cells as template. Sequence analysis revealed that RPL11B had only one nucleotide difference (a C-to-T transition) within codon 39, resulting in a stop codon, whereas RPL11A had no difference. As the rrs2 mutant has a nonsense mutation in RPL11B, we determined the effect of the rpl11a- and the rpl11b-null mutations (10Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford J.L., Jr. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) on the transcriptional repression of RP genes in response to a secretory defect. Both the rpl11a- and the rpl11b-null mutations attenuated the transcriptional repression of RP genes due to a secretory defect, which was caused by either addition of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of the secretory pathway (Fig. 2 A), or shifting sly1 cells to the restrictive temperature (Fig. 2 B). The signaling defect in the rpl11a-null mutant was more striking than that in the rpl11b-null mutant, probably reflecting that the RPL11A gene is expressed at twice the level of RPL11B (10Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford J.L., Jr. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the null mutations of RPS4A or RPS4B (22Synetos D. Dabeva M.D. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3008-3013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that encode a ribosomal protein of the small subunit had little effect on the response to a secretory defect (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that the attenuation of transcriptional repression of ribosomal protein genes is specific to a defect in large ribosomal subunits. As a secretory defect causes transcriptional repression of rDNA as well as RP genes (3Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we examined whether the rpl11 mutation had any effect on the transcriptional repression of rDNA. We monitored the synthesis and processing of rRNA by [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analysis since newly synthesized precursor rRNA is methylated immediately (23Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,24Chen-Schmeisser U. Garrett R.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 74: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, a secretory defect by shifting the sly1 cells to the restrictive temperature leads to strong repression of rDNA transcription (lanes 3 and 4), consistent with previous data (3Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in both the Δrpl11a and Δrpl11b strain cells, repression of rDNA transcription due to a secretory defect was significantly attenuated (lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12). These results indicate that Rpl11p depletion affects the signal transduction from a secretory defect to the repression of rDNA transcription as well as that of RP gene transcription. Interestingly,RPL11A was also cloned in two-hybrid screening by using RRS1 as bait. Rrs1p, an evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein, is required for pre-rRNA processing and proper assembly of ribosomal subunits in S. cerevisiae (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RRS1 was originally isolated as the gene responsible for the rrs1–1 mutation, which causes a defect in the secretory response. To identify proteins that physically interact with Rrs1p, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening on a yeast cDNA library using RRS1 as bait. Among the 21 cDNA clones isolated in this screen, one cDNA encoded most of the sequence of Rpl11Ap. As we reported previously, three clones contained EBP2 cDNA (20Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows two-hybrid interaction of Rrs1p with Rpl11p in yeast with a positive control of Rrs1p and Ebp2p. HIS3 reporter gene was activated in the presence of Gal4p activation domain-Rpl11Ap fusion protein and lexA binding domain-Rrs1p fusion protein. Rpl11Bp also showed two-hybrid interaction with Rrs1p. The results were reproducible, and the assay using lacZ reporter gene showed similar results (data not shown). The C-terminal truncated protein, rrs1–1, also showed two-hybrid interaction with Rpl11 (data not shown). To confirm the interaction between Rrs1p and Rpl11p, we constructed a yeast strain in which both RRS1 and RPL11A on the chromosome were disrupted and complemented with plasmids expressing HA-Rrs1p and Myc-Rpl11Ap. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction of Rrs1p with Rpl11Ap as shown in Fig. 3 B. Rrs1p has an important function in ribosome biogenesis, especially in the maturation of 25 S rRNA and assembly of 60 S ribosomal subunits (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As Rrs1p had two-hybrid interaction with Rpl11p, we examined whether Rrs1p associates with ribosomal particles. Ultracentrifugation was carried out using cell extract from the strain expressing HA-Rrs1p, and ribosome pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4, approximately a half-amount of HA-Rrs1p was detected in the ribosome fraction, and the other half was detected in a soluble fraction in buffer with low ionic strength. To learn the stability of the interaction of Rrs1p with ribosomes, the ribosome fraction was treated with various concentrations of LiCl. Approximately a half-amount of Rrs1p associated with ribosome even at 0.5 m LiCl, and most of Rrs1p dissociated from ribosomes in 1.0 m LiCl. This suggests that the interaction of Rrs1p with a ribosome is rather stable, although it appeared to be less stable as compared with that of ribosomal protein L3. Next, to determine the type of ribosome with which Rrs1p associates, we performed sucrose density gradient centrifugation followed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5). In the first density gradient, the centrifugation of crude ribosome, most of the strong signals for HA-Rrs1p were observed in the fractions corresponding to 60 S ribosomal subunits, and weak signals were found in the fractions corresponding to 80 S monosomes and polysomes (Fig. 5 B). To clarify whether HA-Rrs1p associates with the lower fractions, a pooled fraction from 80 S fractions of the first gradient was analyzed in the second sedimentation. No signal for HA-Rrs1p was detected (Fig. 5 C), indicating that Rrs1p associates with only fractions corresponding to 60 S subunits.Figure 5HA-Rrs1p cosediments with free 60 S ribosomal subunits.

Each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting. Ribosomal protein L3 was used as a marker of 60 S ribosomal subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, we isolated rrs mutants in which transcription of RP genes was not repressed in response to a secretory defect (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that RRS1, the wild-type allele responsible for the rrs1–1 mutation, had an important function in 25 S rRNA maturation and 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly when the secretory pathway functions normally (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we have cloned the duplicated genes encoding ribosomal protein L11 not only as functional genes complementing the rrs2 mutation that causes a defect in the secretory response but also in two-hybrid screening using RRS1 as bait. These results suggest that Rrs1p and Rpl11p have a function in the same signaling pathway in response to a secretory defect and that protein-protein interaction of the two proteins may be important in the signaling. The C-terminal truncated form of Rrs1p, rrs1–1p, shows two-hybrid interaction with Rpl11p (data not shown), suggesting that the N-terminal half of Rrs1p is required for the interaction with Rpl11p and that the signal is transduced through the C-terminal half of Rrs1p. In the same two-hybrid screening, we previously identified Ebp2p and demonstrated that Ebp2p had a similar role to Rrs1p in 25 S rRNA maturation and 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly (20Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We proposed that ribosome assembly machinery is responsive to the signaling, and in this study, we showed that the rpl11 mutation caused a defect in the signaling and that Rrs1p interacts with Rpl11p, strengthening our model. Amino acid sequence analysis and immunological analysis revealed that Escherichia coli L5, Bacillus stearothermophilusL5, and Halobacterium cutirubrum L19 are homologues of yeast Rpl11p (16Tsay Y.-F. Shankweiler G. Lake J. Woolford J.L., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7579-7586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These three homologues were shown to associate with 5 S rRNA (25Horne J.R. Erdmann V.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 119: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Smith N. Matheson A.T. Yaguchi M. Willick G.E. Nazar R.N. J.

Although it is not shown directly that yeast Rpl11p associates with 5 S rRNA, Rpl11p is localized at a position similar to that of its homologue L5 in E. coli ribosomes, near the top surface of the central protuberance of the 60 S subunit (10Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford J.L., Jr. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Tsay Y.-F. Shankweiler G. Lake J. Woolford J.L., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7579-7586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent analysis by docking of atomic models into a lower resolution cryo-electron microscopy map suggested that Rpl11p was involved in the formation of a bridge with the 40 S subunit via the interaction with Rps13p and that it also interacted with the 5 S rRNA-binding protein Rpl5p and the elbow of the P site-bound tRNA (28Spahn C.M.T. Beckmann R. Eswar N. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Blobel G. Frank J. Cell. 2001; 107: 373-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that approximately a half-amount of Rrs1p associates with ribosomal particles and that the binding is fairly tight. Rrs1p is localized mainly in the nucleolus and also in the nucleoplasm (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The nucleolus is the site of pre-rRNA synthesis, pre-rRNA processing, and ribosomal subunit assembly. Most ribosomal proteins bind pre-rRNA in the nucleolus, and pre-rRNA processing is tightly linked to ribosomal subunit assembly (29Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 30Kressler D. Linder P. de la Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Early associating ribosomal proteins bind35S-labeled pre-rRNA to form 90 S preribosome, from which 66 and 43 S preribosomal subunits containing the 27 and 20 S pre-rRNAs, respectively, are formed. The 66 S preribosomal subunit contains late associating ribosomal proteins, and cleavage of 27 S pre-rRNA to 25 S rRNA leads to the 60 S preribosomal subunit. Rrs1p is detected mainly in the 60 S ribosomal subunit fraction in sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis. Considering that Rrs1p localizes in the nucleus, this suggests that Rrs1p associates with the preribosomal particle. Although HA-tagged Rrs1p also appears to associate with a lower fraction corresponding 80 S monosomes in the first sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, the band disappears in the fraction in the second analysis. As 90 S preribosomal particles sediment at nearly the same fractions as 80 S monosomes, and the 60 S ribosomal subunit fraction contains 66 S preribosomal subunits, it seems that Rrs1p associates with 66 S and/or 60 S preribosomal subunits and associates little with the 90 S pre-ribosomal particle if any. As Rrs1p localizes throughout the nucleus, including the nucleolus, Rrs1p might have a role in the transport of large ribosomal subunits from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm as well as pre-rRNA processing/ribosomal subunit assembly. It has recently been reported that Noc proteins, Noc1, Noc2, and Noc3, are required for the maturation and intranuclear transport of preribosomes (31Milkereit P. Gadal O. Podtelejnikov A. Trumtel S. Gas N. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Mann M. Hurt E. Tschochner H. Cell. 2001; 105: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The role of Rrs1p on intranuclear transport is now under investigation. Furthermore, we have found a novel nucleolar protein that interacts with Rrs1p, 2D. Morita, K. Miyoshi, Y. Matsui, A. Toh-e, H. Shinkawa, T. Miyakawa, and K. Mizuta, unpublished data. suggesting that Rrs1p exists as a component of a large complex. We have presented here that Rrs1p and Rpl11p are essential for the secretory response, but the molecular mechanism of transcriptional repression of both rRNA and RP genes in response to a secretory defect remains to be elucidated. As depletion of Rps4p, a protein of the small ribosomal subunit, had little effect on the secretory response, it is unlikely that a decline of protein synthesis caused by the depletion of Rrs1p or Rpl11p canceled a secretory defect. We propose a model in which the signal from a secretory defect might be transmitted to the large ribosomal subunit assembly machinery including Rrs1p and Rpl11p. However, it is also possible that a decline of 60 S ribosomal subunits affects the signaling in response to a secretory defect. In this case, the yeast cells should sense a very small defect in ribosome synthesis because rpl11b-null mutation could cause a small defect in ribosome synthesis (10Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford J.L., Jr. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We cannot distinguish between these two possibilities at present because a defect in a component of the ribosomal subunit could affect the assembly of other components. In fact, qsr1–1 and qsr1–24 (32Thierry T Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Eisinger D.P. Dick F.A. Trumpower B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5136-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; kindly provided by B. L. Trumpower), both of which have mutations in RPL10, were also defective in the signaling due to a secretory response (data not shown). Although Rpl10p appears to assemble with a large ribosomal subunit at the last step in ribosome biogenesis, rpl10 mutations affect the earlier steps of pre-rRNA processing (34Gadal O. Strauβ D. Kessl J. Trumpower B.L. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we prefer the former model for three reasons. First, RPL11 was isolated in two independent screens. Second, Rrs1p appears to be a key protein in the signaling as the rrs1–1 allele leads to an extremely strong defect in the signaling (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Third, rrs1–1 cells still have the ability to repress ribosome synthesis by mild heat shock (6Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or nitrogen starvation. 3K. Miyoshi and K. Mizuta, unpublished data. It should be noted that the mechanism of the secretory response is different from that of mild heat shock or nitrogen starvation. According to our model, the mechanism of transcriptional repression in response to a secretory defect is tightly linked to the normal regulatory mechanism that maintains ribosome synthesis. It has recently been proposed that rRNA transcriptional machinery is closely linked to pre-rRNA processing machinery (35Fath S. Milkereit P. Podtelejnikov A.V. Bischler N. Schultz P. Bier M. Mann M. Tschochner H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This model supports our idea in which transcriptional repression of rRNA genes is mediated through ribosomal subunit assembly machinery, that is, pre-rRNA processing machinery. In addition, we have found that transcriptional repression of rRNA genes is an early event (8Miyoshi K. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3297-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), consistent with our model. We thank T. Miyakawa, E. Tsuchiya, and D. Hirata for valuable discussion, J. R.

As a component of cell surface glycoconjugates, Neu5Ac is pivotal to numerous cellular recognition and communication processes including host-parasite interactions. A prerequisite for the synthesis of sialylated glycoconjugates is the activation of Neu5Ac to cytidine-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac). The reaction is catalyzed by CMP-Neu5Ac-synthetase (syn), which, for unknown reasons, resides in the nucleus. Sequence analysis of the cloned murine CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase identified three clusters of basic amino acids (BC1–BC3) that might function as nuclear localization signals (NLS). In the present study chimeric protein and mutagenesis strategies were used to show that BC1 and BC2 are active NLS sequences when attached to the green fluorescent protein (enhanced GFP), but only BC2 is necessary and sufficient to mediate the nuclear import of CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase. Site-directed mutations identified the residues K198R XR to be essential for nuclear transport and Arg202 to be necessary to complete the transport process. Cytoplasmic forms of CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase generated by single site mutations in BC2 demonstrated that (i) enzyme activity is independent of nuclear localization, and (ii) Arg199 and Arg202 are involved in both nuclear transport and synthetase activity. Comparison of all known and predicted CMP-sialic acid synthetases reveals Arg202 and Gln203 as highly conserved in evolution and critically important for optimal synthetase activity but not for nuclear localization. Combined, the data demonstrate that nuclear transport and enzyme activity are independent functions that share some common amino acid requirements in CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase. 5-N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is the major sialic acid derivative found in animal cells.

In bacteria sialic acids are found as components of capsules and lipooligosaccharides and often are important virulence factors, mediating resistance to host defense mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 13Jann B.

For example, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (NmB), the major cause of meningitis outbreaks in the western hemisphere, expresses a capsular polysaccaride consisting of α2,8-linked sialic acid residues, exclusively. The polysialic acid (polySia) of the NmB capsule is identical to host expressed polySia, which represents a specific posttranslational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (for review, see Ref. 16Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).

Thus the CMP-sialic acid synthetases provide the first example for an evolutionary conservation from bacteria to vertebrates among the sialic acid metabolizing enzymes.The first vertebrate CMP-Neu5Ac-syn cDNA was isolated by complementation cloning in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant LEC29.Lec32, which due to the lec32 mutation does not contain an active CMP-Neu5Ac-syn. These cells cannot transfer the non-activated sugar onto glycoconjugates and therefore lack sialic acid and polySia on the cell surface. Expression cloning with polySia detection as an assay of complementation led to the isolation of a mouse CMP-Neu5Ac-syn cDNA (25Münster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Mühlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Analysis of the intracellular localization of the recombinant murine CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase confirmed earlier studies that showed the majority of CMP-Neu5Ac-syn activity to be localized in the nuclear compartment (for review, see Ref. 18Kean E.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This is in clear contrast to all other nucleotide sugar synthetases, which are restricted to the cytoplasm. The unusual localization of the CMP-Neu5Ac-syn has been a focus of scientific interest for more than 30 years but still remains an enigma (for review, see Refs. 18Kean E.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and25Münster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Mühlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).While small molecules and proteins are able to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion, the import of larger proteins through the nuclear pore complex is mediated by active transport. The nuclear import machinery is complex and various pathways are used simultaneously to achieve the import of many different substrates (for review, see Refs.27Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 28Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 29Yoneda Y.

Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). NLS motifs are non-cleaved signal sequences within a protein that do not fit a tight consensus motif. The so called classical or canonical NLS typically consists of one or more clusters of basic amino acids often preceded by a proline residue (for review, see Refs. 27Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu.

One of the best defined NLSs is located in the simian virus SV40 large T (SV40-T) antigen (P126KKKRKV; Ref. 33Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). In the murine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn three potential NLSs termed basic clusters (BCs) 1, 2, and 3 are present, and their involvement in nuclear transport has been proposed earlier (25Münster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Mühlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).In the present study, wild-type and mutant sequences of BC1, BC2, and BC3 were tested for their ability to transport eGFP chimeras and CMP-Neu5Ac-syn to the nuclear compartment. In addition, the enzymatic activity of the generated CMP-Neu5Ac-syn mutants was analyzed. The data provide clear evidence that (i) functional activity of CMP-Neu5Ac-syn is not dependent on nuclear localization, and (ii) some mutations that prevent nuclear localization also reduce or eliminate synthetase activity.DISCUSSIONIsolation of the murine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn cDNA and visualization of the epitope-tagged recombinant protein in mammalian cells (25Münster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Mühlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) corroborated earlier reports that CMP-Neu5Ac-syn is a nuclear protein in different vertebrate cells (for review, see Refs. 18Kean E.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar; 46). Translocation in the nucleus often depends on the existence of an NLS sequence, which in the case of canonical NLSs are short stretches of basic amino acids that mediate nuclear import of mature proteins. Apart from the well defined NLSs found in SV40 large T antigen and nucleoplasmin (33Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 47Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar), a variety of NLS have been identified (for review, see Refs. 27Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar; 31). Although no strictly conserved consensus sequence has been delineated so far, variations of the four-pattern motif K-K/R-X-K are available for data base searches (PSORTII; Refs. 39Horton P. Nakai K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1996; 4: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar, 40Horton P. Nakai K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar, and 48Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, the existence of a putative NLS must still be verified experimentally.Three NLS-like motifs previously identified in the primary sequence of the murine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn were investigated for function in this study (25Münster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Mühlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Initially the capability of each basic cluster to target eGFP into the cell nucleus was analyzed (Fig. 2). This technique has been employed successfully to study NLS sequences from other nuclear-localized proteins (e.g. Stat5b (49Herrington J. Rui L. Luo G., Yu- Lee L.Y. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5138-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), diacylglycerol kinase-ξ (50Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and Ring3 (42Guo N. Faller D.V. Denis G.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3085-3091PubMed Google Scholar)). Furthermore, the importance of individual basic clusters for the nuclear import of CMP-Neu5Ac-syn was tested with deletion mutants ΔBC1-ΔBC3 (Fig. 3).The most C-terminal basic cluster BC3 was unable to significantly alter the localization of eGFP (Fig. 2), and deletion of BC3 had no deleterious effect on nuclear import of murine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn (Fig. 3). Both findings demonstrate that BC3 is not a functional NLS. In addition, BC3 seems not to contain elements that are required for catalytic activity. The low expression levels of this mutant protein in transfection experiments, however, suggest that this amino acid stretch may be important for the folding and/or stability of the CMP- Neu5Ac-syn.The most N-terminal basic cluster BC1 is sufficient to direct eGFP to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 2), but it is not necessary for nuclear import of the parent protein under the experimental conditions used in this study (Fig. 3). It may be that BC1 supports nuclear transport physiologically, for example by improving the kinetics of the transport process. There are examples where an enhancement in nuclear transport is observed if two or more NLS are present in a given protein (51Richardson W.D. Roberts B.L. Smith A.E. Cell. 1986; 44: 77-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 52Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Alternatively, BC1 could be masked in the native CMP-Neu5Ac-syn by inter- or intramolecular interactions and thus not be accessible to transport factors (53Moreland R.B. Nam H.G. Hereford L.M. Fried H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6561-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions argue against this latter hypothesis and suggest BC1 to be a flexible hydrophilic region, most likely located at the surface of the protein. In line with this we found that the stability of a bacterial expressed recombinant CMP-Neu5Ac-syn is enhanced if 38 amino acids are deleted from the N terminus. This truncation, which includes BC1, does not affect the activity of the recombinant protein. 3A. K. Münster and R. Gerardy-Schahn, unpublished observation. So far, our data are not sufficient to elucidate the role of BC1 in the native protein.BC2 is sufficient to target eGFP to the nuclear compartment and, in addition, is the dominant NLS in murine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn. Deletion of the five amino acid residues that form BC2 (K198RPRR) was sufficient to retain the enzyme in the cytoplasm. Using site-directed mutagenesis the basic amino acids Lys198, Arg199, and Arg201 were shown to be essential for the formation of the functional NLS. Isolated replacement of these positions by alanine completely abolished nuclear transport (see Fig. 4, D–F). Arg202 is important for optimal NLS function. The effect on transport observed in the mutant R202A was small but clearly visible in repeated experiments (see Fig. 4 G). Pro200, despite being part of BC2, is not required for the formation of a functional NLS. Additional experiments are required to determine whether Pro200 is of importance for the spatial geometry of the NLS. At this point we are also unable to judge the importance of Pro196 (see BC2PA). Helix-breaking proline residues often precede an NLS and augment activity (for review, see Refs. 27Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar and 31Jans D.A. Hübner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Such an effect was not observed in this study, but may be of importance under physiological conditions. Finally, variations in the highly conserved C-terminal-flanking amino acid residues of BC2 (mutants Q203A and D204A) are irrelevant for the nuclear transport. Because neither the N- nor the C-terminal ends of BC2 are involved in nuclear transport of murine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn, the active NLS was determined to beK198R X R R. This motif fits well with the four-residue motif K-K/R-X-K used in data base searches (PSORT II; Refs. 39Horton P. Nakai K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1996; 4: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar and 40Horton P. Nakai K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar) and originally suggested by Chelsky (K-R/K-X-R/K; Ref. 48Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Interacting partners recognizing BC2 and the transport pathway for nuclear import of the protein remain to be elucidated.Expression of active murine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn in bacteria has already suggested that CMP-Neu5Ac-syn activity from animal cells is not dependent on nuclear localization (Ref. 25Münster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Mühlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and this paper). To determine connections between nuclear localization and synthetase activity, mutants generated in this study were tested for their ability to complement two CMP-Neu5Ac-syn-deficient mutants, CHO LEC29.Lec32 cells (36Potvin B. Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30415-30421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and E. coli EV5 (43Vimr E.R. Aaronson W. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1106-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity and protein expression were found to correlate directly in bacteria and mammalian cells for the wild-type and mutant CMP-Neu5Ac-syn. Importantly, activity in eukaryotic cells seems not to be dependent on nuclear localization, since the cytoplasmic mutants K198A and R201A restored polySia biosynthesis. Furthermore, the fact that Arg199 and Arg202 are involved in both nuclear transport and catalytic activity of CMP-Neu5Ac-syn suggests that a functional NLS is also required for optimal catalysis. BC2 may contain part of the active site of the enzyme or, perhaps more likely, is important for maintaining the structure of the active site. The results are supported by the comparison of various known CMP-Neu5Ac-syn sequences (Fig. 6). The alignment revealed no significant conservation for BC2 but identified Arg202 and Gln203 as highly conserved residues. This is in line with crystal structure data recently obtained for the NmB enzyme (45Mosimann S.C. Gilbert M. Dombroswki D., To, R. Wakarchuk W. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8190-8196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which show that Arg165 (corresponding to Arg202 in the murine enzyme) is part of the CMP-Neu5Ac binding pocket and of the dimerization domain. As expected from this central function, the exchange R165A completely abolished catalytic activity in the NmB enzyme. It is most likely that Arg202 has an identical function in the murine enzyme. It was, however, surprising to find that the negatively charged Glu162, also part of the Neu5Ac binding pocket in the NmB enzyme, corresponds to the positively charged Arg199 in the murine enzyme.Mutation of the second highly conserved residue, Gln203 in mouse and Gln166 in NmB, to alanine was followed by a drastically reduced functional activity (Figs. 5 and 7). According to the existing three-dimensional data this position does not participate in substrate binding but seems to be required for the quaternary organization of the protein (45Mosimann S.C. Gilbert M. Dombroswki D., To, R. Wakarchuk W. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8190-8196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A lack of quaternary organization in mutants may worsen the overall kinetics of their reactions thus leading to the decreased enzyme activity.Several suggestions have been made to explain the unusual subcellular localization of CMP-Neu5Ac-syn. (i) The nuclear environment may be a prerequisite for enzymatic activity. (ii) The CTP concentration may be higher in the cell nucleus. (iii) Production of CMP-Neu5Ac in the nucleus may protect the nucleotide sugar from subsequent modifications by cytoplasmic enzymes, such as the CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (54Shaw L. Schauer R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 55Malykh Y.N. Krisch B. Shaw L. Warner T.G. Sinicropi D. Smith R. Chang J. Schauer R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). (iv) CMP-Neu5Ac is an allosteric inhibitor of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/kinase. This enzyme, which is localized in the cytoplasm, initiates the synthesis of sialic acids. Sequestration of CMP-Neu5Ac may be necessary to prevent early inactivation of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/kinase. (v) CMP-Neu5Ac may possibly be required for sialyltransferases localized in the nucleus. Sialyltransferase activity associated with rat liver nuclei has been reported that may be critical for the regular function of various nuclear proteins, which never transit the Golgi apparatus (56Emig S. Schmalz D. Shakibaei M. Buchner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13787-13793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 57Richard M. Martin A. Louisot P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 64: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our data show that cytoplasmic forms of the murine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn are active in mammalian cells, thus nuclear localization cannot be a prerequisite for enzymatic activity and the CTP concentration in the cytoplasm is at least sufficient for the functionality of the enzyme. Moreover, trials to discriminate between cytosolic and nuclear CTP pools failed (58Pels R.W. Overdijk B. Van den Eijnden D.H. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Vionnet et al. (46Vionnet J. Concepcion N. Warner T. Zapata G. Hanover J. Vann W.F. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) demonstrated DNA- binding for the purified bovine CMP-Neu5Ac-syn. The data presented in this study, as well as earlier data describing the unusual localization of CMP-Neu5Ac-syn in the nuclear compartment, allow us to speculate that CMP-Neu5Ac-syn or its product may have a second cellular function. Initial experiments have been carried out in our laboratory toward understanding the physiological relevance of the nuclear localization, but at the cell culture level no noticeable differences were found between LEC29.Lec32 cells transfected with either nuclear or cytoplasmic forms of CMP-Neu5Ac-syn. We are currently investigating whether the ratio between N-acetyl- and N-glycolylneuraminic acid varies with the subcellular localization of the CMP-Neu5Ac-syn. Most important, a transgenic mouse model shall soon be available, in which cytoplasmic forms substitute endogenous CMP-Neu5Ac-syn. This model should provide a new basis for studies aimed at enlightening the functional role of CMP-Neu5Ac-syn in the cell nucleus. Sialic acids acids are a family of negatively charged, 9-carbon sugars that form terminal residues on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids and provide the bulk of the negative charge, which is characteristic for animal cell surfaces (for review, see Ref. 1Schauer R. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). More than 40 sialic acid derivatives have been identified in biological systems.

In eukaryotes, many proteins and polypeptides in the secretory pathway are first synthesized as precursors that are then activated by specific endoproteolytic cleavage in the late secretory pathway. The majority of such processing reactions are catalyzed by members of the Kex2/furin family of processing proteases, which belong to the subtilisin superfamily of serine proteases (1Steiner D.F.

Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Like all members of the subtilisin superfamily examined to date, processing enzymes of the Kex2/furin family require calcium ions for maximal activity (10Fuller R.S. Brake A. Thorner J. Proc. Natl.

Calcium is required for stable folding of mature subtilisin, and it is possible to generate thermostable forms of subtilisin by engineering additional calcium-binding sites (12Gallagher T. Bryan P.

Additionally, enzymes of the Kex2/furin family are sensitive to inhibition by heavy metals including Zn2+ (15Julius D. Brake A. Blair L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J.

However, allosteric interactions between these proteases and cations have not been reported, and potential interactions between monovalent cations and the enzymes of the Kex2/furin family have not been studied to date.

The processing proteases of the constitutive secretory pathway (Kex2 and furin) are thought to exhibit rate-limiting deacylation in cleavage of correct sequences (P1 Arg), whereas incorrect sequences (P1 Lys) result in a substantial defect in acylation such that it becomes rate-limiting (4Rockwell N.C.

The rate-limiting deacylation seen with Kex2 and furin is also in contrast to the more distantly related proteases of the subtilisin family, which display rate-limiting acylation and less stringent substrate specificity (28Philipp M. Bender M.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 51: 5-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,29Grøn H. Meldal M. Breddam K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6011-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The advantage conferred in vivo by the rate-limiting deacylation seen with Kex2 is not yet apparent. Such behavior reduces the concentration of free enzyme, thereby lowering the rate of cleavage of incorrect substrates, but it must also reduce the cleavage of correct substrates as well (23Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is possible that this behavior maintains the rate of incorrect cleavage below some toxic threshold, or it may serve as a means of maintaining a reserve pool of protease as a sequestered intermediate, because it is known that Kex2 is in excess in vivo (23Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, such a reserve population would only be advantageous if there were some means of mobilizing it, for example by a pH change in the processing compartment or by the binding of an allosteric effector. It is known that slightly acidic pH does not affect the pre-steady-state behavior of Kex2 (24Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38394-38399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), whereas a pH level of >8 results in rapid inactivation of the enzyme (19Brenner C. Bevan A. Fuller R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 152-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For there to be an effective reserve pool of Kex2 in vivo, it therefore seems plausible to propose that there should be some type of allosteric effector that is capable of modulating the pre-steady-state behavior of the enzyme. Through an adventitious observation, we discovered that Kex2 exhibits substantial activation by monovalent cations. We demonstrate that potassium ion can stimulate kcat for Kex2 cleavage of multiple substrates with an apparent affinity of ∼20 mm and maximal activity at 200–250 mm. Moreover, potassium ion is found to stimulate the homologous enzyme furin but inhibit the neuroendocrine homolog PC2. Cleavage of different substrates displays different responses for furin and Kex2, and potassium ion binding alters the pre-steady-state behavior of Kex2 by accelerating deacylation but slowing acylation. These results raise the possibility that processing proteases of the constitutive secretory pathway can be regulated by lumenal potassium ion concentrations in vivo.

We examined cleavage in the presence of potassium ion at multiple substrate concentrations in excess of KM and confirmed that the observed Vmax was independent of substrate concentration, indicating that the reaction was saturated. For Kex2, assays were carried out in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C as described previously (20Rockwell N.C. Wang G. Krafft G. Fuller R.S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) except that different concentrations of monovalent cations were added (0–1.6 m). Because all monovalent cations tested displayed at least some effect, differential effects of different ions at equal concentrations were compared to assess possible effects of changing total ionic strength. All assays were carried out for ≤10 min. Control reactions indicated that Kex2 was not as stable in the presence of potassium ion, possibly as a result of increased autoproteolysis (data not shown), but reactions were linear for >10 min, indicating that end point assays of ≤10 min would be unaffected by a loss of activity or by substrate depletion. Furin and PC2 assays were carried out as for Kex2 using previously described conditions (26Krysan D.J. Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23229-23234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Again, total ionic strength was not kept constant. Reaction times were ≤10 min, and control reactions indicated that both enzymes were stable in the presence of potassium on this time scale, as was the case with Kex2. For initial burst measurements with amide substrates, Kex2 protease was reacted with substrate at 21 °C in a Kintek RQF-3 rapid quenched flow mixer as described previously (21Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with 0.2 m KCl added to both enzyme and substrate syringes as appropriate. For single-turnover reactions, 1.5–7.5 μm Kex2 protease was reacted with 0.5–5.0 μm d3 -Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA in the rapid quenched flow mixer; again, potassium ion was added to both enzyme and substrate where it was present. Formation of free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin followed a single exponential (Equation 1), where S0 is the initial substrate concentration,t is time, and kapp is the observed first-order rate constant. Product=S0(1−e−kappt)Equation 1 Burst titration of Kex2 with the ester substrate Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCE was carried out exactly as described (27Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Fuller R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) except that enzyme was prepared in 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5m KCl. The substrate was prepared in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at a concentration of 560 μm. The final potassium ion concentration was 0.25 m. Re-equilibration of potassium ion is predicted to be rapid on the millisecond time scale accessible by rapid quench. For Kex2 and furin cleavage of good substrates, examining k catobs as a function of monovalent cation concentration showed stimulation at low concentrations and inhibition at higher concentrations. These data could not be fitted by a two-state binding model, nor were they well described by changes in dielectric screening, which is not a bimodal function. This suggested direct interaction with at least a three-state model, with stimulation caused by binding a high affinity site and inhibition caused by binding at least one low affinity site (where M+ is any monovalent cation). E ↔K1EM+ ↔K2E2M+ SCHEME 1Here, K1 = ([E][M+])/[EM+ ] and K2 = ([EM+ ][M+])/[E2M+ ], and the total enzyme concentration (E0) must obey [E0] = [E] + [EM+ ] + [E2M+ ] because of conservation of enzyme. Under saturating substrate,k catobs should simply reflect the fraction of total enzyme in each of the three states, obeying the following equation. kcatobs=kcat([E]/[E0])+kcatM+([EM+]/[E0])+kcat2M+([E2M+]/[E0])Equation 2 To simplify this further, one can substitute the definitions of the binding constants K1 and K2 and factor out the common E0 term to derive Equation 3. kcatobs=1[E0]kcat[E]+kcatM+K1[E][M+]+kcat2M+K2[EM+][M+]Equation 3 The process of substitution and factoring can be repeated to give the contributions from all three states in terms of the unbound enzyme population [E]. kcatobs=[E][E0]kcat+kcatM+K1[M+]+kcat2M+K1K2[M+ ]2Equation 4 Similarly, the definitions of K1 and K2 may be used with conservation of enzyme to define the ratio [E]/[E0] in terms of monovalent cation concentration and the affinity constants K1 and K2. [E][E0]=11+[M+]K1+[M+ ]2K1K2Equation 5 Equation 3 may be combined with Equation 5 to give Equation 6, which describes the behavior of k catobs in terms of the binding constants K1 and K2, the rate constants for each state, and the concentration of monovalent cation. kcatobs=kcat+kcatM+K1[M+]+kcat2M+K1K2[M+ ]21+[M+]K1+[M+ ]2K1K2Equation 6 Equation 6 can be simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by the quantity K1 K2 to yield Equation7. kcatobs=kcatK1K2+kcatM+K2[M+]+kcat2M+[M+ ]2K1K2+K2[M+]+[M+ ]2Equation 7 In the case of our data sets, we find no evidence that the postulated multiply bound species E2M+ retained activity, so we were able to simplify Equation 7 to yield Equation 8, which was used for nonlinear regression. kcatobs=kcatK1K2+kcatM+K2[M+]K1K2+K2[M+]+[M+ ]2Equation 8 For certain cases, data at high ion concentrations were not well fit by this model. In these cases, inhibition at high concentrations was better described by a model in which two ions were responsible for the inhibitory limb of the observed dependence. A similar treatment could be used to derive Equation 9, which was used for regression analysis. kcatobs=kcatK1K2K3+kcatM+K2K3[M+]K1K2K3+K2K3[M+]+K3[M+ ]2+[M+ ]3Equation 9 This model was used for analyzing the response of Kex2 cleavage to added Li+, NH 4+, and NaBr. In the case of NaBr response, the predicted values of affinity (K1) and maximal response (k catM+) obtained with NaCl were used with this model to deconvolute the effects of the bromide anion. For cleavage of poor substrates by Kex2 and furin, as well as for PC2 cleavage of all substrates tested, titration of potassium ion resulted in inhibition with no apparent stimulation. This behavior could be described by a simple two-state model and was fit by Equation10. kcatobs=kcatK1+kcatM+[M+]K1+[M+]Equation 10 For all ions except Me4N+, these equations gave fits with r 2 > 0.94 and affinity constants for the high affinity site with errors of ±50% or better (for Kex2 binding of potassium ion error was ±20%). The errors for the binding of additional ions or for predicted maximal stimulation were much larger because these values were poorly determined in our data sets. Errors for Me4N+ were larger, and regression analysis for this ion was much poorer (r2 = 0.86) because of the very small changes observed with this ion, resulting in poor signal-to-noise for nonlinear regression. In all cases, fits of relative values of k catobs were obtained by setting the value of kcat (without any monovalent cation) to 1. This analysis assumes ordered cation binding, with the low affinity (inhibitory) site becoming occupied only after the high affinity (stimulatory) site has been filled. It is not possible to exclude random-binding models on the basis of current data; indeed, the observed inhibition at high ion concentrations may well be an indirect effect and not caused by binding of further monovalent cation. In any case, the behavior in question is only seen at monovalent cation concentrations well in excess of 0.5 m, so it is unlikely to have physiological relevance. We examined the effect of different monovalent cations on Kex2 activity in the presence of saturating substrate (Fig. 1), allowing us to measure specific effects on kcat (which reflects catalysis and not product release: Refs. 23Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and 24Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38394-38399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) rather than substrate binding. All group one cations tested (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium) stimulated cleavage. All of these ions displayed stimulation at lower concentrations and varying degrees of inhibition at higher concentrations (Fig. 1, A and B), although inhibition at high concentrations of NaCl was very weak. We also examined a series of ammonium ions (Fig. 1 C). Ammonium and tetramethylammonium gave similar effects, although tetramethylammonium response was very small. However, tetraethylammonium gave a more complicated response, suggesting cooperative effects on enzyme stability (data not shown). Comparison of NaCl and NaBr (Fig. 1 D) indicated that the observed stimulation was due to the cation; furthermore, because almost no inhibition was seen with NaCl over the concentration range examined (0–1.54 m), the additional inhibition seen at high concentrations with other salts (KCl, LiCl, etc.) must also be due to added cation. There were marked differences in response to various cations. For instance, sodium produced <2-fold stimulation with a maximal effect seen above 1 m, whereas lithium activated the enzyme ∼2-fold with a maximal stimulation at 0.5 m LiCl and pronounced inhibition by 1.54 m (Fig. 1 A). The larger ions rubidium and cesium both displayed stimulation at concentrations below 1 m and weak inhibition at higher concentrations, as did ammonium and tetramethylammonium (Fig. 1,B and C). Potassium ion exhibited the most profound effects, with greater than 2.5-fold stimulation at 0.2m KCl and weak inhibition at concentrations above 0.5m. With potassium ion, half-maximal stimulation was observed at ∼20 mm KCl (Fig. 1). These data suggested the presence of at least two binding sites for monovalent cations on Kex2 protease: a high affinity site whose occupancy stimulates activity and a low affinity site responsible for inhibition at high ionic concentrations. This would lead to a three-state model for ion response, with 0, 1, or 2 bound ions. Fitting such a model to the data gave good results for cations other than lithium and ammonium (Equation 8 and Table I). For these ions and for NaBr, data were fitted to a model that assumed inhibition was caused by two ions, necessitating a four-state model (Equation 9 and Table I). A more complicated fit for NaBr seemed appropriate, because bromide clearly had an additional inhibitory effect apart from the effects of the sodium cation (Fig. 1 D).Table IInteraction of monovalent cations with Kex2 ProteaseIonAffinityMaximal stimulationIonic radiusMFoldLi+a2.6130.68Na+ 1-bResponse evaluated using Equation 8.0.582.30.97K+ 1-bResponse evaluated using Equation 8.0.0222.81.33NH4 + 1-aResponse evaluated using Equation 9 to account for the additional inhibition observed at higher concentrations (Fig. 1).0.604.21.43Rb+ 1-bResponse evaluated using Equation 8.0.454.51.47Cs+ 1-bResponse evaluated using Equation 8.0.643.31.67Parameters from fits in Fig. 1 (A–C).

The regression analysis is described under “Materials and Methods.” This analysis permitted us to estimate the affinity of the stimulatory site for various ions (Table I). The results show that potassium ion binds >20-fold more tightly than any other ion tested, with a predicted binding constant of 22 mm. Larger or smaller cations bound with much lower affinity. Additionally, counter titration of sodium and potassium ions at a constant concentration of added cation gave nonlinear results, suggesting competition for a common site (data not shown). This effect is selective for monovalent cations; barium, which has a very similar ionic radius to potassium but is divalent, gave essentially no effect between 0 and 0.2 m(data not shown). All monovalent ions tested stimulated the enzyme to at least some extent. Therefore, we did not attempt to repeat these measurements at constant ionic strength, because there was no known ion that could be used to hold ionic strength constant over the desired range without affecting the enzyme.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating transcription of this gene, we isolated the 5′-flanking region of the mTβR-II gene and characterized its expression in F9-differentiated cells. Analysis of mTβR-II promoter/reporter gene constructs demonstrates that two conserved Ets-binding sites play an important role in the activity of the mTβR-II promoter. Importantly, we present evidence that mElf-3, a member of the Ets family, plays a key role in the activation of the mTβR-II promoter. Northern blot analysis reveals that the steady-state levels of mTβR-II mRNA increase in parallel with those of mElf-3 mRNA during the differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. We also demonstrate that mElf-3 contains one or more domains that influence its binding to DNA. Finally, we report that a single amino acid substitution in the transactivation domain of mElf-3 reduces its ability to transactivate and elevates its steady-state levels of expression.

These growth factors play important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar, 2Kelly D.L. Rizzino A. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 4791-4808PubMed Google Scholar). Three major TGF-β receptors have been identified and designated as type I (TβR-I), type II (TβR-II), and type III (TβR-III) receptors. TβR-III is a glycoprotein (∼280 kDa) that appears to lack intrinsic signaling activity. However, TβR-III can present TGF-β to its signaling receptors, TβR-I (∼55 kDa) and TβR-II (∼75 kDa) (3Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Appropriate cellular responses to extracellular TGF-β are initiated upon binding of TGF-β to TβR-II, which is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase. When bound to ligand, TβR-II forms a heteromeric signaling complex with TβR-I and phosphorylates TβR-I at serine and threonine residues within its kinase domain (4Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Weiser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). This activates a series of downstream signaling pathways (2Kelly D.L. Rizzino A. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 4791-4808PubMed Google Scholar). Both TβR-I and TβR-II are required for TGF-β-mediated growth suppression. Hence, loss of either receptor leads to TGF-β resistance, which often contributes to malignant progression. TGF-β resistance caused by defects in TβR-II expression has been reported in numerous tumor cell lines (5Inagaki M. Moustaka A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Carr B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Importantly, transfection of several different tumor cell lines with an expression vector for TβR-II restored sensitivity of the cells to TGF-β and reduced their malignant behavior (5Inagaki M.

Together, these findings illustrate the importance of both TβR-I and TβR-II as tumor suppressor genes.

However, in several different types of tumors, which exhibit either reduced or undetectable expression of the TβR-II gene at the mRNA or protein level, no structural mutations were apparent within the coding region of the gene (6Park K. Kim S.J. Bang Y.J. Park J.G. Kim N.K. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8772-8776Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 14Lazzereschi D. Ranieri A. Mincione G.

This suggests that defects in the mechanisms regulating the transcription of the TβR-II gene may play important roles in the aberrant expression of TβR-II. In this regard, it has been argued that the low levels of TβR-II mRNA expressed by A431 tumor cells are due to a point mutation located in the 5′-flanking region of the TβR-II promoter (17Muñoz-Antonia T., Li, X. Reiss M. Jackson R. Antonia S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4831-4835PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that this point mutation increases CDP/Cut transcription factor binding affinity, and overexpression of CDP/Cut reduces transcription from TβR-II promoter (18Jackson R.J. Antonia S.J. Wright K.L. Moon N.S. Nepveu A. Muñoz-Antonia T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). During the last several years, the promoter region of the human TβR-II gene (hTβR-II) was examined in several cell culture model systems (19Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K.

Initial analysis identified three positive cis-regulatory elements within 200 bp of the major transcription start site, i.e. a CRE/ATF motif, a GC box, and two Ets-binding sites (EBS) that are separated by 3 bp (19Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although most cells express TGF-β receptors, mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells lack detectable TGF-β binding (23Rizzino A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4386-4390PubMed Google Scholar). After EC cells undergo differentiation, TGF-β binding is readily detected, and the growth of the differentiated cells becomes responsive to TGF-β (23Rizzino A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4386-4390PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that the differentiation of mouse EC cells leads to transcriptional up-regulation of both the TβR-II gene (20Kelly D. Kim S.J. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21115-21124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the gene for one of its ligands, TGF-β2 (24Kelly D.L. O'Reilly M.A. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because mouse EC cells provide an excellent model system for studying both mammalian embryogenesis (25Martin G.R. Science. 1980; 209: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and the transcriptional regulation of genes that play key roles during development and cancer (26Rizzino A. Dickson R.B. Salomon D.S. Hormones and Growth Factors in Development and Neoplasia. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1998: 115-129Google Scholar), we set out to clone and characterize the regulatory regions of the mouse TβR-II gene (mTβR-II). Cloning the mouse promoter would make it possible to study the transcriptional up-regulation of the TβR-II gene in a well characterized mouse model system. It would also enable us to identify and then focus on conserved cis-regulatory elements. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of the 5′-flanking region of the mTβR-II gene. In the course of characterizing the mTβR-II promoter, we focused our attention on the conserved EBS that are located just downstream of the major transcription start site in the human and mouse TβR-II genes. We show that mElf-3 binds to the EBS and strongly stimulates expression of the mTβR-II promoter in differentiated cells derived from mouse F9 EC cells. We also demonstrate that differentiation of EC cells leads to parallel increases in the expression of mRNA for mTβR-II and mElf-3. Equally important, we demonstrate that mElf-3 itself is subject to other levels of regulation. Hence, characterization of the mechanisms that regulate mElf-3 may help identify ways to enhance the expression of the TβR-II gene in diseased tissues that exhibit aberrantly low levels of TβR-II. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME) medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). Unless otherwise stated all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. To assist in cloning the 5′ end of the mTβR-II gene, we designed a set of PCR primers based on the 5′ end of the cDNA sequence from Suzuki et al. (see Ref. 27Suzuki A. Shioda N. Maeda T. Tada M. Ueno N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar; GenBankTMD32072): 5′-CCTCCGGGCCTCCGAGCTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGTCGCTCGTCATAGACCG-3′ (antisense). Using these primers, Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, Missouri) screened a murine strain 129/O1a genomic library and identified a P1 clone that contained a 75–100-kb genomic fragment. To obtain a smaller genomic fragment, the P1 clone was digested with PstI, and the resulting fragments were ligated into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and transformed into DH5αF′ bacteria. Using the same set of primers used to screen the P1 genomic library, we identified a clone (∼4 kb) that contained the 5′-flanking region of the mTβR-II gene. Sequence analysis of both strands over a region of 1021 bp indicated that it extended more than 500 bp upstream of the two major transcription start sites (see below). Sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Alignment of the sequencing results was accomplished using version 1.1 of the Sequence Navigator program (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems). Comparisons (alignments) with other sequences were performed using programs of the Wisconsin Package version 9.1, Genetics Computer Group (GCG, Madison, WI). F9 EC cells were cultured on gelatinized dishes in DME medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Differentiation of F9 EC cells was induced by treatment with 5 μm retinoic acid (RA) for the times indicated (20Kelly D. Kim S.J. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21115-21124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HeLa and 293T cells were cultured in DME medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from F9 EC cells and F9-differentiated cells using the Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μg of each mRNA was fractionated on 1.2% agarose gels containing 0.22m formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membrane by capillary transfer, and immobilized by UV cross-linking (20Kelly D. Kim S.J. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21115-21124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using the Prime-It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). mElf-3 cDNA (see below) was used to generate a probe that was 864 bp in length and encoded amino acid residues 1–287. mTβR-II cDNA was used to generate a probe that was 699 bp in length and encoded the amino acid residues 90–322. A mTβR-I (ALK-5) cDNA was used to generate a probe that was 657 bp in length and encoded the amino acid residues 152–370. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C in the ExpressHybTM hybridization solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for 1.5 h, and the blots were washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization of GAPDH was used as a control for equal loading. Quantitation was accomplished using the PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Sizes of the transcripts were estimated by comparison to Millennium RNA markers (Ambion, Austin, TX). The transcription start site of the mTβR-II gene was examined by primer extension as described previously (28Wiebe M.S. Wilder P.J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we used the antisense primer mTβR-II-PE (5′-GCGCGCGCGGGGGGTGTCGTCGGTCGGTGC-3′ (+96 to +67)) and mRNA isolated from F9 EC cells induced to differentiate by exposure to RA for 4 days. Various regions of the mTβR-II promoter were amplified by PCR from the 4-kb genomic mTβR-II DNA fragment, which we had subcloned into Bluescript KS+. Restriction sites (Hin dIII or BglII) were incorporated at the ends of all primers to permit directional cloning of the amplified fragments into the Hin dIII and BglII sites in the polycloning region of the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmid pBLCAT7 (29Rosfjord E. Lamb K. Rizzino A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1994; 30: 477-481Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the mTβR-II promoter CAT construct was performed using the QuickChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All promoter sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Three FLAG-tagged mElf-3 expression vectors were cloned from mRNA using reverse transcriptase-PCR. One contained a cDNA for full-length mElf-3 (amino acid residues 1–371); a second contained sequences coding for the AT-hook domain plus the DNA binding domain of mElf-3 (amino acids 234–371) (ATH + DBD); and the third contained sequences for the DNA binding domain of mElf-3 (amino acids 271–371) (DBD). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from F9-differentiated cells using the Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 1 h with SuperScript IITM reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using the antisense primer. PCR amplification reaction was performed by using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 1 min. The sequences of the sense primer for full-length, ATH + DBD, and DBD mElf-3 were 5′-CTCAAGCTTGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGATAAGATGGCTGCCACCTGTGAGATCAGC-3′, 5′-ACGAGGATCCGACTATAAGAAGGGGGAACC-3′, and 5′-AATTGGATCCAGAGGTACTCACCTGTGGGAGTTTATCC-3′, respectively. The sense primer for full-length mElf-3 contained a Hin dIII site, a Kozac sequence, the FLAG sequence, and the 5′ mElf-3 coding sequences. The sense primers for ATH + DBD and DBD contained a BamHI site and the coding sequences. The sequence of the antisense primer was 5′-CGCTCTAGATTAATTCCGACTCTCTCCAACCTC-3′. It contained the sequence for an XbaI site followed by coding sequences for mElf-3. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes and directionally cloned into the polylinker region of the mammalian expression vector FNpcDNA3.0, which was kindly provided by Dr. Craig Hauser (Birnham Institute, La Jolla, CA), and described in Galang et al. (30Galang C.K. Garcia-Ramirez J.J. Solski P.A. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Neznanov N.N. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The resulting mElf-3 expression plasmids encoded a protein with an N-terminal FLAG tag. Site-directed mutagenesis of the mElf-3 cDNA was performed using the QuickChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Our sequence of mElf-3 cDNA did not agree fully with its published sequence (31Tymms M.J. Ng A.Y.N. Thomas R.S. Schutte B.C. Zhou J. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Seth A. Rosenberg M. Papas T. Debouck C.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To confirm the mElf-3 cDNA sequence, genomic DNA isolated from F9 EC cells using standard protocols (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 269-279Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR amplification. Oligonucleotide primers were designed for the regions in question (exons 2, 4, and 7) to generate PCR products containing the exon and the intron sequences. The sequences of the primer sets were 5′-CCCTGAACAACCAACAGATGAC-3′ (sense, exon 2) and 5′-TAGGCTCTCTTGGAAGGACATG-3′ (antisense, exon 4) with an expected amplification product of 852 bp, and 5′-CCTCCAACTCTTCTGATGAACTC-3′ (sense, exon 4) and 5′-CAGTATTCCTTGCTCAGCTTTCTG-3′ (antisense, exon 7) with an expected amplification product of 870 bp. PCR amplification reaction was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were gel-fractionated, and the visualized band was purified using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The PCR products were sequenced in both directions and compared with the cDNA sequences. F9-differentiated cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Ma Y.G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The pCMV-β-gal plasmid containing the β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the CMV immediate early promoter was cotransfected to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. F9 EC cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish in DME medium containing 10% FBS and 5 μm RA. After 72 h, the cells were transfected and incubated with the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate for 22 h and then were refed with DME medium containing 10% FBS and 5 μm RA. CAT activities were determined 72 h after transfection using the method of Seed and Sheen (35Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. 293T cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish in DME medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Ma Y.G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with the precipitate for 22 h and then were refed with DME medium containing 10% FBS. CAT activities were determined 24 h after transfection and were normalized as described above. When different amounts of the expression plasmid for mElf-3 were transfected into F9-differentiated and 293T cells, the total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant by addition of null plasmid DNA, FNpcDNA3.0, as indicated in the figure legends. HeLa cells were seeded at 7.5 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish in DME medium containing 10% FBS. Transfections were performed as described for 293T cells. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection and were used for Western blot analysis and gel mobility shift analysis as described below. All transfection experiments were repeated at least twice with different plasmid preparations. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells transiently transfected with 10 μg of one of the three FLAG epitope-tagged mElf-3 expression plasmids described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PERTM nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Annealed, double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled by a fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Nuclear extracts (12 μg) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and ∼20,000 cpm of probe. In competitive binding or supershift assays, unlabeled competitor DNAs or a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope (M2) was preincubated with the nuclear extract for 40 min at room temperature before addition of the labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris/boric/EDTA buffer as described previously (20Kelly D. Kim S.J. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21115-21124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Oligonucleotide probes corresponding to nucleotides +3 to +34 of the mTβR-II gene were as follows: wild type, 5′-TGGCGAGGAGTTTCCTGTTTCCCTCTCGGCGC-3′; mutant, 5′-TGGCGAGGAGTTTGGATCCACCCTCTCGGCGC-3′ (underline indicates mutated sequences). 293T cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106 on 150-mm plates. Cells were co-transfected 24 h after seeding by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Ma Y.G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with the promoter/reporter vector mTβR-II(−108/+56) and a FLAG-tagged mElf-3 expression vector containing either full-length Elf-3 or the DBD of Elf-3. After incubation with the precipitate for 20 h, the medium was changed, and ChIP analysis was initiated 4 h later. Cross-linking was performed by addition of formaldehyde to the media at a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with glycine (0.125 m) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and scraped into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in Cell Lysis Buffer (5 mm PIPES, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated for 15 min on ice, and the nuclei pelleted. The nuclei were lysed in Nuclei Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 10 min. Shearing of the DNA was then performed using a W-225 cup horn sonifier (Misonix, Inc.), and cell debris was pelleted. The supernatant was precleared with protein G PLUS-agarose beads (pre-blocked with bovine serum albumin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following preclearing, the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with Dilution Buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 167 mm NaCl), and 5% was removed and save as an “Input” sample. The remaining sample was divided into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was incubated with FLAG (M2) antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma), and the other aliquot was incubated with Gal4 (DBD) antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Both aliquot mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 4 times with TBS (20 mm Tris, 140 mmNaCl, pH 7.6), and complexes were eluted by two incubations with 100 μl of Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm NaHCO3) at 65 °C for 10 min (a total of 200 μl for each sample). The eluted immunoprecipitated samples and Input sample were decross-linked by addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2 m and incubation at 65 °C overnight. Following decross-linking, the samples were treated with 20 μg of proteinase K in Proteinase K Buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% SDS) for 2 h at 42 °C. DNA fragments were purified using the Geneclean Turbo kit (Qbiogene). The M13-21 FOR primer (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′), specific for a sequence located in the plasmid backbone, and the primer ELF3R (5′-ACGATGCCATTGGGATA-3′), specific for a sequence within the −108/+56 region of mTβR-II, were used to amplify specifically the mTβR-II promoter region located in the transfected promoter/reporter gene construct. PCR was performed on equivalent volumes of each sample and analyzed at multiple cycles. Results are presented for one cycle within the linear range of amplification. Aliquots of nuclear extracts prepared from cells (293T or HeLa) transfected with FLAG-tagged expression vectors coding for full-length and truncated forms of mELF-3, as well as aliquots of the cell extracts from transfected cells used in the CAT assays, were immunoblotted and probed with an anti-FLAG antibody as described previously (36Nowling T.K. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M.S. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Visualization was accomplished using the enhanced chemifluorescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed using the ImageQuant analysis software (Molecular Dynamics). The 5′-flanking region of the mTβR-II gene was isolated from a P1 genomic library that was screened by PCR using primers based on the 5′ end of the published mTβR-II cDNA sequence (27Suzuki A. Shioda N. Maeda T. Tada M. Ueno N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The P1 genomic clone identified in this screen was digested with PstI, subcloned into pBlueScript II KS+, and rescreened with the same set of primers used to identify the P1 genomic clone. This led to the isolation of a 4-kb PstI genomic fragment that contained the 5′ end of the mTβR-II cDNA. Sequencing of this 4-kb genomic su"

In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to create the H610A and H610N variants of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and report that both mutations exhibit both diminished activity (5,000- and 40,000-fold, respectively) and profoundly weakened affinity for the native cofactor, AdoCbl. In contrast, binding of the truncated cofactor analog, adenosylcobinamide, lacking the nucleotide tail, is less impaired. The catalytic failure of the His-610 mutants is in marked contrast to the phenotype of the adenosylcobinamide-GDP reconstituted wild type enzyme that exhibits only a 4-fold decrease in activity, although His-610 fails to coordinate when this cofactor analog is bound. Together, these studies suggest that His-610 may: (i) play a structural role in organizing a high affinity cofactor binding site possibly via electrostatic interactions with Asp-608 and Lys-604, as suggested by the crystal structure and (ii) play a role in catalyzing the displacement of dimethylbenzimidazole thereby facilitating the conformational change that must precede cofactor docking to the mutase active site.

The uncatalyzed rate for the cleavage of the Co–C bond in the cofactor free in solution is 3.8 × 10−9 s−1 at 37 °C (1Waddington M.D. Finke R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4629-4640Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, the kcat for most AdoCbl-dependent enzymes is of the order of ∼102 s−1 leading to a predicted rate enhancement that is of the order of 1012-fold (2Hay B.P. Finke R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 8012-8018Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A member of this class of enzymes is methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes the 1,2 rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (reviewed in Ref. 3Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6191-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is distinguished by being the only family member that is found in both bacterial and mammalian organisms. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes a 0.9 × 1012-fold enhancement of the homolysis rate that corresponds to a lowering of the activation barrier by 17 kcal/mol at 37 °C (4Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7998-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin or coenzyme B12 5′-deoxyadenosine 5′-deoxyadenosylcobinamide 5′-deoxyadenosylcobinamide guanosine diphosphate N-methylimidazole dimethylbenzimidazole Unlike the porphyrins and chlorins, other members of the family of tetrapyrrolic-derived cofactors, cobalamins are characterized by the presence of a large peripheral ornamentation appended from ring D, the dimethylbenzimidazole-containing nucleotide loop. In solution and at physiological pH, AdoCbl is six-coordinate, and the lower axial ligand is the bulky and weakly basic intramolecular base, dimethylbenzimidazole (5Lenhert P.G. Hodgkin D.C. Nature. 1961; 192: 937-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, in the class I or “His-on” (3Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6191-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) subfamily of AdoCbl-dependent enzymes, this lower ligand is replaced by a histidine residue provided by the respective proteins (6Mancia F.

This ligand switch was first reported in B12-dependent methyltransferases that catalyze heterolytic cleavage of the Co–C bond (8Stupperich E. Eisinger H.J. Albracht S.P.J. Eur. J.

Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In contrast, the class II or “dmb-on” enzymes retain the intramolecular ligand in their bound conformation (10Yamanishi M.

The potential role of the lower axial ligand in labilizing the upper axial Co–C bond has been the focus of enduring debate. A popular hypothesis to explain the observed rate enhancement invokes the role of conformational distortion of the corrin macrocycle (for example, see Refs. 13Grate J.H. Schrauzer G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 4601-4611Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14Marzilli L.G. Toscano J. Randaccio L. Bresciani-Pahor N. Calligaris M. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1991; 30: 3420-3430Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). According to this “mechanochemical” mechanism for labilization of the Co–C bond, an upward flexing of the corrin ring would lead to steric crowding on the β-face thereby weakening the organometallic bond. The influence of the trans electronic effects on the cobalt-alkyl bond dissociation energies have been determined with phenylethylcobalt dimethylglyoxime model compounds in which in a series of substituted pyridines were employed as the trans ligand (16Ng F.T.T. Rempel G.L. Halpern J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 621-623Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These studies revealed a linear correlation between increasing basicity of the trans ligand and increasing stabilization of the Co–C bond, consistent with the formal reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ during homolysis. Trans steric effects were evaluated in a series of benzylcobalt dimethylglyoxime model complexes in which the bulk of the tertiary phosphine ligand was varied. An inverse correlation between size and Co–C bond dissociation energy was noted (19Geno M.K. Halpern J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 1238-1240Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These results were consistent with studies on Co-dimethylglyoxime complexes in which increasing the size of the trans ligand resulted in a corresponding lengthening of the Co–C bond (20Randaccio L. Bresciani-Pahor N. Toscano P.J. Marzilli L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 7373-7375Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Summers M.F. Toscano P.J. Bresciani-Pahor N. Nardin G. Randaccio L. Marzilli L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6259-6293Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, a study on the association of a series of substituted phosphines to AdoCbi failed to obtain any evidence for binding, indicating that alkylcobaloximes are probably poor models for the biologically relevant corrinoid cofactors (22Garr C.D. Sirovatka J.M. Finke R.G. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 5912-5922Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sirovatka and Finke have compared the thermolysis of AdoCbi in the presence and absence of N-MeIm as a mimic of the His-on class of isomerases (23Sirovatka J.M. Finke R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3057-3067Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The key finding from these solution studies is that N-MeIm significantly reduces the proportion of Co–C bond homolysis from ≥98% in AdoCbl to ∼50% in AdoCbi·N-MeIm, with the remaining cleavage occurring via the heterolytic pathway, and it accelerates Co–C bond homolysis and heterolysis by a factor of 8 and 350, respectively, relative to AdoCbl. In addition, the presence of N-MeIm leads to an 870-fold and 3 × 104–fold increase in the homolytic and heterolytic rates, respectively, for Co–C bond cleavage relative to AdoCbi in the solvent, ethylene glycol. To address the role of imidazole ligation in a biological context, we have examined the effect of mutating His-610, the residue provided by the Propionibacterium shermanni methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. In this enzyme, His-610 is coordinated to the cobalt and is part of a hydrogen-bonding triad involving Asp-608 and Lys-604 (Fig. 1 and Ref.6Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Our study indicates that binding of AdoCbl is more severely affected than binding of AdoCbi, the cofactor lacking the dimethylbenzimidazole ribose phosphate moiety. We propose that the low activity of the H610A and H610N mutants of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase results from weak binding of the cofactor, and that a major role of the histidine may be in dimethylbenzimidazole displacement and in organization of the active site for tight cofactor binding. AdoCbl and methylmalonlyl-CoA were purchased from Sigma. Radioactive [14C]CH3-malonyl-CoA (56.4 Ci/mol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were reagent grade commercial products and were used without further purification. AdoCbi was synthesized as described previously (24Ishida A. Toraya T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and characterized by FAB-MS analysis at the Midwest Center for Mass Spectroscopy at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. A 451-bp Eco81I-Hin dIII fragment from pMEX2 containing the P. shermanii methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene (Ref. 25McKie N. Keep N.H. Patchett M.L. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, provided by P. Leadlay at the University of Cambridge) was subcloned into the pBS vector (Stratagene), which was then used as a template for creation of mutations by using the strategy supplied with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The following sense mutagenic primers were employed for PCR: H610A, GCCAGGACGGTGCCGACCGC GGCCAGAAGGTC and H610N, GCCAGGACGGTAACGACCGC GGCCAGAAGGTC. The mutant codons are underlined in each case. Each antisense mutagenic primer had the respective complementary sequence and boundaries that were identical to that of the sense primers. In each case, a SacII restriction site was introduced by changing a T to a C (bold) without changing the identity of the encoded amino acid (Arg), to facilitate selection of transformants containing the mutant sequences. T3 and T7 primers were used to confirm the presence of the mutation in the pBS plasmid by nucleotide sequence determination. The mutation-bearing insert was excised from pBS by restriction digestion with Eco81I and Hin dIII and partial PstI restriction digestion and was ligated to the parent expression plasmid, pMEX2, digested with the same restriction enzymes. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequence determination of both strands as well as by the introduction of a new SacII site at position 4,112 in the pMEX2 plasmid. DNA sequencing was performed at the Biotechnology Center Core facility at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. The mutant enzymes were purified through the step preceding reconstitution with cofactor using a modified procedure described previously for the isolation of wild type enzyme (26Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9295-9300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Butyl-agarose (Sigma) was used for hydrophobic chromatography instead of phenyl-Sepharose in the second step, and the Matrex gel blue affinity column was replaced by a POROS anion exchange column (20HQ, Perspective Biosystem) operated on a BIOcad work station. A 10 × 5-cm butyl-agarose column was eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 1.4 to 1 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase eluted at ∼1.2 m ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was concentrated and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, before being loaded onto a POROS 20HQ anion exchange column. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 0 to 250 mm NaCl in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 10 ml min−1. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase eluted at ∼170 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (BioRad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Specific activity of the mutase was determined in the radiolabeled assay at 37 °C as described previously (27Taoka S. Padmakumar R. Lai M.-t. Liu H.-w. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31630-31634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 unit of activity catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of succinyl-CoA min−1 at 37 °C. The concentration of mutant enzymes was increased 5,000-fold (with H610N) or 1,000-fold (with H610A) with respect to the wild type enzyme in the standard assay. Kinetic parameters for the two mutants were determined by increasing the duration of the fixed timed assay from 3 to 10 min in the presence of varying concentrations of [14C]methylmalonyl-CoA (56–2190 μm) or AdoCbl (from 0.14 to 50 μm). Addition of AdoCbl or AdoCbi to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase results in a decrease in fluorescence emission at 340 nm and has been used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant for the wild type enzyme (28Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15287-15294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to use this method with the two His-610 mutants to measure a Kd for AdoCbl or AdoCbi because of the absence of observable changes at low cofactor concentrations and general quenching of protein fluorescence at high concentrations of cofactor. We have attributed this fluorescence quenching at micromolar cofactor concentrations to a filter effect resulting from nonspecific interactions between the cofactor and the protein (28Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15287-15294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This property interfered with our ability to use fluorescence spectroscopy to distinguish between binding at the active site versus nonspecific binding and suggested that the mutant enzymes display weakened binding affinity. Binding of AdoCbi to the mutants was followed spectrophotometrically using a Cary-118 spectrophotometer (Olis Instruments) in which the cuvette holder was maintained at 4 °C by a thermostatted water circulator. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (24.5 μm) in 150 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was employed as a blank. Spectra were recorded between 800 and 306 nm after each addition of AdoCbi (3–5-μl aliquots prepared in the same buffer), following incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. The final AdoCbi concentration used in these experiments was 90 μm. The change in absorbance at 448 nm at each concentration of AdoCbi was obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the same concentration of free AdoCbi in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The Kd for AdoCbi was determined using Equation 1 as described previously (28Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15287-15294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 1/(1−y)=Lo/y(1/Kd)−Eo/KdEquation 1 Estimation of the binding of AdoCbl to the mutants was attempted using a similar procedure. However, we were able to monitor small absorbance changes at 460 nm only when very high concentrations of AdoCbl (0.2–0.4 mm) were added to 150 μmenzyme. The high background absorption from the free cofactor at these concentrations limited the feasibility of this experiment but provided a lower estimate for the Kd for AdoCbl of ≫300 μm. Absorbance changes could not be detected when low enzyme concentrations (∼25 μm) were employed. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutases containing the conservative mutation H610N or the nonconservative mutation H610A were purified to near homogeneity using conditions developed for the wild type enzyme. Whereas both mutations had a profound influence on AdoCbl binding (discussed below), they displayed at most a 2–3-fold higher Km for the cofactor and substrate, respectively (Table I). The Km for methylmalonyl-CoA for H610N was indistinguishable from the value for the wild type enzyme within the limits of experimental error, whereas the H610A variant had a ∼3-fold higher Km. In both mutants, the Km(app) for AdoCbl was ∼2-fold higher. Both mutations resulted in significant decreases in kcat, making these measurements experimentally difficult. Surprisingly, the conservative mutation, H610N, was the poorer catalyst with a kcat of 0.003 s−1 at 37 °C versus 0.024 s−1for H610A, albeit both were significantly lower than the value of 120 s−1 at 37 °C for the wild type enzyme. The low activities of both His-610 mutants raised concerns about possible low level contamination with wild type enzyme. However, the difference in the catalytic activities between the two mutants was consistently observed in every preparation. This would not be expected if low levels of contaminating wild type enzyme were contributing to the observed activities, because the contribution to both mutants should be similar, statistically. In addition, the Km values for the substrate and cofactor for the mutants was distinct from those of the wild type enzyme (Table I).Table ISummary of steady state kinetic parameters for wild type and His-610 mutants of methylmalonyl-CoA mutaseEnzymeKm(M-CoA)Km(AdoCbl)Kd(AdoCbl)Kd(AdoCbi)kcat(at 37 °C)μmμmμmμmWild type133 ± 370.24 ± 0.020.17 ± 0.010.62 ± 0.09120 s−1H610N102 ± 80.52 ± 0.08>>30055.8 ± 5.40.003 s−1H610A364 ± 420.45 ± 0.06>>30049.5 ± 2.70.024 s−1 Open table in a new tab Addition of imidazole to the assay mixture up to a concentration of 25 mm did not change the activity of the mutants indicating failure to rescue the functional effects of histidine removal (not shown). In addition, enzyme activity could not be detected when AdoCbl was replaced with AdoCbi in the reaction mixture in the presence or absence of imidazole as observed previously with wild type enzyme (28Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15287-15294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type enzyme, which displays an overall deuterium isotope effect (DV of 5 ± 0.6), neither the H610A nor the H610N mutant exhibited an isotope effect (data not shown). The weak binding of AdoCbl to the His-610 variants of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase precluded an accurate determination of the Kd for the cofactor. The spectrum of H610A reconstituted with AdoCbl was weak and had features corresponding to a mixture of base-off AdoCbl (460 nm) and hydroxycobalamin (350 and 535 nm) as shown in Fig. 2. The reconstitution procedure used to generate this spectrum is routinely employed with wild type methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and AdoCbl in the laboratory and does not lead to loss of the adenosyl group. These results indicate that the His-610 mutants display enhanced lability of the Co–C bond leading to inactive enzyme containing hydroxycobalamin, a property that is not exhibited by the wild type enzyme. A similar lability has been observed with wild type enzyme reconstituted with AdoCbi, which is in the His-off conformation in the active site (28Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15287-15294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Binding of AdoCbi to wild type mutase results in an increase in absorption across the entire spectral range as has been observed previously for AdoCbl (28Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15287-15294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, the difference spectrum of the [His-610]enzyme·AdoCbi complex obtained following successive additions of cofactor aliquots showed a number of distinct changes (see Fig. 3). These included increases in absorption at 360, 448, 507, and 535 nm and revealed conversion of AdoCbi to hydroxycobinamide in the presence of the enzyme. These results indicate that the absence of the coordinating histidine ligand enhances cleavage of the Co–C bond of AdoCbi as also seen with AdoCbl (see above). The increase in absorbance at 448 nm accompanying cofactor binding was plotted as a function of the concentration of free cofactor and yielded a Kd of 49.5 ± 2.7 μm for H610A (Fig. 3, inset) and 55.8 ± 5.4 μm for H610N (Table I). This study was originally designed to evaluate the role of trans effects in variants of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in which the lower, protein-derived ligand, His-610, was either removed (H610A) or altered (H610N). Both changes had profound effects on the cofactor dissociation constant and on kcat but had modest effects on substrate and cofactor Km values. Thus, the H610A and H610N mutants displayed 5,000- and 40,000-fold diminution in kcat, respectively, as compared with the wild type enzyme, indicating a change in the rate-limiting step that is believed to be product dissociation for the wild type enzyme (29Padmakumar R. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3713-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our inability to measure the binding constant for AdoCbl by difference UV-visible electronic spectroscopy puts a lower limit on the Kd values for the mutants at ≫300 μm, indicating that the equilibrium dissociation constant has been weakened by ≫1,700-fold. The marked difference in the apparent Km and Kd for AdoCbl displayed by the two His-610 mutants is surprising. However, very similar behavior has been reported for the corresponding mutants in glutamate mutase, H16G and H16Q, where the Km is increased 3–5-fold whereas the Kd is increased an estimated 50-fold (30Chen H.P. Marsh E.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7884-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As pointed out by Chen and Marsh (30Chen H.P. Marsh E.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7884-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a minimal kinetic scheme describing the cofactor and substrate binding steps and catalysis reveals that Km is a complex kinetic term that could in principle be equivalent to, larger, or smaller than Kd. In wild type methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, the Kd and apparent Km for AdoCbl are equivalent (28Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15287-15294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Maiti N. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32733-32737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The large difference between the values of the two kinetic constants displayed by the mutants is consistent with a significant change in the binding affinity for AdoCbl, which in turn impacts kcat, presumably by changing the rate-limiting step. This conclusion is supported by suppression of the overall deuterium isotope effect in the mutant enzymes in contrast to that of wild type enzyme that displays a DV of 5 ± 0.6 (32Chowdhury S. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a step such as cofactor binding limiting catalysis. The phenotypes of the His-610 mutants reported in this study are in sharp contrast to the mild effects observed when the His-off state is achieved using the cofactor analog, AdoCbi-GDP (32Chowdhury S. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The latter is a biosynthetic intermediate in the assembly of cobalamin, and we have previously shown that it supports catalysis by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Binding of AdoCbi-GDP results in retention of the 460-nm absorption maximum observed for the cofactor free in solution indicating that His-610 does not move into coordination position when this cofactor analog binds. This is confirmed by the EPR spectrum of bound cob(II)inamide-GDP obtained by photolysis of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reconstituted with AdoCbi-GDP in which the ACo-N value for the hyperfine interaction is 144 G, and superhyperfine splittings associated with axial nitrogen ligation are absent. The Kd for AdoCbi-GDP is 4.9 μmversus 0.17 μm for AdoCbl, and the kcat is decreased from 73 s−1 to 18 s−1 at 30 °C. The spectra of the enzyme in the presence and absence of high concentrations of substrate do not show significant changes (32Chowdhury S. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because the kcat under maximal velocity conditions is only 4-fold lower with AdoCbi-GDP than with AdoCbl, the lack of observable spectral changes argues against transient coordination by His-610 under catalytic turnover conditions. Thus, the His-off state achieved by site-directed mutagenesis as in the H610A mutant (and most likely also in the H610N variant), is functionally different from the His-off state obtained with the cofactor analog, AdoCbi-GDP, and raises the question of what the role of His-610 really is. One possibility is that electrostatic interactions between His-610, Asp-608, and Lys-604 may play an important role in catalysis by maintaining a high affinity cofactor binding site (Fig. 1) and that the absence of this hydrogen-bonding network compromises structural integrity in the holoenzyme. This is supported by the observed increase in the rate of Co–C bond cleavage of bound AdoCbl and AdoCbi (Figs.2 and 3) in comparison to wild type enzyme, where geminate recombination of the homolysis products is greatly favored in the absence of substrate (4Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7998-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A second possibility is suggested by the magnitude of the impairment in the equilibrium binding constant when the nucleotide tail is absent as in AdoCbi (∼80-fold), which is significantly smaller than when the tail is present as in the natural cofactor, AdoCbl (≫1700-fold, Table I). This suggests that the histidine may be important in binding of the cofactor, specifically in the ligand displacement reaction that must precede docking of AdoCbl to the active site of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Fig. 4). The equilibrium association constant for the intramolecular base, dimethylbenzimidazole, in AdoCbl is reported to be 14.3 at 25 °C (33Hay B.P. Finke R.G. Polyhedron. 1984; 7: 1469Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the p Ka for this ligand in AdoCbl is 3.7 (34Brown K.L. Hakimi J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7894-7899Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, at physiological pH, the cofactor exists predominantly in the dmb-on conformation, and the dimethylbenzimidazole must be displaced to achieve the dmb–off conformation in the active site. We have previously characterized the pH dependence of AdoCbl binding to wild type mutase by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy and found it to be associated with a p Ka of 7.3 (28Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15287-15294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, when the truncated cofactor analog AdoCbi was employed, binding of the cofactor was complete within the instrument dead time, suggesting that dissociation of the dimethylbenzimidazole ligand is the slow step in the docking of the native cofactor to the mutase active site. Based on the results reported here on the His-610 mutants, we propose a model in which the coordinating histidine plays a role in promoting the dmb-off conformation and thereby catalyzes cofactor binding (Fig. 4). The observed p Ka of 7.3 associated with AdoCbl binding would be consistent with ionization of a histidine residue. Comparison of the highly homologous structures of the B12binding domains of glutamate mutase determined in the absence of the cofactor (35Tollinger M. Konrat R. Hilbert B.H. Marsh E.N.G. Krauetler B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase solved in the presence of the cofactor (6Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), reveals that the domain is largely preorganized and that the ligand histidine in both cases is located on a loop (Fig. 4). The difference, however, is that in the presence of B12, the loop leads to a relatively long α-helix that interacts with the nucleotide tail; however, this stretch of amino acids is largely disordered in the absence of B12. Thus, binding of the cofactor appears to shift the equilibrium toward a more stable α-helix extending from the loop carrying the ligand histidine (36Tollinger M. Eichmuller C. Konrat R. Huhta M.S. Marsh E.N. Krautler B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 777-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and presumably helps position it for coordination. It is noteworthy that the properties of the histidine ligand mutation, H759G, in methylcobalamin-dependent methionine synthase are distinct from those exhibited by the AdoCbl-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and glutamate mutase with respect to cofactor binding. Tight binding of the cofactor is retained by this mutant although the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme is greatly impaired (37Jarrett J.T. Amaratunga M. Drennan C.L. Scholten J.D. Sands R.H. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2464-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ligand histidine in methionine synthase is a member of a histidine-aspartate-serine triad of residues that appears to be important as a proton shunt that facilitates cycling of the cofactor between six-coordinate methylcobalamin and four-coordinate cob(I)alamin states (9Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). An analogous role is not expected for the isomerases, and indeed, the serine is not conserved in these enzymes. In fact, the significance of the His-on conformation in the subclass of isomerases that exhibit this binding motif is unclear, and it has been speculated that it may represent an evolutionary vestige inherited from the probably more ancient B12-dependent methyltransferase family of enzymes (3Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6191-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In a second subclass of isomerases, AdoCbl is in fact bound in the dmb-on conformation (11Abend A. Bandarian V. Nitsche R. Stupperich E. Retey J. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Lawrence C.C. Gerfen G.J. Samano V. Nitsche R. Robins M.J. Retey J.

Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (218) Google Scholar) revealing that catalysis of isomerase chemistry is not uniquely dependent on the presence of the histidine versus dimethylbenzimidazole ligand. Although reconstitution of most B12-dependent enzymes with their respective cofactors is readily achieved in vitro, little is known about the process in vivo, and in particular, whether or not B12 chaperones are involved. Because intermediates in the cofactor biosynthetic pathway have been shown to bind tightly to several B12 enzymes, facilitation of this process by proteins would appear to be important for achieving specificity. Depending on the class of B12 enzymes, discrimination between the ligand identities at the upper axial position and retention or replacement of the ligand at the lower axial position will be important determinants for cofactor binding. In summary, characterization of the His-610 mutants of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in this study in combination with our previous studies on the catalysis of this reaction by AdoCbi-GDP reconstituted enzyme that yields the His-off conformation (32Chowdhury S. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggests a role for the histidine residue that has not been considered previously. We propose that the histidine residue may be involved in catalyzing the conformational change from the dmb-on to dmb-off state that must precede AdoCbl docking in the active site and that the primary influence of the histidine residue is on cofactor binding rather than catalysis."

Immunology of the Nervous System. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 173-199Google Scholar). They express receptors for proinflammatory cytokines, bacterial products, complement components, and constituents of the coagulation system (5Dorf M.E. Berman M.A. Tanabe S. Heesen M. Luo Y. J.

Thus, astrocytes are highly sensitive to changes in their local environment. These receptors become activated during autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, or cerebrovascular diseases resulting in the release of cytokines and effector molecules (6Huang D. Han Y. Rani M.R.

Inflammatory responses in the CNS rapidly induce activation of astrocytes. Activated astrocytes are associated with the production of multiple chemokines and cytokines (6Huang D. Han Y. Rani M.R. Glabinski A. Trebst C. Sorensen T. Tani M. Wang J. Chien P. O'Bryan S. Bielecki B. Zhou Z.L. Majumder S. Ransohoff R.M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 52-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It has become clear that the chemokine system is also involved in other physiological and pathological processes including embryogenesis, HIV infection, and tumorigenesis (14Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar, 15Ma Q. Jones D. Borghesani P.R. Segal R.A. Nagasawa T. Kishimoto T. Bronson R.T.

Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4502) Google Scholar). The importance of the chemokine system to the CNS was first documented with the chemokine SDF-1 (also termed CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4. In the absence of SDF-1 or its receptor, mice develop serious disorders during the development of CNS tissues (14Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar, 15Ma Q. Jones D. Borghesani P.R. Segal R.A. Nagasawa T. Kishimoto T. Bronson R.T. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9448-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). RANTES (also termed CCL5) is another chemokine involved in the ontogenic development of the brain. Astrocytes from 5-week-old fetal human brains release RANTES, which in turn induces proliferation of the astrocyte cultures (18Bakhiet M. Tjernlund A. Mousa A. Gad A. Stromblad S. Kuziel W.A. Seiger A. Andersson J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, at week 10 of gestation after these cells have expanded, RANTES synergizes with interferon-γ to inhibit the proliferative response and promote cell survival, facilitating astrocyte differentiation. The signaling mechanisms regulating these RANTES-mediated effects on astrocytes remain poorly defined. The stimulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway can result in cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. Ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK) comprise a family of serine/threonine kinases that lie at the terminus of the mitogen-regulated ERK-MAPK pathway (19Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The stimulation of ERK initiates a cascade of activating events including phosphorylation of RSK by ERK and translocation to the nucleus where they phosphorylate nuclear substrates (20Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7470-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Many RSK substrates have been identified, implicating RSK in a myriad of cellular processes. RSK phosphorylates several transcription factors, among them CREB (21Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), c-Fos (22Chen R.H. Abate C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10952-10956Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the CAAT enhancer-binding protein (23Buck M. Poli V. van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the estrogen receptor (24Joel P.B. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) as well as interact with the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (also known as p300) (25Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). RSK may also have a role in chromatin remodeling through phosphorylation of histone H3 (26Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The diversity of these substrates suggests that RSK is involved in the regulation of a wide range of cellular functions. However, the role of RSK in the synthesis of chemokines and chemokine stimulation is unknown to date. In this report, we examine the effects of RANTES on cultured neonatal murine astrocytes. RANTES stimulation induces TNF-α and KC proteins plus a variety of chemokine transcripts. We now demonstrate that the signaling pathway regulating these responses involves the activation of MEK, ERK, and RSK. BALB/cJ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in our animal facilities. Mice were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee on Animals of the Harvard Medical School. Recombinant mouse RANTES was purchased from R&D System (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant murine IL-1β was purchased from Invitrogen. U0126 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology(Beverly, MA), whereas SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem. Rabbit antibodies directed to p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/2), phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (P-ERK1/2), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221), phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), p90RSK, phospho-p90RSK (Ser-381), phospho-p90RSK (Thr-360/Ser-364), phospho-p90RSK (Thr-574), and phospho-CREB (Ser-133) were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Hoechst 33258 was purchased from Sigma. Astrocytes were prepared from neonatal (<24 h) mouse brains as described previously (27Luo Y. Fischer F.R. Hancock W.W. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The purity of the astrocyte cultures was >95% as determined by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). For the production of supernatants, 2 × 104 astrocytes were cultured in 96-well plates with medium or 100 ng/ml RANTES. Supernatants were collected after the indicated times. ELISA assays for KC (28Luo Y. Lloyd C. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3985-3992PubMed Google Scholar) and TNF-α (29Abromson-Leeman S. Maverakis E. Bronson R. Dorf M.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were performed as detailed previously. Protein levels were determined using recombinant KC or TNF-α (R & D Systems) as standards. Astrocytes were treated for the indicated time with medium or 100 ng/ml RANTES. 3 × 105 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmsodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentration of the whole cell extract was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 10-μg samples were loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blots were blocked overnight with 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C and then probed with the indicated antibody. Appropriate anti-immunoglobulin reagents were used to develop the blots by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). RNA was prepared as detailed previously (28Luo Y. Lloyd C. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3985-3992PubMed Google Scholar). RNase protection assays (RPA) for chemokine message were conducted with multiprobe templates according to the manufacturer's protocol (RiboQuant assay kit, BD-PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Gels were scanned, and radioactive bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, large ribosomal subunit protein 32-3A (L32), or GAPDH were used for normalization. The KC reporter plasmid was constructed by using a luciferase reporter gene pGL-3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) driven by mouse KC promoter (−2878/+43). The mutation of the CRE site (ACGTCA to ACGAAT) on the KC promoter (−193/−188) was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Wild-type p90RSK expression (WT-pKH3) and dominant negative p90RSK expression (ΔRSK-pKH3) plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. John Blenis (Harvard Medical School). Wild-type CREB and dominant negative CREB expression plasmids (30Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Rivier J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. M. R. Montminy (San Diego, CA). Astrocytes were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h later, the cells were stimulated with RANTES in absence or presence of the indicated inhibitor, and after an additional 24 h, luciferase activity was determined as recommend by the manufacturer (Promega). Relative luciferase activity was normalized for cell lysate protein concentration as detected by BCA protein assay kit. The relative-fold induction represents the relative intensity of the experimental sample divided by the relative intensity of the medium control. Astrocytes were grown on glass coverslips for one day; the cells were then serum-starved for three hours. Astrocytes were treated with RANTES for 5 or 20 min. Following treatment, cells were fixed in −20 °C methanol, permeabilized in ice-cold 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with phospho-p90RSK (Thr-360/Ser-364) antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (1:2000) for 5 min. Coverslips were mounted on slides using the ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes). Slides were stored at room temperature in the dark until observation. The ability of RANTES to stimulate chemokine/cytokine transcripts in mouse astrocytes was examined by RPA. Primary neonatal mouse astrocyte cultures were incubated with the indicated dose of RANTES, boiled RANTES, or TCA-4 for 3 h and then harvested for RNA isolation. RANTES (≥10 ng/mg) stimulated chemokine/cytokine transcription. Following RANTES treatment, the expression of TNF-α, RANTES, KC, MIP-1α, MIP-2, and MCP-1 transcripts was up-regulated (Fig. 1A). Boiled RANTES (30 min) and a control chemokine TCA-4 failed to induce any chemokine or cytokine transcripts. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that TNF-α, KC, and MIP-2 transcripts were detected as early as 60–90 min after RANTES stimulation (Fig. 1B). At 2 h, distinct bands for MIP-1α and MCP-1 became visible, and a faint RANTES band appeared. IL-6 transcripts were the last to appear (4 h). Unstimulated astrocytes expressed message for the housekeeping genes L32 and GAPDH and occasionally traces of RANTES or MCP-1. The ability of RANTES to stimulate KC and TNF-α protein synthesis was next examined. Primary astrocyte cultures were treated with 100 ng/ml RANTES for the indicated times, and then supernatants were harvested for assay. The viability of the cultures was >95% throughout the 16-h observation period. Kinetic examination indicated that KC proteins were detectable within 8 h and the levels rose rapidly (Fig. 1C). TNF-α proteins were induced with similar kinetics. Low levels of TNF-α (<120 pg/ml) were detectable after 16 h compared with the 20–30 ng/ml concentrations of KC (Fig. 1,C and D). To examine the components of the RANTES signal transduction pathway, we evaluated the phosphorylation of the MEK and MAPK. To minimize basal kinase activity, astrocytes were serum-starved at least 3 h before treatment with chemokine. Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by Western blot. Antibodies that specifically react with phosphorylated MEK or phosphorylated ERK were used to detect the active kinases. RANTES-induced phosphorylation of MEK, ERK1, and ERK2 was noted within 5 min, peaked 20–60 min, and lasted for over 2 h (Fig. 2A). For normalization, total ERK protein levels were determined with an Ab reacting with both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins (Fig. 2B). To determine whether RANTES also induced phosphorylation of the p38 and SAPK/JNK MAPKs, the state of these enzymes was examined directly by Western blot. As illustrated in Fig. 2C, RANTES treatment failed to phosphorylate p38 or SAPK/JNK. Kinetic studies indicated that phosphorylation of p38 or JNK was not detectable from 5 to 120 min after RANTES stimulation (data not shown). Furthermore, the treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 failed to modulate RANTES-mediated transcription of chemokine RNA (data not shown). All three MAPKs were activated following treatment with the cytokine IL-1 (Fig. 2C) in accordance with published results (31Molina-Holgado E. Ortiz S. Molina-Holgado F. Guaza C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32Zhang P. Miller B.S. Rosenzweig S.A. Bhat N.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of the MAP kinase pathway on induction of chemokine transcripts, we pretreated astrocyte cultures with the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, for 1 h. The treatment with 1 μm U0126 partially inhibited transcription, whereas incubation with 50 μm U0126 completely inhibited TNF-α and chemokine transcription (Fig. 3). The data indicate that MEK is involved in the intracellular signal required for RANTES-mediated chemokine induction of astrocytes. To establish that RANTES up-regulated chemokine production by the activation of promoter elements, primary astrocyte cultures were transiently transfected with a murine KC promoter-luciferase construct, and reporter activity was monitored after RANTES treatment. RANTES stimulated reporter activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A). The treatment of the transfected cells with U0126 inhibited reporter activity, whereas incubation with SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, failed to effect this response (Fig. 4B). The p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinases (RSKs) are a family of Ser/Thr protein kinases that are stimulated through the ERK pathway (19Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). RSKs participate in the regulation of transcription factors such as CREB, CREB-binding protein and p300, and c-Fos (19Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 21Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 25Nakajima T.

In addition, RSK participates in the phosphorylation of IκB, leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (34Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 35Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol.

The activation of RSK is a stepwise process involving the phosphorylation of multiple residues (19Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To determine whether RANTES can mediate RSK activation in astrocytes, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml RANTES, and the phosphorylation of multiple RSK residues was examined by Western blot (Fig. 5A). Increased phosphorylation was observed with all phospho-RSK Ab examined including reagents specific for phosphorylation at residues Ser-381, Thr-360/Ser-364, and Thr-574. The phosphorylation of RSK was noted within 5 min, peaked at 60 min, and was sustained for over 2 h. There is a correlation between the dose of RANTES required to stimulate chemokine transcription (Fig. 1A) and the dose sufficient to phosphorylate ERK and RSK (Fig. 5B). Thus, 10 ng/ml RANTES (∼1 nm) triggers the phosphorylation of these kinases and increases transcription. To establish the interrelationship between MEK and RSK, astrocytes were treated with graded doses of U0126 before stimulation with RANTES. After 20 min, lysates were prepared and examined for ERK and RSK phosphorylation. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor blocked RSK phosphorylation in a dose dependent fashion (Fig. 5.C). Therefore, MEK is a critical upstream kinase responsible for activation of RSK in the RANTES signal transduction pathway. To examine the RSK dependence of RANTES-stimulated activation of the KC promoter, we employed a dominant negative mutant of RSK. The two phosphorylation sites (K112R/K464R) required for kinase activity were mutated, resulting in a kinase-defective protein (33Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Kwon E.M. Raines M.A. Blenis J. Sakamoto K.M. Blood. 2000; 95: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Astrocytes were cotransfected with the luciferase-KC promoter construct along with wild-type RSK, mutant RSK, or vector controls. The co-transfected cells were stimulated with RANTES and monitored for luciferase reporter activity. Dominant negative RSK specifically suppressed reporter activity (Fig. 6), demonstrating the importance of this enzyme in regulating the transcription of the chemokine KC. Finally, we examined the ability of RANTES to induce nuclear translocation of RSK. Untreated astrocytes display a diffuse distribution of phosphorylated RSK, nuclear translocation was noted 5 min after RANTES treatment, and after 20 min, high levels of phosphorylated RSK were concentrated within the nucleus (Fig. 7). RSK is known to phosphorylate nuclear proteins including CREB. Phosphorylation of CREB stimulates the recruitment of components of the basal transcription machinery permitting new mRNA synthesis. The activation of gene expression by CREB requires phosphorylation of the Ser-133 residue. We examined the kinetics of CREB phosphorylation in RANTES-stimulated astrocytes by Western blot with a CREB Ser-133-specific Ab. The phosphorylation of CREB was noted in a time-dependent fashion, and this phosphorylation was dependent on the activation of the MAPK pathway as demonstrated by inhibition with U0126 (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, co-transfection of wild type or dominant negative CREB along with the KC promoter-luciferase construct established that CREB was involved in transcription from the KC promoter. Thus, a dominant negative CREB inhibited transcription by the KC promoter (Fig. 8B). CREB functions by binding to CRE. We identified at least two potential CRE sites within the 2.9-kb KC promoter (data not shown). The proximal CRE site in the KC promoter is highly conserved, and identical sequences are present in other CXC chemokine promoters. To evaluate the role of the proximal CRE site in KC expression, the site was mutated. The activity of the wild type and mutant promoter constructs were examined following RANTES stimulation in the luciferase reporter assay. The mutation of the proximal CRE site disrupted transcriptional activity (Fig. 8C). In this communication, we demonstrate that RANTES stimulates murine astrocytes to synthesize RNA for multiple chemokines including KC, MIP-2, MIP-1α, MCP-1, and RANTES plus the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. This in vitro model reflects the complex pattern of chemokines and cytokines produced by astrocytes during chronic infectious and inflammatory diseases (6Huang D. Han Y. Rani M.R. Glabinski A.

The ability of one chemokine to induce a cascade of proinflammatory mediators represents an amplification mechanism that may prolong inflammatory responses in the CNS. Previous reports (27Luo Y.

The ability of RANTES to stimulate astrocytes is consistent with reports demonstrating that astrocytes express two independent high affinity RANTES receptors, CCR1 (41Tanabe S. Heesen M.

The strong, rapid, and sustained induction of KC suggests an important role for this chemokine. KC and the structurally related chemokine MIP-2 may contribute to inflammation by recruiting leukocytes to the CNS, and they may also participate in the subsequent repair processes by promoting the growth of oligodendrocytes (46Wu Q. Miller R.H. Ransohoff R.M. Robinson S., Bu, J. Nishiyama A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2609-2617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Robinson S. Tani M. Strieter R.M. Ransohoff R.M. Miller R.H. J.

Thus, the release of KC and TNF-α during an inflammatory response might be expected to have pathological consequences. Little is known about the signaling mechanisms involved in astrocyte responses to chemokines. Recent reports noted the involvement of MEK and ERK1/2 in response to SDF-1 (40Han Y., He, T. Huang D.R. Pardo C.A. Ransohoff R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 50Lazarini F. Casanova P. Tham T.N., De Clercq E. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Baleux F.

Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1226-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that these enzymes are also involved in astrocyte signal transduction following RANTES treatment. However, RANTES was reported to induce rapid phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK as well as the activation of its downstream effector MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 in T cells (52Wong M. Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Huynh T. Proudfoot A.E. Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11427-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of RANTES-dependent p38 MAPK activation blocked MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 activity in T cells (52Wong M. Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Huynh T. Proudfoot A.E. Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11427-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, we failed to detect the activation of p38 or JNK in RANTES-activated astrocytes. The combined data imply that RANTES differentially activates distinct MAPKs in a cell type-specific fashion. We now demonstrate that RANTES activates the Ser/Thr kinase, RSK, downstream of ERK. In addition, RANTES stimulation causes translocation of phosphorylated RSK to the nucleus. Transfection of a dominant negative RSK mutant that lacks kinase activity specifically inhibited KC promoter-driven transcription. The kinase-defective RSK inhibited but did not completely abolish RANTES-induced transcription, suggesting that other signaling pathways may be involved in the transcriptional activation of KC. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence linking RSK to signaling pathways in astrocytes and the initial data indicating that RSK is involved in chemokine signaling. In the nucleus, RSK apparently phosphorylates CREB. The action of CREB is required for RANTES-mediated induction of chemokine transcription. In a system that analyzed the growth and differentiation of human first trimester fetal astrocytes, it was shown that RANTES induced nuclear translocation of STAT-1 proteins (18Bakhiet M. Tjernlund A. Mousa A. Gad A. Stromblad S. Kuziel W.A. Seiger A. Andersson J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, preliminary experiments with mouse neonatal astrocytes suggest that STAT-1 does not play a role in RANTES-mediated chemokine synthesis (data not shown). The combined data suggest that these different RANTES-mediated effector capacities involve separate elements for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. In summary, the phosphorylation and translocation of RSK are novel requirements for RANTES-mediated activation of chemokine synthesis in astrocytes. The ERK-RSK signal transduction pathway used by astrocytes is distinct from the reported mechanisms of chemokine signaling and induction used by leukocytes. Hence, therapeutic strategies to regulate chemokine responses and synthesis may need to be tailored to specific target tissues."

In the presence of thiol initiator and denaturant, the native LCI denatures by shuffling its native disulfide bonds and transforms into a mixture of scrambled species. 9 of 104 possible scrambled isomers of LCI, amounting to 90% of total denatured LCI, can be distinguished. The denaturation curve that plots the fraction of native LCI converted into scrambled isomers upon increasing concentrations of denaturant shows that the concentration of guanidine thiocyanate and guanidine hydrochloride required to reach 50% of denaturation is 2.4 and 3.6 m, respectively. In contrast, native LCI is resistant to urea denaturation even at high concentration (8 m). The LCI unfolding pathway was defined based on the evolution of the relative concentration of scrambled isoforms of LCI upon denaturation.

LCI is a cysteine-rich polypeptide of 66 residues that behaves as a tight binding and competitive inhibitor of different types of pancreatic-like carboxypeptidases (A1, A2, B, and plasma carboxypeptidase B) with equilibrium dissociation constants Ki of 0.1–0.4 × 10−9 m (1Reverter D.

The lowest Ki value of LCI is shown for plasma carboxypeptidase B, an enzyme also known as thrombin activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), that proteolytically removes C-terminal residues from fibrin and down-regulates plasminogen activation, leading to an attenuation of fibrinolysis (2Wang W.

The profibrinolytic effect of LCI has recently been demonstrated in an in vitro system, 2S. Salamanca et al., manuscript in preparation. suggesting a potential application to human therapy. In this regard knowledge of the stability and folding behavior of LCI constitutes a basis for the development of variants of the molecule with enhanced activity and/or stability. The recently published three-dimensional structure of LCI shows that it folds in a compact domain consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a short α-helix (4Reverter D. Fernández-Catalán C. Baumgartner R. Pfänder R. Huber R. Bode W. Vendrell J. Holak T.A. Avilés F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One of the main contributions to the stability of native LCI arises from the occurrence of four disulfide bridges between cysteines 10–33, 17–61, 18–42, and 21–57, all of them located within regular secondary structure elements. The unstructured C-terminal tail of LCI interacts with the carboxypeptidase in a substrate-like manner, similar to what was previously described for the potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI). No sequential homology is observed between PCI and LCI except for the C-terminal tail; however, both proteins show the structural feature of being stabilized by disulfide bridges. leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor scrambled LCI potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor cardiotoxin III tick anticoagulant peptide guanidine hydrochloride guanidine thiocyanate high pressure liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry For disulfide-containing proteins, unfolding and refolding generally correlate with reduction and oxidation of the native disulfides (5Haber E.

Since the intermediates generated in these processes can chemically be trapped and characterized, it is possible to derive in detail the disulfide unfolding and refolding pathways. We have recently described a new methodology to determine stability toward denaturants and to elucidate the unfolding pathway of disulfide-containing proteins (7Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,8Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This approach is based on the observation that the presence of trace amounts of a thiol initiator during unfolding by denaturants generates a mixture of scrambled species mostly consisting of non-native disulfides that still maintain the native number of disulfide bonds. This method has been applied to characterize the unfolding pathway of several disulfide-containing proteins, namely tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) (3 disulfides) (8Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), PCI (3 disulfides) (9Chang J.-Y., Li, L. Canals F. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and insulin-growth factor (IGF-1) (3 disulfides) (10Chang J.-Y. Marki W. Lai P.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present work we describe the unfolding pathway and conformational stability of LCI derived from the characterization of the scrambled species generated in the presence of a thiol initiator. The comparison to other disulfide-containing proteins offers an insight into the role of disulfide bonds in guiding the folding pathway and stabilizing the native fold. Recombinant LCI was obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli following a procedure previously described (1Reverter D. Vendrell J. Canals Q. Horstmann J. Avilés F.X. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32927-32933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein that contains a construction-added glycine as the N-terminal residue was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a TSK DEAE column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by reverse-phase HPLC. The protein was over 99% pure, as judged by HPLC, and its molecular mass was confirmed by MALDI-TOF. Urea, guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), guanidine thiocyanate (GdnSCN), and acetonitrile with purities greater than 99%, were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Native LCI (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm2-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations of denaturants (urea, GdnHCl, GdnSCN, or organic solvent). The reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium and was typically performed at 23 °C for 20 h (8Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To monitor the kinetics of unfolding, aliquots of the sample treated with selected concentrations of GdnHCl were removed at time intervals, quenched with an equal volume of 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and directly analyzed by HPLC or kept at 20 °C until analysis. The GdnSCN-denatured samples were further purified by gel-filtration (NAP-5 columns from Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to HPLC analysis. To follow the time course of LCI unfolding, native LCI was dissolved in the same buffer containing 6, 7, or 8 m GdnHCl. At given incubation times, aliquots were removed, quenched with an equal volume of 4% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by HPLC. Heat denaturation was performed by submitting aliquots of the sample in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to increasing temperatures of 45, 55, and 65 °C for 1 h and finally quenching the sample with equal volumes of 4% trifluoroacetic acid. The fluorescence spectra of LCI were measured with a 650–40 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer) scanning from 300 to 450 nm with excitation at 280 nm. LCI was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations of denaturants (urea and GdnHCl). Denaturation of LCI was performed at 23 °C for 20 h. The final concentration of LCI was 2 μm. Fluorescence intensities of blank samples containing equivalent concentrations of the denaturant were also analyzed and subtracted from readings of the LCI samples. Isolated fractions of scrambled LCI (20 μg) were treated with 2 μg of thermolysin (Sigma, P-1512) in 30 μl of N-ethylmorpholine/acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.4). Digestions were carried out for 16 h at 37 °C for species X-LCI-g and at 50 °C for X-LCI-a. The reaction products were then fractionated by HPLC and analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the disulfide-containing peptides. The amino acid sequence of disulfide-containing peptides was analyzed by automated Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Procise sequencer (model 494) equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivate analyzer. The molecular mass of disulfide-containing peptides was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker Biflex TOF spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser with an emission wavelength of 337 nm). Denaturation of native LCI is defined by the conversion of the native structure to scrambled isomers. The denaturation curve was therefore generated by plotting the percentage of native LCI converted to scrambled isomers under increasing concentrations of a selected denaturant. In contrast, unfolding describes the state of the denatured LCI and is structurally defined by the composition of scrambled isomers. The LCI unfolding curves are determined by the relative concentrations of different scrambled isomers that exist along the unfolding pathway under increasing concentrations of a selected denaturant. Calculation of the yield of scrambled isomers was based on peak area integration. The data shown have a S. D. of ±5%. Native LCI was allowed to denature and unfold to form scrambled isomers in the presence of a thiol initiator and increasing concentrations of urea, GdnHCl, and GdnSCN. The HPLC profiles of the different states of unfolding are displayed in Fig. 1. Though it is not possible to determine how many scrambled isomers of LCI of the 104 possible ones populate the unfolded state, 9 of them, which amount to 90% of total denatured LCI, can be distinguished. They appear marked alphabetically in Fig. 1(a–i). The denaturation curves, calculated from the percentage of LCI converted to scrambled isomers, are shown in Fig. 2. Unfolding of LCI cooperatively occurs at 2–3 m GdnSCN with a midpoint at 2.4 m and at 3–4 m GdnHCl with a midpoint at 3.6 m. Based on the concentration that is required to achieve the same extent of denaturation, GdnSCN is about 1.5-fold more potent than GdnHCl. In contrast, urea is unable to denature the native LCI, because even at high concentration (8 m) the scrambled species are undetectable. Although urea is normally expected to be a weaker denaturant than GdnHCl (11Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar), LCI represents an extreme case in resistance to urea denaturation because even PCI, one of the more stable of the disulfide-containing proteins studied so far against urea denaturation, is about 50% denatured in 8 m urea (9Chang J.-Y., Li, L. Canals F. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Figure 2LCI denaturation curves. The denatured fraction is expressed as the percentage of LCI that is converted to scrambled isomers. The denaturants are GdnSCN (▴), GdnHCl (♦), and urea (●). Denaturation was carried out at 20 °C for 20 h in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (0.25 mm) and the indicated concentrations of denaturant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given the previous results obtained with the urea treatment and to ensure that no scrambled species hypothetically generated could have remained undetected, the behavior of the molecule upon urea and GdnHCl treatment was followed by fluorescence measurements. LCI contains two tryptophan residues at sequence positions 42 and 50. LCI exhibits increased fluorescence intensities when treated with increasing urea concentrations, albeit without any concomitant redshift. In contrast, treatment with 8 m GdnHCl generates a spectrum with decreased intensity and a clear redshift from 354 to 360 nm (Fig. 3). Since a displacement of the maximum of fluorescence, rather than a change in intensity, indicates denaturation, this observation supports the previously drawn conclusion that urea is unable to denature LCI. LCI was treated with increasing concentrations of methanol, allowing the reaction to reach equilibrium in 48 h. No denaturation at all was observed even at 65% methanol (data not shown). The same result was found when applying a standard heat denaturation procedure. Even at 65 °C with an incubation time of 1 h, no conversion of native LCI into denatured species was observed, supporting a previous observation of resonances related to the presence of three-dimensional structure by NMR at high temperatures (1Reverter D. Vendrell J. Canals Q. Horstmann J. Avilés F.X. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32927-32933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The pathway of LCI unfolding can be represented by plotting the relative concentrations of the scrambled isoforms of denatured LCI along the process. The data corresponding to the evolution of the nine scrambled LCI isomers in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl and GdnSCN are shown in Fig. 4. Because of the almost complete inability of urea to unfold LCI, the unfolding curves are not shown for this condition. The relative concentrations of X-LCI-a and X-LCI-b correlate with the strength of the denaturing conditions in both cases. This phenomenon is more easily observed in GdnSCN curves where an increase in the relative concentration of X-LCI-a from 10 to 45% is observed within the interval of 2–6 m GdnSCN, while an increase from 15 to 37% is observed within the interval of 3–6m GdnHCl. To a lower extent X-LCI-b shows the same phenomenon. X-LCI-f, X-LCI-g, and X-LCI-h show an inverse correlation between their relative abundances and the denaturing conditions. X-LCI-g shows the biggest differences (25–26% in a range of 1–6m GdnSCN). Among these three species, X-LCI-g is the most highly populated scrambled at low concentrations of GdnHCl (16%) and GdnSCN (25%). X-LCI-g is followed by X-LCI-f and X-LCI-h (both 14% in GdnSCN and 12 and 8% in GdnHCl, respectively). According to these results, it is possible to separate the scrambled isomers of LCI into two groups, which suffer a different kind of evolution along the unfolding pathway. Two species, X-LCI-a and X-LCI-g, which represent each population and show the higher relative concentration at extremes of denaturant concentration, were selected to further study their disulfide pairing and be structurally characterized. Along the unfolding pathway of LCI, 9 major fractions can be identified as scrambled isomers, distinguishable from a population of 104 possible isoforms (Fig. 1). They were separated by reverse-phase HPLC with a linear acetonitrile gradient. Two fractions, X-LCI-a and X-LCI-g, selected according to the aforementioned criteria, were further isolated and analyzed to determine their disulfide structures. After digestion with thermolysin, peptides were isolated by HPLC and characterized by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the disulfide pairing. Table I summarizes the sequence and mass spectrometry analyses of the peptides isolated after digestion of the two scrambled isomers.Table IStructures of disulfide-containing peptides derived from thermolysin digestion of scrambled LCIPeptideSequenceSequence positionCys–CysMr found (exp.)a-4LCYQPDQVC10–18Cys11–Cys181066.22 (1067.22)a-9GECNPHPTAPWCREGAVEWVP32–52Cys34 –Cys432333.59 (2333.09)TGQCRTTCIPYV55–66Cys58–Cys621339.56 (1339.61)ECNPHPTAPWC33–43Cys34–Cys431252.40 (1252.16)a-10AAPLPSEGECNPHPTAPWCREG25–46Cys34 –Cys432317.55 (2316.51)a-12DESFLCYQPDQVCCFICRGA6–25Cys11–Cys182293.61 (2294.56)Cys19–Cys22a-13DESFLCYQPDQVCCFICRGAAPLPSEGEC6–57Cys11 –Cys185740.39 (5739.97)NPHPTAPWCREGAVEWVPYSTGQCys19 –Cys22Cys34 –Cys43g-5CFI19–21Cys19–Cys341866.06 (1865.34)APLPSEGECNPHPTA26–40g-8CYQ11–13Cys11–Cys621328.58 (1328.72)RTTCIPYVE59–66WCREGAVEWVPYSTGQCRTT42–61Cys43–Cys582329.60 (2329.99)GAAPLPSEGECNP24–36Cys341241.34 (1241.27)g-9PDQVCCFICRGAAPLPSEGECN14–35Cys18 –Cys222309.65 (2309.94)Cys19 –Cys34g-11PWCREGAVEWVPYSTGQCRTT41–61Cys43 –Cys582426.72 (2426.39)Peptides a-n and g-n correspond, respectively, to thermolysin digestion products of X-LCI-a and X-LCI-g.

The complete sequences of each peptide are shown, and the residues analyzed by Edman degradation are underlined. Sequence numbering refers to the recombinant LCI that contains a construction-added Gly as the N-terminal residue. X-LCI-a was clearly identified as the beads-form isomer (contains Cys11–Cys18, Cys19–Cys22, Cys34–Cys43, and Cys58–Cys62 bonds) (Fig. 5) from the unambiguous results summarized in Table I. The structure of X-LCI-a was deduced from the identification of three major thermolytic peptides, a-4, a-10, and a-9, that showed an unique possible Cys pairing (Table I) consistent with sequencing and mass spectrometry. X-LCI-g adopts Cys11–Cys62, Cys18–Cys22, Cys19–Cys34, and Cys43–Cys58 pairing (Fig. 5). From the unambiguous analysis of peptide g-11, and according to its determined Mr (2426.39), Cys43–Cys58 was the first disulfide pair assigned. The analysis of g-5 showed two separated sequences bound by a unique disulfide pair, Cys19–Cys34. Both disulfide pairs helped to further define the pairing of peptides g-8 and g-9, whereas only one disulfide pair could fit out of a mixture of possibilities. Given that GdnHCl concentration was found to be proportional to the amount of denatured PCI in terms of accumulated scrambled species, the kinetics of unfolding of the native LCI was studied at different denaturant strengths (Fig. 6). The unfolding of LCI is complete in 120 min at 8 and 7 m GdnHCl, whereas it takes 300 min to complete in 6 m GdnHCl. A significant difference can thus be achieved by slightly modifying the concentration of certain denaturant. The rate constant of unfolding at 8 and 7m GdnHCl (3.3 × 10−3 min−1) is about 2.5-fold greater than that observed at 6 m GdnHCl (8.3 × 10−3 min−1). The denaturation curves obtained by representing the fraction of native LCI converted into the scrambled species under increasing concentrations of denaturants (chaotropic agents, organic solvents, and temperature) are indicative of the conformational stability of LCI. GdnHCl and GdnSCN denature LCI quantitatively in a cooperative manner at concentrations between 2–3 and 3–4 m, respectively, in accordance with the observations made in the case of cardiotoxin III (CTX-III) (12Chang J.-Y. Kumar T.K.S. Yu C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6745-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), an all β-sheet protein. These values are higher than those obtained for PCI, another disulfide-containing carboxypeptidase inhibitor (9Chang J.-Y., Li, L. Canals F. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that is almost devoid of any regular secondary structure, (13Rees D.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 475-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Clore G.M. Groneborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The higher concentration of denaturants required for LCI could reflect the contribution of secondary structure to the stability of the LCI fold. The higher stability of LCI compared with PCI is also shown by the fact that urea is unable to denature LCI, whereas PCI reaches 50% denaturation at 8 m urea (9Chang J.-Y., Li, L. Canals F. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At this point it should be mentioned that the increase in fluorescence intensity observed in urea-treated LCI (Fig. 3) is not indicative of denaturation, because no significant red shift is observed between 0 and 8 m. However, a red shift (from 354 to 360 nm) is clearly observed in the 8m GdnHCl-denatured LCI, which additionally shows a decreased fluorescence intensity. Thus, the increase in fluorescence intensity in urea-treated samples may be indicative of a different hydrophobic environment of tryptophan residues upon urea treatment generated by the dynamic relocation of secondary structure elements. PCI, although less stable than LCI, is still a very stable fold with its globular structure stabilized by a compact hydrophobic core and by three disulfide bridges forming a T-knot. Both carboxypeptidase inhibitors are designed to resist extreme external conditions and still be functional. The comparison between the stabilities of other disulfide-containing proteins studied by this method is shown in Table II and is expressed as the concentration of denaturant required to achieve 50% of denaturation of the protein. The following two crucial aspects of these data obtained with seven different disulfide-containing proteins need to be mentioned. 1) The extent of denaturation achieved by each fold is dependent upon the type of denaturant. GdnHCl is generally more potent than urea, albeit the relative potencies vary from protein to protein. The two extreme examples correspond to LCI (in which urea is unable to quantitatively unfold LCI) and TAP, where urea is more potent than GdnHCl. The clear difference of potency between urea and GdnHCl has been extensively reported and can be attributed to the differential mode of action between these denaturants, although the detailed mechanisms are not yet fully understood (15Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar, 11Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar, 16Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Thomson J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2564-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 17Liepinsh E. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 9670-9674Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is known that both denaturants disrupt noncovalent interactions that stabilize the native fold (18Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), mainly hydrophobic interactions, by causing water to become a better solvent for nonpolar amino acids. In addition to this common property, GdnHCl is a salt and also suppresses electrostatic interactions. The suppression of electrostatic interactions is fundamental to achieve unfolding of an all β-sheet protein, as is the case for LCI. 2) LCI is globally the more stable protein studied by this method as yet. In addition to the inability of urea to denature it, no denaturation was observed either with 65% methanol or by heat treatment (incubation at 65 °C for 1 h). The high stability of LCI arises from an optimal combination of disulfide-bonding, a compact hydrophobic core, and the high percentage of regular secondary structure. This high conformational stability of LCI in extreme conditions would greatly facilitate its application to human therapy as a profibrinolytic agent.Table IIConcentration of different denaturants required to achieve 50% of denaturation of several disulfide-containing ProteinsProteinGdnSCNGdnHClUreamLCI2.43.6No denaturationPCI0.71.45>8RNase A0.752.255.75TAP1.04.24.0IGF-11.53.25.5Hirudin25>8CTX-IIINot determined2.33.4These data were determined by the method of disulfide scrambling between the native and scrambled isomers. The data has a S.D. ± 5%. The references are described in the text. Open table in a new tab These data were determined by the method of disulfide scrambling between the native and scrambled isomers. The data has a S.D. ± 5%. The references are described in the text. The denatured LCI was found to be composed of at least 9 scrambled isomers out of the possible 104 (Fig. 1). The unfolding pathway of LCI was determined by the evolution of the scrambled isomers generated under increasing concentrations of GdnHCl and GdnSCN (Fig. 4). Although the absolute amounts of each scrambled in the unfolding pathway is characteristic of the denaturant assayed, the composition and evolution of the different scrambled species is comparable. This indicates that these scrambled species correspond to the main transient intermediates in the unfolding pathway of LCI. Since for an unfolding reaction the strong denaturation condition precludes the accumulation of any intermediate (19Matouschek A. Serrano L. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the characterization of unfolding intermediates is only possible in disulfide-containing proteins. There are two populations of scrambled species that undergo variations along the unfolding pathway. One accumulates under strong denaturing conditions. This was the case for X-LCI-a and to a lesser extent for X-LCI-b. The other population shows an inverse correlation between their relative abundances and the denaturing conditions. This is the case for X-LCI-f, X-LCI-h, and X-LCI-g, the latter being the most populated scrambled at low concentrations of denaturant. Following previous results obtained with PCI (9Chang J.-Y., Li, L. Canals F. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), TAP (8Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and insulin-growth factor (IGF-1) (10Chang J.-Y. Marki W. Lai P.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), an open or relaxed structure is expected to be found for the first population (including X-LCI-a and X-LCI-b) that could explain the prevalence of both forms in high concentration of denaturants. In contrast, the population represented by X-LCI-g should have another kind of non-native structure that turns unstable at high denaturant strength. These non-native structures are likely to be more compact than the unfolded state. The assignment of the disulfide structure of the most abundant scrambled species within each population has confirmed these hypotheses (Fig. 5). The identification of X-LCI-a as the beads-form isomer was already expected from similar results found with other proteins, such as PCI (9Chang J.-Y., Li, L. Canals F. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), TAP (8Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and IGF-1 (10Chang J.-Y. Marki W. Lai P.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which also show a predominance of the bead-form isomer under strong denaturing conditions. This can be due to a common pathway of unfolding where the polypetide chain undergoes a progressive expansion and relaxation toward the shape of linear structure. In contrast, X-LCI-g is an unstable intermediate with a quite compact non-native structure, since the N- and C- terminal ends of the molecule have already been brought together, as suggested by the pairing of disulfide bonds. The rate constant for unfolding of LCI at 7 and 8 m GdnHCl was found to be very similar, whereas it is about 2.5-fold lower at 6 m. Thus, a significant difference can be achieved by slightly modifying the concentration of certain denaturant. On the other hand, the variation of the rate constant of unfolding upon increasing concentrations of denaturants is not linear. This is in contrast not only with the behavior of proteins lacking disulfide-bonding (19Matouschek A. Serrano L. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but also with the unfolding kinetics of CTX-III (12Chang J.-Y. Kumar T.K.S. Yu C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6745-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in which there is a linear decrease of the rate constant for unfolding under denaturation by the same denaturant. The abrupt change in the rate constant for unfolding in LCI between 6 and 7 m GdnHCl could be an indication of the cooperative nature of the process and points out the relevance of hydrogen-bonding (regular secondary structure) in maintaining the native structure of LCI. On the other hand, the kinetics of LCI unfolding is about 15–25-fold slower than that of CTX-III (12Chang J.-Y. Kumar T.K.S. Yu C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6745-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This could be one of the explanations for the high stability of LCI, although a refolding kinetics analysis is needed to confirm this hypothesis. The results presented in this study confirm that LCI fulfills the basic requirements of high stability and slow kinetics of unfolding that are expected for a protein molecule with potential applications in human therapy."

Therefore, by physically interacting with each other, CKase and OTCase prevent the thermodenaturation of carbamoyl phosphate in the aqueous cytoplasmic environment. The thermal profile of several Pyrococcus proteins has been studied intensively (1Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 2Adams M.W. Annu. Rev.

Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar), but much less is known about the thermolabile substrates and products that these thermostable enzymes utilize (5Daniel R.M. Cowan D.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Zierenberg R.A. Adams M.W.W. Arp A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12961-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Most of these intermediate metabolites are identical to the ones found in mesophiles, yet many are extremely thermolabile, and in some cases, their degradation products are toxic to the cell. A case in point is carbamoyl phosphate (CP), 1The abbreviations used are: CPcarbamoyl phosphateOTCaseornithine carbamoyltransferaseCKasecarbamate kinase-like carbamoylphosphate synthetasePBSphosphate-buffered salineTBSTris-buffered saline a precursor of the pyrimidine and arginine pathways. Ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase; EC 2.1.3.3) carbamoylates ornithine to form citrulline, which is converted into arginine in two steps. Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2) catalyzes the condensation of CP and aspartate into carbamoyl aspartate in the committed step of pyrimidine biosynthesis. The decomposition of CP in aqueous solutions at high temperatures (7Allen C.M. Jones M.E. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) leads to the accumulation of cyanate, a powerful and indiscriminate carbamoylating agent. At 100 °C, where Pyrococcus furiosus reaches its highest growth rate, the half-life of CP is less than 2 s (8Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Piérard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, because CP is both extremely labile at high temperatures and potentially toxic, it would appear to require metabolic protection in vivo. carbamoyl phosphate ornithine carbamoyltransferase carbamate kinase-like carbamoylphosphate synthetase phosphate-buffered saline Tris-buffered saline Several examples exist that show that enzymes belonging to the same or related biochemical pathways are organized into functional complexes. These enzyme clusters can pass on products very efficiently without accomplishing a diffusion equilibrium with the bulk phase, a phenomenon called channeling (9Srivastava D.K. Bernhard S.A. Science. 1986; 234: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Srivastava D.K. Bernhard S.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

Relatively tight channeling could protect chemically labile intermediates and thus play a critical role in the physiology of thermophiles. Competition experiments between labeled CP produced by carbamate kinase-like carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CKase; EC 2.7.2.2) and unlabeled CP added to P. furiosus cell extracts showed a marked preference of OTCase for the utilization of CP synthesized by CKase (8Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Piérard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that CKase and OTCase associate to form a multienzyme complex able to channel this labile intermediate. Similar findings indicated the existence of channeling of CP to both aspartate carbamoyltransferase and OTCase in Thermus ZO5 (14Van de Casteele M. Legrain C. Desmarez L. Chen P.G. Piérard A. Glansdorff N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Comp. Physiol. 1997; 118: 463-473Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in the deep sea hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi (15Purcarea C. Evans D.R. Hervé G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6122-6129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, to date no evidence for physical interaction between the synthetase and the carbamoyltransferases had been obtained. In most prokaryotes, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.16) is a heterodimer. A small glutaminase subunit hydrolyzes glutamine and releases ammonia that is transferred to a large subunit, and the latter catalyzes CP synthesis in a complex reaction that also requires bicarbonate and MgATP (16Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 315-374PubMed Google Scholar, 17Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the archaeon P. furiosus, however, CP is synthesized directly from ammonia (8Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Piérard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the enzyme from the archaeon is enzymologically and structurally a carbamate kinase (18Durbecq V. Legrain C.

This situation is unprecedented in microbial CP biosynthesis. Most OTCases are homotrimeric. The OTCase from P. furiosus, however, is built of four trimers disposed in a tetrahedral manner similar to the dodecameric structure of the allosterically regulated OTCase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24Villeret V. Clantin B. Tricot C. Legrain C. Roovers M. Stalon V. Glansdorff N. Van Beeumen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Villeret V.

Thermal stabilization of the P. furiosus OTCase dodecamer results mainly from hydrophobic interactions at the interfaces between the catalytic trimers (24Villeret V. Clantin B. Tricot C. Legrain C.

Villeret V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3937-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When competition experiments (such as those referred to above) indicate shielding from the bulk aqueous phase, the interactions between enzymes should be sufficiently strong to become detectable by techniques designed to monitor the physical association of proteins. Affinity electrophoresis (27Beeckmans S. Van Driessche E. Kanarek L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) has already been used to demonstrate clustering between consecutive enzymes in the glycolytic pathway and the citric acid cycle (28Beeckmans S. Van Driessche E. Kanarek L. J. Mol. Recognit. 1993; 6: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This method allows the visualization of a direct interaction between two different proteins or enzymes in conditions that mimic the crowded intracellular environment (29Beeckmans S. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 19: 278-305Google Scholar), which is by now acknowledged to be quite different from in vitro conditions. Another widely used method for detecting protein interactions is co-immunoprecipitation. Because it can be performed with cell-free extracts, it permits the detection of multienzyme associations in a system where all cellular components are still present. Moreover, it can be used in combination with cross-linking reactions (30de Gunzburg J. Riehl R. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4007-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Prossnitz E. Nikaido K. Ulbrich S.J. Ames F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17917-17920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both techniques thus provide complementary information. In this work, we used both affinity electrophoresis and co-immunoprecipitation with and without a cross-linking agent to demonstrate a physical interaction between P. furiosus CKase and OTCase. We speculate that the interaction between CKase and OTCase is essential for the survival of this extreme thermophilic archaeon, because the direct channeling of CP not only allows for efficient synthesis of proteins but also protects the cell against the thermodegradation of CP into cyanate.

Yeast cells were grown in a 15-liter batch of galactose-containing (1%) medium 164 (36Messenguy F. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 49-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a Biolafitte fermentor. Cells were grown at 30 °C up to a density of about 4 × 107 cells ml−1. P. furiosus CKase was purified from recombinant S. cerevisiae cells as described by Uriarte et al. (21Uriarte M. Marina A. Ramón-Maiques S. Rubio V. Durbecq V. Legrain C. Glansdorff N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 331: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). P. furiosus OTCase was purified from recombinant S. cerevisiae cells as described by Legrain et al. (37Legrain C. Villeret V. Roovers M. Tricot C. Clantin B. Van Beeumen J. Stalon V. Glansdorff N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 331: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using arginine-Sepharose chromatography for the last purification step. Escherichia coli OTCase was purified as described previously (38Legrain C. Stalon V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). P. furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase was purified directly from the archaeon itself (39Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Politi L. Vaccaro R., De Rosa M. Scandurra R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 10 g (wet mass) of frozen Pyrococcus cells were thawed in 10 ml of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with 2.5 mg of DNase. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonic oscillation (10 min, 250 watts, 10 kHz). The suspension was then centrifuged for 60 min at 45,000 rpm. The supernatant was applied on a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (AmershamBiosciences FPLC), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 100 mmNaHCO3. No CKase or OTCase activity could be detected in the pooled fractions. All other proteins were from Sigma. It was verified that none of the used protein solutions showed CKase or OTCase activity. Electrophoresis under native and denaturing conditions (SDS, β-mercaptoethanol) was performed on 8–25% gradient gels with the Phast System (AmershamBiosciences). Analytical isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed with IEF pH 3.0–9.0 gels at 15 °C. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. CKase activity was determined using a coupled assay with partially purified E. coli OTCase at 60 °C (40Legrain C. Villeret V. Roovers M. Gigot D. Dideberg O. Piérard A. Glansdorff N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). E. coli OTCase is stable at this temperature (41Stalon V. Ramos F. Piérard A. Wiame J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 2 ml: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 200 mm NH4Cl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mmATP·Na2, 6 mm l-ornithine, 40 mm NaHCO3, and 200 units of E. coliOTCase. After a 20-min incubation the reaction was stopped, and the citrulline product was determined by the method of Prescott and Jones (42Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). OTCase activity was determined by measuring the formation of citrulline at 60 °C (37Legrain C. Villeret V. Roovers M. Tricot C. Clantin B. Van Beeumen J. Stalon V. Glansdorff N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 331: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm l-ornithine, and 10 mm carbamoyl phosphate. After 5 min the reaction was stopped, and the formed citrulline was determined. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity was measured at 40 °C by following the appearance of NADPH at 340 nm (39Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Politi L. Vaccaro R., De Rosa M. Scandurra R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 1.0 ml of 100 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 2 mm NADP, and 10 mm l-glutamate (μ = 6.22 μmol/OD·min). One enzyme unit is the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate to product per h. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Lowry et al. (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by UV absorption compared with a bovine serum albumin standard. Antibodies against pure CKase and OTCase were obtained from the Laboratory of Hormonology, Centre d'Economie Rurale in Marloie, Belgium. The antibodies, raised in rabbits, were tested by the Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion technique and by dot-blot (Bio-Rad). It was shown that the raised antibodies were specific for their respective antigens. The rabbit serum was cleared with bruto yeast extract. All proteins were covalently immobilized on Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) activated with CNBr (0.4g of CNBr/g of Sepharose 4B) as described previously (29Beeckmans S. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 19: 278-305Google Scholar, 45Beeckmans S. Kanarek L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Proteins to be coupled were diluted to 2 mg/ml in 100 mmNaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.2, and 1 g of Sepharose per 10 mg of protein was used. After coupling, the gels carrying the proteins were washed with 100 mm NaHCO3 and stored at 4 °C. Affinity electrophoresis was performed in 92 mmVeronal buffer, pH 8.5 (or 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5), as described previously (27Beeckmans S. Van Driessche E. Kanarek L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Beeckmans S. Van Driessche E. Kanarek L. J. Mol. Recognit. 1993; 6: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Strips at the bottom of the 1% agarose layer in Veronal buffer, pH 8.5, were replaced by a mixture of 1% agarose (0.2 ml/cm2) with protein coupled to Sepharose. The amount of Sepharose with immobilized protein corresponded to 0.45 mg of protein/cm2. Under the strips with immobilized protein, enzyme at a concentration of 6 mg/ml was loaded (5 μl/hole). Electrophoresis was performed at 120 V during about 20 h for mobile CKase or OTCase, using a LBK 2117 Multiphor II flatbed electrophoresis unit equipped with a cooling plate that was maintained at 22 °C. The mobile enzyme was stained directly in the gel after electrophoresis. For OTCase a histochemical and an immunochemical staining procedure was used; for CKase only the immunochemical staining could be used. For histochemical staining, gels were soaked in an OTCase reaction mixture (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CP, and 4 mm l-ornithine) at 37 °C over 30 min. The gel was thoroughly washed with distilled water. Formed orthophosphate was finally precipitated with 3 mm Pb(NO3)2 dissolved in 50 mm d,l-histidine at pH 7.0. For immunochemical staining, agarose gels were soaked in 10 mmphosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3, containing the respective antiserum in 1:500 dilution. After a 3-h incubation at 25 °C, the gels were washed five times for 15 min each with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and once for 15 min with PBS. The gel was further incubated for 1 h in a PBS solution containing 0.5 mg/ml protein A-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). The gels were again washed (five times for 15 min each with PBST and once for 15 min with PBS). A colored precipitate was formed on the addition of BCIP/NBT (165 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate·Na2 toluidine and 330 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgCl2, and 100 mmNaCl). Immunoprecipitations were performed from unlabeled sources (46Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 221-265Google Scholar). P. furiosus extracts were prepared by simply suspending P. furiosus cells (freshly grown or from stock at −80 °C) in 10 mmphosphate, pH 7.2, or 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.2, with DNase and incubating them for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min) the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation experiments. 500 μl of cell-free extracts of P. furiosus (∼50 mg/ml total protein) were incubated with 1 μl of polyclonal rabbit antibodies against either CKase or OTCase for 1 h on ice. The immune complexes were purified with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma). The protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were suspended in lysis buffer and washed several times with lysis buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin to eliminate aspecific binding to the Sepharose beads. 100 μl of a 10% (v/v) protein A slurry (in 1% bovine serum albumin/lysis buffer) were added and incubated for 1 h. The complexes were precipitated by centrifugation for 15–30 s at 12,000 × g in a standard table top centrifuge. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) to remove unbound proteins and then dissolved in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 20 min and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) in a Bio-Rad electrophoresis unit at 120 V for about 1 h and 15 min. The separated polypeptide chains were blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (16–20 h, 15–20 V, at 4 °C). The nitrocellulose membrane was successively washed with 1% bovine serum albumin/TBS for 1 h, washed with TBS for 10 min, incubated with a 500× dilution rabbit anti-CKase or anti-OTCase in TBST, washed six times for 10 min each with TBST, incubated with a 7000× dilution goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) for 30 min in TBST, washed three times 10 min with TBST, and washed once for 15 min with TBS before color precipitation with BCIP/NBT (Sigma). Cross-linking was performed on P. furiosus extracts with 1% formaldehyde in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 30 min at room temperature. After adding Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, to a final concentration of 50 mm, cross-linked samples were further used in the immunoprecipitation experiments. To provide an independent and more quantitative determination of the affinity of both pyrococcal enzymes for each other, the IAsys system (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK) was used (47Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosens. Bioelectron. 1993; 8: 347-364Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 48Buckle P.E. Davies R.D. Kinning T. Yeung D. Edwards P.R. Pollard-Knight D. Lowe C.R. Biosens. Bioelectron. 1993; 8: 365-370Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were immobilized onto a cuvette with a biotin surface through avidin or streptavidin. Cuvettes with only avidin or streptavidin were negative controls for binding studies. Fig. 1compares the migration of free OTCase through a strip containing immobilized CKase and underivatized Sepharose 4B. After migration, histochemical staining (precipitation of orthophosphate) revealed the OTCase in the gel. Compared with the strip containing underivatized Sepharose, the immobilized CKase was effective in binding the migrating OTCase, thus indicating an interaction between these consecutive enzymes of the arginine metabolic pathway. Similar results were obtained when OTCase was detected immunochemically after electrophoresis through a strip containing immobilized CKase (Fig. 2, lane 2). Reciprocal experiments with CKase migrating through strips containing immobilized OTCase or underivatized Sepharose 4B gave similar indications for an interaction between the two enzymes (not shown). To test the specificity of the observed interaction between CKase and OTCase, several control proteins were used (Fig. 2). P. furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase (lane 4) does not appear to interact with OTCase migrating through the gel, and neither do aspartate aminotransferase (lane 3), immunoglobulin G (lane 5), or bovine serum albumin (lane 6). Hence, free OTCase does not show affinity for the immobilized control proteins, indicating that the interaction between CKase and OTCase is specific. However, Beeckmans et al. (28Beeckmans S. Van Driessche E. Kanarek L. J. Mol. Recognit. 1993; 6: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) pointed out that proteins with comparable isoelectric points should be used as controls to avoid aspecific interactions due to electrostatic behavior. Indeed, lysozyme (not shown), cytochrome c (not shown), and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (lane 8) do show interaction with free migrating OTCase and CKase. All these control enzymes have a high pI (>8) compared with the pI values of CKase and OTCase, which themselves are similar (5.1 and 5.3, respectively). Free migrating OTCase shows affinity for mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (lane 8) but not to the cytoplasmic isoenzyme, which has a lower pI (lane 7). This indicates that the interactions between OTCase and enzymes with high pI, structurally totally unrelated, is probably electrostatic and aspecific. However, the interaction between P. furiosus CKase and OTCase appears specific, as these enzymes have very comparable isoelectric points and do not interact with control proteins with similar pI values. P. furiosus cells (freshly grown or from a frozen stock) disrupt spontaneously without sonication or any other treatment when dissolved in buffer. When concentrated P. furiosus extracts were prepared in this way and kept in a buffer of low ionic strength and low salt concentration, a CKase·OTCase complex could be precipitated as displayed in Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2. Lane 1 shows the co-immunoprecipitation of OTCase (lower panel, Immunoblot with anti-OTCase) when the CKase was precipitated (upper panel, Immunoblot with anti-CKase) with an anti-CKase. Likewise, the immunoprecipitation of OTCase resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of CKase (Fig. 3, lane 2). However, only with highly concentrated extracts (∼50 mg/ml protein) could clear co-immunoprecipitation results be obtained. When the P. furiosus cell-free extracts were prepared by sonication, co-immunoprecipitation of the CKase·OTCase complex was not observed; however, when these extracts prepared by sonication were incubated at 60 °C for a few minutes prior to co-immunoprecipitation, the CKase·OTCase complex apparently reformed and could be precipitated (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). The experiments included controls for the total amount of each protein. This was achieved by immunoprecipitating and immunoblotting with the cognate antibody. Comparing the amount of co-immunoprecipitated protein with the total amount of that protein gave an indication about the amount of protein in the complex. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were tested in several buffers ranging from a 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.2, to a 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, without salt or up to 150 mm NaCl. The best immunoprecipitation results were obtained using a buffer with a low ionic strength (50 mm phosphate or Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) and a low salt concentration (0–100 mm NaCl). When the ionic strength of the buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) or the salt concentration was too high (150 mm NaCl), co-immunoprecipitation was not observed. These data suggest that the CKase·OTCase complex is easily disrupted in vitro. The relatively weak interaction between CKase and OTCase could be captured when the cell-free extracts were incubated with the cross-linking agent formaldehyde prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3,lanes 9 and 10). Formaldehyde covalently links enzymes that are in close association. Hence, existing CKase·OTCase complexes should undergo fixation and could be easily co-immunoprecipitated, whereas without cross-linking the interaction between CKase and OTCase could be partially disrupted, and the two enzymes would not co-immunoprecipitate as readily. Yeast strains expressing only one of the two pyrococcal enzymes, CKase (Fig. 3,lanes 3, 7, and 11) or OTCase (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 8, and 12), were used in parallel in the immunoprecipitations as references in the immunoblots and as extra controls for the specificity of the antibodies. The influence of CP precursors (ATP, MgCl2, NaHCO3, NH4Cl) ornithine and citrulline on a complex formation was investigated by adding them in excess to the extracts. However, no influence of the substrates was observed. To enhance complex formation, we added excess free enzyme to the cell-free extracts prior to co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). 0.125 mg of purified enzyme (CKase or OTCase) was added to 0.5 ml of cell-free extract. When anti-OTCase was used to precipitate OTCase, excess free CKase was added in vitro. This resulted in a better co-immunoprecipitation of CKase (Fig. 4, lane 6) compared with the co-immunoprecipitation without excess free enzyme (Fig. 4,lanes 8 and 9). Adding excess free OTCase had no effect on the co-immunoprecipitation result (Fig. 4,lane 7). Lane 2 of Fig. 4shows a better co-immunoprecipitation of OTCase when excess pure OTCase was added to the cell-free extract compared with the co-immunoprecipitation without excess free OTCase (Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 4), but the effect was much smaller for OTCase than for CKase. As extra control, P. furiosus extract was immunoprecipitated with unrelated rabbit antibodies (Fig. 4, lane 5). In conclusion, although the interaction between CKase and OTCase seems to be weak, clear co-immunoprecipitation of the CKase·OTCase complex was observed when used in combination with cross-linking or the addition of excess free enzyme. Together with the affinity electrophoresis results, evidence is provided for a biologically significant physical interaction between CKase and OTCase from P. furiosus. The channeling of metabolic intermediates through functional complexes of enzymes has been proposed to operate in various metabolic pathways and could be a universal feature in molecular physiology. Whereas strong support for channeling between enzymes of thermophiles has been obtained from kinetic studies, evidence for physical interaction between individual enzymes not associated in a stable, permanent complex has been lacking. Here, we present the first evidence for a physical interaction between two hyperthermophilic enzymes for which kinetic evidence had suggested that these enzymes channel a highly thermolabile and potentially toxic intermediate (8Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Piérard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In affinity electrophoresis experiments, purified CKase or OTCase was allowed to diffuse electrophoretically through a strip containing immobilized OTCase or CKase, respectively, and enzyme localization was performed by assaying enzymatic activity or by immunochemical staining. The resulting association between CKase and OTCase was shown to be specific to the extent that OTCase did not interact with other metabolically unrelated immobilized proteins with a comparable pI. Affinity electrophoresis thus provides direct support for the hypothesis that CKase and OTCase can interact and form aggregates in vivo. Further evidence for a biologically significant interaction between CKase and OTCase was obtained by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In these experiments, only a fraction of CKase was shown to coprecipitate with OTCase and vice versa, suggesting relatively weak, unstable interactions. We performed immunoprecipitations in buffers with varying ionic strength and with different salt concentrations. The best indications for an association between CKase and OTCase were obtained at lower ionic strength and lower salt concentrations, indicative of relatively weak interactions, at least in vitro. Similar findings were reported by Caspary et al. (49Caspary F. Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Séraphin B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3463-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for the interaction between two proteins involved in RNA splicing. Using the IAsys technology with immobilized CKase or OTCase, we were unable to obtain a more quantitative appreciation of the observed interaction between the two enzymes. The interaction between CKase and OTCase is probably too weak to be detected by this technique. The yield of co-immunoprecipitate was increased when the extract was pretreated with a cross-linking agent, or when excess pure enzyme was added to the cell extracts. By using a cross-linking agent such as formaldehyde, possible enzyme-enzyme interactions can be stabilized prior to immunoprecipitation, increasing the yield of the binding partners in the co-immunoprecipitate. Another approach to increasing the yield of the co-immunoprecipitate is to add excess pure enzyme in vitro, thereby driving complex formation. Adding free CKase to the extract resulted in a much better co-immunoprecipitation of this enzyme. A similar approach was used by Huang et al.(50Huang S. Lee W.-H. Lee E.Y.-H. P. Nature. 1991; 350: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) to identify proteins associated with the human retinoblastoma susceptibility protein. When extracts were prepared by sonication, no co-immunoprecipitate was observed. Burns (51Burns V.W. Science. 1964; 146: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) showed previously that gentle sonication of yeast cells stopped both purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis during the sonication period, suggesting that sonication disrupted multienzyme complexes, resulting in the interruption of these biosynthetic processes. However, in P. furiosus extracts prepared by sonication, the CKase·OTCase complex is reformed after incubation at a higher temperature. Together with the cross-linking results, this suggests that a very significant fraction of the cognate enzymes associates in vivo. Channeling efficiency appears to increase with the temperature as shown by isotopic competition experiments in P. furiosus and P. abyssi (8Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Piérard A.

Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was obtained from kinetic experiments, and we provide evidence for the formation of an enzyme complex directing the channeling of CP in P. furiosus. This suggests that CP channeling is widespread. However, the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases from bacteria, fungi, and mammals are structurally very different from the CKase from Pyrococcus. It is interesting that during evolution, CP channeling has developed with structurally different enzymes in different organisms. The evidence presented here for physical interaction between CKase and OTCase from P. furiosus corroborates predictions made from kinetic analysis and provides a basis for future, more quantitative experiments.

This post-transcriptional activity is dependent in part on the binding of this protein to cis-regulatory sequences termed the Rex-response element (XRE). We have proposed previously that the decreased functionality exhibited by Rex in human lymphoblastoid Jurkat T cells may be linked to alterations in the Rex/XRE interactions. The analysis of the ribonucleoprotein complexes formed between Jurkat nuclear proteins and XRE-RNA led to the identification of a 36-kDa protein as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1. In vitro binding assays revealed that hnRNP A1 proteins were found to interfere with the binding of Rex to XRE, whereas nuclear extracts depleted of these proteins were unable to disrupt Rex-XRE complexes. Furthermore, A1 proteins from Jurkat cells were acting in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the amount of these RNA-binding proteins is a critical parameter in controlling Rex activity. We indeed observed a lower level of hnRNP A1 in in vitro HTLV-1-transformed virus-producing T cells than that detected in Jurkat cells. Likewise, overexpression of hnRNP A1 proteins in 293T cells and in Jurkat cells led to a decrease in the expression of a reporter gene dependent on Rex/XRE interactions. Such a decrease was not observed when the expression of the same reporter gene by cells overexpressing hnRNP A1 was dependent on the interactions of human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein with the Rev-response element. These findings indicate that hnRNP A1 by competing with Rex for the formation of REX-XRE complexes is specifically involved in the modulation of the post-transcriptional activity of Rex.

Such a decrease was not observed when the expression of the same reporter gene by cells overexpressing hnRNP A1 was dependent on the interactions of human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein with the Rev-response element. These findings indicate that hnRNP A1 by competing with Rex for the formation of REX-XRE complexes is specifically involved in the modulation of the post-transcriptional activity of Rex. The replication of complex retroviruses is controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, by specific regulatory proteins encoded by the viral genome (1Cullen B.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Green P.L. Chen I.S.Y. Levy J.A. The Retroviridae. 3. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 277-311Crossref Google Scholar, 3Parslow T.G.

Thus, cytoplasmic expression of spliced and unspliced transcripts encoding the gag-pol and env gene products is dependent on a RNA-binding viral protein, the 27-kDa Rex protein of human T cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1), 1The abbreviations used are: HTLV-1, human T cell leukemia virus type 1; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; XRE, Rex-response element; RRE, Rev-response element; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered solution; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; DTT, dithiothreitol; nt, nucleotide. or the 19-kDa Rev of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1). The post-transcriptional activity of both proteins is dependent on their interactions with RNA cis-acting sequences, referred to as the Rex-response element (XRE) and the Rev-response element (RRE), respectively. These proteins display two functional domains, an N-terminal basic domain, acting mainly as a sequence-specific RNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich domain termed the activation domain, acting as a nuclear export signal. These leucine-rich sequences are interchangeable between Rex and Rev, underlining that the specificity of each protein relies on the interaction of the RNA-binding domain with its response element (5Bogerd H.P.

Virol. 1992; 66: 2583-2587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported previously (9Hamaia S. Casse H. Gazzolo L. Duc Dodon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8514-8521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that Rex functionality was impaired in lymphoblastoid Jurkat T cells, as shown by the failure of these cells to produce HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins after transfection with a Rex/XRE-dependent env construct together with a Rex expression plasmid. Conversely, synthesis of HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins was observed in Jurkat cells transfected with a Rev/RRE-dependent env construct together with a Rev expression plasmid. These results therefore indicated that the inability of these lymphoblastoid cells to support Rex function is linked to the deficiency of this viral regulatory protein to bind its response element. They in turn pointed to host cell proteins that would interfere with Rex/XRE interactions. In the present study, we report that nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells are able to bind the XRE sequences. Purification on RNA affinity column and immunoblot analysis showed that one of these proteins with an apparent mass of 36-kDa is hnRNP A1. We then demonstrated that hnRNP A1-containing nuclear extracts are able to compete with Rex for binding to XRE-RNA using in vitro binding assays. Furthermore, nuclear extracts immunodepleted of hnRNP A1 were unable to disrupt Rex-XRE complexes. In these experiments, the amount of these RNA-binding proteins appears to be a critical parameter in controlling Rex activity. We indeed observed a lower level of hnRNP A1 in in vitro HTLV-1-transformed virus-producing T cells than that detected in Jurkat cells. Finally, overexpression of hnRNP A1 in 293T cells was found to correlate with an inhibition of XRE-dependent mRNA accumulation in the cytoplasm of these cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that hnRNP A1 inhibits Rex intervention in the cytoplasmic expression of genomic and singly spliced HTLV-1 mRNAs. Jurkat lymphoblastoid T cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 20 IU/ml penicillin, 20 μg/ml streptomycin. We used in this study three HTLV-1-transformed T cell lines, C91PL (10Popovic M. Lange-Wantzin G. Mann D. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5402-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), MT2 (11Miyoshi I. Kubonishi I. Yoshimoto S. Akagi T. Ohtsuki Y. Shiraishi Y. Nagata K. Hinuma Y. Nature. 1981; 294: 770-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), and HUT-102 (12Gazdar A.F. Carney D.N. Bunn P.A. Russell E.F. Jaffe E.S. Schecter G.P. Guccion J.G. Blood. 1980; 55: 409-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were cultured in complete RPMI medium. Cord blood lymphocytes were isolated from freshly collected heparinized cord blood by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. Adherent cells were removed by incubation of the cells for 1 h at 37 °C on a plastic Petri dish (Falcon). Non-adherent cells seeded at 2 × 106 cells/ml were stimulated with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Welcome reagent Ldt) and expanded in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 units/ml interleukin-2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). One week later, analysis by flow cytometry showed that more than 90% of these cells were CD4+T lymphocytes. The human epithelial 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 20 IU/ml penicillin, 20 μg/ml streptomycin. These cells seeded at 1.2 × 105 cells per well of a 12-well plate were transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (13Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were transfected by using the X-tremeGENE Q2 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the procedure described by the manufacturer. The amount of plasmid used in each transfection assay is indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, resuspended in 60 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.7% Nonidet P-40), and lysed by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Lysates were used to monitor protein expression and to evaluate CAT activity (14Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTecniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). The values of CAT activity, obtained from the same amount of protein, are the means of three experiments performed in triplicate with the standard deviation of the means. In Jurkat cells, the transfection efficiency was assessed by transfecting 100 ng of the RSV-SEAP plasmid in each assay. The obtained values were then normalized related to values of SEAP activity as determined by using a chemiluminescent reporter kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were prepared according to the procedure of Andrews and Faller (15Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), derived from the technique described by Dignam et al. (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts were then dialyzed against extraction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The nuclear extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 25,000 × g, and protein concentration was determined by the standard Bradford method. These extracts were stored at −80 °C, until use. Depletion of hnRNP A1 from the nuclear extract of Jurkat cells was performed through the use of immunomagnetic beads. Briefly, nuclear extracts (15 μg) were incubated with 0.5 μl of either the mouse anti-hnRNP A1 monoclonal antibody 4B10 or a monoclonal antibody isotypic (IgG 2b) control (Immunotech) or of extraction buffer, in a final volume of 30 μl with this buffer. After an incubation for 30 min on ice, immunomagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal) coated with goat anti-mouse IgG (2 × 106 beads/assay) were added. Each sample was then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were then removed with a magnet, and Dynabeads M-450 were added again. Another incubation was performed for 30 min at 4 °C. After removing the beads, unbound nuclear proteins were collected, assayed for hnRNP A1 content by Western blot analysis, and immediately used in binding experiments. The HTLV-1 Rex coding sequence was PCR-amplified with the following oligonucleotide primers: sense 5′-GCGCATATGCCCAAGACCCG-3′ (introducing an NdeI site on ATG) and antisense 5′-GCGCGGTATCCGGGAACATTGGTG-3′. The PCR-amplified fragment was inserted into the vector pET8c(His)6 (a gift of P. Chavrier, INSERM, Marseille, France). Escherichia coli strain BL-21(DE3)Lys containing pET8c-Rex was induced with isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm during the exponential phase growth (with an A600 of 0.5) of the bacterial culture for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then frozen and thawed in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 8. After repeated sonications of the bacterial extract followed by a spin for 15 min at 10,000 ×g, the proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column chelating resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant proteins were eluted in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm KCl, and 500 mm imidazole. After determination of protein concentration by the standard Bradford method, fractions were stored at −80 °C. Plasmids referred to as pKS-XRE and pKS-RRE were constructed by excision with ClaI of the complete XRE and RRE sequences, from the two respective variants of PDM138 (17Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Klein N.P. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6001-6007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences were then reinserted into the ClaI site of the plasmid BluescriptKSII+ (Stratagene) located between the T3 and T7 promoters. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. To generate biotinylated RNAs, pKS-XRE and pKS-RRE templates were linearized with Hin dIII and XhoI, respectively, and were transcribed using the in vitro transcription kit (Promega) in the presence of equal amounts of biotin-21-UTP (CLONTECH) and UTP to ensure incorporation of two biotin molecules per transcript. Biotinylated RNAs were purified by passage through Quick spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Radiolabeled XRE-RNA probes were obtained by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. A typical reaction was carried out in 20 μl of T7 polymerase buffer containing 0.2 μg/μl DNA template, ATP, GTP, and CTP, 2.5 mm each, 100 μm UTP, and 50 μCi [α-32P]UTP at 3,000 Ci/mmol (ICN Biomedicals) with 1 μl of RNA polymerase (20 units/μl; Promega). After purification, the labeled RNA was heat-denatured (85 °C for 2 min) and re-natured at room temperature for 20 min before use. The pFLAG-hnRNP A1 expression vector was generated by PCR, using the primer CGGGATCCATGGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGTCACAGTCTCCTAAAGA coding for both the FLAG coding sequence and part of the N terminus of hnRNP A1, and the primer GGAATTCTTAAAATCTTCTGCCACT, complementary to the 3′ end of the hnRNP A1 cDNA. The PCR-amplified product was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The truncated hnRNP A1 ΔC was similarly constructed using a PCR-amplified fragment that represents hnRNP A1 (amino acids 1–245). The pCAT-XRE and pCAT-RRE plasmids were derived from the reporter plasmid pDM138 containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and the XRE or the RRE sequences (17Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Klein N.P. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6001-6007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They express, under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, a two-exon, one-intron precursor RNA in which the CAT gene and the XRE or the RRE are located within the intron (see Fig. 6A). The rex and rev expression plasmids, containing the wild type Rex or Rev sequences under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, were gifts from B. C. Cullen. The control plasmid pCMV was constructed as described previously (18Diaz J.J. Duc Dodon M. Schaerer-Uthurralt N. Simonin D. Kindbeiter K. Gazzolo L. Madjar J.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (4 μg) were separated by SDS-10% PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.22-μm pore size, Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane, first blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% dry milk and 1 mm DTT for 1 h, was washed with a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Proteins immobilized on the membrane were denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and slowly renatured on the membrane by diluting the denaturation buffer during consecutive washes of 10 min each. 32P-XRE RNA probe (1 × 106 cpm) was then incubated with the renatured membrane-bound proteins at 25 °C for 1 h. After three washes to remove the unbound probe, membranes were autoradiographed at −70 °C for 1 h. Biotinylated RNA transcripts were immobilized on streptavidin beads (Dynabeads M-280, Dynal), and the RNA affinity beads were equilibrated in buffer containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 12% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF. A 1-ml volume of Jurkat nuclear extract supplemented with 0.1 mg of heparin was added to the beads and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The mixture was extensively washed with 100 volumes of buffer containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 1m NaCl, and then dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 4% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF buffer. The eluate was then concentrated to ∼50 μl using Centricon-10 (Amicon) concentrators. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Different amounts of Jurkat nuclear extracts were incubated for 10 min on ice with biotinylated XRE-RNA (200 ng) and with recombinant Rex protein (10 ng) in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer 2.5 mmEDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 12% glycerol, 1 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 80 units/ml RNasin, 0.2 mg/ml heparin, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT. Then, 100 μl of streptavidin-coated Dynabeads M-280 (8 × 107/ml) blocked with yeast tRNA were added, and samples were rocked for 2.5 h. The beads were washed four times in the same buffer containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 using a magnet. Bound proteins were released from beads in SDS-sample loading buffer, and protein complexes were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The indicated amounts of nuclear extracts were suspended into SDS sample loading buffer. Transiently transfected cells were lysed in SDS sample loading buffer, and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE. They were subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (BA, Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was then blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (PBS and 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented 10% nonfat powdered milk and probed with the appropriate antibody diluted in blocking buffer plus 10% nonfat powdered milk. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-Rex antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-hnRNP A1, and anti-hnRNP C antibodies (4B10 and 4F4, respectively; gifts from G. Dreyfuss), control murine IgG2b antibody (Immunotech), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-U1 snRNP (H111, gift from R. Lührmann), followed with an anti-rabbit (Immunotech, France) or anti-mouse (Dako) immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Blots were then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Bands were visualized by using Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with Triton X-100 as described previously (18Diaz J.J. Duc Dodon M. Schaerer-Uthurralt N. Simonin D. Kindbeiter K. Gazzolo L. Madjar J.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG or 4B10 antibody was diluted in 5% goat serum and added to cells for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Dako) were added to cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed and examined under a microscope. To approach the molecular mechanisms underlying the decreased functionality of the Rex protein in Jurkat lymphoblastoid T cells, we investigated whether nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells were able to recognize XRE sequences. To that aim, we elected to use an RNA selection assay in which biotinylated RNA obtained by in vitro transcription was adsorbed to streptavidin-agarose beads and then incubated for 3 h with the recombinant Rex protein. The biotinylated ribonucleoprotein complexes were then isolated on streptavidin-coated beads, and the amount of Rex bound to the RNA probe was assessed by Western blot analysis. Thus, Rex was shown to bind an XRE-RNA probe but not to an antisense XRE-RNA probe (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 3). The addition of nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells led to a decreased amount of Rex bound to the XRE-RNA probe (compare lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, we confirmed previous data demonstrating that Rex binds the RRE (19Unge T. Solomin L. Mellini M. Derse D. Felber B. Pavlakis G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7145-7149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and we showed that this viral protein interacted with biotinylated RRE-RNA of HIV-1 (lane 5). Interestingly, the formation of Rex-RRE complexes was not altered after addition of nuclear proteins (compare lanes 5 and 6). Since cellular proteins have been shown to bind the RRE (Ref. 20Shukla R.R. Kimmel P.L. Kumar A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2224-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), this observation indicates in turn that they are unable to prevent Rex accessing the RRE. To characterize further the interference of nuclear proteins with Rex binding to the XRE, biotinylated XRE-RNA was incubated for 3 h with increasing amounts of the recombinant Rex protein (up to 3 ng) either alone or together with an identical amount (1.5 μg) of nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells. Under these conditions, the amount of Rex bound to the XRE probe was found to decrease gradually (Fig. 1B). To note that Rex was stable in the presence of nuclear extract as assessed by Western blot analysis of the biotin supernatant (see Fig. 1B, inset, lane 2). They results clearly underline that XRE-binding nuclear proteins from Jurkat T cells specifically interfere with the binding of Rex to its response element. To identify the XRE-binding nuclear proteins from Jurkat T cells, nuclear extracts were submitted to a Northwestern blotting analysis by using a radiolabeled XRE probe. The autoradiography revealed that, beside several minor proteins, three main proteins with apparent molecular masses of 94, 36, and 30 kDa, respectively, were found to bind the XRE RNA (Fig. 2A). We focused our attention on the 36-kDa protein, mainly because of the presence in the XRE of a UAGGUA sequence related to the consensus hnRNP A1-binding site (21Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). RNA affinity chromatography was performed in which Jurkat nuclear proteins were incubated with biotinylated XRE-RNA immobilized on beads. Analysis of bound proteins from this RNA affinity column was performed by Sypro-red staining of an SDS-electrophoresis gel and revealed the presence of four main bands, with an apparent molecular mass of 95, 60, 55, and 36 kDa (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis of these proteins in the presence of the 4B10 monoclonal antibody to hnRNP A1 clearly showed that the 36-kDa protein was indeed reactive (Fig. 2B, lane 1) with that antibody but not with the hnRNP C antibody (lane 2). These observations clearly indicate the presence of hnRNP A1 on the XRE-RNA. Next, in vitro binding assays using biotinylated XRE-RNA were performed, in which a constant amount of recombinant Rex was incubated with different amounts of nuclear proteins. After isolation of the biotinylated RNP complexes on streptavidin-coated beads and extensive washings, the relative amounts of Rex and of hnRNP A1 within the RNP complexes were evaluated by Western blot analysis, by successively probing the membranes with the anti-Rex and the anti-hnRNP A1 antibodies. Under these conditions, the amount of Rex bound to the XRE probe was gradually reduced, after incubation with two different amounts (1 and 10 μg) of Jurkat nuclear proteins (Fig. 3). This decrease was found to correlate with an increase in the amounts of hnRNP A1 in RNP complexes. These results underscore the interactions of hnRNP A1 with the XRE and propose that hnRNP A1 is able to compete with Rex in binding the XRE. To ascertain further that hnRNP A1 is affecting the formation of Rex-XRE complexes, we proceeded to the immunodepletion of hnRNP A1 from nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells. We first determined that 15 μg of nuclear proteins were found to inhibit the binding of 10 ng of recombinant Rex to XRE (Fig. 4A). Consequently, this amount of nuclear proteins was immunodepleted of hnRNP A1 by incubation for 1 h in the presence of the murine monoclonal antibody to hnRNP A1 (4B10). In parallel control experiments, incubations were performed either without antibody (mock-treated) or with a murine isotype-matched antibody. Each extract was then incubated with anti-mouse immunoglobulin-coated magnetic beads. After removal of the beads, the Western blot analysis of nuclear proteins confirmed that treatment with the hnRNP A1 antibody led to the partial depletion of that RNA-binding protein (Fig. 4B, lane 2). On the contrary, hnRNP A1 was still present among nuclear proteins either mock-treated or incubated with the murine isotype-matched antibody (lanes 1 and 3). Then each of these three nuclear extracts was incubated with biotinylated XRE-RNA together with recombinant Rex. The Western blot analysis performed to verify the presence of Rex on the XRE probe showed that a significant amount of Rex bound to XRE was detected but only after incubation with the hnRNP A1-depleted nuclear proteins (Fig. 4C, compare lane 2 to lanes 1 and 3). These results confirm that hnRNP A1 behaves as an in vitro inhibitor of Rex/XRE interactions. The above results imply that hnRNP A1 by interfering with Rex/XRE interactions is able to inhibit the post-transcriptional activity of Rex. As the production of viral particles by in vitro HTLV-1 transformed T cells is attesting to an efficient Rex activity in these cells, we speculate that the amount of hnRNP A1 in these cells should be lower than that found in Jurkat lymphoblastoid T cells. To verify this hypothesis, the relative abundance of hnRNP A1 in nuclear extracts from three HTLV-1-transformed (C91PL, HUT-102, MT2) cells and from Jurkat cells was measured by a semi-quantitative Western blot analysis using increasing amounts of nuclear proteins (from 31 to 125 ng). Membranes were then probed with anti-hnRNP A1 (4B10) and anti-U1-snRNP (H111) antibodies (Fig. 5, A and C, respectively). The content of hnRNP A1 in each cell line was then expressed as a ratio to that of U1 snRNP. This analysis indicated that the level of hnRNP A1 expressed in the three HTLV-1-transformed T cell lines was from 5.4- to 3.4-fold lower than that in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 5B). To ascertain that this protein is not present in the extracts because of association with HTLV-1 RNA, nuclear extracts were lysed in SDS denaturation buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Under these conditions, a low level of hnRNP A1 protein was still observed in these HTLV-1-transformed cells (not shown). Furthermore, the analysis of nuclear proteins prepared from uninfected cord blood lymphocytes revealed that the amount of hnRNP A1 detected in these cells was quite similar to that found in Jurkat cells. Collectively, our data imply that a low level of hnRNP A1 in HTLV-1-transformed T lymphocytes correlates with an efficient activity of Rex. To delineate further the involvement of hnRNP A1 as an in vivo inhibitor of Rex/XRE interactions, the functional consequences of an overexpression of this protein were next evaluated. To that aim, 293T cells were transiently transfected either with a FLAG-tagged-hnRNP A1 (FLAG-A1) expression plasmid or with the pcDNA3.1 control plasmid. Overexpression of hnRNP A1 was evaluated by immunofluorescence and Western blot assays. The immunofluorescence study using the 4B10 antibody clearly showed the presence of a significant number of brighter cells among cells transfected with the FLAG-A1 vector, compared with cells transfected with the control plasmid (Fig. 6B). As expected, the tagged hnRNP A1 revealed by incubating cells with an anti-FLAG antibody was found in the nucleus of the transfected cells. The Western blot analysis performed with the same antibodies indicated that the band of endogenous hnRNP A1 (36 kDa) is overlapping that of the FLAG-A1 protein (Fig. 6C). Finally, a slight increase of the overall amount of hnRNP A1 was observed in the FLAG-A1-transfected cells, when compared with that in control cells. The potential effect of hnRNP A1 on Rex activity was then assayed using the XRE-regulated CAT reporter gene vector (pCAT-XRE). It encodes a single intron that contains both the CAT- and the XRE-coding sequences (Fig. 6A). CAT expression is dependent on the Rex/XRE interactions and correlates with the nuclear export and cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced cat mRNAs"
