https://openalex.org/W2019028138,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved, 18- to 25-nucleotide, non–protein coding transcripts that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression during development. miRNAs also occur in postmitotic cells, such as neurons in the mammalian central nervous system, but their function is less well characterized. We investigated the role of miRNAs in mammalian midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DNs). We identified a miRNA, miR-133b, that is specifically expressed in midbrain DNs and is deficient in midbrain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease. miR-133b regulates the maturation and function of midbrain DNs within a negative feedback circuit that includes the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3. We propose a role for this feedback circuit in the fine-tuning of dopaminergic behaviors such as locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2140560927,"Although common among bacteria, lateral gene transfer-the movement of genes between distantly related organisms-is thought to occur only rarely between bacteria and multicellular eukaryotes. However, the presence of endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia pipientis, within some eukaryotic germlines may facilitate bacterial gene transfers to eukaryotic host genomes. We therefore examined host genomes for evidence of gene transfer events from Wolbachia bacteria to their hosts. We found and confirmed transfers into the genomes of four insect and four nematode species that range from nearly the entire Wolbachia genome (>1 megabase) to short (<500 base pairs) insertions. Potential Wolbachia-to-host transfers were also detected computationally in three additional sequenced insect genomes. We also show that some of these inserted Wolbachia genes are transcribed within eukaryotic cells lacking endosymbionts. Therefore, heritable lateral gene transfer occurs into eukaryotic hosts from their prokaryote symbionts, potentially providing a mechanism for acquisition of new genes and functions."
https://openalex.org/W2088170764,"Methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) is a posttranslational modification that is highly correlated with genomic silencing. Here we show that human UTX, a member of the Jumonji C family of proteins, is a di- and trimethyl H3K27 demethylase. UTX occupies the promoters of HOX gene clusters and regulates their transcriptional output by modulating the recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 1 and the monoubiquitination of histone H2A. Moreover, UTX associates with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) 2/3 complexes, and during retinoic acid signaling events, the recruitment of the UTX complex to HOX genes results in H3K27 demethylation and a concomitant methylation of H3K4. Our results suggest a concerted mechanism for transcriptional activation in which cycles of H3K4 methylation by MLL2/3 are linked with the demethylation of H3K27 through UTX."
https://openalex.org/W2065272404,"Alfvén waves, transverse incompressible magnetic oscillations, have been proposed as a possible mechanism to heat the Sun's corona to millions of degrees by transporting convective energy from the photosphere into the diffuse corona. We report the detection of Alfvén waves in intensity, line-of-sight velocity, and linear polarization images of the solar corona taken using the FeXIII 1074.7-nanometer coronal emission line with the Coronal Multi-Channel Polarimeter (CoMP) instrument at the National Solar Observatory, New Mexico. Ubiquitous upward propagating waves were seen, with phase speeds of 1 to 4 megameters per second and trajectories consistent with the direction of the magnetic field inferred from the linear polarization measurements. An estimate of the energy carried by the waves that we spatially resolved indicates that they are too weak to heat the solar corona; however, unresolved Alfvén waves may carry sufficient energy."
https://openalex.org/W2082235945,"Do learning and retrieval of a memory activate the same neurons? Does the number of reactivated neurons correlate with memory strength? We developed a transgenic mouse that enables the long-lasting genetic tagging of c- fos –active neurons. We found neurons in the basolateral amygdala that are activated during Pavlovian fear conditioning and are reactivated during memory retrieval. The number of reactivated neurons correlated positively with the behavioral expression of the fear memory, indicating a stable neural correlate of associative memory. The ability to manipulate these neurons genetically should allow a more precise dissection of the molecular mechanisms of memory encoding within a distributed neuronal network."
https://openalex.org/W2038443045,"The bistability in the position of the two hydrogen atoms in the inner cavity of single free-base naphthalocyanine molecules constitutes a two-level system that was manipulated and probed by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. When adsorbed on an ultrathin insulating film, the molecules can be switched in a controlled fashion between the two states by excitation induced by the inelastic tunneling current. The tautomerization reaction can be probed by resonant tunneling through the molecule and is expressed as considerable changes in the conductivity of the molecule. We also demonstrated a coupling of the switching process so that the charge injection in one molecule induced tautomerization in an adjacent molecule."

Using a scanning tunneling microscope to observe spin excitations, we determined the orientation and strength of the anisotropies of individual iron and manganese atoms on a thin layer of copper nitride. The relative intensities of the inelastic tunneling processes are consistent with dipolar interactions, as seen for inelastic neutron scattering. First-principles calculations indicate that the magnetic atoms become incorporated into a polar covalent surface molecular network in the copper nitride. These structures, which provide atom-by-atom accessibility via local probes, have the potential for engineering anisotropies large enough to produce stable magnetization at low temperatures for a single atomic spin."
https://openalex.org/W2055195045,"Atmospheric aerosol formation is known to occur almost all over the world, and the importance of these particles to climate and air quality has been recognized. Although almost all of the processes driving aerosol formation take place below a particle diameter of 3 nanometers, observations cover only larger particles. We introduce an instrumental setup to measure atmospheric concentrations of both neutral and charged nanometer-sized clusters. By applying the instruments in the field, we come to three important conclusions: (i) A pool of numerous neutral clusters in the sub–3 nanometer size range is continuously present; (ii) the processes initiating atmospheric aerosol formation start from particle sizes of ∼1.5 nanometers; and (iii) neutral nucleation dominates over the ion-induced mechanism, at least in boreal forest conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2034793355,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress hundreds of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), but the physiological roles of specific miRNA-mRNA interactions remain largely elusive. We report that zebrafish microRNA-430 (miR-430) dampens and balances the expression of the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) Nodal agonist squint and the TGF-β Nodal antagonist lefty . To disrupt the interaction of specific miRNA-mRNA pairs, we developed target protector morpholinos complementary to miRNA binding sites in target mRNAs. Protection of squint or lefty mRNAs from miR-430 resulted in enhanced or reduced Nodal signaling, respectively. Simultaneous protection of squint and lefty or absence of miR-430 caused an imbalance and reduction in Nodal signaling. These findings establish an approach to analyze the in vivo roles of specific miRNA-mRNA pairs and reveal a requirement for miRNAs in dampening and balancing agonist/antagonist pairs."

https://openalex.org/W2040516688,"Human height is a classic, highly heritable quantitative trait. To begin to identify genetic variants influencing height, we examined genome-wide association data from 4,921 individuals. Common variants in the HMGA2 oncogene, exemplified by rs1042725, were associated with height (P = 4 × 10−8). HMGA2 is also a strong biological candidate for height, as rare, severe mutations in this gene alter body size in mice and humans, so we tested rs1042725 in additional samples. We confirmed the association in 19,064 adults from four further studies (P = 3 × 10−11, overall P = 4 × 10−16, including the genome-wide association data). We also observed the association in children (P = 1 × 10−6, N = 6,827) and a tall/short case-control study (P = 4 × 10−6, N = 3,207). We estimate that rs1042725 explains ∼0.3% of population variation in height (∼0.4 cm increased adult height per C allele). There are few examples of common genetic variants reproducibly associated with human quantitativetraits; these results represent, to our knowledge, the first consistently replicated association with adult and childhood height."
https://openalex.org/W190626844,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a highly contagious respiratory disease, SARS, with significant mortality. Although factors contributing to the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV remain poorly understood, it has been reported that SARS-CoV infection does not induce type I interferons (IFNs) in cell culture. However, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV evades host detection or has evolved mechanisms to counteract innate host defenses. We show here that infection of SARS-CoV triggers a weak IFN response in cultured human lung/bronchial epithelial cells without inducing the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a latent cellular transcription factor that is pivotal for type I IFN synthesis. Furthermore, SARS-CoV infection blocked the induction of IFN antiviral activity and the up-regulation of protein expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes triggered by double-stranded RNA or an unrelated paramyxovirus. In searching for a SARS-CoV protein capable of counteracting innate immunity, we identified the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain as a potent IFN antagonist. The inhibition of the IFN response does not require the protease activity of PLpro. Rather, PLpro interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, thereby disrupting the activation of type I IFN responses through either Toll-like receptor 3 or retinoic acid-inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways.

IFN induces the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that establish an antiviral state, thereby limiting viral replication and spread (1Sen G.C. Annu. Rev.

This innate antiviral response is initiated upon host detection of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via a number of cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Viral nucleic acids comprising viral genomes or generated during viral replication present major PAMPs that can be recognized by two different classes of PRRs, i.e. the membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or the caspase recruitment domain-containing, cytoplasmic RNA helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), or melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (6Yoneyama M.

Among these, TLR3 and MDA5 detect viral double-stranded (ds) RNA in the endosomes and cytoplasm, respectively (9Sen G.C. Kim S.N.

Upon engagement of their respective ligands, these PRRs recruit different adaptor molecules, relaying signals to downstream kinases that activate IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and ATF/C-Jun, transcription factors that coordinately regulate IFN-β transcription (1Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 7Seth R.B. Kim L. Chen Z.J. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). IRF-3 is a constitutively expressed, latent transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in type I IFN responses. Its activation requires specific C-terminal phosphorylation mediated by two noncanonical IκB kinases, TBK1 or IKKε (14Sharma S. Kim B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J.

Phosphorylation of IRF-3 leads to its homodimerization, nuclear translocation, and association with CBP/p300, whereupon it collaborates with activated NF-κB to induce IFN-β synthesis (16Yoneyama M. Kim W. Fujita T. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Lin R. Kim C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In addition, although it is not utilized by most parenchymal cell types, TLR7 constitutes the major pathway in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and triggers potent IFN-α production in circulation upon engagement of single-stranded viral RNAs (18Diebold S.S.

During co-evolution with their hosts, many viruses have acquired mechanisms to circumvent cellular IFN responses by encoding proteins that disrupt the IFN signaling pathways. It is thought that the early virus-host interactions may significantly impact the course and/or outcome of the infection (1Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 5Kawai T. Kim S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a highly contagious respiratory disease, SARS, with a significant mortality rate of about 10% (20Peiris J.S.

The first 3/4 of the positive-sense, single-stranded, 29.7-kb genome of SARS-CoV is translated into two large replicase polyproteins (22Yount B. Kim R.S. Sims A.C. Deming D. Frieman M.B. Sparks J.

Papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease domains present within these polyproteins direct their processing into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that assemble to generate a multifunctional, membrane-associated replicase complex. Unlike other coronaviruses that encode two different PLpros, SARS-CoV encodes only one. Residing within the 213-kDa, membrane-associated replicase product nsp3, the SARS-CoV PLpro is responsible for cleaving junctions spanning nsp1 to nsp4 (27Harcourt B.H. Kim D. Kanjanahaluethai A. Bechill J. Severson K.M. Smith C.M. Rota P.A. Baker S.C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13600-13612Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLpro resembles that of known cellular deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes USP14 and HAUSP (28Ratia K. Kim K.S. Santarsiero B.D. Barretto N. Baker S.C. Stevens R.C. Mesecar A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5717-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). SARS-CoV PLpro has also been demonstrated to have both DUB and deISGylation activities in vitro, consistent with the fact that it shares the consensus recognition motif LXGG with cellular DUBs (29Barretto N. Kim D. Ratia K. Chen Z. Mesecar A.D. Baker S.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15189-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 30Lindner H.A. Kim N. Lytvyn V. Lachance P. Sulea T. Menard R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15199-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it has been proposed that SARS-CoV PLpro may have important but still uncharacterized functions in regulating cellular processes, in addition to its role as a viral protease (29Barretto N. Kim D. Ratia K. Chen Z. Mesecar A.D. Baker S.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15189-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 30Lindner H.A. Kim N. Lytvyn V. Lachance P. Sulea T. Menard R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15199-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although factors contributing to the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV remain poorly understood, infection of HEK293 cells does not induce production of type I IFNs (21Spiegel M. Kim A. Martinez-Sobrido L. Cros J. Garcia-Sastre A. Haller O. Weber F. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2079-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, pretreatment of permissive cells with IFN prevents SARS-CoV replication (31Zheng L. Kim U. Reymond J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). These are intriguing observations, as the ability to disrupt IFN responses seems to correlate with in vivo virulence in some viral infections, e.g. equine, swine, and H5N1 avian influenza viruses which express NS1, a well characterized IFN antagonist (32Solorzano A.

Virol. 2006; 80: 11115-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The absence of IRF-3 activation and IFN-β mRNA induction in SARS-CoV-infected HEK293 cells has led to the proposal that SARS-CoV is able to disrupt the activation of IRF-3-mediated defenses (21Spiegel M. Kim A. Martinez-Sobrido L. Cros J. Garcia-Sastre A. Haller O. Weber F. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2079-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, contradictory results have been published regarding whether SARS-CoV evades host detection or, alternatively, has developed strategies to actively block host innate defense mechanisms. Three SARS-CoV proteins, ORF3b, ORF6, and nucleocapsid (N), were recently identified as IFN antagonists, based on their ability to inhibit IRF-3 activation (35Kopecky-Bromberg S.A. Kim L. Frieman M. Baric R.A. Palese P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). SARS-CoV nsp1 was also shown to inhibit host IFN responses by inducing the degradation of host mRNAs (36Kamitani W. Kim K. Huang C. Lokugamage K. Ikegami T. Ito N. Kubo H. Makino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12885-12890Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, others have reported that infection of mouse hepatitis virus, a closely related type 2 coronavirus, or SARS-CoV does not activate IFN-β synthesis in murine fibroblasts nor inhibit its induction by poly(I-C) or Sendai virus (SeV) (37Zhou H. Kim S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Versteeg G.A. Kim P.J. van den Worm S.H. Spaan W.J. Virology. 2007; 361: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It was proposed from these studies that group 2 coronaviruses are “invisible” to host cells and thus avoid innate immunity by somehow avoiding host recognition (37Zhou H. Kim S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Versteeg G.A. Kim P.J. van den Worm S.H. Spaan W.J. Virology. 2007; 361: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we show that SARS-CoV triggers a weak, yet demonstrable IFN response in cultured human lung/bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts derived from fetal rhesus monkey kidney, both of which are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, SARS-CoV infection blocks the induction of IFN antiviral activity and the up-regulation of a subset of ISG proteins in response to dsRNA or SeV. We also identify the PLpro of SARS-CoV as a potent IFN antagonist. PLpro interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby disrupting multiple signaling pathways leading to IFN induction. Finally, we demonstrate a role of IRF-3 signaling in control of SARS-CoV infection by showing that disruption of IRF-3 function significantly up-regulates SARS-CoV replication. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV is detected by the innate immune surveillance mechanism of host cells, but that active regulation of IRF-3-mediated host defenses limits the IFN responses and likely contributes to establishment of SARS-CoV infection. Cells—Human bronchial epithelial cells Calu-3, African green monkey kidney cells MA104 and Vero, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293, 293T, 293-TLR3 (a gift from Kate Fitzgerald), HeLa, and human hepatoma cells Huh7 were maintained by conventional techniques. HeLa Tet-Off cell lines (Clontech) were cultured following the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmids—To obtain high level expression of SARS-CoV PLpro in eukaryotic cells, the codon usage of the SARS-CoV PLpro core domain (amino acids 1541-1855 of pp1a of SARS-CoV Urbani strain, GenBank™ accession number AY278741) was optimized based on the human codon usage frequency, and the potential splicing sites and polyadenylation signal sequences were removed from the coding regions of PLpro. The optimized PLpro was named SARS PLpro Sol (Supplemental Material) and cloned into pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB (Invitrogen) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites with in-frame fusion with C-terminal V5 and His6 tags, to result in the expression plasmid pCDNA3.1-SARS-PLpro-Sol. To generate pCDNA3.1-SARS-PLpro-TM (amino acids 1841-2425), the coding sequence for the TM domains downstream of PLpro in SARS-CoV nsp3 was amplified from the plasmid pPLpro-HD (27Harcourt B.H.

Virol. 2004; 78: 13600-13612Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) by PCR with primers P1, 5′-TTAGAATTCACCTGTGTCGTAACTC-3′, and P2, 5′-TAACTCGAGGTGAGTCTTGCAGAAGC-3′, and the product was digested with EcoRI/XhoI and cloned downstream of PLpro Sol with C-terminal in-frame fusion of V5-His6 tags. The catalytically inactive mutants of PLpro Sol and PLpro-TM (C1651A and D1826A) were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using specific primers containing the desired mutations (Supplemental Material). The fidelity of the cDNA inserts in all constructs was validated by DNA sequencing. To construct a tetracycline (tet)-regulated expression plasmid for SARS-CoV PLpro-TM, cDNA fragment encoding PLpro-TM along with its downstream V5-His6 tags in pCDNA3.1-SARS-PLpro-TM were excised by restriction digestion with HindIII and PmeI, and ligated into pTRE2Bla (39Chen Z. Kim Y. Rijnbrand R. Yi J. Wang T. Warter L. Lanford R.E. Weinman S.A. Lemon S.M. Martin A. Li K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 964-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that was digested with HindIII and EcoRV, to result in the plasmid pTRE2Bla-SARS-PLpro-TM. To construct a tet-regulated expression plasmid for a dominant negative (DN) form of IRF-3, cDNA encoding the amino acids 134-427 of IRF-3 was amplified from Huh7 cDNA by PCR and cloned into pTRE2Bla (39Chen Z.

Generation of Tet-regulated Cell Lines—The detailed procedures for establishment of HeLa- and Huh7-inducible cells were similar to those described previously (39Chen Z. Kim Y. Rijnbrand R. Yi J. Wang T. Warter L. Lanford R.E. Weinman S.A. Lemon S.M. Martin A. Li K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 964-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 45Li K. Kim T. Lemon S.M. Beard M.R. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1237-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, to generate HeLa PLpro-inducible cells, HeLa Tet-Off cells were transfected with pTRE2Bla-SARS-PLpro-TM using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and double-selected in complete medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418, 1 μg/ml blasticidin, and 2 μg/ml Tet. Approximately 3 weeks later, individual cell colonies were selected, expanded, and examined for SARS-CoV PLpro-TM expression by indirect immunofluorescence staining using a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the V5 epitope (Invitrogen) (1:500) that is present at the C terminus of PLpro-TM, after being cultured in the absence of tet for 4 days. Two independent cell clones, designated HeLa PLpro-4 and -10, respectively, allowed tight regulation of PLpro-TM expression under tet control and were selected for further characterization. Inducible expression of PLpro-TM in these cells was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using both the V5-tag mAb and a rabbit antiserum against SARS-CoV nsp3 (27Harcourt B.H. Kim D. Kanjanahaluethai A. Bechill J. Severson K.M. Smith C.M. Rota P.A. Baker S.C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13600-13612Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To generate Huh7 cells with conditional expression of DN-IRF-3, cells were cotransfected with pTet-Off (Clontech) and pTRE2Bla-IRF3DN133 at a ratio of 1:10, and double-selected in complete medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418, 2 μg/ml blasticidin, and 2 μg/ml tet. Expansion and screening of positive clones were conducted by procedures similar to those used for HeLa PLpro-inducible cells, except that a rabbit polyclonal IRF-3 antiserum (kindly provided by Michael David) was used for immunostaining and immunoblot analysis. Three individual cell clones, designated Huh7 DN-6, -12, and -18, respectively, allowed tightly regulated expression of DN-IRF3 at various levels. However, under fully induced conditions (-tet), only DN-18 cells expressed DN-IRF-3 at a level higher than that of the endogenous IRF-3, and thus allowed a demonstrable DN effect on viral induction of IRF-3 target genes (Fig. 9A and data not shown). Therefore, we selected DN-18 cells for further analysis. SeV Infection and Poly(I-C) Treatment—Where indicated, cells were infected with 100 hemagglutinin units (HAU)/ml of SeV (Cantell strain, Charles River Laboratories) for 8-16 h prior to cell lysis for luciferase/β-galactosidase reporter assays and/or immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis as described previously (39Chen Z.

Jr. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). For poly(I-C) treatment, poly(I-C) (Sigma) was added directly to the culture medium at 50 μg/ml (M-pIC) or complexed with Lipofectamine 2000 (at 1:1 ratio) (T-pIC) and loaded onto the cells for the indicated time period. SARS-CoV Infection and Titration—Where indicated, cells were infected with the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV (kindly provided by T. G. Ksiazek, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) at the indicated m.o.i. as described previously (47Tseng C.T. Kim J. Perrone L. Worthy M. Popov V. Peters C.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9470-9479Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cell-free SARS-CoV stock with a titer of 1 × 107 TCID50/ml (50% tissue culture infectious dose) was generated following two passages of the original stock in Vero E6 cells and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. All experiments involving infectious viruses were conducted in an approved biosafety level 3 laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch. The infectious viral titers in the cell-free supernatants collected at different time points postinfection were determined by a standard TCID50 assay on permissive Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well plates with a series of 10-fold-diluted samples. The titer was expressed as TCID50 per ml of individual samples. IFN Bioactivity Assay—IFN bioactivity in γ-irradiated cell culture supernatants was determined by a standard microtiter plaque reduction assay using vesicular stomatitis virus on Vero cells, as described previously (48Langford M.P. Kim D.A. Stanton G.J. Baron S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—Cells grown in 24-well plates (5 × 104/well) were transfected in triplicate with the indicated reporter plasmid (100 ng), pCMVβgal (100 ng), and the indicated amount of an expression vector (50-400 ng and supplied with an empty vector to keep the total amount of DNA transfected constant) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty four hours later, transfected cells were mock-treated, treated with poly(I-C) for 6 h, or infected with SeV for 16 h before cell lysis and assay for both firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Data were expressed as mean relative luciferase activity (luciferase activity divided by β-galactosidase activity) with standard deviation from a representative experiment carried out in triplicate. A minimum of three independent experiments were performed to confirm the results of each experiment. The fold change of promoter activity was calculated by dividing the relative luciferase activity of stimulated cells by that of mock-treated cells. Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells grown in chamber slides (LabTek) following the indicated treatments were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min. After a PBS rinse, the slides were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human IRF3 (1:500, kindly provided by Michael David) (49Navarro L. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35535-35538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), or with a V5 tag mAb (1:500, Invitrogen), or with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (R3) against SARS-CoV nsp3 (27Harcourt B.H.

https://openalex.org/W1979575360,"A comprehensive structural analysis of the complete and unmodified Sup35 prion domain in two distinct infectious conformations is presented. A variety of techniques is used to provide structural details of these two prion conformations, one weakly and one strongly propagating strain. The data show that the fibril conformation of both strains share a common amyloid-like core, comprising the glutamine/asparagine rich first 40 residues. In the weaker strain this stable structure is dramatically expanded to 70 amino acids. Among the many surprises to arise from studies of prion biology, perhaps the most unexpected is the strain phenomenon whereby a single protein can misfold into structurally distinct, infectious states that cause distinguishable phenotypes1,2,3. Similarly, proteins can adopt a spectrum of conformations in non-infectious diseases of protein folding; some are toxic and others are well tolerated4. However, our understanding of the structural differences underlying prion strains and how these differences alter their physiological impact remains limited. Here we use a combination of solution NMR, amide hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange and mutagenesis to study the structural differences between two strain conformations, termed Sc4 and Sc37 (ref. 5), of the yeast Sup35 prion. We find that these two strains have an overlapping amyloid core spanning most of the Gln/Asn-rich first 40 amino acids that is highly protected from H/D exchange and very sensitive to mutation. These features indicate that the cores are composed of tightly packed β-sheets possibly resembling ‘steric zipper’ structures revealed by X-ray crystallography of Sup35-derived peptides6,7. The stable structure is greatly expanded in the Sc37 conformation to encompass the first 70 amino acids, revealing why this strain shows increased fibre stability and decreased ability to undergo chaperone-mediated replication8. Our findings establish that prion strains involve large-scale conformational differences and provide a structural basis for understanding a broad range of functional studies, including how conformational changes alter the physiological impact of prion strains."

https://openalex.org/W2037466942,"The overexpression of saccharides such as Globo-H, LewisY and Tn antigen is a common feature of oncogenic transformed cells. Endeavors to exploit this aberrant glycosylation for cancer vaccine development have been complicated by difficulties in eliciting high titers of IgG antibodies against classical conjugates of tumor-associated carbohydrates to carrier proteins. We have designed, chemically synthesized and immunologically evaluated a number of fully synthetic vaccine candidates to establish strategies to overcome the poor immunogenicity of tumor-associated carbohydrates and glycopeptides. We have found that a three-component vaccine composed of a TLR2 agonist, a promiscuous peptide T-helper epitope and a tumor-associated glycopeptide can elicit in mice exceptionally high titers of IgG antibodies that can recognize cancer cells expressing the tumor-associated carbohydrate. The superior properties of the vaccine candidate are attributed to the local production of cytokines, upregulation of co-stimulatory proteins, enhanced uptake by macrophages and dendritic cells and avoidance of epitope suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1983408792,"Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity constitutes the primary plant immune response that has evolved to recognize invariant structures of microbial surfaces. Here we show that Gram-positive bacteria-derived peptidoglycan (PGN) constitutes a novel PAMP of immune responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Microarray analysis performed with RNA prepared from PGN-treated Arabidopsis leaves revealed enhanced transcript levels for 236 genes, many of which are also altered upon administration of flagellin. Comparison of cellular responses after treatment with bacteria-derived PGN and structurally related fungal chitin indicated that both PAMPs are perceived via different perception systems. PGN-mediated immune stimulation in Arabidopsis is based upon recognition of the PGN sugar backbone, while muramyl dipeptide, which is inactive in this plant, triggers immunity-associated responses in animals. PGN adds to the list of PAMPs that induce innate immune programs in both plants and animals.

The innate immune system is a host defense mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved from insects to human and is mainly involved in the recognition and control of the early stage of infection in all animals (1Janeway C.A. Kim Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6064) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, it has become increasingly evident that also plants have acquired the ability to recognize “non self” via sensitive perception systems for components of microorganisms called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; EFR, EF-Tu receptor; Flg22, 22 amino acid fragment of flagellin; FLS2, flagellin-sensing 2; GUS, β-glucuronidase; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MAPK/MPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; NLPPp, Nep1 (necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1)-like protein; NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; PGN, peptidoglycan; PR-1, pathogenesis-related 1; RLK, receptor-like kinase; TLR, toll-like receptor; MBP, myelin basic protein.2The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; EFR, EF-Tu receptor; Flg22, 22 amino acid fragment of flagellin; FLS2, flagellin-sensing 2; GUS, β-glucuronidase; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MAPK/MPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; NLPPp, Nep1 (necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1)-like protein; NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; PGN, peptidoglycan; PR-1, pathogenesis-related 1; RLK, receptor-like kinase; TLR, toll-like receptor; MBP, myelin basic protein.

As classically defined, PAMPs are highly characteristic of potentially infectious microbes, but are not present in the host. In addition, such patterns are often vital for microbial survival and are therefore not subject to mutational variation. PAMPs that trigger innate immune responses in various vertebrate and non-vertebrate organisms include lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, eubacterial flagellin, viral, and bacterial nucleic acids, fungal cell wall-derived glucans, chitins, mannans, or proteins and peptidoglycans (PGN) from Gram-positive bacteria (5Jones D.A.

Virtually all bacteria contain a layer of PGN, but the amount, location, and specific composition vary. PGN is a polymer of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetyl-muramic acid (MurNAc) residues in β-1-4 linkage which are cross-linked by short peptides (9Glauner B. Kim J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schleifer K.H. Kim O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycan chains display little variation among different bacterial species while the peptide subunit and the interpeptide bridge reveal species specific differences. PGN from Staphylococcus aureus belongs to the l-lysine (Lys)-type, which is primarily found in Gram-positive bacteria whereas meso-diaminopimelate (Dap)-type PGN is typical for many Gram-negative bacteria.As PGNs are located on most bacterial surfaces they constitute excellent targets for recognition by the innate immune system. Indeed, PGN is known for a long time to promote an innate immune response in vertebrates and insects (11Stewart-Tull D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 311-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Leulier F. Kim C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat.

Kim S. Hartung T. Hermann C. J. Endotoxin Res. 2006; 12: 69-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGN is perceived in animals via various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including scavenger receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins (NODs), a family of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), PGN-lytic enzymes and Toll-like receptor TLR2 (15Kufer T.A.

Perception of flagellin in Arabidopsis was shown to be dependent on FLS2, a plasma membrane-located receptor-like kinase protein with extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRR-RLKs) (22Gomez-Gomez L. Kim T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracytoplasmic LRR-domain of FLS2 thereby resembles the structure of the extracytoplasmic domain of human TLR5, which also recognizes bacterial flagellin as a PAMP (23Hayashi F. Kim K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). Generally, transmembrane LRR proteins appear to be a common element in PAMP perception in animal and plant systems. In mammals, 11 TLRs have been identified so far and a second plant LRR-RLK, EFR, was described to recognize the bacterial elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) (24Zipfel C. Kim G. Chinchilla D. Caniard A.

Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) are structurally similar to the cytoplasmic LRR-containing pathogen resistance proteins in plants that mediate plant cultivar-specific, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (2Chisholm S.T. Kim G. Day B. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 2006; 124: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar, 4Jones J.D. Kim J.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (8025) Google Scholar).Here we present evidence that PGNs mediate the activation of innate defense responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in addition to their well established role as a PAMP in vertebrates and insects. Treatment with PGN from the phyto-pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus (27Prithiviraj B. Kim H.P. Jha A.K. Vivanco J.M. Plant J. 2005; 42: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) results in the activation of plant defense responses such as medium alkalinization, elevation of cytoplasmic calcium concentrations, NO production, the activation of MAPKs, the accumulation of camalexin and the induction of various defense-related genes. Interestingly, even though a comparison of the defense responses triggered by PGN and the structurally closely related glycan chitin showed a strong overlap, our results indicate that PGN and chitin engage different perception systems. Moreover, we identify the PGN glycan backbone as the PAMP-active part in PGN. This is in contrast to mammals in which MDP was shown to be the minimal structural requirement for PAMP activity (14Traub S. Kim S. Hartung T. Hermann C. J. Endotoxin Res. 2006; 12: 69-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Flg22 peptide and hydrolyzed chitin fragments were described previously (25Kunze G. Kim C. Robatzek S.

Dark grown cell cultures of Arabidopsis Ler were maintained as described (33Fuerst R.A. Kim R. Murray J.A. Lindsey K. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and were used for experiments 5-6 days after subculture.Peptidoglycan Preparation—PGN from S. aureus SA113 (ATCC 35556) and sortase deletion mutant (SA113ΔsrtA) 3G. Thumm and F. Götz, unpublished data. was purified as described earlier (34Bera A. Kim S. Jakob A. Vollmer W. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 35de Jonge B.L. Kim Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from stationary phase cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 min, boiled with 5% SDS for 30 min and broken with glass beads. Insoluble polymeric PGN was harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min and washed several times with lukewarm water to remove SDS. Broken cell walls were suspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and treated with 10 μg/ml DNase and 50 μg/ml RNase A for 2 h and subsequently with 100 μg/ml trypsin for 16 h at 37 °C. To remove wall teichoic acid, the PGN preparations were incubated with 48% hydrofluoric acid (HFA) for 48 h at 4 °C. PGN was harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min and washed several times with water for complete removal of HFA. Further treatment of PGN included 8 m LiCl, 100 mm EDTA and acetone to remove residual protein and LPS contamination. PGN was finally washed several times with water and lyophilized. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis of soluble PGN was carried out as described (34Bera A. Kim S. Jakob A. Vollmer W. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), with following modifications. Purified PGN (1 mg/ml) was suspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and digested with mutanolysin (50 μg/ml), lysostaphin (10 μg/ml), or both for 16 h at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by boiling the samples at 90 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation. Desalting of soluble muropeptides was performed by reverse phase HPLC using a Reprosil-Pur ODS-3 column (5 μm; 250 × 20 mm; Dr. Maisch). Muropeptides were eluted in a step gradient at a flow rate of 10 ml/min starting from water for 10 min to 100% methanol for the next 20 min. Muropeptides were detected at 210 nm. PGN peaks were collected and concentrated in a rotary evaporator to remove excess methanol. Finally, PGN preparations were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C.Histochemical GUS Detection—For the histochemical detection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme activity whole leaves of PR-1:GUS transgenic Arabidopsis (29Shapiro A.D. Kim C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were placed in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 0.5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide (X-gluc, X-Gluc-DIRECT). After vacuum infiltration, the leaves were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and chlorophyll was subsequently removed by several washings in 70% ethanol.Medium Alkalinization, NO, and Camalexin Detection—Medium alkalinization in A. thaliana Ler cell suspensions was measured in 2-ml aliquots as described (25Kunze G. Kim C. Robatzek S. Niehaus K. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3496-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide synthesis in cell cultures was analyzed as described (36Zeidler D. Kim U. Gerber I. Dubery I. Hartung T. Bors W. Hutzler P. Durner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15811-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Camalexin production in plants was quantified by reverse phase HPLC (LiChroCART 250-4, RP-18, 5 μm, Merck; 1 ml/min; MeOH/H2O (1:1) for 2 min, followed by a 10 min linear gradient to 100% MeOH, followed by 3 min 100% MeOH) (37Glawischnig E. Kim B.G. Olsen C.E. Halkier B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8245-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The peak at 12 min was identified as camalexin by comparison with an authentic standard with respect to retention time and UV spectrum (photodiode array detector, Dionex) and quantified using a Shimadzu F-10AXL fluorescence detector (318 nm excitation, 370 nm emission) and by UV absorption at 318 nm.Calcium Measurements—Cytosolic calcium concentrations were measured by calcium-induced aequorin luminescence using transgenic Arabidopsis pMAQ2 plants expressing cytosolic apoaequorin under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (30Knight M.R. Kim S.M. Trewavas A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4967-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 31Knight M.R. Kim A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Mature leaves of 5-week-old plants were cut into 1-mm strips and floated on 100 μl of water supplemented with 10 μm coelenterazine (native coelenterazine, 5 mm stock in methanol, Invitrogen) in a 96-well plate (4 strips/well, n > 3). For aequorin reconstitution plates were incubated in the dark for at least 4 h. Luminescence was measured in a Luminoskan Ascent 2.1 luminometer (Labsystems) and recorded in integration intervals of 10 s. After 60 s recording, PAMPs were applied by addition of 50 μl of a 3-fold concentrated solution in water and measurements continued for the indicated time. Controls were performed by addition of an equal volume of water. Remaining aequorin was discharged by automatic injection of 1 volume of 2 m CaCl2/20% ethanol and luminescence was recorded for another 8-10 min until values were within 1% of the highest discharge value. Relative luminescence values were calculated and converted into actual Ca2+ concentrations as described (38Rentel M.C. Kim M.R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).MAPK Activity Assay—After elicitor treatment, leaves were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and MAP kinase activity was determined by in-gel kinase assays using myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) as substrate as described previously (39Ludwig A.A. Kim H. Felix G. Freymark G. Miersch O. Wasternack C. Boller T. Jones J.D. Romeis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10736-10741Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from leaves was isolated using the Tri Reagent method according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Sigma). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using RevertAid™ M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas). RT-PCR was performed as described previously (40Romeis T. Kim A.A. Martin R. Jones J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) using gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S1). Except for EF1a, which was amplified with 25 PCR cycles, all other PCRs were performed with 30 cycles.Microarray Experiments—Microarray experiments were performed on A. thaliana Col-0 plants infiltrated with 100 μg/ml PGN or water as a control. Affymetrix ATH1 high density oligonucleotide gene arrays were used for triplicate hybridizations of each biological sample. Global analysis of temporal gene expression was performed by subjecting the absolute expression values for scaling using the Affymetrix MAS5.0 software. Scaled mean values of expression were imported into Genespring software (version 7.2, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using a gcRMA (41Schmid M. Kim T.S. Henz S.R. Pape U.J. Demar M. Vingron M. Scholkopf B. Weigel D. Lohmann J.U. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar) plug-in normalization tool prior to data analysis. Means of three replicate values for each data set were analyzed for stimulus-induced differential gene expression. Data sets with expression levels below 50 were excluded from comparative analyses (noise level of expression cut-off). Genes were considered as up- or down-regulated if their mean expression levels deviated more than 2-fold from that of the non-elicited control samples.RESULTSStaphylococcal PGN Acts as a PAMP in Arabidopsis—Despite the well established role of PGN as a PAMP in animal innate immunity, surprisingly little is known about PGN perception in plants. We thus inquired about the ability of plants to recognize and respond to PGN from the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus, that is found as root-associated bacterium in the rhizosphere of many plants and was recently shown to be pathogenic on A. thaliana (27Prithiviraj B. Kim H.P. Jha A.K. Vivanco J.M. Plant J. 2005; 42: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Berg G. Kim L. Hartmann A. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1673-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 43Prithiviraj B. Kim T. Bais H.P. Schweizer H.P. Vivanco J.M. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A typical and well characterized plant response to pathogen infection or treatment with PAMPs is the induction of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (44Uknes S. Kim B. Moyer M. Potter S. Williams S. Dincher S. Chandler D. Slusarenko A. Ward E. Ryals J. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), such as PR-1. To facilitate the detection of gene induction, we used a transgenic PR-1:GUS reporter line, in which the PR-1 promoter is fused to the β-glucuronidase gene from E. coli (29Shapiro A.D. Kim C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 45Laird J. Kim P. Giuntini P. Laval V. Milner J.J. Planta. 2004; 219: 1089-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with heat-killed S. aureus cells or purified PGN resulted in a strong PR-1:GUS expression, similar to that observed with the elicitoractive 22 amino acid fragment from bacterial flagellin (Flg22) (46Gomez-Gomez L. Kim G. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We have consistently found PR-1 gene expression with all PGN preparations tested. Quantitative differences in PR-1 gene expression have only been observed upon infiltration into leaves of different PGN preparations, but not in assays using cultured cells (see below). Thus, these differences are most likely due to variations in the applicability of PGN into different biological samples. We next wanted to investigate which part of PGN is responsible for the induction of PR-1:GUS. Purified PGN was digested with either lysostaphin, an enzyme that specifically cleaves pentaglycin interpeptide bridges in staphylococcal PGN, or with mutanolysin, which hydrolyzes glycosidic linkages between disaccharide units of PGN (Fig. 1B). After HPLC purification, soluble muropeptides were infiltrated into Arabidopsis leaves, and GUS activity was detected after 24 h. Whereas lysostaphin-digested PGN was able to trigger PR-1:GUS expression, no induction was observed with mutanolysin- or mutanolysin/lysostaphin-digested PGN (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, treatment with smaller synthetic PGN components such as MDP, muramic acid or the pentapeptide Ala-d-γ-Glu-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala did not result in any PR-1:GUS induction. Taken together, these results indicate that not the protein part of PGN is perceived by Arabidopsis. Rather, sugar chains longer than the disaccharide are recognized, which is in contrast to PGN perception in vertebrates in which already MDP displays strong immunogenic activity (14Traub S. Kim S. Hartung T. Hermann C. J. Endotoxin Res. 2006; 12: 69-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PGN Triggers Early Plant Immune Responses—Medium alkalinization, occurring as a consequence of altered ion fluxes across the plasma membrane, is one of the earliest marker responses observed in elicitor-treated plant cells (47Atkinson M.M. Kim J.S. Knopp J.A. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 843-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In tobacco cells, addition of lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells as well as M. lysodeikticus PGN induced a strong and rapid increase in extracellular pH (48Felix G. Kim T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6201-6208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here, we compared PGN-induced changes in extracellular pH in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures with that induced by Flg22 (Fig. 2A). Flg22 treatment resulted in a rapid but transient increase in extracellular pH, reaching a maximum at about 30-40 min. In comparison, PGN induced a somewhat slower but more persistent increase in extracellular pH starting after a lag phase of about 15 min. Similar responses were obtained with commercially available PGN from the Gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis and Streptomyces ssp. (supplemental Fig. S1) and the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli (supplemental Fig. S2). Medium alkalinization was dose-dependent with saturating concentrations of 100-200 μg/ml PGN (Fig. 2B). As a concentration of 100 μg/ml PGN triggered nearly maximal responses in medium alkalinization assays (see also Fig. 5D) all further experiments were conducted with this PGN concentration.FIGURE 2PGN triggers early defense responses. A, extracellular pH was monitored over a time course in 6-day-old A. thaliana Ler cell suspension cultures treated with 100 nm Flg22 (squares), 100 μg/ml purified and undigested PGN (triangles) or water as a control (circles). B, cell cultures were treated with the indicated PGN concentrations and the extracellular pH was measured at 0 and 60 min to obtain the delta pH. C, leaves of 5-week-old Arabidopsis plants were infiltrated with 1 μm Flg22, 100 μg/ml PGN or water as a control. At indicated times, leaves were harvested, and MAP kinase activity was analyzed using an in-gel kinase assay with myelin basic protein as a substrate (upper panel). The positions of MAPK activities are indicated by arrowheads. Equal protein loading was confirmed by staining a duplicate gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (lower panel). D, cell cultures were treated with 1 μm Flg22, 100 μg/ml PGN, or water (control), and NO production was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NO production is given as relative fluorescence units. E, leaves of 5-week-old aequorin-transgenic Arabidopsis plants were cut into strips and [Ca2+]cyt was measured in a luminometer after addition of 1 μm Flg22, 100 μg/ml PGN, or water as a control described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5PGN induces camalexin production, but no cell death.

Kim G.B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). PGN or Flg22 were infiltrated into Arabidopsis leaves, and MAPK activity was subsequently analyzed in an ingel kinase assay using MBP as artificial substrate. As shown in Fig. 2C, hypoosmotic stress because of water infiltration in the control samples caused a rapid, but transient activation of two MAPK species of 44 and 46 kDa, respectively. However, PGN treatment resulted in a much stronger response, which closely resembled that obtained with Flg22, most likely representing activation of MPK3 and MPK6 (50Nühse T.S. Kim S.C. Hirt H. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7521-7526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Another hallmark of immune responses in animals and plants is the production of nitric oxide (NO) (36Zeidler D. Kim U. Gerber I. Dubery I. Hartung T. Bors W. Hutzler P. Durner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. S"
https://openalex.org/W2027240263,"Selectivity rules in organic chemistry have been inferred largely from nonaqueous environments. In contrast, enzymes operate in water, and the chemical effect of the medium change remains only partially understood. Structural characterization of the “ladder” polyether marine natural products raised a puzzle that persisted for 20 years: Although the stereochemistry of adjacent tetrahydropyran (THP) cycles would seem to arise from a biosynthetic cascade of epoxide-opening reactions, experience in organic solvents argued consistently that such a pathway would be kinetically disfavored. We report that neutral water acts as an optimal promoter for the requisite ring-opening selectivity, once a single templating THP is appended to a chain of epoxides. This strategy offers a high-yielding route to the naturally occurring ladder core and highlights the likely importance of aqueous-medium effects in underpinning certain noteworthy enzymatic selectivities."
https://openalex.org/W2004143350,"Cellular internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) are untranslated segments of mRNA transcripts thought to initiate protein synthesis in response to environmental stresses that prevent canonical 5′ cap–dependent translation. Although numerous cellular mRNAs are proposed to have IRESs, none has a demonstrated physiological function or molecular mechanism. Here we show that seven yeast genes required for invasive growth, a developmental pathway induced by nutrient limitation, contain potent IRESs that require the initiation factor eIF4G for cap-independent translation. In contrast to the RNA structure-based activity of viral IRESs, we show that an unstructured A-rich element mediates internal initiation via recruitment of the poly(A) binding protein (Pab1) to the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of invasive growth messages. A 5′UTR mutation that impairs IRES activity compromises invasive growth, which indicates that cap-independent translation is required for physiological adaptation to stress."

https://openalex.org/W2014717496,"DNA replication in archaea and in eukaryotes share many similarities. We report the structure of an archaeal origin recognition complex protein, ORC1, bound to an origin recognition box, a DNA sequence that is found in multiple copies at replication origins. DNA binding is mediated principally by a C-terminal winged helix domain that inserts deeply into the major and minor grooves, widening them both. However, additionalDNA contacts are made with the N-terminalAAA + domain, which inserts into the minor groove at a characteristic G-rich sequence, inducing a 35° bend in the duplex and providing directionality to the binding site. Both contact regions also induce substantial unwinding of the DNA. The structure provides insight into the initial step in assembly of a replication origin and recruitment of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase to that origin."
https://openalex.org/W2038174431,"The faithful duplication of genetic material depends on essential DNA replication initiation factors. Cellular initiators form higher-order assemblies on replication origins, using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to locally remodel duplex DNA and facilitate proper loading of synthetic replisomal components. To better understand initiator function, we determined the 3.4 angstrom-resolution structure of an archaeal Cdc6/Orc1 heterodimer bound to origin DNA. The structure demonstrates that, in addition to conventional DNA binding elements, initiators use their AAA+ ATPase domains to recognize origin DNA. Together these interactions establish the polarity of initiator assembly on the origin and induce substantial distortions into origin DNA strands. Biochemical and comparative analyses indicate that AAA+/DNA contacts observed in the structure are dynamic and evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that the complex forms a core component of the basal initiation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2018419826,"The lipocalin α1-microglobulin (α1m) is a 26-kDa glycoprotein present in plasma and in interstitial fluids of all tissues. The protein was recently shown to have reductase properties, reducing heme-proteins and other substrates, and was also reported to be involved in binding and scavenging of heme and tryptophan metabolites. To investigate its possible role as a reductant of organic radicals, we have studied the interaction of α1m with the synthetic radical, 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS radical). The lipocalin readily reacted with the ABTS radical forming reduced ABTS. The apparent rate constant for this reaction was 6.3 ± 2.5 × 103 m-1 s-1. A second reaction product with an intense purple color and an absorbance maximum at 550 nm was formed at a similar rate. This was shown by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to be derived from covalent attachment of a portion of ABTS radical to tyrosine residues on α1m. The relative yields of reduced ABTS and the purple ABTS derivative bound to α1m were ∼2:1. Both reactions were dependent on the thiolate group of the cysteine residue in position 34 of the α1m polypeptide. Our results indicate that α1m is involved in a sequential reduction of ABTS radicals followed by trapping of these radicals by covalent attachment. In combination with the reported physiological properties of the protein, our results suggest that α1m may be a radical reductant and scavenger in vivo.

Most of the filtrated α1m is degraded in the kidneys, but a small part is excreted in the urine (12Larsson J. Kim K. Davies J.R. Lögdberg L. Strand S.E. Åkerström B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2001; 137: 165-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). α1m isolated from plasma and urine is yellow-brown and displays charge heterogeneity (i.e. a broad band upon electrophoresis) (19Ekström B. Kim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8048-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is caused by an array of small chromophoric groups attached to the amino acid residues Cys-34, Lys-92, Lys-118, and Lys-130, which are localized around the entrance of the lipocalin pocket (20Escribano J.

Fibrinol. 2000; 11: 261-275PubMed Google Scholar). The biological function of α1m is unknown, although it has a number of immunosuppressive properties, such as inhibition of antigen-induced lymphocyte cell proliferation, cytokine secretion (23Lögdberg L. Kim B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1981; 13: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Méndez E. Kim J.L. Grubb A. Leyva-Cobián F. Proc. Natl. Sci. Acad. U. S.

Immunol. 1999; 50: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several recent findings suggest that α1m is involved in reduction and scavenging of biological pro-oxidants, such as heme and heme-proteins. First, it was shown that α1m binds heme strongly and obtains the yellow-brown chromophore by incubation with hemoglobin or erythrocyte ghosts, concomitant with degradation of the bound heme (27Allhorn M. Kim T. Nordberg J. Olsson M.L. Åkerström B. Blood. 2002; 99: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A processed form, t-α1m, which lacks the C-terminal tetrapeptide LIPR and has enhanced heme degradation properties, is also induced by incubation with hemoglobin. t-α1m is found in urine (27Allhorn M. Kim T. Nordberg J. Olsson M.L. Åkerström B. Blood. 2002; 99: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and continuously forms in chronic leg ulcers, a hemolytic inflammatory condition where free heme and iron are considered to be oxidative pathogenic factors (28Allhorn M. Kim K. Schmidtchen A. Åkerström B. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 640-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Second, lysyl residues in urine α1m from hemodialysis patients were found to be modified by kynurenine derivates (29Sala A. Kim M. Perani E. Romano A. Labo S. Monzani E. Minchiotti L. Galliano M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51033-51041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These are tryptophan catabolites that have a propensity to form free radicals (30Ishii T. Kim H. Sugata R. Kido R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Okuda S. Kim N. Saito H. Katsuki H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 2000; 32: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and are present at elevated concentrations in plasma of hemodialysis patients (33Pawlak D. Kim K. Malyszko J. Mysliwiec M. Buczko W. Int. Urol. Nephrol. 2001; 33: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fourth, α1m was shown to enzymatically reduce cytochrome c, methemoglobin, nitro blue tetrazolium, and free iron, using NADH, NADPH, or ascorbate as electron-donating co-factors (8Allhorn M. Kim A. Åkerström B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The thiol group in position Cys-34 and the three lysyls Lys-92, Lys-118, and Lys-130 were implicated in the active site. Finally, the cellular expression of α1m is up-regulated by hemoglobin and radical oxygen species (34Olsson M.G. Kim M. Olofsson T. Åkerström B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that α1m could potentially undergo reactions with biological radicals and that these reactions may be related to its physiological function. To investigate how α1m reacts with radicals, we have studied the interaction of α1m with the stable radical, 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). This compound has been used extensively to investigate antioxidant mechanisms (e.g. see Ref. 35Miller N.J. Kim C.A. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 26: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). We show that α1m reduces the ABTS radical and simultaneously covalently binds to the radical, forming a distinct purple adduct. The results suggest that the lipocalin α1m may be a radical reductase and scavenger in vivo. Proteins and Reagents—Wild type and mutated variants of α1m were expressed in Escherichia coli. Using site-directed mutagenesis, a Cys → Ser substitution was introduced at amino acid position 34 to give the C34S-α1m mutant (36Kwasek A. Kim P. Allhorn A. Lindqvist A. Åkerström B. Wasylewski Z. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 53: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the recombinant α1m forms, the N terminus was elongated by a 15-amino acid peptide containing eight histidines (His tag) and an enterokinase cleavage site (DDDDKA). The His tag was removed by incubating 10 mg of α1m with 400 units of enterokinase (Sigma) for 5 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0. His tag-free α1m was then separated from enterokinase by gel chromatography, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. Human α1m was prepared from plasma (37Berggård T. Kim N. Falkenberg C. Enghild J.J. Åkerström B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 245: 676-683Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), urine (38Åkerström B. Kim T. Enghild J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and baculovirus-infected insect cells (39Wester L. Kim M.U. Åkerström B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as described. Human plasma, urine, saliva, and tear fluid were obtained from healthy volunteers. All other proteins and reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma if not indicated otherwise. Alkylation of α1m—Thiol groups were alkylated by incubating α1m (0.18 mm) with 22 mm iodoacetamide (IAA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and then dialyzing exhaustively against 25 mm Tris-HCl + 50 mm NaCl, pH 8. Reduced thiol groups were quantified by alkylation with iodo-[14C]acetamide ([14C]IAA) (Amersham Biosciences; specific activity 59.0 mCi (2.2 GBq)/mmol). The reaction mixtures contained 2 μm α1min0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 1 mm [14C]IAA. The reaction proceeded for 60 min at 25 °C in the dark. To determine the amounts of bound [14C]IAA, the alkylated α1m was subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Reduction of ABTS Radical—A stock solution of ABTS radical was prepared following the procedure of Re et al. (40Pe R. Kim N. Proteggente A. Pannala A. Yang M. Rice-Evans C.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17696) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Potassium persulfate was added to a 7 mm ABTS solution in water, to a final concentration of 2.8 mm, allowing at least 5 h for the reaction. The solution was kept in the dark and used within 24 h. In some experiments, the amount of potassium persulfate was varied, producing different ABTS radical/ABTS ratios. The stock solution was diluted 125 times with PBS. α1m, control proteins, and other reagents were added as described for each experiment, and the reaction was followed by monitoring absorbance changes of ABTS and its radical. End point scanning of the reaction products was done after reducing remaining ABTS radicals by adding NaN3 to a final concentration of 60 mm as described (41Shin T. Kim S. Matsumura E. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). pH studies were done by diluting the stock solution with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, or 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0, or 20 mm glycine-OH, pH 9.0. Estimation of Kinetic Parameters—Initial reaction rates were estimated by linear regression analysis of absorbance values obtained during the first 1 min of the reaction. The total formation of products (i.e. the reduced form of ABTS and the purple α1m modification) and the total consumption of ABTS radical during the initial, rapid reaction phase were determined by linear regression analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Km and Vmax values were determined by nonlinear regression of initial reaction rates using different initial α1m (0.5-4 μm) and ABTS radical (7-55 μm) concentrations and using the same ratio between the initial ABTS radical and ABTS concentrations. Spectrophotometric Determinations—Spectrophotometric analyses were done either in a Beckman 7500 photodiode array spectrophotometer or a Beckman DU 640i spectrophotometer. The reaction between α1m and ABTS radical was followed by scanning a 0.5-ml reaction mixture, blanking with PBS or the appropriate dilution buffer. Reading at time 0 was done before the addition of α1m or control proteins, and at regular time intervals after the addition of the proteins. Concentrations of ABTS were determined by using ϵ340 = 4.8 × 104 m-1 cm-1 and of the ABTS radical using ϵ415 = 3.6 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (42Childs R. Kim W.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Concentrations of α1m were determined by using the extinction coefficients at 280 nm reported for urine, plasma, and baculovirus-infected insect cell α1m (39Wester L. Kim M.U. Åkerström B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and 3.6 × 104 m-1 cm-1 for recombinant α1m. The absorbance values at 550 nm at different time points (A550) were calculated after correction for spillover absorbance of the ABTS radical using the following formula: A550 = 0.5 × (A550(observed) - 0.403 × A735) + 0.5 × (A550(observed) - 0.163 × A415). The coefficients in this equation were determined by absorbance scanning of the ABTS radical at known concentrations. Purification of Purple α1m—The purple end product of α1m was purified by gel filtration. α1m (80-140 μm) was incubated for 5 min with the ABTS radical/ABTS stock solution (1.2-1.8 mm) in PBS. After centrifugation at 8000 × g for 2 min, the reaction product was applied to a 1-ml column packed with Sephadex G-25 Fine and equilibrated with 2 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5. The column was eluted with the equilibration buffer at free flow, and 0.2-ml fractions were collected manually. The eluted fractions were analyzed by absorbance scanning. Protein-containing fractions were pooled. SDS-PAGE, Blotting, and N-terminal Sequence Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed using 12% gels in the buffer system described by Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), with or without 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffers. High molecular mass standards (Rainbow markers; Amersham Biosciences) were used. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was achieved by Edman degradation (Protein Analysis Center, KI, Stockholm, Sweden) of bands separated by SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described (44Madsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction of ABTS Radical with Tyrosine—ABTS radicals were generated by using hydrogen peroxide (50 μm) and lactoperoxidase (5 μg/ml) to oxidize ABTS (100 μm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. When the formation of ABTS radicals reached a maximum (approximately 35 μm), catalase (10 μg/ml) was added to scavenge residual hydrogen peroxide. Tyrosine (10-30 μm) was then reacted with the ABTS radicals. It caused a stoichiometric loss in ABTS radicals within 5 min and promoted the formation of a product that had an absorbance maximum from 500 to 550 nm. This final reaction mixture was analyzed by LC/MS as described below. Reaction of α1m with Glycyl-Tyrosyl Radicals—Radicals of the Gly-Tyr peptide were generated using lactoperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide. Reactions were carried out in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 140 mm NaCl, 20 μm Gly-Tyr, 25 μg/ml lactoperoxidase, and 10 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid with or without α1m, orosomucoid, or HSA. They were started by adding 5 μm hydrogen peroxide. After 30 min at 20 °C, the fluorescence due to formation of dityrosine was measured (λex, 325 nm; λem, 405 nm) in a Jasco J-810 Spectrofluorimeter (Jasco Scandinavia AB, Mölndal, Sweden). Preparation of Protease Fragments of α1m after Reaction with ABTS Radicals—ABTS and α1m were reacted and desalted as described previously to generate the purple product. After boiling for 2 min, Pronase (Protease XIV from Streptomyces griseus) at a 1:25 enzyme/substrate ratio was added to the ABTS-α1m and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Alternatively, trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:10 and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The digests were then subjected to HPLC separation on a Phenomenex Luna 5 μ C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) using the following stepwise gradient. From 0 to 5 min, the eluent was 100% solvent A (10% methanol in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 2.5 mm n-octylamine); the organic phase was then increased to 50% over the following 5 min and kept at 50% between 10 and 30 min. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. Peaks that absorbed at 550 nm were well resolved from ABTS and ABTS radical. They were collected for subsequent analysis by LC/MS. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of α1m Digests—Tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC/MS by selecting and fragmenting major ions that eluted in the chromatogram. Peptides that contained ABTS were identified by the presence of an absorbance maximum around 550 nm and characteristic molecular fragments of ABTS in the MS/MS spectrum. The purple digestion products of the ABTS-α1m were separated on a Jupiter Proteo column (particle size 4 μm, 150 × 2.0 mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), using a Surveyor HPLC pump (Thermo Corp., San Jose, CA). The column was maintained at 30 °C. The products were eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using a linear gradient of two solvents: solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile). The gradient was as follows: 0-30 min, increased solvent B to 50%; 30-32 min, increased solvent B to 100%; 32-34 min, maintained solvent B at 100%; 34-35 min, decreased solvent B to 0%. The injection volume was 20 μl. The HPLC was coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus; Thermo Corp.) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. The mass spectrometer was operated with positive ionization using full scan mode (scan range 100-2000 m/z). Spray voltage was set at 3.5 kV, the capillary temperature was set at 275 °C, and the sheath gas flow was set at 35 units (instrument units). For MS/MS experiments, parent ions were fragmented in the ion trap using 35% collision-induced energy. Reaction between α1m and ABTS Radical—The ABTS radical was readily reduced by α1m (Fig. 1). Overlaid scans of the solution show a decrease of the ABTS radical-specific 415 and 735 nm peaks and a concomitant increase of the ABTS-specific peak at 340 nm. An almost complete reduction was seen after 20 min by 3.5 μm α1m (Fig. 1A). Remaining ABTS radicals were reduced by adding 60 mm NaN3, revealing two end products, reduced ABTS, represented by the 340 nm peak, and a novel peak at 550 nm (Fig. 1A, inset), which gave the solution a purple color. Two separate phases of the reaction could be distinguished (Fig. 1B), an initial faster phase over the first 5 min and a second slower phase that was still ongoing after 2 h. A clear difference in the rate of the first phase was seen between α1m and HSA (Fig. 1B) as well as the control proteins ovalbumin, orosomucoid, and soybean trypsin inhibitor (not shown). In contrast, the rate of the second phase was similar between α1m and the control proteins. Thus, the second phase was regarded as nonspecific and is not discussed further. After 5 min, ∼8-9 ABTS radical molecules had been consumed per molecule of α1m. Trolox, a water-soluble analogue of vitamin E, reduced ABTS radical stoichiometrically at a 1:1 molar ratio (not shown). To study the reaction products, 1 mg of α1m was allowed to react with a ∼10-12-fold excess of ABTS radicals for 5 min, applied to a Sephadex G-25 column, and eluted, and fractions were collected (Fig. 2, A and B). The purple product (i.e. the absorbance at 550 nm) co-eluted with the α1m protein (absorbance at 280 nm), whereas remaining ABTS radicals and ABTS were eluted later. The pH dependence of the reactions was investigated between pH 5 and 9 using standard conditions (Fig. 2C). A slow rate of ABTS radical consumption and formation of reduced ABTS was seen at pH 5, the rates increased between pH 5 and 8, and no further increase was seen at pH 9. This suggests possible involvement of cysteine, tyrosine, or histidine residues on α1m, side chains on which deprotonization is likely to occur between pH 5 and 8. A much more striking pH dependence was seen for the formation of the purple ABTS-α1m. The absence of reaction below pH 7 and a sharp increase in the rate between pH 7 and 8 suggest involvement of side groups with a pKa around 7.5. The His tag of the recombinant α1m did not influence the rates of ABTS radical consumption or formation of ABTS-α1m (not shown). This was supported by experiments using plasma and urine α1m, which lack the His tag (see below). The addition of 0.25-1 μm superoxide dismutase did not slow down the consumption of the ABTS radical or the formation of ABTS-α1m (not shown), suggesting that superoxide radicals were not involved. The rate of ABTS radical loss during the first 60 s of the reaction was estimated in various body fluids (Table 1). The decay of the radical in the absence of α1m was substantial in most fluids, but at higher dilutions, this could be subtracted from the loss induced by α1m. As shown in Table 1, similar rates are seen in plasma, urine, saliva, and tear fluid, suggesting that similar reactions may occur in vivo. Furthermore, similar rates are seen at various dilutions of saliva and tear fluid.TABLE 1Reaction rates in various physiological media of 2.5 μm α1m and the standard ABTS radical/ABTS solutionMediumInitial rate of ABTS radical lossaCalculated as described under “Materials and Methods,” subtracting the rate of ABTS radical loss in the absence of α1m50×bFactor dilution of medium with buffer100×200×μm/sBufferc20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.00.37 (0.02)dMean ± S.D.

(n = 3) Open table in a new tab Kinetics and Stoichiometry—The formation of ABTS-α1m coincided in time with the consumption of ABTS radicals and formation of reduced ABTS (Fig. 3A). This suggests that the three reactions are linked. Fig. 3B illustrates how the rate of the consumption of the ABTS radical and the total consumption of ABTS radical were calculated. The same method was employed to calculate the corresponding parameters for the formation of reduced ABTS and the purple ABTS-α1m. The reaction rates for ABTS radical consumption, ABTS formation, and production of ABTS-α1m (A550), calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 3B, were determined at different initial concentrations of the ABTS radical and ABTS. The rate of formation of ABTS-α1m (A550) was independent of the initial ABTS radical and ABTS concentrations (not shown). However, both the rate of ABTS radical consumption and rate of ABTS formation increased to a maximum with increasing initial concentration of ABTS radical (Fig. 4A). The plots show that the rate of consumption of ABTS radical exceeded the rate of formation of reduced ABTS. The Vmax and Km values for the loss of ABTS radicals were calculated by nonlinear regression to be 0.68 ± 0.06 μm s-1 and 27.2 ± 8.1 μm, respectively. These gave a first order rate constant (Vmax/[α1m]) for reaction of ABTS radical with α1m of 0.17 ± 0.02 s-1 and an apparent second order rate constant (Vmax/Km or kapp) for reduction of ABTS radicals of 6.3 ± 2.5 × 103 m-1 s-1. The total ABTS radical consumption and total ABTS formation were plotted as functions of the initial ABTS radical concentration (Fig. 4B). This demonstrated that 8-9 ABTS radical molecules were consumed per α1m molecule, and six ABTS molecules were formed during the first phase of the reaction. This also suggests that up to 2-3 molecules of ABTS were bound to each molecule of α1m (i.e. the amount of ABTS radicals not converted to reduced ABTS). Reactions with Various α1m Forms and Mutants—The reactions of recombinant α1m were compared with those of α1m purified from human plasma and urine and recombinant α1m from baculovirus-infected insect cells. No significant differences in any of the reaction rates were found between the α1m forms (not shown). The influence of the Cys-34 thiol group was studied using the mutated α1m variant C34S-α1m and alkylated α1m (IAA-α1m) (Fig. 5). A significant, but incomplete, decrease of the reduction rate of ABTS radical was seen between the wild type protein and the two thiol group-modified variants. The formation of the purple ABTS-α1m was decreased to background levels using C34S- and IAA-α1m. This suggests that the Cys-34 thiol group is essential for the binding of ABTS to the protein and is also involved in the reduction of the ABTS radical. Molecular Characterization of ABTS-α1m—The purified and desalted ABTS-α1m was allowed to react with a solution of ABTS radical (Fig. 6A). The ABTS-α1m reduced the ABTS radical at a decreased rate compared with α1m. No more purple color was formed. This suggests that the binding of ABTS on the α1m molecule is saturable (i.e. only a limited number of positions on α1m can be modified) and that the sites for the two reactions are partially linked.

https://openalex.org/W2145776545,"Cell-cell contacts are fundamental to multicellular organisms and are subject to exquisite levels of control. Human RPTPmu is a type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that both forms an adhesive contact itself and is involved in regulating adhesion by dephosphorylating components of cadherin-catenin complexes. Here we describe a 3.1 angstrom crystal structure of the RPTPmu ectodomain that forms a homophilic trans (antiparallel) dimer with an extended and rigid architecture, matching the dimensions of adherens junctions. Cell surface expression of deletion constructs induces intercellular spacings that correlate with the ectodomain length. These data suggest that the RPTPmu ectodomain acts as a distance gauge and plays a key regulatory function, locking the phosphatase to its appropriate functional location."

Nearly 800,000 new cases of diabetes mellitus are diagnosed every year in the United States. Although insulin replacement remains the mainstay of treatment, considerable effort has been devoted to developing approaches for cell-based therapy (1Bonner-Weir S. Kim G.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Through these efforts, it may become possible to introduce cells into diabetic patients that not only produce insulin, but also respond appropriately to metabolic signals that regulate insulin production, processing, and secretion. Accomplishing this goal demands a better understanding of the essential determinants of the beta cell phenotype. Whereas no single transcription factor can be considered to be the sole determinant of beta cell function, the homeodomain-containing factor Pdx-1 (Ipf1/Idx-1/Stf-1/MODY4) has been shown to be a major regulator of beta cell function. Initially characterized because of its role in regulating insulin and somatostatin promoters (2Ohlsson H. Kim K. Edlund T.

Additionally, Pdx-1 is expressed in adult beta cells and thus is a potential target for therapeutics. In fact, a newly approved anti-diabetic drug, exendin-4, functions in part through an intracellular signaling cascade activating Pdx-1 (16Buteau J. Kim R. Susini S. Prentki M.

Normally expressed in pancreatic alpha cells, glucagon may be under direct repressional control by Pdx-1 in beta cells (8Ahlgren U. Kim J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H.

To identify new Pdx-1 binding sites, including sites in novel regulatory regions, we have used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 2The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Dox, doxycycline; GO, gene ontology; GST, genomic signature tag; Pdx-1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox protein-1; SACO, serial analysis of chromatin occupancy; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; RT, reverse transcriptase; DN, dominant negative; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; FBS, fetal bovine serum.2The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Dox, doxycycline; GO, gene ontology; GST, genomic signature tag; Pdx-1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox protein-1; SACO, serial analysis of chromatin occupancy; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; RT, reverse transcriptase; DN, dominant negative; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; FBS, fetal bovine serum.

In addition to promoter elements, this array contains enhancers and highly conserved regions that may contain novel regulatory elements or transcripts. Additionally, genomic elements are included that represent micro-RNAs, an abundant class of regulatory RNAs that also have implications for gene regulation. Lastly, the microarray contains putative regulatory regions identified through serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO) (35Impey S. Kim S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H.

Review of the target gene list indicates that Pdx-1 binds to regulatory elements in genes involved in virtually every aspect of the insulin secretory process in beta cells, from glucose uptake and metabolism to insulin processing and release. The data provide a comprehensive framework for understanding Pdx-1 knock-out mouse models that display beta cell dysfunction and systemic glucose intolerance (5Brissova M. Kim M. Nicholson W.E.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2586-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is highly likely that Pdx-1 binding sites are embedded within larger genetic regulatory domains containing multiple transcription factor binding sites. To test this idea, we made a second SACO library from NIT-1 cells using antibodies directed against NeuroD1/BETA2. NeuroD1 is a critical determinant of pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation (37Chae J.H. Kim G.H. Lee J.E. Mol. Cells. 2004; 18: 271-288PubMed Google Scholar), and both Pdx-1 and NeuroD1 regulate insulin expression (2Ohlsson H. Kim K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 38Naya F.J. Kim C.M. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The results from this parallel screen reveal a high degree of target overlap between these two factors and suggest that the identified binding sites may denote regulatory modules (39Howard M.L. Kim E.H. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Levine M. Kim E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4936-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) that are occupied by multiple factors controlling gene expression in a combinatorial fashion. One co-regulated target that we identified is the micro-RNA, miR-375, believed to negatively regulate insulin secretion (41Poy M.N. Kim L. Krutzfeldt J. Kuwajima S. Ma X. Macdonald P.E. Pfeffer S. Tuschl T. Rajewsky N. Rorsman P. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). This result uncovers a previously unknown genetic regulatory pathway involving micro-RNA in pancreatic beta cells and provides a model wherein Pdx-1 and NeuroD1 control both insulin gene expression and its secretion via miR-375. Cell Culture—Mouse insulinoma NIT-1 cells were grown in Kaighn’s modification of Ham’s F-12 medium (F12K) (ATCC, Manassas, VA), which contains 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The inducible DN-Pdx-1 rat insulinoma INS-1 cell line (lacking the first 79 amino acids) was produced by C. B. Wollheim and H. Wang (28Wang H. Kim P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Stable and control INS-1 cells were both grown in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were grown under selection with 50 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Promega, Madison, WI) and 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) and were induced by 300 ng/ml doxycycline (Dox) (Sigma) for 4 days, with media and drugs changed after 2 days. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified chamber in 5% CO2. ChIP—Media was removed from confluent 10-cm plates of NIT-1 cells (∼5 × 106 cells per plate) and replaced with 1% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. The plates were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline on ice and harvested in ice-cold buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4) and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min followed by a 1× phosphate-buffered saline wash. Cell pellets were lysed in 600 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then sonicated to an average size of 2 kb using a bath sonicator (5 × 30 s, 140-W pulses with 30-s rest intervals in ice water) (Misonix, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Samples were centrifuged and supernatants (400 μg of protein) were pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Invitrogen) that was previously blocked with bovine serum albumin (0.25%) and glycogen (0.24 mg/ml). Samples were centrifuged and supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.75 μl (∼25 μg) of rabbit anti-Pdx-1 antiserum raised against the N terminus (5Brissova M. Kim M. Nicholson W.E. Gannon M. Knobel S.M. Piston D.W. Wright C.V. Powers A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11225-11232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), 1 μl of C-terminal anti-Pdx-1 antiserum (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), or 1 μg of purified rabbit anti-NeuroD1 raised against amino acids 122-165 (42Poulin G. Kim M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An equivalent amount of control rabbit antiserum (Sigma) was added to IgG samples and incubated overnight. Anti-Pdx-1 and NeuroD1 complexes were captured with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry) for 2 h at 4 °C, then sequentially washed with lysis buffer 4 times for 10 min each, LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate) once for 10 min, and TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA), once for 30 min and again for 5 min. Elution buffer (100 mm NaHCO3 and 1% SDS) was added directly to the beads and the immunocomplexes were dissociated in two sequential washes of 200 μl each for 15 min at room temperature. The bead supernatants were pooled and incubated at 65 °C over-night to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. The samples were extracted with 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Invitrogen) and nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. Each ChIP sample was resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Mouse Pancreatic Islet Preparation—Pancreata from eight C57BL mice aged 4 to 8 months were injected with 1 ml of cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen) containing 0.3 mg/ml Liberase R1 (Roche Applied Science). Pancreata were then dissected and minced before incubating in a total volume of 5 ml of HBSS at 37 °C for 25 min to allow digestion to occur. Digestions were stopped with the addition of 45 ml of HBSS containing 10% FBS. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min, supernatants removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of HBSS + 10% FBS. Pancreatic islets were visualized by addition of 0.5 mg/ml diphenylthiocarbazone (Sigma) and were placed individually into fresh HBSS and then into RPMI media containing 5 mm glucose, 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin supplements. Approximately 400 islets were maintained overnight at 37 °C in a humidified chamber in 5% CO2 before performing the ChIP assays. Reverse Transcription—INS-1 control and DN-Pdx-1 expressing cells (5 × 105) were plated onto 12-well plates and treated with or without 300 ng/ml doxycycline for 4 days. Total RNA was isolated by extraction with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 500 ng was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis in a reaction containing 50 ng of random primers, 500 μm dNTPs, 1× first-strand buffer, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 20 units of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega) in a 20-μl reaction volume. Samples were diluted 1:5 before using in quantitative PCR. Quantitative PCR—ChIP DNA or cDNA (2 μl) was analyzed in a 10-μl real-time PCR (qPCR) containing 1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 1× SYBR Green, 0.1 unit of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (all PCR reagents from Invitrogen), and 1 μm primers (IDT, Coralville, IA). Primers were designed using Primer3 (frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi) (43Rozen S. Kim H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using default parameters excepting: rodent and simple repeat mispriming library was used; product size was selected as 50-150 bp; optimal primer size was 23 nucleotides; primer Tm was between 65 and 70 °C, with an optimal Tm of 68 °C; maximal self-complementarity was 4.00; and maximal poly-x was 3. For ChIP confirmations, input sequences for Primer3 analysis were 400-bp regions surrounding the mean of the array or SACO loci. In a few cases, additional primers were designed outside this 400-bp window. PCR was performed using a PTC-200 DNA engine cycler with a CFD-3200 Opticon detection system (MJ Research, Inc., Waltham, MA) for one cycle at 95 °C (1 min) and 45 cycles of 94 °C (15 s) and 68 °C (40 s). Standard curves for each primer set were serial dilutions of ChIP input DNA that had been processed in a similar manner to ChIP DNA. Quantitative ChIP data were derived from the standard curve, and expressed as “-Fold change,” in which the sample value was divided by the average of six control values, multiplied by 100. Pdx-1 positive signals were considered to be 2-fold above the average control value, and 2-fold above the average IgG ChIP signal. For RT-PCR, “percent change” was calculated from samples treated with or without Dox. PCR products were further analyzed on 4% NuSieve GTG low-melt agarose gels (Cambrex Bio Science, Inc., Rockland, ME). Only single-band PCR products were considered for analysis. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. Construction of Promoter Microarray—The Mouse PromoterChip BCBC 5B (www.cbil.upenn.edu/EPConDB/) contains over 18,000 1-kb tiles amplified from mouse genomic DNA, and includes promoters, enhancers, conserved sequences, micro-RNAs, and Pdx-1 SACO elements. The array contains 5100 proximal promoters, as determined from full-length cDNA libraries and Reference Sequences (RefSeqs), and 7728 enhancers, defined as a 1-kb sequence containing the most putative transcription factor binding sites (based upon a combined TRANSFAC hit (p value) and human-mouse conservation score) within 5 kb of the transcriptional start site. The array also includes putative regulatory sequences highly conserved between human and pufferfish (1172 tiles) (44Woolfe A. Kim M. Goode D.K. Snell P. McEwen G.K. Vavouri T. Smith S.F. North P. Callaway H. Kelly K. Walter K. Abnizova I. Gilks W. Edwards Y.J. Cooke J.E. Elgar G. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e7Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and pancreatic-specific genes conserved between human and chicken (318 tiles) (45Schug J. Kim W.P. Kappen C. Salbaum J.M. Bucan M. Stoeckert C.J. Jr. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 615 tiles span micro-RNA and surrounding sequences. Lastly, 1981 tiles were added that are potential regulatory regions as identified through the Pdx-1 SACO assay. ChIP-on-Chip Assay—Pdx-1 and IgG ChIP DNA from two independent experiments, each performed in duplicate, were amplified by ligation-mediated PCR and fluorescently labeled as described (46Friedman J.R. Kim B. Le P.P. Peiris T.H. Arsenlis A. Schug J. Tobias J.W. Kaestner K.H. Greenbaum L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12986-12991Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Labeled DNA was hybridized to the Mouse PromoterChip BCBC-5B. SACO Assay—The Pdx-1 SACO library was made as described (35Impey S. Kim S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2004; 119: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Briefly, sonicated ChIP DNA was first amplified by ligation-mediated PCR, then digested with NlaIII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) leaving an overhanging CATG. Adapters with corresponding CATG overhangs that contained a recognition site for MmeI (New England Biolabs) were then ligated. MmeI cleaves 20-22-bp downstream from its binding site, leaving a dinucleotide overhang. The digested fragments were then self-ligated to form “ditags.” The Mme adapters were cleaved using NlaIII, concatamerized, and subcloned into pZERO-2 (Invitrogen). Sequencing of concatamers was performed by Rexagen Corp. (Seattle, WA). Statistical Analysis—Detailed descriptions of the procedures are provided in the MIAME supplement. In brief, after examination of QA/QC metrics and normalization, a regularized t test was used to determine enrichment using a level of significance of 0.05. Putative targets were identified as those elements meeting both the statistical criteria as well as a biological threshold (i.e. fold > 1.4). For all tables, q-values are reported (47Storey J.D. Kim R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9440-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (6936) Google Scholar). The q-value of a test measures the proportion of false positives incurred (the false discovery rate) when that particular test is called significant. Annotation of the array was done using the mouse (mm8) assembly. Elements were mapped to target genes using the Entrez Gene Identifier. Categorical data analysis was performed to examine if particular TRANSFAC motifs, Gene Ontology (GO) categories, or KEGG pathways were over-represented in the candidate target gene list compared with the expected frequency of those categories based on the entire array. Quality of Pdx-1 ChIP—To test the quality of the Pdx-1 ChIP, we measured the signal obtained on the well characterized Pdx-1 target gene, insulin. Pdx-1 ChIPs were performed using NIT-1 insulinoma cells, a mouse beta cell line, and the results were analyzed using qPCR. Fig. 1 demonstrates the specificity of the Pdx-1 antiserum, as there was an ∼14-fold enrichment for the insulin promoter using anti-Pdx-1 versus IgG antiserum. As an additional control, genes not expressed in this cell line were also examined, demonstrating that the Pdx-1 antibody does not precipitate nonspecific sequences. Analysis of Pdx-1 Genomic Binding Sites—A collection of high confidence binding sites was identified by hybridizing the Pdx-1 ChIP DNA and control IgG DNA to the Mouse Promoter-Chip BCBC-5B microarray. A high confidence binding site was defined as having a -fold change over IgG greater than 1.4 and p value <0.05, as well as meeting the QA/QC metrics for the array (based on PCR flags). 817 elements on the array were identified as high confidence sites (supplemental Table S2). This included 298 mouse-human conserved elements, 230 elements from the Pdx-1 SACO library, 152 proximal promoter elements, 107 human-pufferfish conserved elements, 22 human-chicken conserved elements, and 8 elements that were within 5 kb of micro-RNAs (supplemental Table S2). We analyzed the Pdx-1 positive elements for occurrences of a Pdx-1 binding motif as identified by the TRANSFAC data base (48Matys V. Kim E. Geffers R. Gossling E. Haubrock M. Hehl R. Hornischer K. Karas D. Kel A.E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Kloos D.U. Land S. Lewicki-Potapov B. Michael H. Munch R. Reuter I. Rotert S. Saxel H. Scheer M. Thiele S. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). We found that this motif was highly enriched (χ2 = 47.05, df = 1, p < 1 × 10-5), when compared with all array tiles (subtracting out the SACO elements because they are already considered to be enriched for Pdx-1 motifs), providing additional evidence that the sites identified are valid Pdx-1 target sites. To begin to assign functional significance to the Pdx-1 binding sites, we mapped the elements to 583 gene targets (based on unique Entrez Gene ID) after duplicate genes were removed. To confirm whether these high confidence binding sites were authentic, we randomly selected 30 for repeat ChIP assays using specific primers. 100% of the sites were confirmed by repeat ChIP assay and qPCR analysis (Fig. 2A). As qPCR analysis is more sensitive than the hybridization signal obtained from microarray analysis, in this case a positive signal was considered to have a -fold change of 2.0 above a nonspecific IgG ChIP and a -fold change of 2.0 above a selection of negative control genes. Negative control genes were selected because they were transcriptionally silent in NIT-1 cells, and the data are displayed at the far right in Fig. 2A. As an additional control, we repeated the ChIP assays using Pdx-1 antiserum that recognizes another epitope and obtained the same confirmation rate (data not shown). Furthermore, we performed ChIP assays for Pdx-1 and IgG using isolated mouse pancreatic islets and confirmed the majority (7/10) of targets tested (Fig. 2B). Pdx-1 Target Genes Control Critical Functions of Beta Cell Biology—To categorize the properties of the genes associated with Pdx-1 binding sites, we utilized the GO biological process classification (www.geneontology.org) (Table 1 and supplemental Table S3).

However, we did not know how HSF1 regulates non-heat shock genes. Here, we show that constitutive HSF1 binding to the interleukin (IL)-6 promoter is necessary for its maximal induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in mouse embryo fibroblasts and peritoneal macrophages. Lack of HSF1 inhibited LPS-induced in vivo binding of an activator NF-κB and a repressor ATF3 to IL-6 promoter. Neither NF-κB nor ATF3 binds to the IL-6 promoter in unstimulated HSF1-null cells even if they were overexpressed. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor or a DNA methylation inhibitor restored LPS-induced IL-6 expression in HSF1-null cells, and histone modification enzymes were recruited on the IL-6 promoter in the presence of HSF1. Consistently, chromatin structure of the IL-6 promoter in the presence of HSF1 was more open than that in its absence. These results indicate that HSF1 partially opens the chromatin structure of the IL-6 promoter for an activator or a repressor to bind to it, and provides a novel mechanism of gene regulation by HSF1.

One of major adaptive responses to high temperature stress in all living organisms is to induce heat shock proteins, which assist protein folding and inhibit protein denaturation (1Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). This response is regulated mainly at the level of transcription by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), 2The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock transcription factor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HSE, heat shock element; Hsp, heat shock protein; LPS, lipopolysaccaride; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; CBP, CREB-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; pfu, plaque forming unit. which can sense an increase in temperature (2Wu C.

Furthermore, HSF1 inhibits expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β by binding directly to the tumor necrosis factor-α promoter (16Singh I.S. He J.R. Calderwood S. Hasday J.D. J. Biol.

However, it is still unclear how HSF1 regulates expression of non-heat shock genes. To understand molecular mechanisms of the regulation of cytokine expression by HSF1, we further examined expression of IL-6. Although the effect of HSF1 on IL-6 expression is moderate, HSF1-mediated IL-6 expression may be involved in various aspects of inflammatory and immune response such as antibody production (14Inouye S.

Here, we found a novel function of HSF1 that partially opens the chromatin structure of the IL-6 promoter for an activator or a repressor to bind to it in unstressed conditions. Cell Cultures and Treatments—Primary cultures of wild-type, HSF1-/- mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells were prepared and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (18Inouye S.

Primers to amplify IL-6, Hsp70-1, and β-actin fragments are: IL6F2, 5′-CTGGTGACAACCACGGCCTTCCCTA-3′; IL6R2, 5′-ATGCTTAGGCATAACGCAGTAGGTT-3′; m70-23-1, 5′-AAGAACGCGCTCGAGTCCTATGT-3; m70-23-2, 5′-CTGGTACAGTGCACAGTGCTGCT-3′; β-actin 5′,5′-GACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGAT-3′; and β-actin 3′,5′-TTGCTGATCCACATCTGCTG-3′. The amplified DNA fragments were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed using Epi-Light UV FA1100 (Aisin Cosmos R&D Co., Japan). Levels of mRNAs were estimated using the NIH Image program. Western Blot Analysis and Gel Shift Assay—Cell extracts were prepared from MEF cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min.

The amount of bound and free DNA in saturating binding was quantified by image analysis. The Kd for HSE81 and HSE2 was determined from Scatchard analysis and the equation of the best-fit line with the formula Kd =-1/slope. Viral Infection—To generate adenovirus vectors, cDNAs for wild-type human HSF1 and mutants HSF1(R71G) and HSF1(R71A) containing Kozak consensus sequence were amplified by PCR using pZeo-hHSF1, pZeo-hHSF1R71G, and pZeo-hHSF1R71A (18Inouye S.

The fragment was inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) at BamHI and EcoRI sites to generate pcDNA3.1-mATF3. To generate adenovirus vector, a KpnI/EcoRV fragment of pcDNA3.1-mATF3 was inserted into the pShuttle-CMV vector (Stratagene). A full-length cDNA fragment of mouse NF-κB p65 containing the Kozak consensus sequence and hemagglutinin tag was amplified using primers: mp65N, 5′-CGCAAGCTTGCCACCATGGACGATCTGTTT-3′ and mp65C, 5′-GCGCTCGAGTTATCCAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGGAGCTGATCTGACTCAAAAG-3′ (underlined sequences indicates HindIII and XhoI, respectively). Amplified cDNAs were inserted into the pShuttle-CMV vector at HindIII and XhoI sites. Adenoviruses, Ad-mATF3 and Ad-mp65, were generated as described above. Titers of virus stocks were 1-5 × 108 pfu/ml. MEF cells plated in 100-mm dishes containing 10 ml of medium were infected with Ad-HSF1 and Adenoviruses expressing HSF1 mutants at a titer of 8 × 105 pfu/ml, Ad-mATF3 at a titer of 1.2 × 105 pfu/ml, and Ad-mp65 at a titer of 0.6 × 105 pfu/ml. At 24 h after infection of viruses, cells were harvested for assay or treated with LPS for the indicated periods. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—ChIP-enriched DNAs were prepared from MEF cells as described previously. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were rabbit antiserum for mouse HSF1 (αHSF1c) (14Inouye S. Izu H. Takaki E. Suzuki H. Shirai M. Yokota Y. Ichikawa H. Fujimoto M. Nakai A. J. Biol.

Then genomic DNA was isolated from the nuclei using DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA (5 μg) was digested completely with XbaI and SpeI (20 units each) at 37 °C overnight, and 1.8-kb (-1109 to +626) and 0.9-kb (-1109 to -262) DNA fragments were amplified by 30 cycles of PCR using LA Taq polymerase. Primers used were: IL-6g1, 5′-GACCCAGCCTAGAAGACTTGAGC-3′; IL-6g3, 5′-GCAGTCACATTCTGTATCCTTCCAGACAGG-3′; and IL-6g4, 5′-CTTTAAAAGTGACTCAGCACTTGAGC-3′. The DNA fragments were subjected to Southern blot analysis, and signals were quantified by image analysis. The percentage of cleavage was calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 7. Statistical Analysis—Significant values were determined by analyzing data with the Mann-Whitney's U test using Stat View version 4.5J for Macintosh (Abacus Concepts, CA). A level of p < 0.05 as considered significant. HSF1 Is Required for Maximal Induction of IL-6 Expression—We showed previously that HSF1 is required for IL-6 to be maximally induced in cultured spleen cells and peritoneal macrophages in response to LPS treatment (14Inouye S.

Here, we examined IL-6 expression in primary cultures of MEF because NF-κB-regulated genes are induced in response to LPS stimulation (27Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Kaisho T. Sanjo H.

Consistent with a previous report, LPS-induced levels of IL-6 mRNA and secreted IL-6 levels in media were much lower in HSF1-null MEF and macrophage cells than those in wild-type cells, and heat shock did not induce IL-6 expression (Fig. 1, A and B). When cells were treated with LPS, IL-6 expression is induced mainly by NF-κB, and then suppressed by ATF3, a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors (28Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 29Gilchrist M. Thorsson V. Li B. Rust A.G. Korb M. Kennedy K. Hai T. Bolouri H. Aderem A. Gilchrist M. Nature. 2006; 441: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In addition to NF-κB, many transcription factors such as NF-IL6, AP-1, IRF-1, and ATF-2 enhance IL-6 expression (30Ray A.

Previous work suggests that HSF1 might directly activate specific transcription factors such as NF-IL6 (17Xie Y. Chen C. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11802-11810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, we found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and serum stimulations moderately induced IL-6 expression and interferon-γ treatment accelerates LPS-induced expression, whereas IL-6 expression is less induced by all of these stimuli in HSF1-null cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we found that constitutive and LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA levels were restored when HSF1 was re-expressed into HSF1-null cells, whereas these were not restored at all when HSF1(R71G) or HSF1(R71A), in which a DNA contact site arginine was substituted to glycine or alanine (18Inouye S.

These results demonstrate that DNA binding of HSF1 is necessary to induce IL-6 expression at a maximal level, and excluded the possibility that HSF1 directly affects some other transcription factors. HSF1 Binds to IL-6 Promoter on Unstressed Conditions—Comparison of mouse and human IL-6 promoter sequences revealed conserved three HSE-like sequences within -1,000 bp from transcription start sites (supplemental Fig. S1) (14Inouye S. Izu H. Takaki E. Suzuki H. Shirai M. Yokota Y. Ichikawa H. Fujimoto M. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38701-38709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis showed that binding of HSF1 was detected in unstressed cells by PCR amplification of an HSE2 fragment (-827 to -565) containing overlapping HSE-like HSE1 and HSE2 sequences, but not of an HSE3 fragment (-230 to +31) containing an HSE-like HSE3 sequence and major regulatory elements (Fig. 2A). This result strongly suggests that the HSE2 (overlapping with HSE1), which is located in a uniquely distal position among other regulatory elements, is an HSF1-binding site. Even though HSF1 directly binds to the IL-6 promoter, heat shock did not induce IL-6 expression (Fig. 1A). Consistently, the level of HSF1 binding to IL-6 promoter was nearly constant during heat shock although the level of HSF1 binding to the Hsp70 promoter increased significantly (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, it is unlikely that HSF1 recruits transcriptional initiation complexes on the IL-6 promoter (2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref Scopus (982) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of unique interactions between HSF1 and the IL-6 promoter, we performed saturation binding to determine apparent dissociation constants (Kd) (23Kroeger P.E. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3370-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HSF1 binding to an HSE2 probe was saturated at a much lower concentration of the probe than that to an ideal probe, and Scatchard analysis revealed that the Kd value of HSF1 binding to an HSE2 probe (21.3 nm) was 7-fold higher than that to an ideal HSE probe (3.3 nm) (Fig. 2C). HSF1 is known to exist as a monomer that cannot bind to DNA in unstressed cells. In response to heat shock, it is converted to a DNA-binding trimer that activates heat shock genes (2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 3Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). However, recent loss-of-function analysis of HSF1 revealed that HSF1 regulates target gene expression in unstressed cells (35Nakai A. Ishikawa T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2885-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Yan L.J. Christians E.S. Liu L. Xiao X. Sohal R.S. Benjamin I.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and during development (11Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4931-4937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether an HSF1 monomer could play any role or not, we generated a deleted HSF1 (HSF1ΔAB) that lacks the oligomerization domain, and point mutant HSF1(R176P) in which arginine at amino acid 176 in the oligomerization domain was mutated to proline (Fig. 3A). Wild-type HSF1 forms a DNA binding trimer when it was overexpressed in cells, whereas HSF1ΔAB was unable to bind to DNA in vitro as it stayed a monomer (Fig. 3, B and C). Overexpressed HSF1(R176P) stayed mostly a monomer in unstressed cells and was unable to bind to DNA in vitro even though it formed a trimer on heat shock conditions (Fig. 3, B and C). We found that the two HSF1 mutants neither bind to the IL-6 promoter in vivo (Fig. 3D), nor restore IL-6 expression in HSF1-null cells (Fig. 3E). These results strongly suggest that an HSF1 monomer cannot bind to the IL-6 promoter in vivo. A little amount of HSF1 trimer that exists in unstressed cells (Fig. 3, B and C) may bind to the IL-6 promoter in vivo in unstressed cells. HSF1 Is Required for ATF3 and NF-κB to Bind to IL-6 Promoter in Unstimulated Cells—To understand interplay of HSF1 and a transcriptional repressor or an activator on the IL-6 promoter, we examined whether HSF1 is required for ATF3 to suppress LPS-induced IL-6 expression. Surprisingly, overexpression of ATF3 into wild-type cells suppressed LPS induction of the IL-6 mRNA level, whereas its overexpression into HSF1-null cells had no effect on the LPS-induced level (Fig. 4, A and B). The partial inhibitory effect of ATF3 in wild-type cells was expected because loss of ATF3 function also led to a moderate increase of IL-6 expression (Fig. 4C). ChIP analysis identified that constitutive and LPS-induced binding of ATF3 on the IL-6 promoter was much less in HSF1-null cells compared with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 4D). Remarkably, ATF3 never bound to the IL-6 promoter in vivo in unstimulated HSF1-null cells even though ATF3 was ectopically overexpressed in the nucleus (Fig. 4E). These results demonstrate that HSF1 is required for ATF3 to bind to the IL-6 promoter in vivo in unstressed cells, and it promotes LPS-induced ATF3 binding to the promoter. To examine whether HSF1 is required for binding of only a negative regulator ATF3 or not, we analyzed p65, a component of NF-κB that is a major transcriptional activator for LPS-induced gene expression. We found that LPS-induced in vivo binding of p65 was markedly low in HSF1-null cells although most p65 translocated into the nucleus after LPS treatment (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, p65 never bound to the IL-6 promoter in unstimulated HSF1-null cells even though p65 was overexpressed in the nucleus (Fig. 5B). These results clearly showed that HSF1 promotes binding of both an activator and a repressor to IL-6 promoter. HSF1 Affects Modification of Histone and DNA—As the above results suggested that HSF1 may regulate chromatin structure of the IL-6 promoter on unstressed cells, we treated cells with tricostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, and found that the inhibitors elevated constitutive and LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA levels in HSF1-null cells to the levels in wild-type cells (Fig. 6A). These treatments did not alter mRNA levels of β-actin as well as Hsp70, whose promoter is opening in the absence of heat shock (37Lis J. Wu C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The result indicated that the inhibitors mimic the effects of HSF1, implying the function of HSF1 is for chromatin remodeling. Furthermore, ChIP analysis showed that histone H3 was more acetylated in the presence of HSF1, which is associated with increased recruitment of CBP histone acetylase and BRG1, an ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex (Fig. 6B). As HSF1 physically interacts with BRG1 (38Sullivan E.K. Weirich C.S. Guyon J.R. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5826-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and a plant HSF interacts with CBP (39Bharti K. Von Koskull-Doring P. Bharti S. Kumar P. Tintschl-Korbitzer A. Treuter E. Nover L. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1521-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), our results suggest that HSF1 could recruit CBP and SWI/SNF complex on IL-6 promoter directly or indirectly in the absence of any stimulus. HSF1 Promotes Chromatin Opening of IL-6 Promoter—We next examined remodeling of IL-6 promoter-encompassing nucleosomes by HSF1 using the restriction enzyme accessibility assay. Isolated nuclei were treated with AflII restriction enzyme that can specifically digest a site located between NF-κB and ATF3 binding sites (Fig. 7A). We found that the IL-6 promoter was not cleaved at all by treating with 20 units of AflII for 15 min in unstimulated HSF1-null MEF cells, although the promoter was efficiently cleaved in unstimulated wild-type cells (Fig. 7B). Cleavage rates of IL-6 promoter in both wild-type and HSF1-null cells increased following LPS stimulation, but the IL-6 promoter in wild-type cells was more efficiently cleaved than that in HSF1-null cells at any time points after LPS treatment (Fig. 7C). IL-6 promoter in macrophages treated with or without LPS was also cleaved more efficiently in the presence of HSF1 (Fig. 7D). Heat shock treatment did not affect the cleavage rate by AflII (Fig. 7E). These results demonstrate that HSF1 is necessary to partially open the chromatin structure under basal conditions and also enhances opening its chromatin structure in response to LPS stimulation, and are consistent with HSF1-dependent accessibility of ATF3 and NF-κBonthe IL-6 promoter (Figs. 4 and 5). A unique feature of HSF1 regulation on IL-6 expression is that HSF1 facilitates binding of ATF3 and NF-κB on the IL-6 promoter in some cells such as MEF cells. Even in the absence of stress, HSF1 partially opens the chromatin structure of the IL-6 promoter, and this activity is also important for a repressor ATF3 and an activator NF-κB to bind to the promoter when cells are stimulated with LPS. HSF1 may facilitate LPS-induced chromatin opening by unknown factors. This novel function of HSF1 explains why HSF1 is required for IL-6 to be maximally induced in response to LPS treatment in MEF cells, cultured spleen cells, and peritoneal macrophages (14Inouye S.

Previous work showed that HSF1 is required for targeting histone acetylation and recruiting chromatin remodeling complex to heat shock genes in response to heat shock (40Corey L.L. Weirich C.S. Benjamin I.J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 41Thomson S. Hollis A. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and histone acetylation precedes chromatin opening of the yeast Hsp82 gene (42Erkina T.Y. Erkine A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7587-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, there was no evidence that HSF1 can induce histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling in unstressed cells. Our results revealed recruitment of histone acetylase and nucleosome remodeling complexes on the non-heat shock IL-6 gene by HSF1 in unstressed cells, which is required for the IL-6 gene to be fully activated or repressed. As was showed in IL-6 promoters, there are many HSE-like sequences that could be bound by HSFs. In fact, in vivo ChIP analysis showed many non-heat shock genes that are bound by HSF1 (43Trinklein N.D. Murray J.I. Hartman S.J. Botstein D. Myers R.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). HSF is localized at specific loci on chromosomes in unstressed Drosophila salivary glands (44Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C.

Our observations suggest that HSF1 might play a general role in maintaining the nucleosome-free structure over the transcription start site of constitutively expressed genes. We do not know the molecular basis explaining why HSF1 can play a role in unstressed cells, as HSF1 mostly stays a monomer that cannot bind to DNA in unstressed conditions (2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 3Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the level of HSF1 binding to the IL-6 promoter was nearly constant during heat shock although the level of HSF1 binding to the Hsp70 promoter increased significantly (Fig. 2B). This result is unexpected because less than several percent of HSF1 existed as a trimer in unstressed MEF cells and nearly 100% of it existed as a trimer in heat-shocked cells (Fig. 3B). In unstressed cells, does an abundant HSF1 monomer bind to the IL-6 promoter? Our analysis strongly suggests that an HSF1 monomer cannot bind to the IL-6 promoter in vivo (Fig. 3). Therefore, binding of a little trimeric HSF1 to its HSE2 sequence could saturate at a much lower concentration as was suggested in Fig. 2C, or binding of an HSF1 trimer to IL-6 promoter might be stabilized by unknown factors in unstressed cells. The IL-6 gene possessing such a unique feature might represent genes to which HSF1 binds constitutively and constantly, irrespective of heat shock. We thank Dr. S. Ishii and S.

https://openalex.org/W2169214521,"Cell entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is strikingly linked to lipoproteins and their receptors. Particularly, high density lipoprotein (HDL) enhances infectivity of HCV by involving the lipid-transfer function of the scavenger receptor BI, a receptor for both HDL and HCV. Here, we demonstrate that apoC-I, an exchangeable apolipoprotein that predominantly resides in HDL, specifically enhances HCVcc and HCVpp infectivity and increases the fusion rates between viral and target membranes via a direct interaction with the HCV surface. We identify the hypervariable region 1, located at the N terminus of the HCV E2 glycoprotein, as an essential viral component that modulates apoC-I-mediated enhancement of HCV fusion properties. The affinity of apoC-I for the HCV membrane may predispose it for fusion with a target membrane via alterations of its outer phospholipid layer. Conversely, we found that excess apoC-I provided as lipoprotein-free protein induces the disruption of the HCV membrane and subsequent loss of infectivity. Furthermore, our data indicate that HDL neither interacts nor spontaneously exchanges apoC-I with HCV virions. Because apoC-I is not present in serum as a lipoprotein-free form, our results suggest that HDL-embedded apoC-I could be released from the lipoprotein particle through a fine-tuned mechanism regulated via a triple interplay between hypervariable region 1, HDL, and scavenger receptor BI, resulting in optimal apoC-I recruitment on the viral membrane.

Nature. 2005; 436: 930-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HCV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. Its genome encodes a single polyprotein processed by viral and cellular proteases into three structural (core, E1 and E2 glycoproteins) and seven non-structural proteins (3Lindenbach B.D. Kim C.M. Flaviviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 991-1042Google Scholar, 4Penin F. Kim J. Rey F.A. Moradpour D. Pawlotsky J.M. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). For a long time the study of HCV cell entry has remained limited because the ex vivo characterization of HCV derived from plasma has proven extremely difficult. This is due in large part to the low infectivity of the virus in cultures of primary hepatocytes, to its high genetic heterogeneity, and to its association through different forms with lipoproteins. Thus, to overcome these severe limitations toward the molecular characterization of HCV infection, several surrogate assays have been developed. Two relevant and complementary in vitro cell entry assays consist of cell culture-grown genuine HCV (HCVcc) derived from a fulminant hepatitis C, JFH-1 (5Lindenbach B.D. Kim M.J. Syder A.J. Wolk B.

Although HCVcc further permit investigation of the late infection steps, HCVpp, which can be produced in non-hepatic cells that can be readily complemented with hepatic factors, offers a particularly flexible plate form to study the structure/function relationship of HCV glycoproteins both in cell culture and in liposome fusion assays in vitro (11Lavillette D.

Thus, both HCVcc and HCVpp infection assays reproduce some cell entry features of native HCV and allow a precise dissection of the cellular and viral factors involved in the early events of HCV infection (for review, see Refs. 12Barth H.

The viral surface glycoproteins, E1E2, and their receptors mediate the cell entry processes of HCV. At least three receptors for HCV E2 have been identified that mediate concentration, binding, and cell entry of viral particles. They include glycosaminoglycans, the CD81 tetraspanin, and the scavenger receptor B-I (SR-BI), a major receptor of high density lipoprotein (HDL). Using HCVpp and HCVcc infection assays as well as in vitro membrane fusion assays, HCV entry has been shown to occur in a pH-dependent manner (10Hsu M. Kim J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C.

On the other hand, an essential component of HDL that seems responsible for infection enhancement is the apolipoprotein C-I (apoC-I) (35Meunier J.C. Kim R.E. Faulk K. Zhao M. Bartosch B. Alter H. Emerson S.U. Cosset F.L. Purcell R.H. Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ApoC-I is a small plasma protein (57 amino-acids) composed of two amphipathic α-helices. It is the smallest of the exchangeable apolipoproteins (A-I, A-II, A-IV, C-I, C-II, C-III, and E) and circulates in the bloodstream associated with HDL, mainly and with very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron particles (40Cohn J.S.

Its capacity to interact with lipid surfaces underlies a number of its functional properties and its important role in regulating plasma lipoprotein metabolism (42Jong M.C. Kim M.H. Havekes L.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 472-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Shachter N.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of the early steps of HCV infection by HDL. We demonstrate that apoC-I increases HCVcc and HCVpp membrane fusion via a direct and specific interaction with HCV particles. We show that the HVR1 region is an essential viral component that modulates this interaction and enhancement of HCV fusogenicity. Our data indicate that lipoprotein-associated apoC-I induces HCV infection enhancement through a mechanism that is regulated via a triple interplay between HVR1, HDL, and SR-BI, which results in optimal apoC-I recruitment on the viral membrane. These results provide the first description of a host-soluble factor helping the fusion process of an enveloped virus.

Inflammation is also believed to be integral to the pathogenesis of AD. Here we show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a strong inducer of inflammation, stimulates the production of Aβ in cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 or human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells, both of which express a mutant type of APP. We have demonstrated using subtype-specific agonists that, of the four main subtypes of PGE2 receptors (EP1–4), EP4 receptors alone or EP2 and EP4 receptors together are responsible for this PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells, respectively. An EP4 receptor antagonist suppressed the PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in HEK293 cells. This stimulation was accompanied by an increase in cellular cAMP levels, and an analogue of cAMP stimulated the production of Aβ, demonstrating that increases in the cellular level of cAMP are responsible for the PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ. Immunoblotting experiments and direct measurement of γ-secretase activity suggested that PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ is mediated by activation ofγ-secretase but not of β-secretase. Transgenic mice expressing the mutant type of APP showed lower levels of Aβ in the brain, when they were crossed with mice lacking either EP2 or EP4 receptors, suggesting that PGE2-mediated activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors is involved in the production of Aβ in vivo and in the pathogenesis of AD.

Transgenic mice expressing the mutant type of APP showed lower levels of Aβ in the brain, when they were crossed with mice lacking either EP2 or EP4 receptors, suggesting that PGE2-mediated activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors is involved in the production of Aβ in vivo and in the pathogenesis of AD.

AD is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of tangles and senile plaques. Senile plaques are composed of the amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) Aβ40 and Aβ42 (1Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10847) Google Scholar, 2Mattson M.P. Nature. 2004; 430: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated by secretase-dependent proteolysis of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Prior to proteolysis, APP undergoes modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. To generate Aβ40 and Aβ42, APP is first cleaved by β-secretase and then by γ-secretase. For the cleavage of APP, β-secretase competes with α-secretase, which produces non-amyloidogenic peptides (3Sisodia S.S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 4Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). The γ-secretase is an aspartyl protease complex composed of four core components, including presenilin (PS) 1 and PS2 (5Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The early onset familial AD is linked to three genes, APP, PS1, and PS2 (5Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 6Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the production of Aβ, which reflects the proteolysis of APP by secretases (particularly γ-secretase), is a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, cellular factors that stimulate the production of Aβ may be good drug targets for the prevention and treatment of AD. It has been repeatedly suggested that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of AD. Chronic inflammation, which is indicated by accumulation of microglia around senile plaques and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen species, has been observed in the brains of AD patients (7Townsend K.P. Pratico D. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1592-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, trauma to the brain and ischemia, both of which can activate inflammation, are major risk factors for AD (8Ikonomovic M.D. Uryu K. Abrahamson E.E. Ciallella J.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Clark R.S. Marion D.W. Wisniewski S.R. DeKosky S.T. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 190: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Prostaglandins (PGs), one of the major groups of chemical mediators in the mammalian body, are potent inducers of inflammation (9Srinivasan B.D. Kulkarni P.S. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 312: 229-249PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase (COX) is essential for the synthesis of PGs and has two subtypes, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most cell types, whereas expression of COX-2 is induced by various factors including inflammatory cytokines and is responsible for the progression of inflammation (10Vane J. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 11Smith C.J. Zhang Y. Koboldt C.M. Muhammad J. Zweifel B.S. Shaffer A. Talley J.J. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13313-13318Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of PGE2, a major proinflammatory product of COX, and overexpression of COX-2 have been observed in the brains of AD patients (12Kitamura Y. Shimohama S. Koike H. Kakimura J.

Roberts L.J. 2nd Morrow Neurology. 1999; 53: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the extent of COX-2 expression correlates with the amount of Aβ and the degree of progression of AD pathogenesis (15Ho L. Purohit D. Haroutunian V. Luterman J.D. Willis F. Naslund J. Buxbaum J.D. Mohs R.C. Aisen P.S. Pasinetti G.M. Arch. Neurol. 2001; 58: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress COX-2 have been reported to show stimulation of aging-dependent neural apoptosis and memory dysfunction (16Andreasson K.I. Savonenko A. Vidensky S. Goellner J.J. Zhang Y. Shaffer A. Kaufmann W.E. Worley P.F. Isakson P. Markowska A.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8198-8209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These previous studies suggest that COX-2 and PGE2 are important in the pathogenesis of AD and are therefore good targets for potential AD drugs. Supporting this notion, epidemiological studies have revealed that prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), inhibitors of COX, delays the onset and reduces the risk of AD (17in t'Veld, B. A., Ruitenberg, A., Hofman, A., Launer, L. J., van Duijn, C. M., Stijnen, T., Breteler, M. M., and Stricker, B. H. (2001) N. Engl. J. Med. 345, 1515–1521Google Scholar). In an animal model of AD, administration of some NSAIDs decreased the amount of Aβ and senile plaques and suppressed microglial activation (18Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7504-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in cultured cells, treatment with NSAIDs decreased the amount of Aβ (21Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 22Weggen S.

Therefore, NSAIDs have attracted much attention as a new class of drugs for the treatment of AD. However, clinical use of NSAIDs is associated with various side effects, such as gastrointestinal complications (23Hawkey C.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 521-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and cardiovascular thrombotic events (24Singh D. Br. Med. J. 2004; 329: 816Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Ray W.A. Griffin M.R. Stein C.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These side effects are mainly due to an NSAID-induced nonspecific decrease in the levels of various types of prostanoids and eicosanoids and the inhibition of signal transduction mediated by their receptors. Identification of specific prostanoids and eicosanoids, or of their receptors that are involved in the anti-AD activity of NSAIDs, is therefore important for the development of new types of drugs for AD with a reduced risk of side effects. Based on the studies described above, it is reasonable to hypothesize that PGE2 increases the amount of Aβ. In fact, it was recently reported that PGE2 stimulates the production of Aβ in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (26Qin W. Ho L. Pompl P.N. Peng Y. Zhao Z. Xiang Z. Robakis N.K. Shioi J. Suh J. Pasinetti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50970-50977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism governing this stimulation has remained unclear. For example, whereas PGE2 receptors have been pharmacologically subdivided into four main subtypes (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) (27Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar), the EP subtype involved in this PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ has not been identified. In the present study, we have confirmed that PGE2 stimulates the production of Aβ in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. Experiments with EP agonists and antagonists have revealed that, depending on cell type, the EP4 receptor alone or the EP2 and EP4 receptors together are involved in the PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ. Furthermore, experiments with transgenic mice suggest that EP2 and EP4 receptors are also involved in the production of Aβ in vivo. Based on the results of the current study, we propose that antagonists for both EP2 and EP4 receptors may be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of AD.

APP23 mice were crossed with EP2–/– mice (31Hizaki H. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Hirose M. Saji T. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Noda Y. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Parallel crosses were made between APPsw mice and C57BL/6 mice (wild type mice for EP2–/– mice) to generate APPsw/EP2+/+ control mice. Most EP4–/– mice die in the C57BL/6 background. Therefore, survivors of the F2 progenies of EP4–/– mice in the mixed genetic background of 129/Ola and C57BL/6 were intercrossed and the resulting female survivors were used as described (32Kabashima K. Saji T. Murata T. Nagamachi M. Matsuoka T. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Sugimoto Y. Kobayashi T. Miyachi Y. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Clin.

APP23 mice were crossed to these EP4–/– mice to generate APPsw/EP4+/– mice and these were crossed to EP4–/– mice to generate APPsw/EP4–/– mice. Parallel crosses were made between APPsw mice and mice in the mixed genetic background of 129/Ola and C57BL/6 to generate APPsw/EP4+/+ control mice. The experiments and procedures described here were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institute of Health, and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kumamoto University. Cell Culture—HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells expressing APPsw were from our laboratory stocks (34Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Araki W. Suzuki K. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For transient expression of each gene, cells were seeded 24 h before the transfection in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. The transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine (TM2000) or HilyMax according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used for experiments after a 24-h recovery period. Transfection efficiency was determined in parallel plates by transfection of cells with pEGFP-N1 control vector. Transfection efficiencies were greater than 90% in all experiments. The stable transfectants expressing each gene were selected by immunoblotting or real-time RT-PCR analyses. Positive clones were maintained in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. Immunoblotting Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (35Hoshino T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Hwang H.J. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For detection of the C-terminal fragment (CTF) α and CTFβ, membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (36Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For detection of CTFγ, the membrane fractions were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar). Samples were applied to polyacrylamide SDS gels (Tris-Tricine gel for the detection of APP and Tris glycine gel for other proteins), and subjected to electrophoresis, after which proteins were immunoblotted with their respective antibodies. Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (sELISA) for Aβ and EIA for cAMP—Cells were cultured for 24 h and the conditioned medium was subjected to sELISA using three types of specific monoclonal antibodies, as described previously (29Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19304-19310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Araki W. Suzuki K. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The amount of Aβ in mouse brain was determined as described previously (38Iwata N. Mizukami H. Shirotani K. Takaki Y. Muramatsu S. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Ozawa K. Saido T.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, the brain hemispheres were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl with a homogenizer (Polytron) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, defined as the soluble fraction, was taken and guanidine-HCl added to give a final concentration of 0.5 m before sELISA. The pellet was solubilized by sonication in 6 m guanidine-HCl buffer. The solubilized pellet was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was diluted and termed the insoluble fraction. The amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in each fraction were determined by sELISA. Cells were pre-treated for 30 min with 0.5 m 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase) and further cultured for 10 min with or without PGE2, EP agonists, or EP antagonist. Cells were lysed with ice-cold 100% ethanol and centrifuged. The supernatants were dried, re-suspended in the assay buffer, and applied to the EIA kit for measurement of cAMP, according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. Samples (10 μg of RNA) were reverse transcribed using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesized cDNA was amplified by PCR (TAKARA PCR Thermal Cycler) using TAKARA Taq DNA polymerase, and reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR cycle conditions were 2 min at 50 °C, followed by 10 min at 95 °C and finally 35 cycles at each of 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. Primers were designed using the Primer3 Web site (www.frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi). The sequences of the primers (written as target cDNA: forward primer and reverse primer) were: EP1, 5′-accttctttggcggctct-3′ and 5′-gcacgacaccaccatgatac-3′; EP2, 5′-ccacctcattctcctggcta-3′ and 5′-cgacaacagaggactgaacg-3′; EP3, 5′-agcttatggggatcatgtgc-3′ and 5′-tctgcttctccgtgtgtgtc-3′; EP4, 5′-tgcgagtattcgtcaaccag-3′ and 5′-ggtctaggatggggttcaca-3′; and actin, 5′-ggacttcgagcaagagatgg-3′ and 5′-agcactgtgttggcgtacag-3′. γ-Secretase-mediated Peptide Cleavage Assay—We performed the assay as previously reported (39Farmery M.R.

Teng L. Wang Z. Song M. Xiong J. Bai Y. Pei G. Nat. Med. 2007; 12: 1390-1396Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Solubilized membranes were re-suspended and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 200 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% CHAPSO (w/v), and 10 μm APP-derived fluorescent substrate of γ-secretase. We measured fluorescence using a plate reader (Fluorstar Galaxy) with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey multiple comparison test or Student's t test for unpaired results was used for evaluation of differences among more than three groups or for the evaluation of differences between two groups, respectively. Differences were considered to be significant for values of p < 0.05. Stimulation of Aβ Production by PGE2—We used HEK293 cells that stably express a form of APP with double mutations (K651N/M652L), known as the “Swedish” mutations (APPsw) (29Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19304-19310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These mutations elevate cellular and secreted levels of Aβ (29Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19304-19310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amount of these peptides in conditioned medium was determined using a sELISA. Treatment of cells with PGE2 increased the levels of Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1, A and B), a similar result to that observed for CHO cells (26Qin W. Ho L. Pompl P.N. Peng Y. Zhao Z. Xiang Z. Robakis N.K. Shioi J. Suh J. Pasinetti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50970-50977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We concluded that this increase is due to stimulation of production of Aβ because, after treatment of the cells with PGE2, not only did the amount of secreted Aβ increase but the amount of Aβ in the cells also increased and because pulse label experiments with [35S]methionine showed that treatment of cells with PGE2 increased generation of CTFs of APP that are co-generated by γ-secretase (CTFγ) with Aβ (data not shown). Although it is not clear whether comparison of concentrations of PGE2 between in vivo and in vitro is reasonable or not, the concentrations of PGE2 required for stimulation of Aβ production (1–10 nm) are within the same range of PGE2 concentrations that are observed in the human brain (41Iwamoto N. Kobayashi K. Kosaka K. J. Neurol. 1989; 236: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the fact that production of Aβ is stimulated by the concentration of PGE2, which is equivalent to that found physiologically is against the idea that PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ seen in vitro is involved in inflammation-stimulated development of AD. We also performed similar experiments in SH-SY5Y cells that stably express APPsw. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, treatment with PGE2 also increased the level of Aβ in SH-SY5Y cells; however, the extent of stimulation of Aβ production in SH-SY5Y cells was not as dramatic as that seen in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). We confirmed that PGE2 did not affect the cell growth and intracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity at concentrations used in Fig. 1 in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Identification of EP Receptors Involved in PGE2-stimulated Production of Aβ—We used agonists specific for each EP receptor (Table 1) to identify EP receptors involved in the PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ. Initially, we used HEK293 cells and examined the mRNA expression of each EP receptor by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, mRNA for each of the EP receptors was detected, although the level of expression varied between them. We also confirmed the expression of EP2 receptor by immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 5A). Then, we examined the effect of agonists specific for each EP receptor on the production of Aβ in HEK293 cells. Treatment of cells with AE1-329 (an EP4 agonist) increased the level of Aβ in conditioned medium (Fig. 2, H and I). The amplitude of this increase was similar to that achieved with PGE2 (Fig. 1, A and B). Based on previously reported findings using AE1-329, it is reasonable to postulate that, for the concentrations used in the experiment described in Fig. 2, H and I, it acts as a specific agonist for the EP4 receptor (42Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M. Maruyama T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Suda T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, none of the other specific agonists, including DI-004 (an EP1 agonist), AE1-259 (an EP2 agonist), and AE-248 (an EP3 agonist), significantly affected the level of Aβ (Fig. 2, B–G). Based on previous reports, the concentrations of EP agonists employed in the experiments described in Fig. 2 should have been sufficient to activate their respective EP receptor (42Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M. Maruyama T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Suda T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We confirmed that each agonist did not affect the cell growth at these concentrations used in Fig. 2 (data not shown). Consequently, the results in Fig. 2 suggest that EP4 is responsible for the PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in HEK293 cells. As described below, we suggested that EP2 receptor is not functional in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we found that none of PGE2, DI-004, and AE-248 increased the intracellular Ca2+ levels (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that neither EP1 nor EP3 receptor is functional in HEK293 cells (both EP1 and EP3 receptors are coupled to Ca2+ mobilization (27Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ma H. Hara A. Xiao C.Y. Okada Y. Takahata O. Nakaya K. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Ushikubi F. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). Thus, we could not conclude that activation of these receptors (EP1, EP2, and EP3) does not affect the level of Aβ in general, based on the inability of DI-004, AE1-259, and AE-248 to affect the level of Aβ in HEK293 cells.FIGURE 5Involvement of the cellular level of cAMP in PGE2-stimulated produc"

It has also been suggested that LXR agonists possess anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of LXR agonists on the innate immune response in human primary lung macrophages and a pre-clinical rodent model of lung inflammation. Before profiling the impact of the agonist, we established that both the human macrophages and the rodent lungs expressed LXRα/β. We then used two structurally distinct LXR agonists to demonstrate that activation of this transcription factor reduces cytokine production in THP-1 cells and lung macrophages. Then, using the expression profile of ATP binding cassettes A1 (ABCA-1; a gene directly linked to LXR activation) as a biomarker for lung exposure of the compound, we demonstrated an LXR-dependent reduction in lung neutrophilia rodents in vivo. This inhibition was not associated with a suppression of c-Fos/c-Jun mRNA expression or NF-κB/AP-1 DNA binding, suggesting that any anti-inflammatory activity of LXR agonists is not via inhibition of NF-κB/AP-1 transcriptional activity. These data do not completely rule out an impact of these agonists on these two prominent transcription factors. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate anti-inflammatory actions of LXRs in the lung.

LXRs form obligate heterodimers with another orphan nuclear receptor, RXR, and regulate cholesterol and lipid homeostasis.

The nuclear receptors LXRα and LXRβ have been implicated in the control of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and in the intestine ligand activation of LXR/RXR heterodimers dramatically reduces dietary cholesterol absorption, an effect postulated to be mediated by ABCA1 (6Repa J.J. Kim S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). A dual LXRα/β agonist has been shown to reduce the development of atherosclerosis (9Joseph S.B. Kim E. Pei L. Watson M.A. Collins A.R. Laffitte B.A. Chen M. Noh G. Goodman J. Hagger G.N. Tran J.

This data suggest that LXR agonists may reduce atherosclerosis not only by promoting cholesterol efflux but also by limiting the production of inflammatory mediators in the artery wall (10Joseph S.B. Kim A. Lafitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar).

Therefore, there is a clear rationale for evaluating the ability of LXR ligands to evoke anti-inflammatory activity in the lung (18Cao G. Kim Y. Jiang X.C. Eacho P.I.

The innate inflammatory response to endotoxin is central to host defense processes, but in disease conditions, this chronic inflammatory response can become detrimental to the airways. As yet there are no published studies on the impact of LXR agonists in the airways; therefore, the first challenge was to determine whether LXR receptors are expressed in the in vitro and in vivo systems we were to use. Having demonstrated the presence of the receptors in both cell types, we profiled the impact of the two LXR agonists in the LPS-driven cytokine release in the human cell-based assays. In parallel, having shown that the airways of the rat strain used in the pre-clinical model expressed LXR, we used the expression of ABCA-1 as a guide for determining the dose of compound to be used to profile their effect in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCollection of Human Lung Tissue Macrophages (HLTMs)—HLTMs were obtained from recipient tissue from lung transplant surgery. Ethical approval for the study was obtained along with relevant consent from the patient, or in the case of tissues obtained from brain-dead donors, consent from the relatives. The details of the collection technique used are published in Birrell et al. (21Birrell M.A. Kim S. McCluskie K. Catley M.C. Hardaker E.L. Haj-Yahia S. Belvisi M.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Once collected and purified, the cell suspension was diluted in RPMI 1640 with glutamax I and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic and antimycotic solution (penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B; Sigma-Aldrich), and 400,000 cells per well were added to 24-well plates. These plates were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (95% air, 5% (v/v) CO2). After 60 min, the non-adherent cells were removed by washing, and fresh medium was added. The adherent, purified macrophages (consistently > 99%) were incubated overnight for use/treatment the following day.Culture of THP-1 Monocytic Cells—The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Health Protection Agency, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). Cells were cultured in accordance with the methods detailed in Birrell et al. (21Birrell M.A. Kim S. McCluskie K. Catley M.C. Hardaker E.L. Haj-Yahia S. Belvisi M.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On experiment days the cells (10 × 106 cells/ml) were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature (Mistral 3000i, MSE). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet of cells was washed in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 with glutamax I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% antibiotic and antimycotic solution, with no fetal calf serum. The cells were then centrifuged under the same conditions, then the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 with glutamax I, supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic and antimycotic solution.LXRα and -β mRNA Expression in THP-1 Cells and HLTMs—Supernatants were removed from the cultured THP-1 cells and HLTMs, and the cells were then collected and retained at –80 °C.Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cells using Tri Reagent (Sigma) and RNA reverse-transcribed to cDNA as detailed in Birrell et al. (21Birrell M.A. Kim S. McCluskie K. Catley M.C. Hardaker E.L. Haj-Yahia S. Belvisi M.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Amplification of the cDNA and detection of target PCR product was carried out by real-time PCR, which involves a 5′-nuclease assay using fluorescent-labeled TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Pre-developed assays (Assay on Demand) were purchased from Applied Biosystems for the investigation of mRNA expression of LXRα and -β. Reactions were internally controlled with the 18 S rRNA internal control (Applied Biosystems). PCR reactions were performed in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 3 μl of sample cDNA (2.5 ng/μl), with the Assay on Demand of the target gene, TaqMan universal master mix, and 18 S rRNA internal control. Amplification and detection of specific products were carried out in an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using an amplification protocol consisting of 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Results were analyzed using the Sequence Detection Software(Applied Biosystems), and the relative amount of target gene transcript was normalized to the amount of 18 S rRNA internal control transcript in the same cDNA sample. The data were then converted from the exponential form into linear data by using the calculation 2–(target ct – 18 S ct, ct is threshold cycles) and then arbitrarily multiplied by 106 to change the values into whole numbers. Before performing the analysis, each assay was validated according to instructions from Applied Biosystems. Assay validations were performed to ensure that the threshold cycles of both the target and internal control, determined in the linear exponential phase of the amplifications, had equal efficiencies.Compound Treatment of THP-1 Cells and HLTMs—Cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO, final concentration 0.1% v/v) or compound (GW3965 or T1317, 10–11–10–6 m) synthesized at GlaxoSmithKline by previously described methods (6Repa J.J. Kim S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 14Englund M.C. Kim A.L.

The potency (EC50) of GW3965 and T1317 in a LXR cell-based reporter gene assay has been published at 190 ± 30 and 85 ± 10 nm, respectively (22Birrell M.A. Kim K. Wong S. Donnelly L.E. Barnes P.J. Belvisi M.G. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone (10–6 m) was included as an intra-assay positive control. After 24 h of culturing the supernatants were collected and stored for subsequent assessment of cytokine levels. Protein levels of TNFα, IL-8, IL-6, and MIP-1α (plus IL-1β and GROα for experiments with THP-1 cells) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using human DuoSets® according to manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems Europe, Oxfordshire, UK).LXRα and -β mRNA Expression in Human and Rat Tissues—Human RNA extracted from a range of human tissues was bought from Clontech Laboratories (n numbers of these samples were varied for each tissue type, and where there was more than one source, the RNA was pooled at the place of manufacture). A similar range of tissues were collected from 3 male naïve Wistar rats (180–200 g of the same strain used in the LPS-challenged model below), and RNA was extracted as outlined above and in Birrell et al. (22Birrell M.A. Kim K. Wong S. Donnelly L.E. Barnes P.J. Belvisi M.G. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). LXRα and -β mRNA expression was established as outlined above in the human cells.Establishing an Appropriate Dose of LXR Ligand to Use in the Rodent Model of Endotoxin-driven Airway Inflammation—To establish an appropriate dose of LXR agonist to use in the preclinical model of endotoxin-driven inflammation, it was decided to measure the mRNA expression of ABCA-1, a gene shown to be regulated by LXR agonists (10Joseph S.B. Kim A. Lafitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) in rats treated with the agonist. Vehicle or T1317 (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, twice a day for 4 days and 7 and 4 h before sampling) was orally dosed to Wistar rats, and 4 h after the last dose the animals were culled, and the lung was collected and stored at –80 °C. ABCA-1 mRNA expression was assessed using real-time TaqMan reverse transcriptioPCR as outlined above and in Birrell et al. (22Birrell M.A. Kim K. Wong S. Donnelly L.E. Barnes P.J. Belvisi M.G. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The data were expressed as -fold difference from vehicle-treated samples.Determination of the Effect of GW3965 and T1317 on LPS-induced Airway Inflammation in the Rat—Male Wistar rats (180–200 g) were purchased from Harlan-Olac (Bicester, UK) and housed for at least 5 days before use. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. UK Home Office guidelines for animal welfare based on the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 were strictly observed.Rats were challenged with an aerosol of endotoxin-free saline (for 30 min) or LPS (0.3 mg/ml) as previously described (22Birrell M.A. Kim K. Wong S. Donnelly L.E. Barnes P.J. Belvisi M.G. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose and 0.2% Tween 80 in water, 2 ml/kg), GW3965 (30 mg/kg), or T1317 (30 mg/kg) were administered orally 1 h before and 2 h post-challenge. This dose was chosen because it was shown to increase the expression of ABCA-1, a gene linked to activation of LXR (10Joseph S.B. Kim A. Lafitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The positive standard, dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), was included and administered using the same treatment regimen. Six hours after challenge cellular burden in the airway tissue was determined using methodology detailed in Birrell et al. (22Birrell M.A. Kim K. Wong S. Donnelly L.E. Barnes P.J. Belvisi M.G. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbitone (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), the left lobe was removed, and the vasculature was perfused with RPMI to remove any blood and then finely chopped. A 300-mg aliquot of the lung tissue went through an enzymatic digest to extract the white cells. The remaining lung tissue was kept for ABCA-1 mRNA expression analysis. Total white blood cell counts in the lung samples were determined using an automated cell counter (Sysmex F-820, Sysmex UK Ltd., Linford Wood, Buckinghamshire, UK). Cytospins of these samples were prepared by centrifugation of 100-μl aliquots in a cytospin centrifuge (Shandon, Runcorn, UK) at 700 rpm for 5 min, low acceleration at room temperature. Slides were fixed and stained on a Hema-tek 2000 (Ames Co., Elkhart, IN) with modified Wrights-Giemsa stain. Three part differential counts on 200 cells per slide were performed following standard morphological criteria, and the numbers of neutrophils were established from the total white cell counts.To determine whether the anti-inflammatory action of the LXR ligands was mediated by inhibition of the NF-κB/AP-1 pathway as previously reported in alternative assay systems (10Joseph S.B.

Then, having chosen an appropriate time point, we repeated the in vivo phase described above and collected lung tissue for assessment of NF-κB/AP-1 pathway activation. In addition to c-Jun/c-Fos mRNA expression, we also performed EMSA analysis on lung tissue nuclear extracts using the appropriate NF-κB and AP-1 DNA sequence-labeled probes as detailed in Birrell et al. (24Birrell M.A. Kim E.L. Wong S. McCluskie K. Catley M.C. De Alba J. Newton R. Haj-Yahia S. Pun K.T. Watts C.J. Shaw R.J. Savage T.J. Belvisi M.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 962-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).To explore other possible anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the LXR agonists, we measured a range of inflammatory biomarkers thought to be involved in the development of the LPS-induced airway neutrophilia. Lung tissue taken from the 6-h LPS study was analyzed for levels of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression (by real-time TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR as described above) and cytokines (IL-1β and rat equivalent of IL-8/GROα-CINC-1 and CINC-3 by rats specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).Data Analysis—All the values in the figures and text are expressed as the mean ± S.E. mean of n observations. The effect of LPS exposure compared with saline control was analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U post-test for unpaired data. Statistical analysis of multiple comparisons was made using one-way analysis of variance with an appropriate post-test. All treatments were compared with relevant vehicle control groups; differences were deemed significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSLXRα and -β mRNA Expression in THP-1 Cells and HLTMs—The level of LXR mRNA expression appears to be comparable in THP-1 cells and HLTMs (Fig. 1). The semiquantitative expression levels may suggest that there is more LXRα compared with LXRβ at the gene level at least. Direct comparison, however, between genes is not recommended, as actual levels of genes will depend on many factors including efficiency of the assay and design of the primers and probes.Compound Treatment of THP-1 Cells and HLTMs—LPS exposure to THP-1 cells caused a significant increase in IL-1β, GROα, IL-6, IL-8 MIP-1α, and TNFα (Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2). Both LXR agonists caused a significant, concentration-related inhibition of cytokine production, with a maximal inhibition of around 50 to 70% (Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2). Neither compound appeared to have any toxic effect on the cells as shown by the similar cell viability readouts compared with the relevant vehicle group (data not shown). Although one caveat to this is that because the agonists are known to induce multidrug transports (ABC family), trypan blue exclusion may not accurately reflect true viability. The intra-assay positive control, dexamethasone, caused a significant inhibition of all cytokines measured (Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2).FIGURE 2Effect of LXRα/β agonists on LPS-nduced cytokine release in cultured THP-1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2093006176,"Deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is associated with significant pathology in humans. However, the consequences for organogenesis and early development are not well understood. We have investigated these issues using a zebrafish model. COX deficiency was induced using morpholinos to reduce expression of CoxVa, a structural subunit, and Surf1, an assembly factor, both of which impaired COX assembly. Reduction of COX activity to 50% resulted in developmental defects in endodermal tissue, cardiac function, and swimming behavior. Cellular investigations revealed different underlying mechanisms. Apoptosis was dramatically increased in the hindbrain and neural tube, and secondary motor neurons were absent or abnormal, explaining the motility defect. In contrast, the heart lacked apoptotic cells but showed increasingly poor performance over time, consistent with energy deficiency. The zebrafish model has revealed tissue-specific responses to COX deficiency and holds promise for discovery of new therapies to treat mitochondrial diseases in humans.

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) 2The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochrome c oxidase; MO, morpholino; hpf, hours postfertilization; dpf, days postfertilization; rtPCR, reverse transcription-PCR; qrtPCR, quantitative rtPCR; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochrome c oxidase; MO, morpholino; hpf, hours postfertilization; dpf, days postfertilization; rtPCR, reverse transcription-PCR; qrtPCR, quantitative rtPCR; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. is the terminal enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, COX couples the vectoral movement of protons across the inner membrane to the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen. Mammalian COX consists of 13 subunits, 10 of which (COXIV–COXVIII) are encoded by nuclear DNA. The other three subunits (COXI, COXII, and COXIII) are encoded by the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and constitute the hydrophobic/catalytic core of the enzyme. Assembly of COX is a complicated process involving multiple assembly factors and chaperones, including COX10–11, COX15–20, COX23, SCO1, SCO2, and SURF1 (1Herrmann J.M. Funes S. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 354: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Deficiency in COX activity is associated with significant pathology usually affecting highly metabolic tissues, including brain, muscle, and eyes (2Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar, 3Smeitink J. van den Heuvel L. DiMauro S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). For example, COX deficiency is commonly associated with Leigh syndrome, an early-onset disorder resulting in progressive central nervous system degeneration and early lethality (4Leigh D. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1951; 14: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 5Rahman S. Blok R.B. Dahl H.H. Danks D.M. Kirby D.M. Chow C.W. Christodoulou J. Thorburn D.R. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The majority of cases of COX-deficient Leigh syndrome are a result of mutations in SURF1, which encodes a COX assembly factor (6Zhu Z. Yao J. Johns T. Fu K. De Bie I. Macmillan C. Cuthbert A.P.

Mutations in SURF1 impair the incorporation of subunit II, resulting in a buildup of an early COX assembly intermediate, decrease in other COX subunits, and a decrease in COX activity (8Tiranti V.

Mitochondrion. 2004; 4: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). COX deficiency may also be complicated by cardiac pathology, including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies (12Marin-Garcia J. Goldenthal M.J. Pierpont E.M. Ananthakrishnan R. Perez-Atayde A. Cardiovasc. Pathol. 1999; 8: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Holmgren D. Wahlander H. Eriksson B.O. Oldfors A. Holme E. Tulinius M. Eur.

Schon E.A. Revue Neurologique. 1991; 147: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar). COX deficiency is detrimental during the prenatal period as well. The incidence of this disorder has prompted the application of COX activity assays to prenatal samples obtained by chorionic villus biopsy and amniocentesis in specific cases (15Houstek J. Klement P. Hermanska J. Antonicka H. Houstkova H. Stratilova L. Wanders R.J. Zeman J. Prenat. Diagn. 1999; 19: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Wanders R.J. Wijburg F.A. Ruiter J.

Prenatal diagnostics of this type have preparatory value for parents and physicians and may also be used to explain previous pregnancy losses (17Tay S.K. Shanske S. Kaplan P. DiMauro S. Arch. Neurol. 2004; 61: 950-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, our incomplete understanding of the metabolic requirements of different tissues and organs during development diminishes the predictive value of these assays. Initial studies using specific inhibitors of COX suggest that there is a large reserve of COX activity. The biochemical threshold of COX inhibition that can be tolerated before mitochondrial respiration is impaired was observed to be 60–86% in isolated rat mitochondria (18Letellier T. Heinrich R.

Studies in human cell lines using a specific COX inhibitor and mtDNA lesions revealed a range of thresholds from 21% to 82% depending upon cell type (23Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24D'Aurelio M. Pallotti F. Barrientos A. Gajewski C.D. Kwong J.Q. Bruno C. Beal M.F. Manfredi G. J. Biol.

Clinically, patient samples with COX deficiencies between 50 and 85% are associated with severe pathologies (25Mizusawa H. Watanabe M. Kanazawa I. Nakanishi T. Kobayashi M. Tanaka M. Suzuki H.

However, questions as to how these levels of COX deficiency affect a rapidly developing organism, tissue and organ sensitivity, and cellular responses remain unanswered. A vertebrate animal model of COX deficiency is therefore desirable. Recently mouse has been used as a model system for COX deficiency. Agostino et al. (30Agostino A. Invernizzi F. Tiveron C. Fagiolari G. Prelle A. Lamantea E. Giavazzi A. Battaglia G. Tatangelo L. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) generated a mouse null in Surf1. The Surf1 knock-out mouse exhibited defective COX activity in tissue samples, muscle weakness, motor deficits, and early-post-natal lethality. However, there was ∼90% post-implantation embryonic lethality, and the 10% of mice that survived embryogenesis did not display any obvious neurological symptoms. The relative inaccessibility of in utero mouse embryonic development precludes simultaneous biochemical analysis and thorough investigation of organ development and function during the prenatal period, when the vast majority of the Surf1 knock-out mice died. Furthermore, the cost and technical requirements of generating transgenic mouse mutants impede the creation of allelic series of mutants with different levels of reduction of COX components, which are needed to pinpoint the amount that best recapitulates human disorders. Therefore, we chose to dissect the mechanisms of COX deficiency associated with early developmental pathology and lethality in a zebrafish model. Zebrafish develop ex utero protected from the outside environment by a transparent chorion. Embryonic and larval zebrafish tissue is also transparent, a trait that has made zebrafish a powerful tool for studying development and physiology in real-time (31Grunwald D.J. Eisen J.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 32Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8612) Google Scholar). Furthermore, compared with mouse, zebrafish is readily amenable to the analysis of dose-dependent loss of function phenotypes using antisense morpholino (MO) oligonucleotides. MOs are gene-specific and block expression by binding RNA and sterically inhibiting either translation (33Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar) or splicing (34Draper B.W. Morcos P.A. Kimmel C.B. Genesis. 2001; 30: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). They can be titrated to inhibit protein expression to various degrees, resulting in a range of phenotypes from wild type to complete loss of function. The full spectrum of genetic mutations that precipitate COX deficiency is unknown. It is likely that certain mutations, or subsequent protein deficits, have not been identified, because they are necessarily lethal prenatally. This may explain why no patients have been described to date with a mutation in a nuclear DNA-encoded structural component of COX (35DiMauro S. Schon E.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2656-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Titrated MO knockdown is therefore a promising means by which the requirement for certain gene products could be identified. In the current work we demonstrate that MOs are an effective means of inducing COX deficiency in zebrafish. We show that MOs designed to reduce expression of Surf1, an assembly factor, and CoxVa, a structural component of COX, effectively impair COX activity in developing zebrafish. We describe detrimental effects of COX deficiency on cell biology, organ development, and organism physiology. These include increased activation of programmed cell death, defective secondary motor neuron development, impaired endodermal organ development, and cardiovascular dysfunction. The progressive developmental pathologies culminate in cardiac failure and early lethality. These data provide insights into the mechanism of COX deficiency associated with embryonic loss and developmental pathology in humans. The utility of this zebrafish model is enhanced by its potential application in forward genetic screens and high throughput small molecule screens to discover modifier genes of COX activity and potential treatments of COX deficiency, respectively. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were collected from natural crosses of genotype ABC or Tg(gata2:GFP) adults at the University of Oregon Zebrafish Facility. Embryos were reared at 28.5 °C on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle according to standard protocols (36Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book.4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). Embryos were staged by hours postfertilization (hpf) and days postfertilization (dpf) according to Kimmel et al. (32Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8612) Google Scholar). All zebrafish experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Translation and splice-blocking MOs were designed by Gene Tools, LLC. MOs were solubilized in sterile water then diluted to working concentrations and injected as in Nasevicius et al. (33Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). A 1% phenol red solution was added to working concentrations for visualization of injection volume. A translation-blocking MO, which binds at the ATG start, was designed against cox5aa (5′-ACAGTCGAAGGGCGGCTCGGAACAT-3′). The cox5ab-MO (5′-AGCTGGAGAACACAGCGAACACACA-3′), which binds at the second exon splice acceptor site, and surf1-MO (5′-CGGAAGGCACAGAGACTCACTCTAC-3′), which binds at the fourth exon splice donor site, were designed to block appropriate splicing of target mRNA. These MOs had a 3′-fluorescein modification, and fluorescence was used to select fish that had homogeneously incorporated the MOs. A splice-blocking galT-MO (5′-AAATCATTATGCACTCACCTGATGG-3′), which binds the second exon splice donor site of α1,3-galctosyltransferase, a non-mitochondrial enzyme, was used to control for nonspecific effects of injection. p53-MO (5′-GCGCCATTGCTTTGCAAGAATTG-3′), a translation blocker, was used to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis (37Langheinrich U. Hennen E. Stott G. Vacun G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2023-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). emx3-MO (5′-GACGTGTCTGTCTCTTACCTGCGTC-3′), which binds the second exon splice acceptor site of the empty spiracles homeobox 3 gene, was used as a positive control for the effects of p53-MO. cox5aa mRNA with silent mutations at the MO binding site and surf1 mRNA were transcribed out of pcDNA3 using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer instructions. Rescue experiments were performed by co-injecting cox5aa and surf1 mRNA with cox5aa-MO and surf1-MO, respectively. The amount of mRNA injected was titrated to determine the effective dose. rtPCR—3-dpf zebrafish samples were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) using a Kontes pellet pestle. RNA was isolated by chloroform extraction, isopropanol precipitation, and washed in 75% ethanol. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed with the DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT). The following primers were used for amplification of a surf1 fragment spanning the MO binding site: forward, 5′-GTCAACAATCAACTTCCACTGTCG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTTGCTCCACTTTCACCACTGG-3′. rtPCR was carried out in an MJ Research PTC-225 Peltier Thermal Cycler. The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 5 min then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and finally 72 °C for 10 min, and then held at 10 °C. qrtPCR—cDNA was synthesized from extracted RNA as described above. Genomic DNA was extracted from samples of 15 zebrafish at 3 dpf using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The following primers were used in quantitative real-time rtPCR reactions: cox1 forward, 5′-ACTTAGCCAACCAGGAGCAC-3′; cox1 reverse, 5′-GGGTGGAAGAAGTCAGAAGC-3′ (38Ton C. Stamatiou D. Liew C.C. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 13: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); β-actin forward, 5′-TTCTGGTCGGTACTACTGGTATTGTG-3′; and β-actin reverse, 5′-ATCTTCATCAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGT-3′ (38Ton C. Stamatiou D. Liew C.C. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 13: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in 25-μl volumes with 1× SYBER Green PCR Master Mix (Molecular Probes), 7.5 pmol of both forward and reverse primers, and 200 ng of DNA. All samples were run in triplicate. qrtPCR was performed in 96-well plate format in an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Cycling parameters were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The run finished with 95 °C for 15 s followed by a dissociation step of 60 °C for 15 s. Images of live zebrafish were obtained with a digital camera on a Zeiss Axioplan. Fluorescence images of live stained and fixed fish were captured on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U using epifluorescence or confocal lasers. Adobe Photoshop was used to adjust image brightness and contrast. Zebrafish embryos were manually dechorionated and euthanized by an overdose of tricaine methane sulfonate (36Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book.4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde BT fix (36Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book.4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). 24-hpf and 31-hpf fixed embryos were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 48-hpf fixed embryos were permeabilized in 100% acetone at –20 °C for 25 min. Permeabilized embryos were washed with 0.2% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1% Me2SO in PBS and blocked in wash solution with 2% normal goat serum. Embryos were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. For primary motor neuron detection 24-hpf embryos were incubated with zn1 monoclonal antibody (1:200) (39Trevarrow B. Marks D.L. Kimmel C.B. Neuron. 1990; 4: 669-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and znp1 monoclonal antibody (1:1000) (39Trevarrow B. Marks D.L. Kimmel C.B. Neuron. 1990; 4: 669-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), which were detected with goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 IgG1 and IgG2a (Molecular Probes), respectively. Secondary motor neurons were detected in Tg(gata2:GFP) transgenic zebrafish by incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (1:200, Molecular Probes) followed by goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Initiation of apoptosis was detected by incubation with rabbit monoclonal anti-active caspase-3 (1:200, BD Pharmingen) (40Ryu S. Holzschuh J. Erhardt S. Ettl A.K. Driever W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18467-18472Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) followed by goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear stain (1:1000) was added to the second to last wash. The vital dye acridine orange was used to identify apoptotic cells (41Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24-hpf, 31-hpf, 48-hpf, and 3-dpf live zebrafish were soaked in 0.5 μg/ml acridine orange for 15 min and washed five times in embryo medium (36Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book.4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar) at room temperature in the dark. 20 zebrafish embryos at 3 dpf were homogenized in 100 μlof 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) using a Kontes pellet pestle. Samples were further disrupted by brief sonication with a Branson Sonifier 150. SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g, and then the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay according to manufacturer instructions (Pierce). Samples were electrophoresed on a 10–20% acrylamide gel using the Laemmli buffer system (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred from one-dimensional gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45-μm pore size) as described previously (43Triepels R.H. Hanson B.J. van den Heuvel L.P. Sundell L. Marusich M.F. Smeitink J.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8892-8897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in a 5% milk/PBS solution overnight. Blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies against COXI and COXVa (MitoSciences Inc.) and a porin Ab-2 antibody (Calbiochem), all at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in 1% milk/PBS solution. After washing three times for 5 min with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunolabs) was applied. Blots were visualized using the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare). The substrate of the reaction, reduced ferrocytochrome c, was generated by dissolving 250 mg of bovine heart cytochrome c (Sigma) in 1 ml of 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, and reduced by addition of l-(+)-ascorbic acid (MCB Reagents). Reduced bovine heart cytochrome c was purified at 4 °C over 20 ml of Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) in a column equilibrated with 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, and collected in 1-ml fractions before concentration measurement at 550 nm in a Beckman DU7 (e = 19.1 mm–1 cm–1). Zebrafish were homogenized using a Kontes pellet pestle and suspended to 5 mg/ml in 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2. Proteins were detergent-extracted by adding 2 mm dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and placed on ice for 20 min, and then insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min. This zebrafish detergent lysate was diluted to the desired amount for each well in 100 ml of 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 0.3 mm dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. An equal volume of 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 0.3 mm dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 60 mm ferrocytochrome c was added to each well. The oxidation of the added ferrocytochrome c was immediately measured at 30 °C using a Molecular Dynamics Spectramax 384 micro-plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 550 nm. The oxidation of ferrocytochrome c was followed for 105 min. However, the activity rates were calculated from linear slope of the initial rates at time points <11 min. Zebrafish Have Two Copies of cox5a and One Copy of surf1 Genes—The sequence identified as NM_001024403 was recovered from an initial BLAST of the zebrafish genome, having 74% amino acid sequence identity to human COXVa (supplemental Fig. S1A). Knockdown of zebrafish cox5a with a MO designed against this sequence successfully impaired COX activity and development as described below. However, residual CoxVa protein was detected by Western blot. Therefore, another BLAST search of the zebrafish genome was performed to look for a second cox5a gene. Due to an ancestral genome duplication, zebrafish have duplicate co-orthologs for a minimum of 20% of human genes (44Postlethwait J. Amores A. Cresko W. Singer A. Yan Y.L. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We identified a second sequence, XM_695484, as being 65% identical to human CoxVa and 76% identical to the other zebrafish gene at the amino acid level (supplemental Fig. S1A). NM_001024403 was named cox5aa and a translation blocking MO, cox5aa-MO, was designed against the ATG start site of this sequence. XM_695484 was named cox5ab, and a splice-blocking MO, cox5ab-MO, was designed against the second exon splice acceptor site. cox5aa and cox5ab should encode functionally equivalent proteins. Here we refer to both proteins as CoxVa, because they are not distinguished by the antibody to human COXVa. In a BLAST search of the zebrafish genome for surf1 one sequence, XM_678665, was identified with significant similarity to human SURF1. In a protein alignment, zebrafish Surf1 has 60% amino acid sequence identity to the homologous human sequence (supplemental Fig. S1B). A search for a duplicate gene recovered no other sequences with significant similarity. A splice-blocking MO, surf1-MO, was designed against the fourth exon splice donor site of this gene. Reduction of Either CoxVa or Surf1 Impairs COX Activity—Assembly of the COX holoenzyme requires the proper structural subunits and necessary assembly factors. Therefore, MO reduction of either CoxVa or Surf1 was expected to alter the amount of normally assembled and functional COX. To determine the effects of cox5aa-MO, cox5ab-MO, and surf1-MO on total zebrafish COX activity, we measured the initial rate of cytochrome c oxidation by extracted zebrafish proteins from uninjected and MO injected samples of 20–30 fish at 3 dpf. Zebrafish embryos were injected with 20 ng of cox5aa-MO, cox5ab-MO, or surf1-MO. In titration experiments this dose resulted in a reproducible phenotype (described below) that was not lethal at 5 dpf in the majority of injected zebrafish. Another control group received 20 ng of galT-MO, which blocks splicing of α1,3-galactosyltransferase, a non-mitochondrial gene. 3J. Bates and K. Guillemin, unpublished data. The COX activity in each MO-injected population was measured relative to an uninjected control in at least two separate experiments. For equivalent amounts of protein, COX activity in 3-dpf cox5aa-MO, cox5ab-MO, and surf1-MO samples was approximately half that of uninjected and galT-MO controls (as shown in a representative experiment, Fig. 1, A and B). Morpholino Reduction of Zebrafish cox5aa, cox5ab, and surf1 Results in Reduced COX Subunits—SURF1-deficient human patient cells exhibit decreased levels of COX protein subunits (9Poyau A. Buchet K.

Genet. 1999; 8: 2541-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), presumably due to impaired COX assembly and subsequent proteolysis of subunits. We proposed that deficient production of the structural subunit CoxVa would similarly impair COX assembly in zebrafish. Using monoclonal antibodies to the human COX proteins that we showed cross-reacted with the zebrafish proteins of the predicted size (data not shown), we assessed the levels of CoxVa and CoxI in cox5aa-MO, cox5ab-MO, surf1-MO, and control samples in Western blots. The levels of CoxVa and CoxI were normalized to porin, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, the level of which would not be expected to be altered. Proteins were extracted from samples of ∼20 zebrafish at 3 dpf. As expected, the MO target protein, CoxVa, was decreased in cox5aa-MO and cox5ab-MO fish relative to porin compared with uninjected and galT-MO controls (Fig. 1C). A concomitant decrease in CoxI, relative to porin, was also noted. Because no antibody was available to Surf1 in zebrafish to confirm MO inhibition of protein expression, we designed surf1-MO to inhibit splicing of the transcript. cDNA was prepared from RNA extracted from 3-dpf uninjected and surf1-MO-injected embryos and used in rtPCR with primers to the third and fifth exons, which flank the MO binding site. A larger fragment was PCR amplified in the surf1-MO sample indicating failure to splice out the fourth intron (Fig. 1D). Western blot of uninjected and surf1-MO zebrafish revealed a decrease in CoxI relative to porin in the surf1-MO fish (Fig. 1E). The decrease in mtDNA-encoded CoxI in cox5aa-MO, cox5ab-MO, and surf1-MO zebrafish indicates that COX assembly is impaired by reduced production of either a structural subunit or an assembly factor and that altered COX assembly results in secondary loss of other mtDNA encoded subunits in zebrafish. mtDNA Transcript Levels Are Elevated in surf1-MO but Not cox5aa-MO or cox5ab-MO Zebrafish—The decrease in CoxI"
https://openalex.org/W2046167176,"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is a major means by which diversity is achieved in antibody genes, and it is initiated by the deamination of cytosines to uracils in DNA by activation-induced deaminase (AID). However, the process that leads from these initiating deamination events to mutations at other residues remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that a single cytosine on the top (nontemplate) strand is sufficient to recruit AID and lead to mutations of upstream and downstream A/T residues. In contrast, the targeting of cytosines on the bottom strand by AID does not lead to substantial mutation of neighboring residues. This strand asymmetry is eliminated in mice deficient in mismatch repair, indicating that the error-prone mismatch repair machinery preferentially targets top-strand uracils in a way that promotes SHM during the antibody response."
https://openalex.org/W1580325495,"Discipline-based education research seeks to marry deep knowledge of the discipline with similarly deep knowledge of learning and pedagogy (1, 2) and may encourage college and university faculty members to bring more rigor to classroom instruction. For example, the physics-based education research community has used tools such as the Force Concept Inventory (3) to determine that students taught with interactive teaching techniques developed from discipline-based education research [such as Peer Instruction (4, 5)] better understand the concepts of Newtonian physics than do students taught in a lecture-based format. Within the engineering community, the ultimate aims of such research include the creation of education programs that attract more, and more diverse, students to the study of engineering; retain more of the students who are enrolled; deepen students' understanding of engineering concepts; broaden students' appreciation of engineering's role in meeting the needs of a global society; and better prepare students for further study or professional practice. In pursuing these aims, research in engineering education looks beyond questions solely devoted to teaching, learning, and assessment; it also examines issues associated with faculty rewards (6) and the organizational dynamics of engineering departments (7, 8)."

Collectively these studies have led to a general understanding of the catalytic mechanism in terms of oxygen chemistry, electron transfer, and proton translocation. The catalytic cycle can be initiated from the fully reduced enzyme (R) or from the mixed-valence form (MV) in which only heme a3 and CuB are reduced or by single electron injection (11Ruitenberg M.

The oxygen atom in CuB2+-OH- is derived from molecular oxygen (40Hansson O. Kim B. Aasa R. Vanngard T. Malmstrom B.G. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1295-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The breaking of the O=O bond requires donation of four electrons and a proton. Because this also occurs when the reaction is started with MV, whereas heme a3 and CuB provide only three electrons, an amino acid, Tyr-280 (P. denitrificans numbering), was proposed to act as the donor of the fourth electron (plus the proton) (33Proshlyakov D.A. Kim M.A. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8020-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Tyr-280 is covalently linked to His-276, a ligand to CuB, and sufficiently close to the binuclear center to act as a rapid reductant (8Ostermeier C. Kim A. Ermler U. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

DeWitt D.L. Babcock G.T. Science. 2000; 290: 1588-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In PR, in contrast to PM, the Tyr-280* is absent (42Morgan J.E. Kim M.I. Palmer G. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6882-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) presumably because it has been reduced by heme a to the anion (Tyr-280-) or to the protonated Tyr-280. Even though heme a oxidation in the sequence R → A → PM → PR is completed within ∼100 μs, the true rate of electron transfer from heme a to heme a3 (and to Tyr-280*?) is ∼1 ns (43Pilet E. Kim A. Liebl U. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16198-16203Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which would explain why PM (and Tyr-280*) does (do) not accumulate to a measurable extent when the reaction is started from R. Instead of Tyr-280, the conserved Trp-272 has been proposed recently as the amino acid residue involved in O=O bond breaking (44MacMillan F. Kim K. Angerer H. Michel H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The PR → F transition is not associated with electron transfer but with proton binding and proton translocation (9Wikstrom M. Biochim. Biophys.

The slowest step of the oxidative part of the catalytic cycle (1-1.5 ms) is the F → OH transition, which is linked to proton translocation as well (9Wikstrom M. Biochim. Biophys.

At this stage, the enzyme is completely oxidized, but in a metastable “high energy state,” OH. Reduction of OH, but not of the resting enzyme (O), leads to two successive proton-pumping events in the reaction sequence OH → E → MV (11Ruitenberg M. Kim A. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Michel H.

To resolve enzyme catalytic mechanisms on the microsecond time scale, we have developed a microsecond freeze-hyperquenching mixing/sampling device (MHQ) (5Cherepanov A.V. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1656: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 46Wiertz F.G.M. Kim O.M.H. Cherepanov A.V. MacMillan F. Ludwig B. de Vries S.

MHQ is an extension of the rapid-freeze quench technique (49Ballou D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in which the instrument dead time has been reduced from 5-7 ms to 60-80 μs (46Wiertz F.G.M. Kim O.M.H. Cherepanov A.V. MacMillan F. Ludwig B. de Vries S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 575: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 47Lu S. Kim F.G.M. de Vries S. Moenne-Loccoz P. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2005; 36: 359-362Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The great advantage of MHQ and rapid-freeze quench is that the resulting frozen powder containing trapped intermediates can be analyzed by a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including EPR spectroscopy, an invaluable tool in the study of metallo-redox enzymes. MHQ experiments with cytochrome bo3 from Escherichia coli and cytochrome aa3 from P. denitrificans showed the formation of a tryptophan radical (Trp*) after ∼200 μs, which was weakly magnetically coupled to the Fe4+=O state of the heme a3 (46Wiertz F.G.M. Kim O.M.H. Cherepanov A.V. MacMillan F. Ludwig B. de Vries S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 575: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The EPR properties of this transient radical differ from the Tyr-167* and the proposed porphyrin cation and/or tryptophan radicals obtained by incubation with H2O2 (50Rigby S.E. Kim S. Rich P.R. Heathcote P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5921-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 51Rich P.R. Kim S.E. Heathcote P. Biochim. Biophys.

In the work presented in this report we used MHQ to determine the kinetics of the Trp* found previously and assign its role in the catalytic cycle. Q-band EPR spectroscopy identifies the radical as the neutral radical form of Trp-272. The kinetics of Trp-272*, CuA, heme a, and heme a3 were determined and simulated with a single set of rate constants in a model including the new intermediate FW*, which harbors the Trp-272*. The Trp-272* is formed in the second part of the catalytic cycle and Trp-272 is proposed as the electron donor to heme a3 or CuB. An additional role for Trp-272 in proton pumping is discussed. Enzyme Purification—P. denitrificans cytochrome aa3 was purified as previously described (53Ludwig B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 54Hendler R.W. Kim K. Reynafarje B. Ludwig B. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and contained 0.2 mol Mn2+ per mole of enzyme as determined by EPR spectroscopy. Mn2+-depleted enzyme was obtained by decreasing the Mn2+ concentration to 0.5 μm in the growth medium (55Käss H. Kim F. Ludwig B. Prisner T.F. J. Phys. Chem.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11709-11716Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Microsecond Freeze-hyperquenching and Sample Handling—The MHQ setup (dead time of 60-80 μs and effective reaction temperature of 10 ± 1 °C.) and the sample handling procedures are identical to those described before (5Cherepanov A.V. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1656: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 46Wiertz F.G.M. Kim O.M.H. Cherepanov A.V. MacMillan F. Ludwig B. de Vries S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 575: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) except that the aluminum rotating cold plate was coated with a layer of ∼5 μm of 99.999+ % tungsten. Tungsten was applied in 50 cycles of physical vapor deposition. The tungsten coating of the cold plate resulted in lower impurities (e.g. Fe3+ trapped in corundum) in the samples analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. For each time point 0.25 ml of pulsed cytochrome aa3 (100-280 μm) was used (5Cherepanov A.V. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1656: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 46Wiertz F.G.M.

The reduced enzyme (incubated with 10 mm ascorbate and 1 μm phenazine ethosulfate) was mixed 1:1 with an O2-saturated (1.3 mm at 20 °C) buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1% laurylmaltoside). Sample preparation for the low temperature UV-visible spectroscopy and normalization and analysis of the spectra are described in (46Wiertz F.G.M. Kim O.M.H. Cherepanov A.V. MacMillan F. Ludwig B. de Vries S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 575: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sample packing is described previously (47Lu S. Kim F.G.M. de Vries S. Moenne-Loccoz P. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2005; 36: 359-362Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). UV-visible Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectra were recorded with an Olis upgraded Aminco DW2000 scanning spectrophotometer equipped with a custom-made liquid N2-flow system, to maintain the temperature during the measurement stable at 90 K (48Wiertz F.G.M. Kim S. Biochem. Soc. Transact. 2006; 34: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The spectrophotometer was calibrated with a holmium oxide filter to an accuracy of 0.2 nm. Data Analysis—Data were processed and analyzed with the IGOR Pro software package (Wavemetrics). Q-band EPR spectra were simulated using a home-written simulation program in Pascal for the Macintosh computer. The program allows for non-linear g- and A-tensors. The kinetic data were fitted to a model of six consecutive irreversible reactions. The analytical solution of this set of homogeneous first-order differential equations has been added to the supplemental information. EPR Spectroscopy—X-band EPR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker ER200D spectrometer, Q-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E9 spectrometer. Both spectrometers were equipped with a home-built helium-flow system (57von Wachenfeldt C. Kim S. van der Oost J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). EPR signals were quantitated with respect to a 10 mm CuClO4 standard. Differences in sample packing were corrected using the Mn2+ signal as internal standard in case Mn2+-containing CcO was used (see supplemental Fig. S2). For Mn2+-free CcO no correction for sample packing was applied, only for differences in starting concentrations of the CcO. The overall dilution of the enzyme as present in the EPR tube is 6- to 10-fold with respect to the starting concentration. This dilution arises from the 1:1 mixing, condensation of water vapor during sample handling, and the loose sample packing owing to the fine nature of the frozen powder. The uncertainty in sample packing was determined at 1 ± 0.20 (n = 25) and is indicated with error bars in the figures. However, the relative concentrations of CuA, heme a and the Trp* are accurate to 1 ± 0.05, because they are determined in the same sample. The g values of the Trp* at Q-band frequency were determined with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and the Mn2+ signal as an internal standard and are accurate to ±0.0002. Low Temperature UV-visible Spectroscopy of MHQ Samples—MHQ samples were prepared by reacting fully reduced cytochrome aa3 with O2 for various times between 83 μs and 6 ms. Fig. 1 shows the low temperature absolute and difference UV-visible spectra of a selection of these samples. In the first 130 μs of the reaction the absorbance of the Soret band at 444 nm decreased, and a new band appears at 430 nm (Fig. 1A). The difference spectra (Fig. 1B) indicate a loss of intensity of ∼50% at 444 nm. Concomitantly, the α-band shifted from 603 to 606 nm (Fig. 1A) or, in the difference spectra (Fig. 1B), to 608 nm while losing some intensity. The peaks at 430 and 606 nm in the absolute spectra are characteristic for the oxoferryl state (Fe4+=O) of heme a3, and the P-state, specifically PR (32Varotsis C. Kim Y. Appelman E.H. Babcock G.T.

https://openalex.org/W2066989972,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a familial tumor syndrome linked to mutation of the MEN1 gene, which encodes a tumor suppressor, menin. We previously reported that menin up-regulates the caspase 8 expression and promotes TNF-α-induced apoptosis. However, it remains unclear how menin up-regulates caspase 8 expression and whether menin-mediated caspase 8 expression plays a role in repressing MEN1 development. Here we show that menin binds the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the Caspase 8 locus in vivo and activates transcription of a reporter gene through the 5′-UTR. Menin directly binds the 5′-UTR in a sequence-independent manner in vitro. Moreover, Men1 ablation in cells reduces acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the 5′-UTR of the caspase 8 locus bound by menin in vivo. Notably, the MEN1-derived menin point mutants lose their ability to bind the caspase 8 locus and fail to induce caspase 8 expression and TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. Consistent with these observations, the expression level of caspase 8 is markedly reduced in insulinomas from Men1+/– mice. Together, our results indicate that menin enhances the caspase 8 expression by binding the caspase 8 locus, and suggest that menin suppresses MEN1 tumorigenesis, at least in part, by up-regulating caspase 8 expression.

It has also been reported that menin, by interacting with histone deacetylases, suppresses the JunD-mediated transcription of a reporter gene, whereas tricostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, abrogates menin-mediated repression on gene transcription (24Gobl A.E.

We previously demonstrated that caspase 8 expression was down-regulated in menin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas complementation of the MEFs with menin restored the high level of caspase 8 expression (26Schnepp R.W.

However, it remains unclear how menin regulates caspase 8 expression and whether the menin-dependent caspase 8 expression is relevant to tumorigenesis in MEN1 syndrome. To address these questions, we have shown that menin specifically binds the 5′-UTR of the caspase 8 locus in vivo, and this menin-5′-UTR binding is correlated with an enhanced histone acetylation at the caspase 8 locus. The DNA fragment bound by menin in vivo also mediates menin-dependent transcriptional activation in vitro. Importantly, we have also shown that MEN1-derived menin point mutants not only lose their ability to bind the caspase 8 locus and induce caspase 8 expression but also fail to potentiate TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Moreover, caspase 8 expression is markedly decreased in islets or insulinomas in Men1+/– mice. These results suggest that menin suppresses MEN1 tumorigenesis, at least in part, through up-regulating caspase 8 expression. Plasmid Construction—pMX-menin and pcDNA-menin were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified human menin cDNA (U93236) into the BamHI/NotI site of pMX-puro and pcDNA3 vectors, respectively, as previously described (13La P.

To generate L22R and A242V point mutations of menin, pMX-menin and pcDNA-menin were used as a template, and mutations were introduced to the template by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To express the GST-menin, the PCR-amplified cDNA was cloned into the BamHI/NotI site of pGEX-6P (GE Healthcare), and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a GST-tagged protein. pGEX-F1, -F2, and -F3 expressing the N-terminal part, the middle, and the C-terminal part of menin, respectively, were generated using pGEX-menin as a template and were expressed and purified as previously described (35La P.

To construct pcas-Luc, genomic DNA covering –2935 to +623 of the caspase 8 locus was amplified from mouse genomic DNA and cloned into the KpnI and SmaI site of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Additionally, the mutant pcasM-Luc was constructed by cloning the PCR-amplified genomic DNA from –2935 to +40 of the caspase 8 locus, which lacked most of the 5′-UTR sequence, to the KpnI and XhoI site of the pGL3-basic vector. Cell Culture, Generation of Recombinant Retroviruses, and Complementation of Menin-null MEFs—HEK 293 cells and E-NX cells, which were derived from 293 cells by transfecting the cells with individual cDNAs expressing retrovirus-packaging proteins (36Grignani F.

Menin-null MEFs complemented with menin or its mutants were established as previously described (26Schnepp R.W. Kim H. Sykes S.M. Zong W.X. Silva A. La P. Hua X. J. Biol.

Briefly, control retroviruses, menin, or its mutant-expressing retroviruses were used to infect Men1–/– MEFs. The resulting cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—E-NX cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. For the luciferase assay, 4 × 105 cells were seeded per well in 6-well plates on day 0. On day 1, cells were transfected with reporter constructs, control pcDNA, pcDNA-menin, L22R, or A242V as indicated. pCMV-β-galactosidase expressing the LacZ gene (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was cotransfected as an internal control to normalize the luciferase activity. After overnight incubation, cells were switched to a normal medium. On day 3, cells were harvested for luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and β-galactosidase assays (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured by a TR717 Microplate Luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN). Real Time RT-PCR Quantification, Northern Blotting, and Gel Shift Assay—Exponentially growing MEF cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. After a 2-day culture, total RNA was isolated with a Qiagen RNeasy® minikit. Real time RT-PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7900HT real time PCR system, with 5 μg of total RNA as a template. Taqman probes for caspase 8, Hoxc8, and GAPDH were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Mm00802247_ml, Mm00439369_m1, and Mm99999915_gl, Foster City, CA). Northern Blotting for identifying menin-induced genes was performed as previously described (35La P. Kim A.C. Hou Z. Wang H. Schnepp R.W. Yan N. Shi Y. Hua X. J. Biol.

RNA (20 μg) was separated on an agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane. The membranes were further incubated with the labeled caspase 8 probe or the GAPDH probe, followed by autoradiography.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1075-1081PubMed Google Scholar), a pool of 60-mer nucleotides with 20-nucleotide random sequences in the middle part were synthesized, converted to double-stranded DNA, and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled probe was incubated with each of the following proteins: GST-menin fusion protein, GST-F1 (amino acids 1–218), F2 (amino acids 219–395), F3 (amino acids 396–610), and Smad3, as described for the gel shift assay. The reactions were separated on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (35La P. Kim A.C. Hou Z. Wang H. Schnepp R.W. Yan N. Shi Y. Hua X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49045-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The gel, after completion of electrophoresis, was stained with colloid Coomassie Blue, followed by autoradiography. The subregion of the gel with the dsDNA probe bound by menin protein or Smad3, as assessed by comparing the Coomassie-stained protein bands on the gel and the corresponding autoradiography, was excised and used to extract DNA. Using primers corresponding to the 5′-end and 3′-end sequences of the dsDNA, the purified DNA was further PCR-amplified and utilized as the DNA probe for the next round of gel shift assays with either menin or Smad3, which specifically binds to DNA (40Zawel L.

After four rounds of amplification, PCR-amplified dsDNA was subjected to incubation with 500 ng of GST-menin, GST-F1, F2, F3, or Smad3 in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The reaction was further separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gel and followed by autoradiography. Western Blotting and Detection of Apoptotic Cells—MEFs were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/100-mm dish on day 0. On day 2, cells were harvested and processed for Western blotting as previously described (35La P. Kim A.C. Hou Z. Wang H. Schnepp R.W. Yan N. Shi Y. Hua X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49045-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, on day 0, MEFs (2 × 105 cells) were seeded in a 100-mm dish. After 2 days of culture, cells were harvested. The whole cell lysate (50 μg of protein) was separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond C+ membranes. Antibodies used for Western blotting were anti-actin (sc-1615; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-menin (BL342, Bethyl Laboratory, Montgomery, TX), anti-caspase 8 (ALX-804-447-C100; Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and sheep anti-mouse IgG (A-6154 and A-5906; Sigma). For analyzing TNF-α-induced apoptosis, MEFs were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well dishes. On day 2, cells were treated with or without TNF-α (30 ng/ml)/actinomycin D (20 ng/ml). After 24 h of treatment, cells were collected for propidium iodide staining. The stained cells were subjected to fluorescence-activating cell scanning analysis (LSR cytometer; BD Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—MEFs were seeded at 106 cells/100-mm dish on day 0, harvested, and analyzed on day 1 with a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, chromatin DNA was cross-linked to proteins by formaldehyde and sheared by pulsed ultrasonication. Sheared DNA-protein complex was incubated with the antibody or control IgG overnight. Antibodies used for ChIP were anti-menin (BL342; Bethyl Laboratory), anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody, and anti-acetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology). Antibody-precipitated DNA-protein complex was reverse cross-linked, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, and the precipitated DNA was used as template for conventional PCR or Taqman PCR. Primers for the 5′-UTR Taqman PCR were 5′-CCCGAGCTGGAGTTGTGA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTGGTGGGAAAGGAA-3′, and the Taqman probe was 5′-TCACCTGTGGCCGAGTAC-3. Primers for the island were 5′-TGAGCAGTTGGCTTCTAGTCCA-3′ and 5′-GCAGACCAGGAAGCTTGGTTT-3′, and the Taqman probe was 5′-CCAGGCTTCTGACCAATCCAGACACAATTA-3′. Detection of mRNA and Protein Levels of Caspase 8 in Islets/Insulinomas in Men1+/– and Men1+/+ Mice—Islets were isolated using Ficoll gradient centrifugation, as described previously (12Karnik S.K. Kim C.M. Gu X. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. McLean G.W. Xiong Y. Meyerson M. Kim S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14659-14664Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from Men1+/+ or Men1+/– islets using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and was reverse-transcribed using the Retroscript kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Primers for RT-PCR analysis of caspase 8 mRNA were 5′-ACAATGCCCAGATTTCTCCCTAC-3′ and 5′-CAGACAGTATCCCCGAGGTTTG-3′. Each RT-PCR was repeated at least three times. Islet proteins were extracted using triple detergent lysis buffer (GE Healthcare) and processed for Western blotting using an anti-caspase 8 antibody (3B10; Alexis Biochemical). Menin Binds to the 5′-UTR of Caspase 8 Locus in Vivo—We have previously shown that menin increases caspase 8 expression specifically (26Schnepp R.W. Kim H. Sykes S.M. Zong W.X. Silva A. La P. Hua X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10685-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether menin binds the caspase 8 locus in vivo and, if it does, whether the binding is DNA sequence-specific or not. Thus, we performed a ChIP assay in menin-null MEFs complemented with vector or menin to address these questions. Three pairs of primers used for ChIP target three distinct regions of the caspase 8 locus, including 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, and a region containing a ∼80-bp fragment that was highly conserved between human and murine genomic DNA with 78% identity at the 5′ end of the caspase 8 locus, which was named as the “island.” The ChIP assay indicates that anti-menin antibody, but not the control IgG, pulled down the 5′-UTR fragment in menin-expressing cells (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6, middle), whereas anti-menin antibody failed to pull down the DNA fragment in vector cells (Fig. 1, lane 3). In contrast, menin failed to pull down the island and 3′-UTR regions in either menin-expressing or menin-null cells (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 6, top and bottom). These results demonstrate that menin specifically associated with the 5′-UTR region of the caspase 8 locus in vivo. We have previously shown that menin binds dsDNA in vitro (35La P. Kim A.C. Hou Z. Wang H. Schnepp R.W. Yan N. Shi Y. Hua X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49045-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether menin binds the 5′-UTR of caspase 8 in vitro and, if it does, whether menin binds it in a DNA sequence-dependent manner. To address this question, we amplified the 5′-UTR and end-labeled it with 32P. The labeled probe was used to perform a gel shift assay to determine whether the probe binds the C-terminus of menin (GST-menin fusion protein (GST-F3), amino acids 396–610) (Fig. 2A), which was previously shown to bind dsDNA (35La P.

Our results clearly show that GST-F3 binds the 5′-UTR DNA fragment (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). We further tested whether the menin-DNA binding is affected by nonspecific dsDNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, even the lowest amount of poly(dI-dC) (0.125 μg), a homopolymer of nonspecific dsDNA, markedly blocked GST-F3 binding to the 5′-UTR DNA fragment (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8), suggesting that C-terminal menin (residues 396–610) binds the 5′-UTR in a sequence-independent manner. However, we could not rule out the possibility that menin might prefer to bind some DNA sequences with a relatively high affinity. To address this question, we applied CASTing (39Ouellette M.M.

https://openalex.org/W2121822754,"Yeast Rpl10 belongs to the L10e family of ribosomal proteins. In the large (60 S) subunit, Rpl10 is positioned in a cleft between the central protuberance and the GTPase-activating center. It is loaded into the 60 S subunit at a late step in maturation. We have shown previously that Rpl10 is required for the release of the Crm1-dependent nuclear export adapter Nmd3, an event that also requires the cytoplasmic GTPase Lsg1. Here we have carried out an extensive mutational analysis of Rpl10 to identify mutations that would allow us to map activities to distinct domains of the protein to begin to understand the molecular interaction between Rpl10 and Nmd3. We found that mutations in a central loop (amino acids 102–112) had a significant impact on the release of Nmd3. This loop is unstructured in the crystal and solution structures of prokaryotic Rpl10 orthologs. Thus, the loop is not necessary for stable interaction of Rpl10 with the ribosome, suggesting that it plays a dynamic role in ribosome function or regulating the association of other factors. We also found that mutant Rpl10 proteins were engineered to be unable to bind to the ribosome accumulated in the nucleus. This was unexpected and may suggest a nuclear role for Rpl10.

Here we have carried out an extensive mutational analysis of Rpl10 to identify mutations that would allow us to map activities to distinct domains of the protein to begin to understand the molecular interaction between Rpl10 and Nmd3. We found that mutations in a central loop (amino acids 102–112) had a significant impact on the release of Nmd3. This loop is unstructured in the crystal and solution structures of prokaryotic Rpl10 orthologs. Thus, the loop is not necessary for stable interaction of Rpl10 with the ribosome, suggesting that it plays a dynamic role in ribosome function or regulating the association of other factors. We also found that mutant Rpl10 proteins were engineered to be unable to bind to the ribosome accumulated in the nucleus. This was unexpected and may suggest a nuclear role for Rpl10. Yeast Rpl10 belongs to the L10e family of ribosomal proteins and is orthologous to bacterial L16. In the crystal structure of the Haloarcula marismortui large subunit (1Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar, 2Klein D.J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 141-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), L10e is situated in a deep cleft between the central protuberance and the GTPase-activating center. The assembly of L16 into the bacterial subunit is accompanied by a large conformational change of the subunit (3Teraoka H. Nierhaus K.H. FEBS Lett. 1978; 88: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that L16 is necessary for organizing the ribosome structure surrounding its binding pocket. The central core of L10e is a sandwich composed of five β strands and two α helices (2Klein D.J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 141-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). A similar architecture is observed for L16 in the bacterial ribosome; however, in L16 the central core is reduced to four β strands and two α helices. The solution structure of free L16 from Thermus thermophilus (4Nishimura M. Yoshida T. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Ohkubo T. Kobayashi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), is remarkably similar to that of L16 in the context of the subunit, indicating that L16 does not undergo large conformational changes upon binding to the subunit. Although L10e makes no contacts with other ribosomal proteins, it makes extensive contacts with 23 S rRNA along helices H38 and H89 and minor contacts with 5 S rRNA. H38, also referred to as the “A-site finger” is involved in a bridging interaction with the 30 S subunit, whereas H89 extends from the peptidyl transferase center. Fitting the archaeal ribosome structure to cryo-electron microscopic reconstructions of the yeast ribosome (5Spahn C.M.T. Beckmann R. Eswar N. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Blobel G. Frank J. Cell. 2001; 107: 373-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) shows that Rpl10 is similarly disposed in the eukaryotic ribosome. The location of L16 in the large subunit, close to the A-site and the GTPase-activating center, suggests the possibility that it is intimately involved in translation. In fact, bacterial subunits reconstituted without L16 have reduced catalytic activity and are defective for interaction with the small subunit (6Kazemie M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Moore V.G. Atchison R.E. Thomas G. Moran M. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the crystal structure of the bacterial ribosome L16 makes contacts with the T-loop of the A-site tRNA (8Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), and cryo-EM structures of bacterial ribosomes show L16 making contacts with initiation factor IF2 (9Allen G.S. Zavialov A. Gursky R. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Cell. 2005; 121: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, ribosomes are assembled in the nucleolus, a subcompartment of the nucleus where transcription of the bulk of ribosomal RNA takes place. Early analysis of the in vivo assembly of ribosomes in yeast led to the conclusion that Rpl10 is loaded into the ribosome at a late step (10Kruiswijk T. Planta R.J. Krop J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 517: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and that the protein exchanges on mature subunits (11Zinker S. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free Rpl10 is bound by the WD repeat protein Sqt1 and is unstable in temperature sensitive sqt1 mutants (12West M. Hedges J.B. Chen A. Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3802-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, Sqt1 appears to act as a chaperone for free Rpl10. C-terminally truncated Rpl10 proteins are unable to bind stably to the ribosome and are toxic because they titrate Sqt1 away from functional Rpl10 (12West M. Hedges J.B. Chen A. Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3802-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Eisinger D.P. Dick F.A. Denke E. Trumpower B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5146-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whether Rpl10 initially loads onto the subunit in the nucleus or cytoplasm has been debated. The export adapter for the large subunit in yeast is Nmd3 (14Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 15Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), a protein that shuttles into and out of the nucleus to mediate subunit export dependent on the export receptor CRM1. Mutations in RPL10 or repression of RPL10 transcription lead to a failure to recycle Nmd3 to the nucleus (16Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicating that the release of Nmd3 from subunits in the cytoplasm depends on Rpl10. Release of Nmd3 also depends on the cytoplasmic GTPase Lsg1, and we have suggested that the GTPase activity of Lsg1 drives the accommodation of Rpl10 into the subunit, facilitating the release of Nmd3 (12West M. Hedges J.B. Chen A. Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3802-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Lsg1 belongs to a small but highly conserved family of circularly permuted GTPases (17Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The related circularly permuted GTPase RbgA from Bacillus subtilis is also required for late, and possibly rate-limiting, assembly of L16 into the bacterial large subunit (18Uicker W.C. Schaefer L. Britton R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here, we have carried out a mutational analysis of Rpl10 to identify mutations that would define different domains important for interaction with Sqt1, the ribosome, and for release of NMD3. Yeast Strains and Media—All of the strains were grown at 30 °C in rich medium (yeast extract peptone) or synthetic dropout medium (20Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. 1994; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) containing either 2% glucose or 1% galactose as the carbon source. The following strains were used in this study: AJY2104 (MATα kanMX6:GAL1:RPL10 ura3 Leu2 ade2 ade3), made by integration of the GAL1 promoter (21Longtine M.S. McKenzie A r. Demarini J Shah.D. G Wach.N. Brachat A. Philippsen A. Pringle P. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) into the genomic locus of Rpl10, W303 (MATα leu2-3,1123 his3-11 ura3-1 trp1-1 ade2-1 can 1-100 SSD1-d), BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 met15Δ0), and AJY2141 (MATa SQT1: GFP:HIS3 his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 met15Δ0). Construction of Plasmids—Plasmids are listed in Table 1. pAJ1197 (RPL10-myc LEU2-CEN), where myc denotes 13 tandem copies of the c-Myc epitope (21Longtine M.S. McKenzie A r. Demarini J Shah.D. G Wach.N. Brachat A. Philippsen A. Pringle P. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar), was made by combining RPL10, as a PCR product amplified with oligonucleotides AJO645 and AJO644 and cut with SstI and BamHI, with the Myc epitope as a BamHI-HindIII fragment from pAJ538 (15Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) into pRS315. Random loss of function mutants of RPL10 were made by PCR mutagenesis and in vivo recombination in yeast. Forty PCR reactions of twenty cycles were carried out in parallel using Taq DNA polymerase (GeneChoice) with AJO264 and AJO722, and pAJ1197 as the template. The products were pooled and cotransformed into AJY2104 with BsaBI-SalI gapped pAJ1197. Transformants were selected on Leu– galactose plates and replica-plated to Leu– glucose plates to identify dead or slow growing mutants.TABLE 1Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidDescriptionSourcepAJ409URA3-CEN NMD3Ref. 22Kallstrom G.

Western Blotting—Extracts were prepared from 5-ml cultures of AJY2104 containing mutant Rpl10 plasmids grown in Leu– galactose medium. All of the subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. The cells were washed in 500 μl of extract buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A) and resuspended in 250 μl of extract buffer. An equal volume of glass beads (400 μm) was added, and the samples were vortexed in three 1-min pulses with 2-min intervals on ice. The samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using mouse α-c-Myc (9E10) (Covance), affinity-purified rabbit anti-Rpl8, affinity-purified rabbit anti-Nmd3, affinity-purified rabbit anti-Sqt1, and affinity-purified rabbit anti-Lsg1. Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitations (IPs) 2The abbreviation used is: IP, immunoprecipitation. of mutant myc-tagged Rpl10 proteins, 25-ml cultures were grown to A600 ∼ 0.5 in Leu– galactose medium. All of the subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. The cells were harvested, washed with IP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP40, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm each leupeptin and pepstatin A), and resuspended in 250 μl of IP buffer. Extracts were made by glass bead lysis (five 50-s pulses with 2-min intervals on ice) and were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. 1.0 μl of α-c-Myc (9E10) antibody was added to equal A260 units of sample supernatants and rocked for 1 h at 4°C.30 μl of a 50% slurry of bovine serum albumin-blocked protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) was then added, and rocking was continued for an additional hour. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitation from sucrose gradient fractions was carried out in a similar fashion. Polysome Analysis—5 ml fresh overnight cultures in Leu– galactose medium were diluted into 100 ml of Leu– glucose medium and cultured until A600 =∼0.3. Cycloheximide was added to 150 μg/ml, and the cells were immediately poured onto ice and collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. All of the subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. The cell pellets were washed with 2 ml of polysome buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 6mm β-mercaptoethanol, 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm each leupeptin and pepstatin A), resuspended in one volume of the same buffer and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Equal A260 units of supernatant were loaded onto continuous 7–47% sucrose gradients in polysome buffer without protease inhibitors. After centrifugation for 2.5 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor, the gradients were analyzed by absorbance at 254 nm. The proteins were precipitated from fractions with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described (23Hedges J. Chen Y.I. West M. Bussiere C. Johnson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36579-36587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Threading—The sequence of Rpl10 (amino acids 4–173) was threaded onto the structure of L10e in the 50 S ribosomal subunit from the archaeon H. marismortui (Protein Data Base structure 1S72) (2Klein D.J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 141-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) using Swiss-PDBViewer www.expasy.org/spdbv/ (24Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar). A gap from amino acids 102 to 111 corresponds to the unstructured central loop of L10e. Mutagenesis of RPL10—We introduced random mutations into the open reading frame of RPL10 using PCR and recombined the PCR products into a c-Myc-tagged expression vector in vivo in yeast. In the strain used for this screen, RPL10 was expressed from its genomic locus but under control of the GAL1 promoter. This strain is inviable under repressing conditions (the presence of glucose) unless functional RPL10 is provided episomally. However, the growth of this strain is indistinguishable from wild type in the presence of galactose (data not shown). Repressing genomic conditional RPL10, instead of selecting against an RPL10-containing vector on 5-fluoroorotic acid, avoided interplasmid recombination, which, in our hands, is a common problem during plasmid shuffle in such screens. In addition, we were able to identify several dominant negative mutants in this screen, probably because the high expression of genomic RPL10 from the GAL1 promoter efficiently outcompeted the dominant negative mutants (data not shown). From this screen, 26 different mutants were obtained. Six contained two mutations, which were subsequently subcloned to isolate the single amino acid changes. In addition to the random mutations, we engineered four directed mutants. In an attempt to disrupt Rpl10 binding to the ribosome without significantly altering the structure of Rpl10, we mutated two regions of basic amino acids that were likely important for electrostatic interaction with rRNA. Within α helix 2 of Rpl10, which contacts helix 89 of 25 S rRNA, we mutated Arg153 and Arg154 each to glutamate. Separately, Lys38, Lys39, and Lys40 in α helix 1, which are modeled to interact with helix 38 of 25 S rRNA, were each changed to alanine. In addition, we made the combined K38A,K39A,K40A,R153E,R154E mutant (referred to as KKKRR). Finally, the mutational analysis identified a cluster of mutations within an internal loop of Rpl10. The corresponding loop in L10e was not resolved in the crystal structure of the 50 S subunit from H. marismortui (2Klein D.J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 141-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), suggesting that this loop is not structured in the free subunit, consistent with NMR analysis of free L16 (4Nishimura M. Yoshida T. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Ohkubo T. Kobayashi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To examine the function of this loop, we deleted amino acids 102–112 (Δ102–112). Altogether, we analyzed 39 different mutations (Fig. 1 and Table 3).TABLE 3Summary of rpl10 mutantsMutationGrowth in rpl10ΔaGrowth in GAL1::RPL10 strain (AJY2104) under repressing conditions.Dominant negativebScored in the wild-type strain BY4741.Cellular localizationcDetermined by IF in BY4741.

Open table in a new tab Phenotypic Analysis of rpl10 Mutants—Serial dilutions of the rpl10 mutants expressed in AJY2104 (GAL1::RPL10) were plated onto selective plates to examine growth under repressing conditions for genomic RPL10 (Fig. 2). Because we initially screened for slow growth or lethality, we obtained mutants with a spectrum of growth phenotypes. K40E, F136L, and K203M were initially obtained in combination with second mutations and did not appear to contribute significantly to the phenotype of the double mutant (data not shown and Table 3). In Fig. 2 the rpl10 mutants are arranged roughly in the order in which the mutations appear in the gene to aid in identifying mutations with common phenotypes that map close together in primary sequence. The most striking result from this analysis was the cluster of mutations from Ser104 to Met115. These mutations were all lethal and corresponded to an unstructured loop in L10e, indicating that these residues are not needed for any stable contacts with the large subunit. The apparent growth observed in the first two dilutions of some of these mutants represents residual growth supported by preexisting ribosomes. These mutants were not able to form colonies after prolonged incubation (data not shown). Because it was possible that amino acid substitutions within this loop resulted in structural or electrostatic conflicts in the ribosome, we engineered a deletion of this loop that, based on the crystal structure of L10e from H. marismortui, was expected to remove the entire loop without significantly distorting the remainder of Rpl10. Like the point mutations within the loop, the deletion mutant (rpl10Δ102–112) was lethal (Fig. 2). Rpl10 shows genetic interaction with NMD3, encoding the 60 S subunit export adapter NMD3 (12West M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5146-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because high copy NMD3 suppresses certain rpl10 mutants by bypassing their defect in recycling Nmd3 (16Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of high copy NMD3 on the rpl10 mutants. Surprisingly, only a single mutant, rpl10Q59R, showed significant suppression by high copy wild-type NMD3 (Fig. 2, column 2). We also tested the effect of expressing an nmd3 mutant (NMD3I112T I362T) that has reduced affinity for 60 S subunits and suppresses certain rpl10 mutants that block Nmd3 release in the cytoplasm (16Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, column 3). Nmd3(I112T I362T) was able to suppress various rpl10 mutants. We do not presently understand why high copy NMD3 and NMD3(I112T I362T) suppress rpl10 mutants differentially. It is possible that the release of Nmd3 is coordinated with Rpl10 loading. If so, mutant Nmd3 with weakened affinity for the subunit, but not overexpression of wild-type Nmd3, could allow some defective Rpl10 proteins to load into the subunit. It has been shown previously that C-terminally truncated rpl10 mutants fail to assemble stably with the ribosome and titrate out cellular Sqt1 (12West M. Hedges J.B. Chen A. Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3802-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Eisinger D.P. Dick F.A. Denke E. Trumpower B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5146-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of SQT1 relieves the dominant effect of these rpl10 mutants, we tested whether overexpression of SQT1 could suppress any of the rpl10 point mutants as an indicator of mutants that are defective for assembly into the ribosome. Because Sqt1 stabilizes free Rpl10, high copy SQT1 is also likely to suppress rpl10 mutations with reduced binding to Sqt1. High copy SQT1 suppressed various rpl10 mutants (Fig. 2, column 4). Interestingly, there was considerable overlap between the mutants suppressed by NMD3I112TI362T and by high copy SQT1, the exceptions being V53G, N73D, and G151V, which were preferentially suppressed by high copy SQT1, and R90S, L97S and KKKRR, which were preferentially suppressed by mutant nmd3. The suppression of rpl10(KKKRR) by NMD3(I112T I362T) was surprising because this mutant Rpl10 does not stably interact with the ribosome. As noted above, the release of Nmd3 may be coordinated with the loading of Rpl10. Mutant Rpl10 that cannot efficiently bind to the ribosome may not be able to trigger the release of Nmd3. However, mutations in Nmd3 that weaken its interaction with the ribosome may alleviate this problem. Finally, we tested all mutants for dominant negative effects when expressed from a low copy vector in wild-type cells (Fig. 3, data not shown, and Table 3). Δ31–32, C49R, L65S, G151V, and KKKRR showed modest effects in this assay, whereas deletion of the internal unstructured loop (amino acids 102–112) was strongly dominant negative. There was no obvious correlation between mutants that were dominant negative and those that were suppressed by NMD3 or SQT1. The slightly reduced 60 S subunit levels in the wild-type sample is likely due to a subtle effect of the C-terminal epitope tag. To examine the effects of the rpl10 mutants on 60 S biogenesis and translation, we analyzed the polysome profiles of selected mutants by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The mutant Rpl10 proteins were expressed ectopically in the presence of wild-type Rpl10, to allow similar growth of all cultures. RPL10 expression was then repressed by growth in glucose-containing medium. Because Rpl10 is continuously incorporated into ribosomes during cell growth, the pool of wild-type Rpl10 is rapidly depleted. Under these conditions, the wild-type Rpl10 control showed modest halfmers. However, all of the mutants tested gave profiles similar to the vector control (Fig. 4 and data not shown), indicating that the mutant proteins were not supporting ribosome assembly. Coimmunoprecipitation and Sucrose Gradient Sedimentation—To test more directly for interactions between the mutant Rpl10 proteins and the ribosome, Nmd3, Sqt1, and Lsg1, we carried out co-IP assays. The mutant Rpl10 proteins were imunoprecipitated from extracts by virtue of a C-terminal c-Myc epitope. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for Rpl8 as a 60 S subunit marker, Nmd3, Sqt1, and Lsg1 (Fig. 5). The results from this analysis were complex, although several important conclusions can be drawn. First, the KKKRR mutant, engineered to be defective for ribosome binding, coimmun"

(EC 1.1.1.95) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to differ markedly in structure and activity (1Dey S. Kim Z. Xu X.L. Sacchettini J.C. Grant G.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Like the E. coli enzyme, M. tuberculosis PGDH is a homotetramer, but unlike the E. coli enzyme, whose subunits are composed of three distinct domains, each M. tuberculosis subunit is composed of four distinct domains. The two enzymes have in common a nucleotide binding domain, a substrate binding domain, and a regulatory domain that appear to function similarly in both. The regulatory domains of these enzymes are members of the ACT domain family of small molecule binding regulatory domains (4Aravind L. Kim E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 5Chipman D.M. Kim B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33825-33829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that bind l-serine, an inhibitor of enzymatic activity. The fourth domain in M. tuberculosis PGDH is called the “intervening domain” and is located sequentially between the substrate binding domain and the regulatory domain. The function of this fourth domain in the PGDH subunit is not known but it forms what appears to be a new ligand binding site. This site is a small, solvent accessible pocket surrounded by positively charged amino acid side chains. It was first recognized from the crystal structure where it was observed to bind l-tartrate, a component of the crystallization buffer. Because l-tartrate is found only in plants, and it was present in the buffer in high concentrations, it is unlikely that it is the physiological ligand for this site. Therefore, for simplicity and to avoid ambiguity, we will refer to this site as the “anion binding site” because it appears to be composed completely of cationic side chains. E. coli PGDH exhibits activity with both the physiological substrate, hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate (HPAP), as well as α-ketoglutarate, an analog of HPAP. The M. tuberculosis enzyme, on the other hand, displays activity only with HPAP. Furthermore, the M. tuberculosis enzyme exhibits significant substrate inhibition characteristics that are not seen with HPAP in the E. coli enzyme. Both enzymes utilize NADH as a cofactor and are inhibited in a positively cooperative manner by l-serine. However, the sensitivity of the M. tuberculosis enzyme to l-serine inhibition is ∼10-fold less than the E. coli enzyme, the IC50 values being 30 and 3 μm, respectively. PGDH is an essential enzyme for the M. tuberculosis bacteria (7Sassetti C.M. Kim D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar) and may represent a potential target for drug development. The existence of a physiologically relevant inhibitor binding site (for serine) as well as an apparent new ligand binding site of unknown function as part of a new, unique domain provide distinct targets for potential drug interaction. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to better characterize the kinetic and ligand binding characteristics of M. tuberculosis PGDH and to explore the potential function of the intervening domain and the anion binding site. HPAP was purchased from Sigma as the dimethylketal tricyclohexylammonium salt and was converted to HPAP according to directions accompanying the reagent. NADH was also purchased from Sigma and all other reagents were analytical grade. The concentration of each HPAP preparation was determined by the amount of NADH converted to NAD+ (8Sugimoto E. Kim L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was stored in frozen aliquots prior to use. The concentration of HPAP was determined each time the assays were performed. M. tuberculosis PGDH concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm using an E1% of 5.6 that was previously determined by amino acid analysis (1Dey S. Kim Z. Xu X.L. Sacchettini J.C. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14884-14891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The values for the pKa of functional groups were calculated using SPARC (ibmlc2.chem.uga.edu/sparc/). M. tuberculosis PGDH activity was measured by following the conversion of NADH to NAD+ by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in the presence of enzyme and HPAP. Assays performed between pH 6.0 and 8.5 were performed in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA at the designated pH and concentrations of NADH and HPAP. Assays performed between pH 4.5 and 5.5 were performed in 200 mm potassium acetate buffer, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. Enzyme concentrations varied between 6 and 16 nm. Enzyme was assayed at pH 6 in both buffers to normalize the enzyme activity at the pH crossover point. No significant difference in relative activity was observed when the addition of KCl was used to maintain an ionic strength of 31 mS/cm across all pH values. Expression and Purification—M. tuberculosis PGDH was expressed as previously described (1Dey S. Kim Z. Xu X.L. Sacchettini J.C. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14884-14891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells from a 500-1000-ml preparation were re-suspended in 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA and brought to pH 6.2 with 0.1 n HCl (buffer A). After a 10-min incubation on ice with 0.16 mg/ml lysozyme, the cells were sonicated for 2-3 min. Crude debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min after the addition of 19 mg/ml ammonium sulfate and 35 μl/ml of 10% polyethyleneimine in water. After the addition of 150 mg/ml ammonium sulfate to the supernatant, the cell extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant retained. M. tuberculosis PGDH was precipitated by the addition of 270 mg/ml ammonium sulfate and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was re-suspended in buffer A and loaded on to a 1.2 × 12-cm column of 5′-ADP-Sepharose, washed with five column volumes of buffer A, and eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm ammonium sulfate and 250 μm NADH. M. tuberculosis PGDH was located by assaying for enzymatic activity and appropriate fractions pooled. The 5′-ADP pool was dialyzed against 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl and loaded onto a 2.6 × 7-cm column of Q-Sepharose. The column was washed with 1 column volume of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl and developed with a 1200-ml linear gradient of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 5-1000 mm KCl. M. tuberculosis PGDH was located by assaying for enzymatic activity and purity assessed on SDS-PAGE gels. Mutagenesis—Site-specific mutagenesis was performed by standard PCR methods (9Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991: 8.5.1-8.5.8Google Scholar). After amplification, the PCR product was digested at appropriate restriction sites flanking the mutated residue and the piece containing the mutation was ligated into the expression vector containing the native enzyme that was digested in the same manner. The sequence of the entire coding region of the protein was determined to be correct by sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Sequencer. Protein purity was assessed on SDS-PAGE gels and all mutants were present as predominate single bands of the appropriate size. Mutants were isolated as described for the native enzyme. Substrate Inhibition—The kinetic model employed for fitting the data that exhibits substrate inhibition was that described by LiCata and Allewell (10LiCata V.J. Kim N.M. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and utilized the following equation, v=Vmax+Vi([S]x/Kix)1+(Kn/[S]n)+([S]x/Kix)(Eq. 1) where Vmax and Vi correspond to the catalytic constants kcat and kcat(i) and n is the Hill coefficient. The exponent x is a second Hill coefficient allowing for cooperativity of substrate binding in the inhibitory mode. To obtain convergence for Equation 1, the value of x must be fixed. The integer value for x that gives the best fit was determined empirically. When there is no cooperativity present, n and x = 1. The Vi term describes the case where inhibition is only partial and represents the inhibited velocity. When complete inhibition is observed, Vi = 0, and the equation, in the absence of cooperativity, reduces to the standard equation for complete uncompetitive substrate inhibition (11Cleland W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). v=Vmax1+(K/[S])+([S]/Ki)(Eq. 2) pH Studies—The pH dependent data were fit to the following equations 3Professor Paul Cook, University of Oklahoma, personal communication. to determine the pKa values. The pH dependence of log V/K data were fit to Equation 3, log(V/K)obs=log((V/K)1+([H]/K1)+(K2/[H]))(Eq. 3) where V/K is the pH independent value and K1 and K2 represent dissociation constants for enzyme or substrate functional groups. The pH dependence of log (1/Ki) data were fit to, log(1/Ki)obs=log(YL1+([H]K1)2+YH(K2[H])21+(K2[H])2)(Eq. 4) where YL and YH are pH independent values of 1/Ki at low and high pH, respectively, K1 and K2 represent dissociation constants for enzyme or substrate functional groups. All data were fit with Kaleidograph version 4.0 from Synergy Software. The kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 were derived from at least three determinations.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of native and mutated M. tuberculosis d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenaseEnzymeKmkcatKikcat/Kmμms-1μmm-1 s-1Native170 ± 502461 ± 281950 ± 1201.5 × 107H447AaFit to Equation 2160 ± 101446 ± 191870 ± 500.9 × 107R451AaFit to Equation 2190 ± 401881 ± 109950 ± 1501.0 × 107R501AaFit to Equation 2180 ± 101989 ± 881020 ± 301.1 × 107R446AbFit to Equation 1 with n = 1, x = 2123 ± 18467 ± 49289 ± 150.4 × 107K439AcFit to Equation 1 with n = 2, x = 275 ± 1368 ± 3854 ± 40.5 × 107R501A, R451A, K439AaFit to Equation 2243 ± 161558 ± 587218 ± 13790.6 × 107a Fit to Equation 2b Fit to Equation 1 with n = 1, x = 2c Fit to Equation 1 with n = 2, x = 2 Open table in a new tab Substrate Inhibition Kinetics—PGDH from M. tuberculosis displays substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations as shown in Fig. 1. A plot of activity versus the log of the substrate concentration (Fig. 1, inset) produces a symmetrical curve that approaches complete inhibition at high substrate concentrations. This behavior is consistent with complete uncompetitive substrate inhibition (see below) and the substrate concentration data can be fit well with the equation describing this type of inhibition (Equation 2). When the HPAP concentration was varied at different fixed concentrations of NADH, the apparent kcat and Km increase as NADH levels increase. At the same time, the Ki decreases with increasing NADH indicating increasing levels of substrate inhibition (Fig. 2). Double reciprocol plots of the data display the characteristic non-linear patterns expected for substrate inhibition (12Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. 1975; (pp. , Wiley Interscience, New York): 818-826Google Scholar). Unlike HPAP, NADH does not exhibit substrate inhibition. Rather, a plot of activity versus increasing NADH concentrations exhibits a sigmoidal character indicating homotropic positive cooperativity. When the NADH concentration was varied at different fixed concentrations of HPAP, it can be seen that at low HPAP concentrations the maximum velocity of the reaction increases as HPAP increases, but at higher HPAP concentrations this trend was reversed and the velocity of the reaction decreases as the HPAP concentration was increased. This behavior is consistent with uncompetitive substrate inhibition by HPAP (12Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. 1975; (pp. , Wiley Interscience, New York): 818-826Google Scholar). The double reciprocal plots for this data are also non-linear due to the homotropic positive cooperativity of NADH. The crystal structure showing tartrate bound to the enzyme utilized the Na,K salt of tartrate at a concentration of 1 m. However, the inclusion of Na,K tartrate in the assays where HPAP or NADH are varied at a constant level of the other does not seem to have a significant effect on the activity of the enzyme. It may be that whereas tartrate can bind to this site at high concentrations, it may not bind in a productive manner. Anion Binding Site—The anion binding site was originally observed as an area of additional density where two adjacent intervening domains converged. The densities appeared to represent tartrate molecules that were a component of the crystallization buffer (2Dey S. Kim G.A. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14892-14899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The location of the anion binding site at the interfaces of the intervening and regulatory domains is shown in Fig. 3. The tartrate molecules are in hydrogen bonding distances of a group of positively charged residue side chains consisting of His-447 from one subunit and Lys-439′, Arg-451′, and Arg-501′ from the adjacent subunit (′ indicates residues contributed from an adjacent subunit). Arg-501 is actually found in the regulatory domain but extends into this binding pocket. His-447 is found in the strand connecting the regulatory domain and the intervening domain, whereas Lys-439 and Arg-451 are found in the intervening domain. Two molecules of tartrate are bound at each interface because of the symmetry of the structure. This arrangement is similar to the two molecules of serine that bind symmetrically at the regulatory domain interface in E. coli PGDH (3Schuller D. Kim G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). There is an additional cationic side chain, Arg-446, that is found very close to the anion binding site but does not appear to interact with tartrate in the available crystal structure. The anion binding site was chosen as a focus for site-specific mutagenesis because of the structural similarity of tartrate to the substrate and because only enzymes containing the intervening domain displayed substrate inhibition. The positively charged residues at the anion binding site, His-447, Arg-451′, Arg-501′, Arg-446, and Lys-439′ were converted to alanine side chains by site-directed mutagenesis. A triple mutant where Arg-501′, Arg-451′, and Lys-439′ were all converted to alanine residues was also produced. This combination of residues was chosen because it included all of the residues contributed by one of the subunits at the anion binding site interface. The kinetic parameters, determined at pH 7.5, for these mutations are presented in Table 1. The native enzyme as well as H447A, R451A, and R501A are best fit to Equation 2 and display complete uncompetitive substrate inhibition. The triple mutant was also fit using Equation 2, but displayed little if any apparent substrate inhibition (Fig. 4). On the other hand, R446A and K439A mutations appear to display only partial uncompetitive inhibition as well as cooperative effects and can best be fit with Equation 1. The cooperative effects of the data fit best with n = 1, x = 2 for R446A, and n = 2, x = 2 for K439A. The Km, kcat, and Ki values for native enzyme and H447A, R451A, R501A, and the triple mutation are comparable, whereas those values for R446A and K439A are significantly reduced. These latter two are also the two mutants that display partial cooperative inhibition. Dependence of Activity on pH—When the pH dependence of the activity of the native enzyme is measured at constant levels of HPAP and NADH, a very unusual dual pH optimum is observed (Fig. 5). The activity is relatively constant between pH 7.5 and 9.5. Above pH 9.5 and below pH 7.5, the activity falls off rapidly. However, at approximately pH 5.7 the activity starts increasing again and reaches a new optimum at approximately pH 5.2 before decreasing once again. The activity of the enzyme was not measured below pH 4.5-5.0 because NADH spontaneously hydrolyzes in this region. The observation of a dual pH optimum was explored in more detail by determining the kinetic parameters of Km, kcat, and Ki at different pH values. The data are presented in Fig. 5 and show that the Ki for substrate inhibition decreases markedly (1/Ki increases) in the area of the valley between the two pH optima. The kcat appears to be essentially pH independent throughout the pH range studied, whereas the kcat/Km parameter yields pK values of 4.9 and 7.0 when fit to Equation 3. The 1/Ki response was relatively sharp between pH 5 and 7 and fitting this data to equation 4 yields pK values of 5.78 and 5.84. Because these values are indistinguishable within error, they are considered to be a single pK of 5.8. The anion binding site mutant enzymes did not all produce the same dual pH optima observed for the native enzyme (representative plots are shown in Fig. 6). Instead, H447A and R501A exhibited a single broad bell-shaped curve with an acidic side pK of ∼4.8. R446A and R451A yielded similar profiles. However, a slight shoulder was visible at a pH corresponding to the valley observed for the native enzyme. The triple mutation also exhibited a single broad pH profile, but it appeared to be shifted by ∼0.5-1 pH units to the acid side. K439A retained the dual optima of the native enzyme but with a broadened valley that corresponded to pK values of ∼4.9 and 8.0 as compared with 4.9 and 7.0 for thenative enzyme. When the pH-dependent kinetic parameters are determined for H447A and R501A, the decrease in Ki between pH 5 and 7 is absent or greatly reduced. A comparison of the 1/Ki values for native, H447A, R501A, and K4539A PGDH is shown in Fig. 7. The Ki values for R501A are relatively constant at all pH values studied and the substrate inhibition profiles exhibit apparent complete inhibition. The same is true for H447A from pH 7.5 to 6.0. However, below pH 6.0 the inhibition profile changes from that of complete inhibition to partial inhibition at pH 5.5 and no apparent substrate inhibition at pH 5.0. An increase in substrate inhibition, similar to the native enzyme, is apparent for K439A. In this case, substrate inhibition is partial from pH 8.5 to 5.5, and then reverts to a low level of complete inhibition at pH 5.0. The 1/Ki values are elevated at pH values that display a reduced velocity in the valley between the two apparent pH optima. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that there is a correlation between the widened valley seen for K439A, pH 5.5-7.5, compared with native enzyme, pH 5.5-6.5, and the pH specific increase in the 1/Ki values for that mutant.FIGURE 7Log of 1/Ki as a function of pH.

This is similar to what was reported for rat PGDH (13Achouri Y. Kim M.H. Van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which also possesses an intervening domain, but is not seen in the E. coli enzyme that lacks an intervening domain. This suggested that the intervening domain was potentially involved in the mechanism of substrate inhibition. Surprisingly, analysis of the pH dependence of the activity of M. tuberculosis PGDH produces a very unusual but distinct dual pH optimum profile for this enzyme. Subsequent analysis of the kinetic parameters demonstrates that whereas the kcat is relatively independent of pH, the substrate inhibition of enzymatic activity actually increases significantly in the area between the pH optima. This rise and then drop in substrate inhibition as the pH is lowered appears to be responsible for the apparent dual optima that is observed when the enzyme is assayed at a single constant concentration of substrate and cofactor. Subsequent investigation of the potential function of the anion binding site by site-directed mutagenesis revealed a correlation between the unusual dual pH optimum observed for this enzyme and the potential involvement of this site in the substrate inhibition characteristics of the enzyme. As originally pointed out (2Dey S. Kim G.A. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14892-14899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), tartrate is most likely not the physiological ligand for this site because, as far as we know, it is found only in plants. Furthermore, tartrate does not seem to affect catalytic activity in in vitro assays. Although tartrate has some similarity to the substrate, hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate, in that both possess anionic groups at either end of their carbon chains, hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate is larger than tartrate and possesses an ionizable phosphate group in place of one of the carboxyl groups of tartrate. Thus, the interaction of hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate at this site could be more extensive than that seen for tartrate. The reason that tartrate does not appear to produce inhibition could be due to an unproductive binding mode because it is lacking the phosphate group that provides for a more elongated molecule, a higher charge density, and a higher pK. Furthermore, binding of substrate may potentially involve additional interactions with the protein, such as with Arg-446 that displays a definite effect on the substrate inhibition but is not observed to be interacting with tartrate in the crystal structure. A fit of the log kcat/Km values of the native enzyme at various pH values to Equation 3 yields pK values of ∼7.0 and 4.9. When an increase in substrate inhibition is absent, as in H447A and R501A, a single pK of ∼4.9 is observed. The pK of 4.9 probably represents a group at the active site being protonated that is required in its unprotonated state for activity. This may represent His-280, which forms a His-Glu pair with Glu-262 at the active site. The apparent pK of 7.0 appears to result as a function of the increase in substrate inhibition. The fit of the log 1/Ki plot as a function of pH, for the native enzyme, to Equation 4, yields two pK of ∼5.8 that are indistinguishable within error. This peak is well defined and clearly shows a slope of ∼2 on either side. This indicates that two functional groups are protonated and two functional groups are unprotonated for optimal substrate inhibition to occur. These groups could be on either the protein or the substrate and the value of 5.8 represents an average pKa of the groups involved. It seems likely that His-447 at the anion binding site and the phosphate group of the substrate are involved, potentially in a charge interaction. As the pH decreases, both groups, which have a normal pKa of ∼6, would become increasingly protonated. This would increase the positive charge on the histidine but at the same time decrease the negative charge on the phosphate group. These opposing phenomena would tend to produce the strongest charge interaction at their pKa where the relative concentration of the salt bridge would be the highest. This corresponds to the pKa of the increase in substrate inhibition. Other potential groups that could be involved are the carboxyl group of the substrate (pKa = 3.3) and Lys-439 on the protein (pKa = 9.7) if their pK values were sufficiently perturbed by the local environment. The average pKa of these groups is close to the pKa of substrate inhibition. Involvement of protonation of the arginine residues at the anion binding site seems unlikely due to the very large perturbation of their normal pKa values (pKa = 12) that would be required. When either Arg-501 or His-447 are mutated to alanine residues, the dual pH optimum and the decrease in Ki are no longer observable. Mutation of Arg-446 and Arg-451 produces a similar result although a slight shoulder is still observed at this point in the pH curve. Because these residues are found on adjacent subunits, the binding of substrate may serve to bridge the adjacent subunits through a hydrogen bond or charge interaction network. The substrate inhibition would be more pronounced at lower pH due to the increased formation of salt bridges between the substrate and the residues at the anion binding site, as discussed above. These salt bridges would be expected to be stronger than non-ionic hydrogen bonds. Mutation of Lys-439, on the other hand, not only maintains the dual pH optimum, but actually increases its range from pH 5-7 to 5-8. Consistent with this, the range over which the Ki decreases (1/Ki increases) for this mutant is also increased by the same extent. Furthermore, the mutation K439A, as well as R446A, changes the nature of the substrate inhibition from complete inhibition to partial inhibition, thus defining their role in contributing to the extent of inhibition. H447A and R501A mutants still exhibit substrate inhibition between pH 5 and 7 comparable in magnitude to that seen above pH 7 for the native enzyme. On the other hand, the triple mutant, R501A,R451A,K439A, which eliminates all of the residues from one subunit, displays a nearly complete loss of substrate inhibition at all pH values. Although the kinetic data are consistent with classical uncompetitive substrate inhibition, where the second substrate (HPAP) binds to the active site prior to release of the product of the other substrate (NAD), the mutagenesis data strongly support the involvement of the anion binding site in the substrate inhibition mechanism. This is particularly apparent with the almost complete loss of substrate inhibition seen with the triple mutant. This, along with the observation that substrate inhibition has only been seen in those PGDH enzymes containing intervening domains, provides strong support for a mechanism of substrate inhibition caused by substrate binding at a second site away from the active site. The internal pH of the M. tuberculosis bacteria is not well characterized. If the cytosolic pH of actively growing M. tuberculosis is close to neutrality, as one might expect, the observed increase in Ki at lower pH may not be physiologically relevant to the actively growing bacteria. However, this phenomenon may be relevant to the persistent phase of the bacteria. After the initial infection of macrophages in the lung, the immune response of the host develops granulomas or “tubercles” around the infection resulting in a latent, persistent stage of infection. Phagosomes containing viable M. tuberculosis equilibrate to a pH of ∼6.2 (14Russell D.G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 15Honer zu Bentrup K. Kim D.G. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) that causes them to be retained within the endosomal pathway and isolates the bacterium from the degradative environment of the lysosome. This is within the optimum pH range of 5.7-6.2 of the pH-dependent increase in substrate inhibition reported here for M. tuberculosis PGDH. This coincidence suggests that there may be some connection between the persistent state of M. tuberculosis infection and a need to restrict the activity of this metabolic enzyme. However, this hypothesis would depend on whether or not the cytosolic pH of the bacteria assumes the pH of its environment in the tubercule. Like E. coli PGDH, M. tuberculosis PGDH is feedback regulated by l-serine, the immediate end product of its pathway. These studies support an additional allosteric mechanism of inhibition of PGDH activity through interaction of substrate with the anion binding site of the enzyme. This has interesting mechanistic implications for the regulation of enzyme activity and for the function of the unique intervening domain found in d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from M. tuberculosis and perhaps other species. The anion binding site also provides a potential new target for drug development. We thank Dr. James C. Sacchettini and Dr. Paul Cook for helpful comments."

The first step, i.e. the reductase step that is not rate-limiting, leads in both cases to the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate and release of 1 mol of Met per mol of Msr. Recently, the role of invariant amino acids of the MsrA domain of the PilB protein of Neisseria meningitidis involved in the chemical catalysis of the reductase step was investigated by comparing the kinetic properties of the wild type to those of several mutated MsrAs (20Antoine M. Kim S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Antoine M. Kim A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39062-39070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A scenario of the reductase step was thus proposed in which the substrate binds to the active site with its sulfoxide function largely polarized via interactions with invariant amino acids, the role of which is to stabilize the transition state of the sulfurane type. In this scenario, the stabilization of the thiolate form of the catalytic Cys is proposed to be substrate-assisted by the positive charge borne by the sulfur of a sulfoxide. This scenario implies a transfer of the hydrogen of the catalytic Cys to the oxygen of the sulfoxide function via an acid-base catalyst, which is likely to be a Glu residue. In parallel with this study, recent work was also done to characterize the amino acids involved in MetSO recognition (22Gand A. Kim M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20484-20491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In particular, the hydrophobic pocket composed of the side chains of a Trp and a Phe residue was shown to be essential in positioning the substrate for efficient catalysis of the reductase step via van der Waals interactions with the ε-methyl group of the substrate.In contrast, no information is available on the nature of the amino acids and how they operate in catalysis of the reductase step and on the structural factors involved in recognition of the substrate in MsrB. Only the three-dimensional structure of the MsrB domain of the PilB protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which differs from that of the N. meningitidis MsrB domain by only two amino acids, has been determined by x-ray so far (23Lowther W.T. Kim H. Etienne F. Brot N. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 348-352PubMed Google Scholar). One of the MsrB domains in the asymmetric unit has a cacodylate molecule bound. This cacodylate molecule is a good mimic of a MetSO-bound active site, which is surface-exposed. As shown in Fig. 1, methyls (designated A and B) represent the ε-methyl and the γ-methylene of MetSO, respectively, whereas the A atom and one of the oxygen atoms mimic the sulfur and the oxygen of the sulfoxide function, respectively. The methyl groups of cacodylate are located in a cavity described to be formed by the side chains of Cys-117 5In this paper, N. meningitidis MsrB amino acid numbering is based on the E. coli MsrB sequence devoid of the N-terminal Met.5In this paper, N. meningitidis MsrB amino acid numbering is based on the E. coli MsrB sequence devoid of the N-terminal Met. and Trp-65, whereas the oxygen atom that mimics the oxygen of the sulfoxide interacts through a hydrogen-bonding network with His-103 and with Thr-26, His-100, and Asn-119 but in this case via a water molecule. Finally, inspection of the x-ray structure shows a Cys-117, Arg-116, Asp-107 triad that was postulated to activate the catalytic Cys-117 (23Lowther W.T. Kim H. Etienne F. Brot N. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 348-352PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, in view of the structural information, all these residues of the MsrB domain of the N. meningitidis PilB were substituted. The kinetic parameters were determined for all mutated MsrBs and compared with those of the wild type. The pH dependence of the rate constant of the reductase step of H103N and R116L MsrBs was also determined and compared with that of the wild type. Two major results of this study are as follows: 1) the catalytic active form of MsrB in the reductase step is the Cys-117-/His-103+ with pKapp values of 6.7 and 8.3, respectively; 2) activation of Cys-117 does not involve Arg-116 and Asp-107 as postulated previously but is rather substrate-assisted via the polarized form of the sulfoxide function of the substrate. Taking into account all the results, a scenario for the catalysis is proposed in comparison with that of MsrA and is discussed in terms of evolution not only for catalysis but also for substrate recognition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis, Production, and Purification of Enzymes—The Escherichia coli BE002 strain (MG1655 msrA::specΩ, msrB::α3kan) was used for all N. meningitidis MsrB productions, transformed with the plasmidic construction pSKPILBMsrB containing only the coding sequence of msrB under the lac promoter (17Olry A.

The BE002 strain was kindly provided by Dr. F. Barras. Its use prevented expression of endogenous wild-type MsrA and MsrB from E. coli, and thus all preparations were devoid of contaminating activity by the Msrs from E. coli. Site-directed mutageneses were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).Purification of the wild-type MsrB was performed as described previously (17Olry A. Kim S.

In the case of mutated MsrBs, the enzymes were produced as a nonsoluble form. Pellets obtained after sonication and centrifugation were resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing 20 mm dithiothreitol and 6 m urea, and then dialyzed twice against buffer A containing 3 and 0 m urea, successively. The solution was then applied successively onto an ACA 54 resin, a Q-Sepharose column, and a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously for the wild type (17Olry A. Kim S.

The molecular concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using extinction coefficient of 17,330 m-1·cm-1 at 280 nm for wild-type and mutated MsrBs except for W65A and W65F MsrBs for which an extinction coefficient of 11,580 m-1cm-1 was used. Trx1 and Trx reductase from E. coli were prepared following experimental procedures described previously (24Mulrooney S.B.

Kinetic reactions were performed at 25 °C, under pseudo-first-order conditions at a constant ionic strength of 0.15 m over the pH range 7.25-9.5 with polybuffer B (120 mm Tris, 30 mm imidazole, 30 mm acetic acid). One syringe was filled with wild-type or Cys to Ser mutated MsrBs, and the other was filled with 2-PDS. MsrB and 2-PDS concentrations after mixing were 10 and 310 μm, respectively. Release of pyridine-2-thione was followed at 343 nm using an extinction coefficient of 8080 m-1·cm-1.The pseudo-first-order rate constant kobs was determined at each pH by fitting the absorbance (A) at 343 nm versus time (t) to monoexponential Equation 1, where a is the burst amplitude and c is the end point. A=a(1−e−kobst)+C The second-order rate constant k2 was calculated by dividing the kobs value by the concentration of 2-PDS. k2 versus pH profiles fitted to Equation 2 for one-pKa profiles, in which k2(max) represents the second rate constant for the thiolate form. k2=k2(max)1+10(pKa−pH) Kinetics in the Presence of the Trx Recycling System—Kinetics in the presence of the Trx recycling system were carried out with 400 mm Ac-l-Met-(RS)-SO-NHMe (AcMetSONHMe) as a substrate and 100 μm E. coli Trx1 as a reductant in the presence of the Trx recycling system (1.28 μm E. coli Trx reductase and 0.3 mm NADPH), as described previously (17Olry A.

AcMet-SONHMe was prepared from Ac-l-Met-OMe (Bachem) as described previously (26Olry A. Kim S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Purity of AcMetSONHMe was assessed by proton NMR analysis.Kinetics of the First Step in the Absence of Reductant by Single Turnover Fluorescence Experiments at pH 8—Kinetics of the fluorescence decrease of Trp-65 associated with the formation of the disulfide bond were measured for T26A, H100A, H100N, D107A, R116L, and N119A MsrBs at 25 °C in buffer A on an SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics) adjusted for fluorescence measurements, as described previously (26Olry A. Kim S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was set at 291 nm, and the emitted light was collected above 320 nm, using a cutoff filter. One syringe contained mutated MsrB in buffer A (10 μm final concentration after mixing), and the other one contained AcMetSONHMe at various concentrations in buffer A (10-600 mm, final concentration). An average of six runs was recorded at each substrate concentration. Rate constants, kobs, were obtained by fitting fluorescence traces with the monoexponential equation (Equation 3), in which c represents the end point, and a represents the amplitude of the fluorescence decrease. y=ae−kobst+c When saturation is obtained as it is in wild-type, T26A, H100A, H100N, D107A, and R116L MsrBs, data were fit to Equation 4 using least squares analysis to determine kobs max and KS for AcMetSONHMe, where S represents the AcMet-SONHMe concentration, and KS represents the apparent affinity constant for the substrate. kobs=kobs(max)×SKS+S For H103N and H103A MsrBs, kinetics of the slow fluorescence decrease were measured at 25 °C in buffer A on an flx spectrofluorometer (SAFAS). The excitation wavelength was set at 291 nm, and the emitted light followed at 340 nm. The assay mixture contained 10 μm of enzyme in buffer A with various concentrations of AcMetSONHMe (10-300 mm). Data were then treated using the same procedure as described above to obtain kobs max and KS values.To determine the pseudo-second-order constant (k2) values, subsaturating concentrations of AcMetSONHMe were used, from 0.1 to 2 mm for wild-type, T26A, H100A, H100N, D107A, R116L, and N119A MsrBs and from 0.1 to 1 mm for H103A and H103N MsrBs. Kinetics of the rapid fluorescence decrease were measured at 25 °C in buffer A with a stopped-flow apparatus for wild-type, D107A, and R116L MsrBs. The kinetics of the slow fluorescence decrease were measured on an flx spectrofluorometer (SAFAS) at 25 °C in buffer A for T26A, H100A, H100N, H103A, H103N, and N119A MsrBs. The slope (k2) of the rate constants (kobs) plotted against substrate concentration was obtained by linear fitting. pH Dependence of the Reductase Step Rate Constant for Wild-type and H103N MsrBs—Kinetics of the first step were recorded by single turnover fluorescence experiments in the absence of reductant as described above. Determination of kobs max and KS values for AcMetSONHMe as a function of pH was carried out using the same procedure as described above, but replacing buffer A with polybuffer B. kobs max values were plotted against pH and fit for the wild type to Equation 5, derived from a two-pKa model for a bell-shaped curve, and for H103N MsrB to Equation 6, derived from a single pKa model for a monosigmoidal increasing curve.In Equation 5, pKa1 and pKa2 represent the pKapp values governing the acid and the basic limb, respectively, and k′ and k″ represent the pH-independent rate constants of the mono-deprotonated and double deprotonated forms of enzyme, respectively. kmax=k′×10−pH−pKa1+k′′×10−pKa1−pKa210−pKa1−pKa2+10−pH−pKa1+10−2pH In Equation 6, pKa represents the pKapp, and k′ represents the maximum pH-independent rate constant of the deprotonated form of enzyme. kmax=k′1+10pKa−pH Determination of the Rate of Ac-l-Met-NHMe (AcMetNHMe) Formation by Single Turnover Quenched-flow Experiments at pH 8 for W65A and W65F MsrBs—In the case of W65F MsrB, quenched-flow measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics) fitted for the double-mixing mode and adapted to recover the quenched samples as described previously (20Antoine M.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Equal volumes (60 μl) of a solution containing 200 μm W65F MsrB were mixed with various concentrations of AcMetSONHMe in buffer A (from 50 to 400 mm, final concentration) and introduced in the aging loop. The mixtures were allowed to react for 40-5000 ms and quenched with 2% trifluoroacetic acid, and samples were collected in a 200-μl loop. At each aging time, four data runs were collected, and the corresponding quenched samples were pooled in a volume of 700 μl. Trifluoroacetic acid (100%, 50 μl) was subsequently added to 200 μl of the quenched samples to obtain precipitated protein, and in parallel, quenched samples not treated with 100% trifluoroacetic acid were used to determine the protein concentration from absorbance readings at 280 nm. In the case of W65A MsrB, quenching was carried out by manual addition of trifluoroacetic acid (100%, 50 μl) in 200 μl of mixture containing 200 μm of enzyme and 200-800 mm of AcMetSONHMe in buffer A at different time intervals (30-3600 s).Samples treated with acetic acid were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. AcMetNHMe quantification in the resulting supernatant was carried out by C18 reverse phase chromatography as described previously (20Antoine M. Kim S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Olry A. Kim S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Data were plotted as moles of AcMetNHMe formed per mol of MsrBs as a function of time (t). The rate of AcMetNHMe formation was determined by fitting the curve to the monoexponential Equation 7 in which a represents the fraction of AcMetNHMe formed per mol of MsrB, and kobs is the rate constant. y=a(1−e−kobst) For W65F MsrB, kobs versus AcMeSONHMe concentration profile was fit to Equation 4 using least squares analysis to determine kobs max and KS for AcMetSONHMe. For W65A MsrB, the pseudo-second-order rate constant (k2) was obtained from the slope of rate constant (kobs) plotted against substrate concentration by linear fitting.RESULTSRationale for the Kinetic Characterization of the Mutated MsrBs with AcMetSONHMe as Substrate—The rate-limiting step of wild-type MsrB is associated with the Trx-recycling process (26Olry A. Kim S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, to interpret the consequences on the kinetics of the reductase step of the mutated MsrBs, it was necessary to attain the rate of this step. This was done by following the decrease of the Trp-65 fluorescence emission signal intensity upon going from the reduced form to the disulfide oxidized form as described recently for the wild type (26Olry A. Kim S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this context, we assumed that the reductase step for all mutated MsrBs remain rate-determining in the process leading to the formation of the MsrB disulfide bond as demonstrated for the wild type (26Olry A. Kim S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This was verified for H100A, H100N, H103A, and H103N MsrBs by measuring directly the rate of formation of AcMetNHMe. In all cases, the rate of formation of AcMetNHMe was similar to that determined by following the decrease of the Trp-65 fluorescence intensity in the presence of 150 mm of Met-(RS)-SO (data not shown). As shown below, two types of mutated MsrBs were observed in terms of rate-limiting step as follows: those for which the rate-limiting step remains associated with the Trx-recycling process and those whose rate-limiting step precedes the Trx-recycling process. To demonstrate this, the rate of decrease in NADPH followed at 340 nm was determined under saturating concentration of Trx-TrxR-NADPH in a coupled enzymatic system and compared with that of the decrease of the Trp-65 fluorescence intensity under the same conditions of pH (i.e. 8) and concentration of AcMetSONHMe.For all mutated MsrBs, k2 values of the reductase step that represent the kobs max/KS values were determined under subsaturating concentrations of AcMetSONHMe. When saturating kinetics of AcMetSONHMe was observed, KS and kobs max values were determined, and k2 values were also calculated directly from these values.In the case of mutated MsrBs at position 65, in the absence of the fluorescent Trp-65 probe, the rate of the reductase step was determined by following the rate of formation of AcMetNHMe under single turnover conditions, i.e. in the absence of reductant. This was done at several concentrations of AcMetSONHMe for W65A and W65F MsrBs (see Fig. 4C). In all cases, formation of ∼0.8-0.9 mol of AcMetNHMe per mol of mutated MsrB was observed for all the substrate concentrations used.FIGURE 4Determination of the catalytic parameters of the reductase step of wild-type, H103A, H103N (A), H100A, H100N, T26A, N119A (B), W65A and W65F MsrBs (C). Kinetics of the reductase step were determined in buffer A at pH 8.0 under single turnover conditions by fluorescence approach for T26A, H100A, H100N, H103A, H103N, and N119A MsrBs, and by quenched-flow experiments for W65A and W65F MsrBs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The final concentration of wild-type and mutated MsrBs was 10 μm for fluorescence experiments and 150 μm for quenched-flow experiments and the AcMetSONHMe concentration varied in function of the mutated MsrB tested. Experimental kobs data were fit for wild-type (▴, A), H103A (▪, A), H103N (•, A), H100A (•, B), H100N (▾, B), T26A (▪, B), N119A (▴, B), and W65F (•, C) MsrBs to Equation 4, which gave kobs max and KS values, and for W65A (▪, C) MsrB to a linear equation which gave k2 value. The catalytic parameters of wild-type and mutated MsrBs are summarized in Table 1, except for N119A MsrB. Indeed for this latter mutated MsrB, the kobs max and KS values obtained (1.8 ± 0.3 s-1 and 1200 ± 250 mm, respectively) could only be taken as estimated due to the fact that substrate saturating concentration was not reached at 400 mm of substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The kinetic experiments were performed with AcMet-SONHMe because of the better affinity of MsrB for this substrate compared with MetSO (26Olry A. Kim S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of the various substitutions made could be more easily quantified in terms of KS and kobs max values and not only in terms of k2 values. This proved particularly important in obtaining the pH dependence of kobs max of the reductase step for wild-type, R116L, and H103N MsrBs. Indeed, to interpret the pH profile in terms of contribution of ionizable groups within the Michaelis complex, the concentration of AcMetSONHMe has to be saturating over the pH range investigated.Determination of the pKapp Value of the Catalytic Cys-117 in the Reduced Form of MsrB—The method consisted of determining the second-order rate constant of the reaction with the Cys-specific reactivity probe 2-PDS as a function of pH, by following the formation of pyridine-2-thione at the λmax of 343 nm. Under native conditions, the reaction obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics with formation of 2 mol of pyridine-2-thione per mol of MsrB. This result is in accord with the presence of the catalytic Cys-117 and the recycling Cys-63 in N. meningitidis MsrB. Under all conditions of pH, stopped-flow traces fitted to monoexponential Equation 1, with amplitude corresponding to the release of 2 mol of pyridine-2-thione. The pH-k2 profile fitted to monosigmoidal Equation 2 resulting in a pKapp value higher than 9.3 and a k2(max) value higher than 1.5 × 104 m-1·s-1 (Fig. 2). The fact that no release of pyridine-2-thione was observed when 10 mm dithiothreitol was added showed formation of the disulfide-oxidized MsrB and not the thiopyridine adduct on each Cys (data not shown). Therefore, the pKapp value may be assigned to either the catalytic Cys-117, the recycling Cys-63, or to both Cys-63/Cys-117. This is dependent on the Cys that is first titrated by 2-PDS and the rate-limiting step in formation of the disulfide bond. Thus, to attain the pKapp of Cys-117, reactions of 2-PDS with C117S and C63S MsrBs were also carried out. Both mutated MsrBs behaved similarly to the wild-type MsrB, except that only 1 mol of pyridine-2-thione/mol of enzyme was released (curves not shown). Both pH-k2 profiles were of monosigmoidal type with no saturation at high pH, resulting in the estimation ofapKapp and k2(max) values higher than 9.3 and 2.1 × 104 m-1·s-1 and 9.0 and 0.8 × 103 m-1·s-1 for C63S and C117S MsrBs, respectively (Fig. 2). Altogether, the data favor a pKapp value of Cys-117 close to 9.3.FIGURE 2PH dependence of the second-order rate constant k2 for the reaction of the thiol groups of wild-type, C63S, and C117S MsrBs with 2-PDS.

Human PMP70 consists of 659 amino acid residues and has six putative transmembrane domains (TMDs). PMP70 is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and targeted posttranslationally to peroxisomes by an unidentified peroxisomal membrane protein targeting signal (mPTS). In this study, to examine the mPTS within PMP70 precisely, we expressed various COOH-terminally or NH2-terminally deleted constructs of PMP70 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in Chinese hamster ovary cells and determined their intracellular localization by immunofluorescence. In the COOH-terminally truncated PMP70, PMP70(AA.1-144)-GFP, including TMD1 and TMD2 of PMP70, was still localized to peroxisomes. However, by further removal of TMD2, PMP70(AA.1-124)-GFP lost the targeting ability, and PMP70(TMD2)-GFP did not target to peroxisomes by itself. The substitution of TMD2 in PMP70(AA.1-144)-GFP for TMD4 or TMD6 did not affect the peroxisomal localization, suggesting that PMP70(AA.1-124) contains the mPTS and an additional TMD is required for the insertion into the peroxisomal membrane. In the NH2-terminal 124-amino acid region, PMP70 possesses hydrophobic segments in the region adjacent to TMD1. By the disruption of these hydrophobic motifs by the mutation of L21Q/L22Q/L23Q or I70N/L71Q, PMP70(AA.1-144)-GFP lost targeting efficiency.

Peroxisomes are organelles surrounded by a single membrane, and they are found in almost all eukaryotic cells. Peroxisomes have many important metabolic functions, including β-oxidation of fatty acids, especially very long-chain fatty acids, and synthesis of ether phospholipids (1Van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Therefore, a defect in the biogenesis and function of the organelle causes severe metabolic disease, such as Zellweger syndrome (2Lazarow P.B. Moser H.W. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc, New York1994: 2287-2324Google Scholar, 3Brosius U. Gärtner J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1058-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Fujiki Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes are thought to be formed by the division of pre-existing peroxisomes after the import of newly synthesized proteins (5Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized on cytosolic polysomes, and posttranslationally targeted to the peroxisomes (5Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The import of peroxisomal matrix proteins is gradually becoming well understood. Most matrix proteins are targeted to the peroxisomes by one of two types of a peroxisome targeting signal (PTS). 2The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisome targeting signal; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; GFP, green fluorescence protein; mPTS, peroxisomal membrane protein targeting signal; PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; PMP70, 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein; TMD, transmembrane domain; PCC, Peasonŉs correlation coefficient; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. 2The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisome targeting signal; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; GFP, green fluorescence protein; mPTS, peroxisomal membrane protein targeting signal; PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; PMP70, 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein; TMD, transmembrane domain; PCC, Peasonŉs correlation coefficient; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. PTS1 is a COOH-terminal tripeptide composed of SKL or a conserved sequence and is found in the majority of matrix proteins (6Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). PTS2 is a cleavable NH2-terminal nonapeptide with the consensus motif (R/K)(L/V/I)X5(H/Q)(L/A) and is found in a few matrix proteins (7Osumi T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Yokota S. Miura S. Fujiki Y.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). PTS1 and PTS2 are recognized by the specific receptors, Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively (9McCollum D. Monosov E. Subramani S. J.

These receptors target the cargo proteins from the cytosol to the docking complex on the peroxisomal membrane (11Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H.

Peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) do not contain a recognizable PTS1 or PTS2 sequence, and they are still imported even in the mutants that are defective for the import of matrix proteins, indicating that the targeting process of PMPs is not dependent on the components of the pathway for matrix protein targeting (15Subramani S.

These results argue against the role of Pex19p as an import receptor for PMPs and assign an alternative, chaperone function for Pex19p that stabilizes newly synthesized PMPs in the targeting process. These discrepancies remain to be resolved, and the precise function of Pex19p is still a matter of debate. The PTS of PMPs, termed mPTS, has yet to be identified. The mPTS was first defined in Candida boidinii PMP47 (34McCammon M.T. McNew J.A. Willy P.J. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Dyer et al.

Although no consensus primary amino acid sequences or common structural properties have been delineated, nearly all PMP fragments that can target to peroxisomes contain a cluster of basic amino acids in conjugation with at least one TMD. Interestingly, several PMPs have been shown to contain multiple nonoverlapping mPTSs (38Brosius U. Dehmel T. Gärtner J. J. Biol.

However, it is still unclear whether these multiple mPTSs reflect the specific properties of PMP targeting. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of peroxisome membrane synthesis and especially the import of human PMPs, we characterized the regions responsible for the targeting of PMP70. PMP70 is one of the major components of mam-malian peroxisomal membranes and belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily (42Kamijo K. Taketani S. Yokota S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J.

It consists of 659 amino acid residues, and the putative topology of PMP70 predicts six transmembrane segments with the NH2 and COOH termini facing the cytoplasm (44Shani N. Valle D.

We describe that PMP70 possesses two distinct nonoverlapping targeting signals; one is in PMP70(AA.1-124), and the other is in PMP70(AA.264-375). Furthermore, we found that the hydrophobic segments not containing the positively charged cluster, residing just adjacent to the first TMD of both targeting elements, were important for targeting but not for the binding of Pex19p.

Different NH2- or COOH-terminal truncation mutants of PMP70 were generated by PCR using a full-length human PMP70 cDNA (47Kamijo K. Kamijo N. Ueno I. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Biochim. Biophys.

PCR-generated fragments with XhoI or PstI and BamHI restriction sites were subcloned in frame into a pEGFP-N1 expression vector. To construct NH2-terminal GFP fusion proteins, NH2- or COOH-terminally truncated cDNA fragments of PMP70 were amplified from each PMP70-GFP expression vector encoding the corresponding truncated cDNA fragment of PMP70 using the forward primer 5′-AAATGGGCGGTAGGCGTGT-3′, which annealed to a site upstream of the unique PstI site in pEGFP-N1, or 5′-CTCGAGATGGCGGCCTTCAGCAAG-3′, which introduced an XhoI site at the amino terminus, and the reverse primer 5′-CGCTGAACTTGTGGCCGTTTA-3′, which annealed to a site downstream of the unique BamHI site in pEGFP-N1. PCR-generated fragments with PstI or XhoI and BamHI restriction sites were subcloned in frame into a pEGFP-C3 expression vector.

All transfections were performed using an Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min in 5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for indirect immunofluorescence. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Immunostaining was performed by essentially the same procedure as described in Ref. 7Osumi T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Yokota S. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Hijikata M. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar. The fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used in this study were a rabbit antibody against the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of rat PMP70 (1:200) and a rabbit antibody against rat catalase (1:200). Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used to label the first antibody. The cells were mounted in 90% glycerol in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the samples were examined by confocal microscopy (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jene, Germany). To analyze the efficiency of peroxisomal localization, samples were examined by TCS-SP5 software (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The per pixel scatter diagrams were generated using the built in software of the Leica TCS-SP5. Peasonŉs correlation coefficient (PCC) and the peroxisome colocalization rate were employed to evaluate colocalization. PCC is one of the standard measures to assess the relationship between fluorescence intensities (48Graf S.A. Haigh S.E. Corson E.D. Shirihai O.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42954-42963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Its value ranges between -1.0 and 1.0, where -1.0 represents no overlap and 1.0 represents complete colocalization. The peroxisome colocalization rate was expressed as a ratio of colocalization area showing certain red pixel intensity of peroxisomal marker and certain green pixel intensity of each GFP fusion protein against the area foreground. In a typical experiment, 20 randomly chosen areas containing some of the cells expressing GFP fusion protein were examined for each culture, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Purification of His-Pex19p—Purification of the NH2-terminal His6-tagged human Pex19p (His-Pex19p) was performed by essentially the same procedure as described in Ref. 27Kashiwayama Y. Asahina K. Shibata H. Morita M. Muntau A.C. Roscher A.A. Wanders R.J.A. Shimozawa N. Sakaguchi M. Kato H. Imanaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. M15 pREP4 Escherichia coli cells (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) harboring pQE30/PEX19 were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. At a cell density of 0.5 (A600), protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min, resuspended in 35 ml of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and disrupted 20 times for 20 s in an ice bath by an Astrason XL-2020 ultrasonic processor (Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min and the His-Pex19p in the supernatant was immediately applied to 10 ml of TALON Metal affinity resin (Clontech) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After extensive washing, the His-Pex19p was eluted with the lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions containing His-Pex19p were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol and stored at -80 °C. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—The plasmids encoding wild type and mutant PMP70s were transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase, and the synthesized mRNAs were isolated by a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Using the purified mRNA, cell-free translation was performed according to the bilayer method using PROTEIOS™, a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis core kit, according to the manufacturerŉs procedure. In a typical experiment, the synthesized mRNAs were translated for 24 h at 26 °C in a 300-μl wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine in the presence of 100 μg of His-Pex19p. After translation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for co-immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation—Translation products (50 μl) were pre-cleaned with an appropriate amount of protein G-agarose in 200 μl of the binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol). After this step, the supernatant was removed and incubated with protein G-agarose beads saturated with anti-His G antibody. After incubation of the suspensions for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 250 μl of the binding buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on a 7-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel. The gels were dried, and the radio-activity of the band corresponding to PMP70 was quantified by a Fuji BAS 5000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Other Methods—Protein was assayed as described previously (43Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed with primary antibodies and a second antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Antigen-antibody complex was visualized with ECL+Plus Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Localization of COOH-terminal Truncated PMP70—To determine the mPTS of PMP70, we first expressed various COOH-terminal deletion constructs of PMP70 fused with GFP in CHO cells and examined their intracellular localization by immunofluorescence. We have recently shown that PMP70(AA.1-659)-GFP and PMP70(AA.1-375)-GFP, which possess whole NH2-terminal transmembrane segments, were localized to peroxisomes and that PMP70(AA.1-144)-GFP was still targeted to peroxisomes, indicating that PMP70 possesses an mPTS in the NH2-terminal 144-amino acid region (27Kashiwayama Y.

Therefore, we expressed various COOH-terminal deletion constructs of PMP70 in fusion with the COOH terminus of GFP (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, GFP-PMP70(AA.1-375) exh"
https://openalex.org/W2003841275,"The rsmA gene of Streptomyces coelicolor lies directly upstream of the gene encoding the group 3 sigma factor σM. The RsmA protein is a putative member of the HATPase_c family of anti-sigma factors but is unusual in that it contains seven cysteine residues. Bacterial two-hybrid studies demonstrate that it interacts specifically with σM, and in vitro studies of the purified proteins by native PAGE and transcription assays confirmed that they form a complex. Characterization of RsmA revealed that it binds ATP and that, as isolated, it contains significant quantities of iron and inorganic sulfide, in equal proportion, with spectroscopic properties characteristic of a [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing protein. Importantly, the interaction between RsmA and σM is dependent on the presence of the iron-sulfur cluster. We propose a model in which RsmA regulates the activity of σM. Loss of the cluster, in response to an as yet unidentified signal, activates σM by abolishing its interaction with the anti-sigma factor. This represents a major extension of the functional diversity of iron-sulfur cluster proteins.

Loss of the cluster, in response to an as yet unidentified signal, activates σM by abolishing its interaction with the anti-sigma factor. This represents a major extension of the functional diversity of iron-sulfur cluster proteins. Iron-sulfur proteins constitute a ubiquitous and hugely functionally diverse family of proteins that contain clusters of iron atoms bridged by acid-labile sulfides. Protein cysteine residue side chains normally complete the tetrahedral coordination of each iron. The capacity to delocalize electrons over both iron and sulfur ions makes iron-sulfur clusters ideally suited to roles in electron transfer pathways such as the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer chains and in nitrogen fixation. They are also involved in substrate binding and activation (e.g. in dehydratases such as aconitase and the radical S-adenosylmethionine family of enzymes), sulfur donation (e.g. biotin synthase), and the regulation of enzyme activity (e.g. phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (see Ref. 1Johnson D.C. Kim D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar and references therein). In addition to these roles, there are also several well characterized examples of iron-sulfur clusters involved in regulation of gene expression in bacteria. SoxR, which contains a redox-active [2Fe-2S] cluster (2Hidalgo E. Kim J.M.J. Bradley T.M. Walsh C.T. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20908-20914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), responds to oxidative stress and activates SoxS, another transcription factor that, in turn, activates the transcription of the target genes (3Wu J. Kim B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nunoshiba T. Kim E. Amabile Cuevas C.F. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). FNR is a CRP-like transcription regulator that controls the expression of genes involved in the adaptation to anoxia (5Shaw D.J. Kim D.W. Guest J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The sensory domain (N terminus) binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster that degrades in the presence of O2 to a [2Fe-2S] cluster via a two-step mechanism involving a [3Fe-4S] cluster intermediate (6Crack J.C. Kim J. Cheesman M.R. Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), with a concomitant loss of DNA-binding activity (7Green J. Kim J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 113: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Khoroshilova N. Kim C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). IscR, a transcription regulator involved in iron-cluster synthesis, requires the presence of a [2Fe-2S] cluster for its activity (9Schwartz C.J. Kim J.L. Patschkowski T. Luther C. Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation also occurs through the composition of RNA polymerase holoenzyme (10Burgess R.R. Kim A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K.F. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In addition to the principle sigma factor, essential for housekeeping functions, many bacteria contain several alternative sigma factors that are required for cellular responses to various stress signals. These alternative sigma factors are sometimes regulated via specific inhibitor proteins, called anti-sigma factors (11Helmann J.D. Cur. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These proteins respond to a relevant internal signal resulting from a stress condition, which, by a variety of mechanisms, results in dissociation of the bound sigma factor, enabling its interaction with RNA polymerase. Several mechanisms have been characterized to date, involving secretion of the anti-sigma factor out of the cell (as in FlgM (12Hughes K.T. Kim K.L. Semon M.J. Karlinsey J.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1277-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar)), proteolytic degradation of the anti-sigma factor (as in Escherichia coli RseA (13Walsh N.P. Kim B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar)), partner switching, which necessitates sequestration of the anti-sigma factor by an anti-anti-sigma factor (as in SpoIIAB/SpoIIAA and RsbW/RsbV (14Hughes K.T. Kim K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 231-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar)), or inactivation of the anti-sigma factor through stress-induced oxidation. The first example of the latter mechanism was demonstrated for Streptomyces coelicolor RsrA, the archetypal member of a growing family of zinc-containing anti-sigma factors (15Kang J.G. Kim M.S.B. Seok Y.J. Hahn M.Y. Bae J.B. Hahn J.S. Kleanthous C. Buttner M.J. Roe J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4292-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The family is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved HX3CXXC motif implicated in Zn2+ coordination (16Zdanowski K. Kim P. Jakimowicz P. O'Hara L. Buttner M.J. Paget M.S.B. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8294-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Under oxidative stress conditions, the Zn2+ ion is expelled, with concomitant formation of a disulfide bond (17Li W. Kim A.R. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Paget M.S.B. Kleanthous C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rhodobacter sphaeroides ChrR, another member of the zinc-containing anti-sigma factor family, responds to singlet oxygen generated as a by-product of photosynthesis (18Anthony J.R. Kim K.L. Donohue T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6502-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which this occurs is not yet clear. Here we report studies of a putative member of the HATPase_c anti-sigma factor family from S. coelicolor. We demonstrate, using bacterial two-hybrid studies, native PAGE and in vitro transcription that the protein interacts specifically with the group 3 sigma factor σM, which has been shown to be a part of the regulatory cascade that is initiated in response to osmotic shock, under the control of σB (19Lee E.-J. Kim N. Kim H.-S. Park J.-H. Cha C.-J. Kao C.M. Roe J.-H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1252-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The anti-sigma factor, subsequently referred to as RsmA, contains, upon isolation, iron and inorganic sulfide with spectral properties characteristic of a [2Fe-2S] cluster. We show that the presence of the cluster modulates the interaction between RsmA and σM, leading to a model in which the cluster plays a central role in controlling the switch between active and inactive forms of RsmA. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—Media and culture conditions for E. coli were as described previously (20Sambrook J. Kim E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). For plasmid selection in E. coli LB broth was supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic at its working concentration: kanamycin (25 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). The β-galactosidase assay was carried out in E. coli cya strain DHM1 (F- glnV44 (AS) recA1 endA gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 spoT1 rfbD1 cya-854) (21Dautin N. Kim G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7060-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DNA Manipulation—Overexpression vectors were generated by using the amplified open reading frame of sigM and rsmA from S. coelicolor cosmid 5F8. NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites were engineered into the 5′- and 3′-primers, sigMX1 and sigMX2 and rsmAX1 and rsmAX2 (for a list of primers, see supplemental Table S1), respectively, to maintain unidirectional cloning. The PCR product was blunt-ended and cloned into pUC18, generating pAG10 (σM) and pAG11 (RsmA), respectively, and the inserts were verified by sequencing. NdeI/EcoRI fragments (containing the sigM and rsmA genes, respectively) were then ligated into pET28a (Novagen). The resulting plasmids, pAG110 (σM) and pAG111 (RsmA), were introduced into E. coli BL21λDE3/pLysS (22Studier F.W. Kim B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4839) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid expression plasmids were generated by PCR amplification of the genes of interest using primers sigML1 and sigML2 and rsmAL1 and rsmAL2, respectively, and S. coelicolor 5F8 cosmid DNA. EcoRI and PstI restriction sites introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, were subsequently used for cloning into pKT25 and pUT18 (23Karimova G. Kim C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The resulting vectors expressed hybrid proteins such that the proteins of interest were fused to the T25 or T18 part of adenylate cyclase, respectively. Overexpression and Purification of σM—Typically 8 × 250 ml LB was inoculated with E. coli BL21λDE3/pLysS containing pAG110. At an A600 nm of 0.6, the cultures were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at 25 °C for 16 h. Subsequent purification was performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 200 μg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, and the pellet, containing σM as inclusion bodies, was twice resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2% sodium deoxycholate and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The washed pellet was solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Following centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was dialyzed against two changes (2 liters) of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol for 6 h. The dialysate was centrifuged to remove any mis-folded protein and further purified by application to a Heparin column (GE Healthcare) followed by elution in a KCl gradient (0-1 m) in the same buffer. σM-containing fractions, which eluted at 800 mm KCl, were pooled and desalted/concentrated using a disposable centrifugation concentrator (20 ml, Vivascience) with a 10-kDa cut off. Overexpression and Purification of RsmA—Typically 8 × 250 ml of LB was inoculated with E. coli BL21λDE3/pLysS containing pAG111. At an A600 nm of 0.6, the cultures were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated with shaking (100 rpm) at 25 °C for 4 h. Cells were lysed, and RsmA inclusion bodies washed as described above for σM. Inclusion bodies were solubilized by incubating for 5 min at 50 °C and 15 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3% (w/v) n-laurylsarcosine, 1 mm DTT. 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; TNP-ATP, trinitrophenoladenosine triphosphate. The solution was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min to remove any non-solubilized protein. The resulting reddish-brown supernatant was applied to a gel-filtration column (PD10, GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, to remove any excess detergent. Eluted protein was stored anaerobically below 4 °C. Apo-RsmA was acquired by prolonged exposure to aerobic conditions (typically 16 h). Protein assays confirmed that little or no protein was lost in the process, whereas iron and sulfide assays on the gel-filtered sample verified that no detectable iron or sulfide remained associated with the protein, and bands characteristic of an iron-sulfur cofactor were absent from the UV-visible spectrum. β-Galactosidase Assay—Assays were performed on chloroform-treated bacterial suspensions using the modified Miller protocol (24Zhang X. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11181-11189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was expressed as Miller units using Equation 1, Miller units=1000×(A420−1.75×A550)T×V×A600 in which T is the reaction time (minutes), and V is the volume (milliliters) of culture used in the assay. Native Gels—Native gels (7% acrylamide) were cast horizontally using a customized assembly in which the upper glass plate had a slit in the middle allowing for a comb to be fitted. Gels were run at 40 mA for the required time at 4 °C in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3. In Vitro Transcription Assay—In vitro transcription reactions were performed as described previously (25Buttner M.J. Kim N.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Primers ctc1 and ctc2 were used to generate a fragment of pCB340, carrying the Bacillus subtilis ctc promoter and coding DNA, which was used as the template in all of the reactions, resulting in a ∼250-nucleotide transcript. Purified σM (37 nm) was incubated with E. coli RNA polymerase (0.1 unit, Epicenter) in the absence or presence of as isolated RsmA (400 nm) and the DNA template, and the reaction was initiated with NTP mix and [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci mmol-1, GE Healthcare). ATP Assay—The ATP content of RsmA was analyzed using a bioluminescence luciferase assay (Biaffin). Briefly, d-luciferin and the thermostable firefly luciferase were mixed in the pro-prietary reaction buffer before mixing in a 1:1 ratio with the unknown RsmA sample (in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to measurement. A calibration curve was constructed by using ATP solutions of known concentration in place of RsmA samples. Luminescence was recorded on a Bio-tek Instrumentals FLx800 microplate fluorescence reader in bioluminescence mode (emission at 560 nm). Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. CD spectra in the near-UV and visible range (300-800 nm) and far-UV range (190-260 nm) were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter interfaced to a PC. CD intensity is expressed as molar ellipticity ([θ]) in units of deg cm2 dmol-1 for the far-UV region and as molar CD extinction coefficient (Δϵ) in units of m-1 cm-1, with reference to the cluster cofactor concentration, for the UV-visible region. Spectra were corrected for intensity due to the buffer. EPR spectra were measured with a X-band spectrometer (Bruker ER200D with an EPS 3220 computer system) fitted with an ESR9 liquid helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Spin intensities of paramagnetic samples were estimated by double integration of EPR spectra using 1.25 mm Cu(II), 10 mm EDTA as the standard. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 luminescence spectrometer with excitation at 408 nm, and slit widths of 5 nm. Fluorescence titrations of RsmA were carried out using a microsyringe (Hamilton) to add sub-stoichiometric quantities of TNP-ATP or ATP. Analysis of the binding of TNP-ATP, which was complicated by the fact that the unbound nucleotide contributed to emission intensity at 560 nm, was achieved using the program Dynafit (Biokin). Competition binding titration experiments were analyzed in terms of Reaction 1, for which the exchange constant expression can be written as in Equation 2. Kex=Kd TNP-ATPKd ATP=[RsmA-ATP][TNP-ATP][RsmA-TNP-ATP][ATP] For each point in the titration, each term of the exchange expression was calculated, and a value for Kex was obtained. An average value of Kex was determined (titration points at the extremities were omitted from the averaging calculation), and Equation 2 used to determine the Kd for ATP binding to RsmA. Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (26Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) using a correction factor of 0.8 for RsmA determined by amino acid analysis and 0.75 for σM determined by the method of Pace (27Pace C.N. Kim F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). The iron content of RsmA was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission and/or by a modified Ferene method (28Crack J.C. Kim J. Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18909-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which gave equivalent results. Labile sulfide was measured as previously described (29Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Two B. subtilis anti-sigma factors, RsbW and SpoIIAB, were used as probes in a BLAST search (30Altschul S.F. Kim T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60177) Google Scholar) against S. coelicolor proteins. The family of anti-sigma factors to which these proteins belong possesses a nucleotide binding domain (called HATPase_c (31Min K.T. Kim C.M. Diederich B. Errington J. Yudkin M.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 735-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar)) that is similar to the ATP binding domain of histidine kinases. Thus, the initial low stringency BLAST search highlighted some two-component histidine kinases. The two families were separated based on differences in size and domain organization. The potential candidates, satisfying the size requirement of ∼250 residues and lacking any other obvious domain structure belonging to the histidine kinase family, were further confirmed by iterative psi-BLAST searches against the available protein data base. Sequence alignments were performed against Bacillus stearothermophilus SpoIIAB using the ClustalW program (32Higgins D. Kim J. Gibson T. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55967) Google Scholar) and manually refined using the conserved motifs (the N-, G1-, G2-, and G3-box) of the GHKL superfamily (33Dutta R. Kim M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Identification of RsmA—Searches of the S. coelicolor proteome revealed 27 putative anti-sigma factors belonging to the RsbW/SpoIIAB-type HATPase_c protein kinase anti-sigma factor family (34Campbell E.A. Kim S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the proteins share little overall primary sequence identity, they each contain, to varying degrees, the conserved motifs of the HATPase_c family, which is itself part of the GHKL superfamily of ATPases (33Dutta R. Kim M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Sco7313 (subsequently referred to as rsmA (regulator of sigma M A) is located immediately upstream of sigM. rsmA encodes a putative soluble protein containing seven cysteine residues, including a CXXC motif that is found as part of iron-sulfur cluster binding motifs, as well as those of thioredoxin-like proteins and Zn2+-binding proteins, and has a high proportion of charged residues. Neither of these are typical characteristics of this anti-sigma factor family. RsmA Contains a [2Fe-2S] Cluster—RsmA was overproduced with an N-terminal His tag in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies using n-laurylsarcosine, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The near-UV-visible absorption spectrum of aerobically purified RsmA contained major bands at 280, 320, and 420 nm, with shoulders present at 460 and 550 nm (Fig. 2A) and was characteristic of that arising from a [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing protein (35Cammack R. Nature. 1980; 286 (442): 442Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). CD spectra of metal cofactors provide a more detailed insight into differences in cluster properties and can be used to distinguish between different iron-sulfur cluster structures. The near-UV-visible CD spectrum of RsmA, as isolated (Fig. 2B), contained negatively signed peaks at 348, 390, 530, and 620 nm, a dominant positive peak at 460 nm, and low intensity positive peaks at 315, 370, 600, and 700 nm. These features resemble those of [2Fe-2S] type clusters (36Jung Y.-S. Kim S. Christiansen J. Dean D.R. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 32402-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37Stephens P.J. Kim G.M. Devlin F.J. Morgan T.V. Stout C.D. Martin A.E. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), in which only minor differences in peak maxima, probably reflecting differences in the local protein environment, are usually found. Protein, iron, and labile sulfide analyses revealed sub-stoichiometric, but near equivalent concentrations of iron and sulfide (iron:sulfide = 1:0.91 ± 0.01). The metal-to-protein ratio varied somewhat from one preparation to another, with an average of ∼0.7:1. Taken together, these data indicate that RsmA contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster and is isolated, on average, as ∼35% holo-protein. This is based on the assumption that each RsmA is capable of binding one cluster, a conclusion supported by gel-filtration experiments showing that the presence of the cluster does not appear to influence the association state of the protein, see supplemental data. As isolated, the iron-sulfur cluster of RsmA is present in an EPR-silent form, consistent with a cluster oxidation state of [2Fe-2S]2+ (diamagnetic, S = 0, not shown). Attempts to reduce RsmA by anaerobic addition of sodium dithionite did not give rise to an EPR signal, consistent with UV-visible spectra, which demonstrated loss of the cluster (but not the protein) upon addition of this reductant (data not shown). Anaerobic treatment of RsmA with a 20-fold excess of the milder reducing agent sodium ascorbate, followed by incubation at ambient temperature, resulted in a low intensity EPR-active species, with g values at ∼2.047, 2.01, and 1.97, which arise from a rhombic S = 1/2 species (Fig. 2C). Simulation of the signal was consistent with this, although the central signal at g = 2.01 was of higher intensity than predicted. Radical species commonly give rise to isotropic signals at this g value, and thus a minor radical species may be present here. However, such signals normally persist up to room temperature; in this case, the signal exhibited homogeneous temperature dependence and was no longer detected above 40 K (not shown). The S = 1/2 species was assigned to a minor component of a [2Fe-2S]+ cluster. Integration versus aCu2+ standard revealed that ∼10% of clusters present were in the reduced, EPR-active state. EPR signals arising from [2Fe-2S]+ clusters exhibit significant variation in symmetry and anisotropy (38Hugo N. Kim J. Gaillard J. Timmis K.N. Jouanneau Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9622-9629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) from the rhombic signals of plant ferredoxins (39Cheng H. Kim B. Reed G.H. Markley J.L.

A usual feature is that the value of gav is <2 (43Gibson J.F. Kim D.O. Thornley J.H. Whatley F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1979; 579: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although there are examples, particularly in the xanthine oxidase family, in which this is not the case (45Caldeira J. Kim V. Asso M. Guigliarelli B. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Bertrand P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, the observed gav value is also >2, indicating that this is an unusual signal for a [2Fe-2S]+ cluster. RsmA Is an Anti-sigma Factor—To characterize an in vivo physical interaction between RsmA and σM, a bacterial two-hybrid system, based on functional complementation of the Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase fragments T25 and T18 (23Karimova G. Kim C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was utilized. DNA fragments encoding the two proteins of interest were cloned into the pKT25 and pUT18 vectors and were co-transformed into E. coli strain DHM1, along with the empty vectors, in all possible pairwise combinations. The efficiency of the interaction was quantitated by measuring β-galactosidase activities in liquid cultures (see “Experimental Procedures”). The vectors expressing RsmA and σM fused to either the T25 or T18 fragment of adenylate cyclase gave a substantial complementation signal when coexpressed together, in both configurations. None of the other combinations gave a significant complementation signal (Fig. 3), consistent with the proposal that RsmA and σM constitute an anti-sigma factor/sigma factor pair. To assess the specificity of the interaction between RsmA and σM, sigB, encoding another S. coelicolor alternative sigma factor from the same family (σB), was also cloned into pKT25 and pUT18 and tested against the RsmA-encoding vectors described above. Although above baseline levels for both configurations, the observed signals did not indicate a significant interaction (Fig. 3), suggesting that RsmA specifically interacts with σM. Interactions between RsmA and σM (also overproduced as a His-tagged protein in E. coli) in vitro were probed by native PAGE. We were unable to resolve both proteins simultaneously using standard vertical electrophoresis; despite a predicted pI <∼7.5, σM ran as a basic protein, and although RsmA has a predicted pI ∼ 8.8, tightly associated n-laurylsarcosine molecules (which remain bound after exchange into non-detergent buffer) imparted an overall negative charge to RsmA at neutral/high pH. Thus, horizontal native PAGE, in which both acidic and basic proteins can be analyzed, was employed. Equimolar concentrations of the sigma and anti-sigma factors were mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to loading on a 7% acrylamide native gel, along with separate samples of each (Fig. 4A). Lanes in which σM alone was loaded (lanes 2 and 5) contained two bands running toward the cathode (-), with the faster running band representing a minor species. The origin of this difference is not known, but we note that these two forms of σM were not resolved by vertical native PAGE (see later). Because RsmA preparations contained a residual amount of the detergent n-laurylsarcosine, σM was also run in the presence of the detergent to assess the effect on its migration characteristics (lane 1). Apart from a slight smearing of the bands, such that the two forms of σM are not clearly distinguished, no effect was observed. Mixing RsmA and σM at equal concentrations gave rise to a band corresponding to unbound σM, but this was substantially weaker than that due to the same concentration of σM in the absence of RsmA (lane 5), indicating that σM binds to RsmA and the resulting complex migrates toward the anode, resulting in a more diffuse band than observed for RsmA alone. That not all of the σM was r"

Because hypoxia and other physiological signals induce formation of an abasic site at a key base within the hypoxic response element (HRE) of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene (FASEB J. 19, 387-394, 2005) and because abasic sites can introduce flexibility in model DNA sequences, in the present study we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based reporter system to assess topological changes in a wild-type (WT) sequence of the HRE of the rat VEGF gene and in a sequence harboring a single abasic site mimicking the effect of hypoxia. Binding of the hypoxia-inducible transcriptional complex present in hypoxic pulmonary artery endothelial cell nuclear extract to the WT sequence failed to alter sequence topology whereas nuclear protein binding to the modified HRE engendered considerable sequence flexibility. Topological effects of nuclear proteins on the modified VEGF HRE were dependent on the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and on formation of a single-strand break at the abasic site mediated by the coactivator, Ref-1/Ape1. These observations suggest that oxidative base modifications in the VEGF HRE evoked by physiological signals could be a precursor to single-strand break formation that has an impact on gene expression by modulating sequence flexibility."

https://openalex.org/W2044556456,"The Bacteroides mobilizable transposon NBU1 uses an integrase (IntN1) that is a tyrosine recombinase for its integration and excision from the host chromosome. Previously we showed that IntN1 makes 7-bp staggered cuts within the NBU1 att sites, and certain mismatches within the crossover region of the attN1 site (G(–2)C attN1) or the chromosomal target site (C(–3)G attBT1-1) enhanced the in vivo integration efficiency. Here we describe an in vitro integration system for NBU1. We used nicked substrates and a Holliday junction trapping peptide to show that NBU1 integration proceeds via formation of a Holliday junction intermediate that is formed by exchange of bottom strands. Some mismatches next to the first strand exchange site (in reactions with C(–3)G attBT1-1 or G(–2)C attN1 with their wild-type partner site) not only allowed formation of the Holliday junction intermediate but also increased the rate of recombinant formation. The second strand exchange appears to be homology-dependent. IntN1 is the only tyrosine recombinase known to catalyze a reaction that is more efficient in the presence of mismatches and where the first strand exchange is homology-independent.

IntN1 is the only tyrosine recombinase known to catalyze a reaction that is more efficient in the presence of mismatches and where the first strand exchange is homology-independent. The possible mechanisms by which the mismatches stimulate recombination are discussed. The Bacteroides mobilizable transposon, NBU1, can be transferred from one cell to another via conjugation, using transfer proteins provided in trans by a coresident conjugative transposon, CTnDOT (1Shoemaker N.B. Kim A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1651-1657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using its own integrase IntN1, NBU1 integrates into the host chromosome in the recipient cell, at a specific site called attBT1-1, located at the 3′-end of a leu-tRNA gene (2Shoemaker N.B. Kim G.R. Salyers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3594-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IntN1 carries the conserved residues RKHRHY that are characteristic of tyrosine recombinases (2Shoemaker N.B. Kim G.R. Salyers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3594-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and substitution of each of these residues inactivates the protein (3Rajeev L. Kim A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 978-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The target attBT1-1 contains a 14-bp “common core” sequence, which is identical to a sequence on the NBU1 attN1 and gets duplicated following integration (4Shoemaker N.B. Kim G.R. Stevens A.M. Salyers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6578-6587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IntN1 makes 7-bp staggered cuts within this 14-bp region on the top and bottom strands (3Rajeev L. Kim A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 978-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Thus, similar to other characterized tyrosine recombinases, recombination by IntN1 occurs within a specific core sequence, which is identical in the two substrates.Tyrosine recombinases such as phage λ integrase and Cre and Flp recombinases have an absolute requirement for homology within the crossover regions (5Bauer C.E.

According to the current “strand-swapping isomerization” model, strand exchange occurs by cleavage of partner strands in each site forming a 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond and free 5′-OH groups. Two or three bases are melted from each strand and annealed to the complementary strand in the partner (11Nunes-Duby S.E. Kim M.A. Landy A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The bases are tested for homology with the partner by effective base-pairing before ligation (11Nunes-Duby S.E. Kim M.A. Landy A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Lee J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4042-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to form a Holliday junction intermediate. Isomerization of the intermediate leads to the second round of cleavage and strand exchanges at the opposite end of the crossover region, where effective base pairing is again required to form complete recombinants.Further analysis suggested that the homology between the NBU1 att sites was not critical to recombination and probably existed only to preserve the leu-tRNA gene sequence. Mismatches were introduced in the NBU1 core region in either attN1 or attBT1-1, and the mutant att sites were tested for their in vivo integration efficiency (13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). When the bases A(–8) and G(–7) next to top strand cleavage site (Fig. 1A) were mutated in either att site, integration efficiency was not affected significantly. Substitutions of bases A(–6), C(–5), and C(–4) decreased the integration frequencies to different extents, but the recombination was not restored to wild-type levels when the same mutation was present on both the att sites. The effect of the G(–2)C and C(–3)G substitutions were more surprising. The C(–3)G mutation enhanced in vivo integration frequencies by 100-fold, but only when it was placed in the attBT1-1 site (Fig. 1B). When placed in the attN1 site the integration was adversely affected. On the other hand, the G(–2)C mutation in attN1 stimulated integration by 300-fold, but abolished activity when placed in attBT1-1 (Fig. 1B) (13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). IntN1 is the only tyrosine recombinase known whose activity is stimulated by mismatches within the crossover region.It has not been demonstrated that the recombination mechanism for any mobilizable transposon using a tyrosine recombinase involves a Holliday junction intermediate.

IntN1 differs from other tyrosine recombinases, because the HJ intermediate is formed even in the presence of mismatches next to the first strand exchange site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia, Proteins, and Plasmids—All Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LB-agar plates. The antibiotic concentrations used were as follows: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml), and trimethoprim (100 μg/ml). Plasmid preparations were performed with Qiagen kits. Native IntN1 was expressed from a T7 promoter in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain and purified as described previously (3Rajeev L. Kim A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 978-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). IHF was purified as described previously (14Dichiara J.M. Kim A.N. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2692-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from IDT. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from Fermentas.Preparation of Radiolabeled attBT1-1 Substrates—The attBT1-1 substrates were prepared by first 5′-radiolabeling one of the oligonucleotides using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and removing unincorporated label using a G50 mini-Sephadex column. The labeled oligonucleotide was then mixed with the complementary oligonucleotide at a molar ratio of 1:5 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and annealed by heating to 95 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling. Oligonucleotides used for wild-type and mutant attBT1-1 substrates are shown in Table 1. Substrates carrying a nick at one of the cleavage sites were prepared by annealing together three oligonucleotides (Table 1), one of which was 5′-radiolabeled.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used to prepare attBT1-1 substratesOligonucleotideSequenceWT ts5′-TCTTAGCTTTTCGTGGTACCCAGACCCGGGGTCGAACCGGGATG-3′WT bs5′-CATCCCGGTTCGACCCCGGGTCTGGGTACCACGAAAAGCTAAGA-3′C(-3)G ts5′-TCTTAGCTTTTCGTGGTACCCAGACCGGGGGTCGAACCGGGATG-3′C(-3)G bs5′-CATCCCGGTTCGACCCCCGGTCTGGGTACCACGAAAAGCTAAGA-3′A(-8)T ts5′-TCTTAGCTTTTCGTGGTACCCAGTCCCGGGGTCGAACCGGGATG-3′A(-8)T bs5′-CATCCCGGTTCGACCCCGGGACTGGGTACCACGAAAAGCTAAGA-3′G(-7)C ts5′-TCTTAGCTTTTCGTGGTACCCACACCCGGGGTCGAACCGGGATG-3′G(-7)C bs5′-CATCCCGGTTCGACCCCGGGTGTGGGTACCACGAAAAGCTAAGA-3′G(-2)C ts5′-TCTTAGCTTTTCGTGGTACCCAGACCCCGGGTCGAACCGGGATG-3′G(-2)C bs5′-CATCCCGGTTCGACCCGGGGTCTGGGTACCACGAAAAGCTAAGA-3′Nick ts left5′-TCTTAGCTTTTCGTGGTACCC-3′Nick ts right5′-〈phos〉AGACCGGGGGTCGAACCGGGATG-3′Nick bs right5′-CATCCCGGTTCGACCC-3′Nick bs left5′-〈phos〉CCGGTCTGGGTACCACGAAAAGCTAAGA-3′ Open table in a new tab In Vitro Recombination Assay—The plasmid pJWS200 was previously constructed by cloning the NBU1 attN1 site into the pGEM-T vector (13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in 20-μl volumes containing ∼1.5 μg of supercoiled pJWS200 (0.6 pmol) and 1.5–2 pmol of radiolabeled attBT1-1 (44 bp) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 70 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm spermidine. Approximately 1 μg of the integrase IntN1 (18 pmol) and 0.2 μg of purified E. coli IHF were added. Peptide-supplemented reactions had 1 μl of the peptide diluted appropriately in water. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h unless otherwise stated and were stopped by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1%. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel in 1× TBE (8 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was then vacuum-dried and exposed to phosphorimaging plates, and the amount of radiation in bands was quantified using phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA-3000). Percent recombination was calculated as the ratio of the number of counts present in the product to the total number of counts present in both the product and the substrate (15Kazmierczak R.A. Kim B.M. Burgin A.B. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5193-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For time point assays, the recombination reaction was set up in 5× or 10× volumes, 10- to 20-μl aliquots were withdrawn at specified time points, and the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS.Restriction Analysis of Recombinant Products—The in vitro recombination reactions were set up as described above, but in 5× volumes. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reactions were extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, the DNA was precipitated and digested with ScaI enzyme (Invitrogen), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The products were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described above.Denaturing Agarose Electrophoresis—To analyze the recombination products by denaturing electrophoresis, the reactions were set up as described above, but they were stopped by adding NaOH to a final concentration of 50 mm. The products were run on a 1% alkaline agarose gel (50 mm NaOH, 5 mm EDTA) in alkaline buffer (50 mm NaOH, 5 mm EDTA) at 30 V for 16 h. The gel was dried and exposed as described above.Two-dimensional Gel Analysis of Recombination Reactions—Recombination reactions supplemented with the peptide were set up in 2× volumes. Two 15-μl samples were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel in 1× TBE. One lane from each pair was sliced out of the gel and prepared for the second dimension as described below; the rest of the gel was dried and exposed to phosphorimaging screens. The gel slices were soaked in alkaline buffer (50 mm NaOH, 5 mm EDTA) for 1 h, and then embedded in a tray with 200 ml of a molten agarose solution in 50 mm NaOH, 5 mm EDTA. The gel was then electrophoresed in alkaline running buffer (50 mm NaOH, 5 mm EDTA) at 30 V for 16 h. The gel was then dried and exposed to phosphorimaging screens.In Vivo Recombination Assay—The E. coli strains used were previously constructed (13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The donor strain with the attN1 site in the reverse orientation was constructed in this study. Primers carrying the restriction sites for XhoI and XbaI were designed and used to amplify the attN1 gene from pJWS200. The attN1 site was then cloned into the pir-dependent pEPE vector that was cut with XhoI and XbaI enzymes. After transformation into E. coli BW19851 cells, chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were selected, and the inserts were sequenced to check for the presence of the attN1 site.An E. coli mating assay was used as previously described (3Rajeev L. Kim A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 978-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Donor strains are resistant to chloramphenicol (Cm) and trimethoprim (Tp), and recipient strain is resistant to ampicillin (Ap) and kanamycin (Kn). Recipient colonies were selected for growth on LB Ap Kn plates, and integrant colonies were selected on LB Ap Kn Cm plates. The integration frequency was calculated as the ratio of the number of Ap Cm Kn-resistant colonies to the number of Ap Kn-resistant colonies. A colony PCR screen was utilized on the integrant colonies to determine if they were obtained by site-specific integration of attN1 into attBT1-1. We used primers that anneal to attBT1-1 and the regions flanking attN1, such that amplification of attBT1-1, attN1, attR-N1, or attL-N1 gave different sized products (3Rajeev L. Kim A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 978-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).RESULTSDoes IntN1 Use a Single-stranded or Double-stranded Substrate?—The Vibrio cholerae CTX phage uses the host-encoded XerC/XerD recombinases to integrate into the host chromosome. The single-stranded DNA genome of CTXϕ folds into a hairpin structure that creates a recombination site for XerC/XerD (16Val M.E. Kim M. Campos J. Sherratt D. Cornet F. Mazel D. Barre F.X. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 559-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Only one pair of strand exchanges is performed, and the resulting HJ intermediate is converted to double-stranded DNA by cellular processes. The integration of integron gene cassettes mediated by the tyrosine recombinase IntI1 also uses a folded single-stranded attC substrate (17Bouvier M. Kim G. Mazel D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4356-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The active hairpin structure is formed only by one of the single strands: only the (+) strand of CTXϕ or the attC bottom strand of the integron cassette can integrate. Because single-stranded DNA is part of the natural lifecycle in conjugative and mobilizable transposons, it is conceivable that the single strand that enters the recipient is the actual substrate instead of the complementary double strand form. Therefore, we used an E. coli in vivo conjugation assay (13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) to test if IntN1 shows a preference for top versus bottom strand of the NBU1 attN1 (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Mating assay to test for integration efficiencies of top versus bottom strands of attN1. The donor strain carries the pir-dependent pEPE:attN1 plasmid with the NBU1 attN1 site cloned in either the forward or the reverse orientation. The pir recipient cell has the target attBT1-1 site in the chromosome and the plasmid pIntN1 expressing the NBU1 Int. Donors and recipients are mixed together for conjugation to occur. Transconjugants that are resistant to ampicillin (Ap), kanamycin (Kn) and chloramphenicol (Cm) arise only by integration of the pEPE:attN1 plasmid into the recipient chromosome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The recipient strain has the Bacteroides target attBT1-1 site integrated in the chromosome and expresses the NBU1 intN1 gene on a plasmid. The donor strain carries a conjugative pir-dependent CmR plasmid (pEPE:attN1) with the NBU1 attN1 site. Following conjugation, ApR, KnR, and CmR colonies were obtained only if the attN1 plasmid integrated into the pir recipient chromosome (Fig. 2). A donor strain carrying the pEPE plasmid was used as the negative control. The pEPE plasmid is the parent vector of pEPE:attN1 that lacks the attN1 site. In the absence of an attN1 site, the integration frequency was <10–7 integrants per recipient. We tested two donor strains, each carrying the pEPE:attN1 plasmid but with the attN1 site cloned in opposite orientations, such that during conjugation either the top or the bottom strand of attN1 would be delivered into the recipient cell. If one of these strands is folding into a recombination target for IntN1, then the integration frequencies should differ depending on which strand is transferred. We observed equal integration frequencies of ∼7 × 10–5 integrants per recipient when either the top or the bottom attN1 strand entered the recipient cell. This is in contrast to the integron integrase IntI1 where recombination was 1000-fold higher for the bottom strand of attC than the top (17Bouvier M. Kim G. Mazel D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4356-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), or to CTXϕ where there was a 100- to 1000-fold higher recombination with the (+) strand than the (–) strand (16Val M.E. Kim M. Campos J. Sherratt D. Cornet F. Mazel D. Barre F.X. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 559-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This implies that NBU1 integration does not depend on a particular single strand to form the substrate for recombination.Additionally, ApR, KnR, and CmR colonies were obtained when we electroporated the double-stranded circular pEPE: attN1 plasmid into competent recipient cells. To ensure that these colonies arose by site-specific recombination between attN1 and attBT1-1, colony PCR was performed using primers that anneal to the att sites such that amplification of attN1, attBT1-1, attL, and attR gave different sized fragments (3Rajeev L. Kim A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 978-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In >90% of the colonies the attL and attR sites were obtained by site-specific recombination. When the parental plasmid pEPE (lacking attN1 site) was electroporated into the recipient cells, no Ap-, Kn-, and Cm-resistant colonies were obtained. This demonstrates that IntN1 is able to use a double-stranded circular substrate in vivo. The similar experiment performed with integron cassettes revealed that the integron integrase IntI1 could not act on a transformed double-stranded attC plasmid (17Bouvier M. Kim G. Mazel D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4356-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).A caveat is that conjugation in E. coli with recombinant plasmids may not be equivalent to natural transfer of NBU1 between Bacteroides species. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that IntN1 is able to process both single- and double-stranded forms of attN1, or that the active target is formed by either the top or the bottom strands of attN1, the most compelling evidence for the use of a double-stranded substrate comes from the in vitro system that uses both double-stranded substrates (see next section).In Vitro Integration Assay for IntN1—Previous analysis of NBU1 site-specific recombination utilized an in vivo conjugation assay. To facilitate mechanistic studies and to avoid processing of intermediates in vivo by host enzymes, we developed an in vitro recombination assay. In this system, NBU1 IntN1 and a host factor were added to reaction mixtures containing a supercoiled plasmid pJWS200 carrying the NBU1 attN1 site, and a short linear radiolabeled fragment (44 bp) containing the Bacteroides attBT1-1 site. The reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Integration produces a linear radiolabeled product that is approximately the size of the linearized pJWS200 plasmid (3.5 kb), as shown in Figs. 3 (A and B). The faint band that migrated slower than the recombinant band is likely a recombinant dimer, resulting from a second round of recombination between attN1 and either attL or attR. Such multimers have been observed in λ integrase (Int) in vitro recombination (18Nunes-Duby S.E. Kim L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The mobilities of both the bands were unchanged by treatment with proteinase K (not shown). To confirm that the product band obtained is a recombinant, the reaction products were digested with ScaI. The circular attN1 plasmid has a single ScaI restriction site, and digestion of the linear recombinant should result in two fragments ∼1.4 and 2.1 kb in size. The recombination scheme and the expected restriction products are shown in Fig. 3A, and the results (Fig. 3C) are consistent with the product being formed by site-specific recombination between the attN1 and attBT1-1 sites.FIGURE 3In vitro system for NBU1 integration. A, reaction scheme. Supercoiled plasmid with the NBU1 attN1 site and a radiolabeled linear attBT1-1(C(–3)G) fragment are incubated together with partially purified IntN1 and a host factor (E. coli IHF) at 37 °C. Integration will result in a long radiolabeled linear product the size of the linear pJWS200 plasmid. The expected products of ScaI digestion of the recombinant are shown. B, autoradiograph of agarose gel electrophoresis of reaction products. The recombinant product migrates much slower than the labeled attBT1-1 substrate. Lane 1, no IntN1; lane 2, IntN1 added. C, restriction analysis of recombination products. Recombination reactions were set up with attBT1-1 (C(–3)G) labeled either on the top strand (lanes 1 and 2), or the bottom strand (lanes 3 and 4), or both strands (lanes 5 and 6). The reactions products in lanes 2, 4, and 6 were digested with ScaI. D, C(–3)G attBT1-1 has a higher rate of reaction than wild-type attBT1-1. The in vitro reactions were set up with either WT attBT1-1(filled squares) or the mutant C(–3)G attBT1-1 (open triangles). Aliquots were removed at 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min and the reactions were stopped by addition of 1% SDS. Recombination percentage was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The graph is representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The optimal recombination conditions were at a temperature of 37 °C, a pH of 8, and in the presence of dithiothreitol and spermidine. Dithiothreitol was essential for the reaction to occur. We found that increasing the glycerol concentration to 40–50% could substitute for spermidine. The reaction was not stimulated by the addition of Mg+2, ATP or Me2SO. We also tested if supercoiling of the attN1 plasmid was necessary. When the attN1 plasmid was relaxed using a topoisomerase or linearized by ScaI digestion, no product formation was seen (not shown).We tested various cell extracts and nucleoid proteins to see if they stimulate the reaction. A host factor is essential for the reaction. The reaction was stimulated greatly either by a partially purified specific Bacteroides host factor 3M. Romero-Guss, unpublished results. or purified E. coli IHF. On the other hand, when the reaction was supplemented with either a Bacteroides crude extract or purified HU protein, the amount of product formed was low compared with when IHF was added. Integration of CTnDOT in vitro is also stimulated by E. coli IHF, but not by HU (19Cheng Q. Kim N. Shoemaker N.B. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4829-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We used the E. coli IHF as the host factor in all further experiments described here.One of the attBT1-1 crossover mutants that was previously constructed, C(–3)G attBT1-1, enhanced in vivo integration frequencies by 100-fold (13Schmidt J.W. Kim L. Salyers A.A. Gardner J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The C(–3)G attN1, however, was deficient in recombination. A cross between C(–3)G attBT1-1 and C(–3)G attN1, where the sites are homologous, had an integration frequency less than that between two wild-type sites (Fig. 1B). We tested the C(–3)G attBT1-1 in the in vitro reaction against wild-type attN1. We observed that the mutant site had a much higher rate of reaction than the wild-type site (Fig. 3D). For this reason, we used the C(–3)G attBT1-1 in all subsequent experiments, unless otherwise indicated.Use of Nicked attBT1-1 Substrates to Trap Holliday Junction Intermediates—Because intermediates are usually short-lived in reactions catalyzed by tyrosine recombinases, their accumulation depends on blocking the reaction at different steps. Holliday junction intermediates are trapped for λ Int using substrates that are either nicked (18Nunes-Duby S.E. Kim L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or carry a non-bridging phosphorothioate (20Kitts P.A. Kim H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6839-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) at the second cleavage site and with substrates that exhibit heterology on the right side of the overlap region (18Nunes-Duby S.E. Kim L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Kitts P.A. Kim H.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).To determine if the integration of NBU1 proceeds via a Holliday junction intermediate, we used C(–3)G attBT1-1 substrates that had a nick at one of the sites of IntN1 cleavage. A nick at the cleavage site will not allow formation of the 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond, and this will prevent the strand exchange step. These nicked substrates will block the recombination reaction either fully or partially depending on which strand carries the nick and if there is a bias in the order of strand exchanges. We tested two attBT1-1 substrates in the in vitro recombination reaction, one with a nick at the position of top strand cleavage, and the other with a nick at the bottom strand cleavage site (Fig. 4A). We observed that the reaction with the top strand nicked substrate resulted in the accumulation of an intermediate that migrated slower on an agarose gel than the linear recombinant (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Only a minor amount of product that migrated like the linear recombinant was obtained with the bottom strand nicked attBT1-1 (Fig. 4A, lane 5). This difference in the reaction products between the two nicked substrates implies that there is a defined order of strand exchanges. It is likely that NBU1 integration proceeds by exchange of bottom strands first. When the nick was at the top strand cleavage site, IntN1 could cleave and exchange the bottom strands, but top strand exchange could not occur and the reaction intermediate accumulated. Such a Holliday junction intermediate was expected to migrate similar to the relaxed pJWS200 plasmid due to the presence of the nick. The mobility of this band did not chan"

In this study, we identified two unique 28-kDa, dithiothreitol-sensitive nucleases and showed that they are constitutively released/secreted by parasites during axenic culture. Using several different molecular approaches, we identified and characterized the structure of <i>EhNucI</i> and <i>EhNucII</i>, genes that encode ribonuclease T2 family proteins. Homologous episomal expression of epitope-tagged <i>EhNucI</i> and <i>EhNucII</i> chimeric constructs was used to define the functional and biochemical properties of these released/secreted enzymes. Results of coupled immunoprecipitation-enzyme activity analyses demonstrated that these ""secretory"" enzymes could hydrolyze a variety of synthetic polynucleotides, as well as the natural nucleic acid substrate RNA. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that sera from acutely infected amebiasis patients recognized and immunoprecipitated these parasite secretory enzymes. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that within its host, these secretory nucleases could function, at a distance away from the parasite, to harness (<i>i.e.</i> hydrolyze/access) host-derived nucleic acids to satisfy the essential purine and pyrimidine requirements of these organisms. Thus, these enzymes might play an important role in facilitating the survival, growth, and development of this important human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2076964735,"The b subunit dimer in the peripheral stator stalk of Escherichia coli ATP synthase is essential for enzyme assembly and the rotational catalytic mechanism. Recent protein chemical evidence revealed the dimerization domain of b to contain a novel two-stranded right-handed coiled coil with offset helices. Here, the existence of this structure in more complete constructs of b containing the C-terminal domain, and therefore capable of binding to the peripheral F1-ATPase, was supported by the more efficient formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds between cysteine residues that are proximal only in the offset arrangement and by the greater thermal stabilities of cross-linked heterodimers trapped in the offset configuration as opposed to homodimers with the helices trapped in-register.

The process of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and bacteria, or photophosphorylation in chloroplasts, requires the enzyme F1F0-ATP synthase to utilize the energy of the transmembrane proton gradient for the production of ATP from ADP and Pi. The enzyme functions as a molecular motor, with rotor and stator complexes consisting of subunits from both the membrane-peripheral F1 and membrane-integral F0 sectors of the protein. In the Escherichia coli enzyme, F0 contains three subunits in an ab2c10 stoichiometry, whereas F1 has five subunits in the stoichiometry of α3β3γδε. The γεc10 subunits compose the rotor, and b2δ forms the stator. As the rotor is driven by the passage of protons through a pore formed by the c and a subunits of F0, rotation of γ within the α3β3 hexamer of F1 causes conformational changes in the catalytic nucleotide-binding sites located on the β subunits, promoting ATP synthesis and release. One function of the b2δ stator is to hold the α3β3 hexamer against the rotational torque, as otherwise α3β3 would simply turn with the rotor rather than undergoing the conformational changes associated with the formation and release of ATP. In anaerobic or facultative bacteria, the enzyme can function as a proton pump, hydrolyzing ATP to drive protons out of the cytoplasm, against the electrochemical gradient.

The major component of the stator stalk is the 156-residue b subunit, which forms an elongated dimer extending from the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane to the top of F1, where it interacts with δ (6Dunn S.D.

The tether region (residues 25–52) links the transmembrane and dimerization domains; its function is not well understood, but it is known to interact with the a subunit and to play a role in coupling (19McLachlin D.T.

Although interactions exist between b and α3β3 (19McLachlin D.T. Kim A.M. Clark S.M. Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The interaction of b and δ, mediated through the C-terminal regions of each subunit, appears to be key to this binding (15Takeyama M. Kim T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol.

Dimerization of b is essential for F1 binding and ATP synthase function, although it can be significantly weakened through mutation in the dimerization domain before activity is lost (14Sorgen P.L.

The isolated dimerization domain has been characterized as an atypical, parallel, two-stranded coiled coil (13Revington M. Kim D.T. Shaw G.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31094-31101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24McLachlin D.T. Kim S.D. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses of this region have identified an 11-residue hendecad pattern, with positions denoted abcdefghijk (6Dunn S.D. Kim D.J. Del Rizzo P.A. Futai M. Wada Y. Kaplan J.H. Handbook of ATPases: Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Pathophysiology. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2004: 311-318Google Scholar, 26Del Rizzo P.A. Kim Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Hendecad patterns are indicative of right-handed coiled coils in which 11 residues make three turns of the helix relative to the interhelical axis (27Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 28Lupas A.N. Kim M. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 37-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar); the expected distribution of positions for a two-stranded structure of this type is shown on the helical wheel in Fig. 1A. The hendecad pattern seen in b subunit sequences is unusual in that the a and h positions at the center of the interface are usually occupied by alanine or other small amino acids, whereas larger hydrophobic residues are often seen in the d and e positions that are more peripherally situated (6Dunn S.D. Kim D.J. Del Rizzo P.A. Futai M. Wada Y. Kaplan J.H. Handbook of ATPases: Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Pathophysiology. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2004: 311-318Google Scholar). In the absence of a high resolution dimeric structure, assignment of the hydrophobic strip defined by the a, d, e, and h positions as the dimerization interface in the isolated dimerization domain has been supported by recent studies of disulfide formation between cysteine residues introduced into the a and h positions between residues 61 and 90 and by assessment of the stabilities of disulfide-linked dimers (29Del Rizzo P.A. Kim Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Results of these studies further implied that the two helices of the dimer are offset, rather than in-register as in left-handed coiled coils. In this staggered configuration, one of the helices, denoted bN, 2The abbreviations used are: bN and bC, the positions of the b subunits in the offset right-handed coiled coil of the b2 dimer, with bN shifted toward the N terminus and bC shifted toward the C terminus; BPM, benzophenone-4-maleimide; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride. is N-terminally shifted relative to the other helix, denoted bC, by about 5.5 residues (one-half of a hendacad), making the dimer intrinsically asymmetric, as seen in Fig. 1B. A functional significance of the right-handed coiled coil in withstanding the torque imparted by γ rotation within α3β3 was suggested. The goal of this study was to explore the existence of the offset helices in b constructs containing the δ-binding domain and to assess its functional significance in the interaction with F1. The results we present confirm the asymmetric nature of the dimer and reveal the different roles of bN and bC in the binding of F1. Plasmid Construction—Recombinant DNA techniques were performed by standard methods. All generated sequences were verified by sequencing. Plasmids encoding b polypeptides were constructed such that all of the resultant proteins included the R83A mutation, previously shown to stabilize the dimer (26Del Rizzo P.A. Kim Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), except when cysteine was inserted at this position. Plasmids encoding b residues 53–156 were based on pSD111, which includes a leader sequence of MSYW (24McLachlin D.T. Kim S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas plasmids encoding b residues 34–156 were based on plasmid pJB3, in which the leader sequence is MST (30Dunn S.D. Kim J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Relevant mutations were introduced into these plasmids by subcloning appropriate sections of DNA from previously described plasmids encoding desired cysteine substitutions (29Del Rizzo P.A. Kim Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or C-terminal mutations resulting in either premature chain termination, V153Stop, or else addition of GC to the normal C-terminal Leu-156 (16McLachlin D.T. Kim J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Protein Expression, Purification, and Production of Disulfide Cross-linked Forms—The various mutant forms of soluble b subunit were expressed and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and ion-exchange chromatography, essentially as described (24McLachlin D.T. Kim S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Dunn S.D. Kim J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Purification steps were monitored by SDS-PAGE. To prepare disulfide-linked dimers, purified cysteine-containing b polypeptides, either individually or as equimolar mixtures, were first reduced with 2 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h and then dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Dialysis bags were then transferred to buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 μm CuCl2, and dialysis was continued for 3 days. In cases where one of the b subunits contained a C-terminal Gly-Cys addition, as well as a cysteine at either position 83 or 90 in the dimerization domain, a copper/cysteine disulfide exchange buffer that contained 10 μm CuCl2 as well as 10 mm cysteine was used to foster internal disulfide formation, while leaving the C-terminal cysteine residue disulfide-linked to the free amino acid cysteine. The resultant cross-linked forms were purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a Mono Q 5/5 column. Determination of Propensity to Form Disulfides—Purified cysteine-containing b constructs were analyzed for their propensity to form disulfide-linked dimers by a previously described method in which the polypeptides are dialyzed in the presence of air against buffer containing 10 μm CuCl2 and 10 mm cysteine (24McLachlin D.T. Kim S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Del Rizzo P.A. Kim Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Equal volumes of 60 μm protein samples were mixed, giving each a final concentration of 30 μm. Mixtures were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C to reduce any disulfides. Part of each sample was removed for analysis by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, and the dialysis bags were then transferred to a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm cysteine, and 10 μm CuCl2 and allowed to dialyze for 24 h at 4 °C with vigorous stirring. Samples were again collected and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. To prevent any disulfide exchange, sample buffer for nonreducing SDS-PAGE contained 15 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Chemical Cross-linking with Benzophenone-4-maleimide (BPM)—All steps were performed at room temperature. Samples of purified F1 and disulfide-linked b dimers, in which one of the subunits had a C-terminal glycylcysteine addition, were separately passed through 1-ml centrifuge columns (31Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) containing Bio-Gel P-10 resin (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. The b dimers at a concentration of 25 μm were incubated for 75 min with 1 mm TCEP to reduce the C-terminal cysteine of those constructs. Chemical cross-linking of the b dimers to F1-ATPase using BPM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was carried out using the procedure described by McLachlin et al. (16McLachlin D.T. Kim J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). BPM dissolved in dimethylformamide was added in a 5-fold molar excess over the b dimers and allowed to incubate for 15 min. Unreacted BPM was quenched by addition of an equimolar amount of β-mercaptoethanol. The b dimer was then mixed with the column-centrifuged F1 at a molar ratio of 2 F1 per b dimer, in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2. Controls were performed in which no BPM was added to the b solution. Samples were exposed to long wave ultraviolet light from an Ultra-Violet Products model TM-36 transilluminator for 5 min. As an additional control, some BPM-modified samples were placed on the transilluminator but removed before it was turned on. After illumination, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the samples, which were then heated at 100 °C for 2 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Other Materials and Methods—Thermal denaturation of protein constructs in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, was followed by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 222 nm using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. The temperature was increased at the rate of 1 °C per min. Data were converted to mean residue ellipticity and fitted to a two-state model as described (32Briere L.K. Kim S.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8607-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33Santoro M.M. Kim D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 34Swint L. Kim A.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). F1 binding activity of b dimers was determined using a competitive assay described previously (16McLachlin D.T. Kim J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Purified soluble b dimers at the indicated concentrations were mixed with 20 μl of an F1 affinity resin bearing soluble b linked to the resin through a cysteine residue near its N terminus and 31.3 μg of F1 (0.3 μm) for 1 h. The resin was sedimented by centrifugation; the supernatant solution was removed; the pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bovine serum albumin was added to the competition buffer to serve as a control for trapping of liquid within the resin pellet. As a control, resin with only cysteine linked was used. Protein concentrations were determined using the Advanced Reagent (Cytoskeleton, Inc.), and values for b subunits were corrected using a factor determined by quantitative amino acid analysis as described previously (26Del Rizzo P.A. Kim Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Del Rizzo P.A. Kim Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using the Tris-glycine system described by Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Sample buffer for nonreducing SDS-PAGE contained 15 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Sample buffer for reducing SDS-PAGE contained 50 mm dithiothreitol. The presence of free thiol groups in polypeptides was determined by treatment with 1.2 mm fluorescein maleimide in SDS sample buffer lacking both dithiothreitol and N-ethylmaleimide for 15 min followed by SDS-PAGE (36McLachlin D.T. Kim S.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Before Coomassie Blue staining, the gel was exposed to UV light to visualize the fluorescein-labeled polypeptides. Polyclonal antibodies to the peripheral domain of b and to δ subunit were raised in rabbits. The anti-δ serum was treated with bMERC resin (16McLachlin D.T. Kim J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to remove antibodies that recognized b subunit. The anti-b serum was sufficiently specific for our studies without any special treatment. Blotting was carried out using carbonate blot buffer as described previously (37Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were subsequently detected using a second antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as described (38Aggeler R. Kim R.A. Dunn S. Gogol E.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Preferential Formation of Intersubunit Disulfides between Positions a and h—The propensity for disulfide formation between cysteine residues introduced into b subunit polypeptides was assessed using a previously developed method involving initial dialysis against buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mm EDTA to reduce any existing disulfides, followed by a second dialysis against a disulfide exchange buffer containing 10 μm Cu2+ and 10 mm free cysteine to foster selective oxygen-dependent disulfide formation. Previous studies of disulfide bond formation using dimerization domain constructs showed that mixed pairs of polypeptides with cysteines in all adjacent a and h positions between Ala-61 and Ala-90 had much stronger propensities to form disulfide-linked heterodimers than any of the individual cysteine-containing constructs to form disulfides (29Del Rizzo P.A. Kim Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We asked if this result could be extended to forms of b containing the entire C-terminal domain that is involved in binding F1, using b34–156 with cysteines at individual h positions (68, 79, 90) and b53–156 constructs with cysteines at individual a positions (72, 83), as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1, C and D). The difference in size between these constructs allowed differentiation between homodimers and heterodimers by their migration on SDS-PAGE. No more than a trace of dimer formed from any pure construct during the dialysis against 5 mm dithiothreitol (Fig. 2A, upper), but surprisingly significant dimer formation occurred between constructs with cysteines in adjacent a and h positions (i.e. 68 × 72, 72 × 79, 79 × 83, and 83 × 90) even during this step (Fig. 2A, lower panel). After oxidizing dialysis in a disulfide-exchange buffer (Fig. 2B), essentially complete dimer formation was observed in those particular mixed samples, whereas disulfide formation was substantially incomplete for the individual polypeptides or the other mixtures. Disulfide-linked Offset Heterodimers Are More Stable than In-register Homodimers—Whereas the results of the disulfide formation studies indicated that interchain disulfide formation is more favorable for each of the four adjacent a/h pairs tested than for any individual construct or for any of the other mixed samples, the distinction is not absolute. We therefore sought additional evidence by determining the thermal stability of purified, disulfide-linked b dimers, following the change in the circular dichroism signal as the temperature was raised. Three in-register homodimers and two offset heterodimers were analyzed (Fig. 3). In comparison with the cysteineless constructs, shown in Fig. 3 as open symbols, homodimers linked through cysteines at positions 79, 83, or 90 all showed broader transitions indicative of lower cooperativity. In contrast, the two offset heterodimers melted with sharp transitions, similar to those of the cysteineless forms, implying that interhelical interactions in the native cysteineless forms are more closely approximated by those in the offset heterodimers. Because the introduction of either type of disulfide converts folding from a bimolecular to a unimolecular reaction, both result in increases in the midpoint of melting, but it is also notable that the melting midpoints of the heterodimers were about 20 °C higher, in the range of 73–75 °C, than those of the in-register homodimers that were between 49 and 54 °C. Overall, the results of these studies imply that the unusual offset relationship of the helices previously seen in the isolated dimerization domain applies also to constructs extending to the C terminus. Offset Heterodimers Preferentially Bind F1—To investigate the functional relevance of the offset relationship of the b subunit helices, we studied the effects of either offset or in-register intersubunit disulfides on the interaction with F1 using a semi-quantitative competitive assay, in which the ability of a soluble b to compete with wild-type b conjugated to agarose beads for binding a limited amount of F1 is tested (16McLachlin D.T. Kim J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 4. As seen in the left-hand lanes in Fig. 4 next to the molecular weight standards, control resin lacking conjugated b had only small amounts of F1 trapped within the resin, whereas the affinity resin bound substantial F1 in the absence of soluble competitor, but had only the background level when competing wild-type soluble b was added (upper panel). Both of the tested offset heterodimers, 79 × 83 and 83 × 90, resembled the wild-type b in their ability to compete for F1, whereas the in-register homodimers formed with cysteines at any of the three positions competed less effectively. The stronger binding of the offset heterodimers to F1 implies the relevance of the staggered conformation of b within the enzyme. bN Is More Important for F1 Binding—The final four residues of the b polypeptide have been found previously to be required for the binding of b to F1 through the δ subunit; deletion of these residues completely abolished F1 binding (16McLachlin D.T. Kim J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies from the Cain laboratory showed that coexpression of a bR36I mutant, which is also nonfunctional by itself, complemented the four-residue truncation, implying that a heterodimeric form of b with just one of the subunits extending to the C terminus would foster assembly and function of ATP synthase (39Grabar T.B. Kim B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31205-31211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because formation of a disulfide bond between position 83 of one b subunit and position 90 of the other b subunit locks the polypeptide with 90C in the bN position, and the polypeptide with 83C in the bC position (see Fig. 1C), we were able to ask which of the two b subunits must extend to the normal C terminus, Leu-156, by incorporating the four-residue C-terminal deletion into the constructs bearing either of the cysteine mutations. Through disulfide formation and subsequent purification, we prepared heterodimers in which the final four residues were deleted from bN only, bC only, or from both of the polypeptides. These constructs were tested for their ability to compete for F1 binding using the competitive assay (Fig. 5). As before, both the wild-type control and offset disulfide-linked dimer with both C termini intact (bC × bN) competed effectively, as indicated by the strong reduction in F1 bound to the resin. Notably, the C-terminal truncation of bN strongly reduced competition for F1, whereas the C-terminal truncation of bC had a much less significant effect (the truncation of polypeptides is indicated in the figure by the subscript Δ4). As expected, controls with deletion of the C-terminal residues on both subunits, either offset or in-register, showed no competition for F1. These results indicate that the C-terminal residues of bN play the mor"
https://openalex.org/W2097074526,"The CHO1-encoded phosphatidylserine synthase (CDP-diacylglycerol:l-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.8) is one of the most highly regulated phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CHO1 expression is regulated by nutrient availability through a regulatory circuit involving a UASINO cis-acting element in the CHO1 promoter, the positive transcription factors Ino2p and Ino4p, and the transcriptional repressor Opi1p. In this work, we examined the post-transcriptional regulation of CHO1 by mRNA stability. CHO1 mRNA was stabilized in mutants defective in deadenylation (ccr4Δ), mRNA decapping (dcp1), and the 5′–3′-exonuclease (xrn1), indicating that the CHO1 transcript is primarily degraded through the general 5′–3′ mRNA decay pathway. In respiratory-sufficient cells, the CHO1 transcript was moderately stable with a half-life of 12 min. However, the CHO1 transcript was stabilized to a half-life of >45 min in respiratory-deficient (rho– and rhoo) cells, the cox4Δ mutant defective in the cytochrome c oxidase, and wild type cells treated with KCN (a cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor). The increased CHO1 mRNA stability in response to respiratory deficiency caused increases in CHO1 mRNA abundance, phosphatidylserine synthase protein and activity, and the synthesis of phosphatidylserine in vivo. Respiratory deficiency also caused increases in the activities of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, and the phospholipid methyltransferases. Phosphatidylinositol synthase and choline kinase activities were not affected by respiratory deficiency.

PS synthase is an integral membrane protein that is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (7Natter K. Kim P. Faschinger A. Wolinski H. McCraith S. Fields S. Kohlwein S.D. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 662-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the formation of PS by a Mn2+-dependent sequential reaction by displacing CMP from CDP-DAG with serine (8Bae-Lee M. Kim G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10857-10862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction product PS is a major structural component of yeast membranes accounting for 4–18% of total phospholipids depending on growth conditions (9Rattray J.B. Kim A. Kidby D.K. Bacteriol.

PS also serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the most abundant membrane phospholipids PE (20–32%) and PC (35–55%) that are synthesized by the de novo CDP-DAG pathway (Fig. 1) (5Carman G.M. Kim S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 9Rattray J.B. Kim A. Kidby D.K. Bacteriol. Rev. 1975; 39: 197-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cho1 mutants defective in PS synthase activity can still synthesize PE and PC if they are supplemented with ethanolamine or choline; indeed, cho1 mutants are ethanolamine/choline auxotrophs (12Atkinson K.

Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ethanolamine is used for PE synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway (Fig. 1). The PE synthesized by the Kennedy pathway may be methylated to PC via the CDP-DAG pathway (Fig. 1). Choline is used for PC synthesis via the CDP-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway (Fig. 1). In wild type cells, both the CDP-DAG and Kennedy pathways contribute to the synthesis of PC regardless of whether choline is supplemented to the growth medium (14Morash S.C. Kim C.R. Hjelmstad R.H.

If choline is not present in the growth medium, the choline required for the Kennedy pathway is derived from the phospholipase D-mediated turnover of PC synthesized by way of the CDP-DAG pathway (19Patton-Vogt J.L.

In addition, the phosphorylation of the enzyme inhibits its activity, whereas dephosphorylation stimulates its activity (26Kinney A.J. Kim G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The zinc-mediated regulation of CHO1 occurs in the absence of inositol supplementation (32Iwanyshyn W.M. Kim G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Repression of CHO1 also occurs when cells enter the stationary phase of growth (33Homann M.J. Kim M.A. Gaynor P.M. Ho C.-T. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 533-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lamping E. Kim J. Paltauf F. Henry S.A. Kohlwein S.D. Genetics. 1995; 137: 55-65Crossref Google Scholar). These forms of regulation are dependent on the UASINO cis-acting element in the promoter of the CHO1 gene (21Chen M. Kim L.C. Lopes J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The derepression of CHO1 is mediated by a heterodimer complex of the positive transcription factors Ino2p and Ino4p that bind to a UASINO cis-acting element to drive transcription (5Carman G.M. Kim S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 21Chen M. Kim L.C. Lopes J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of CHO1 is mediated by the repressor Opi1p, which interacts with Ino2p to attenuate transcription (5Carman G.M. Kim S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 21Chen M. Kim L.C. Lopes J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Opi1p repressor function is regulated by the cellular concentration of PA, which helps anchor the repressor to the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane apart from the Ino2p-Ino4p complex bound to the UASINO element (37Loewen C.J.R. Kim M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). PA concentration and Opi1p repressor function is mediated in part by the PAH1-encoded Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase enzyme (38Santos-Rosa H. Kim J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 39Han G.-S. Kim W.-I. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Sci. 2006; 31: 694-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) whereby activation of Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase activity results in a decrease in PA concentration followed by the translocation of Opi1p into the nucleus for interaction with Ino2p to repress CHO1 transcription. As discussed above for the biochemical regulation of PS synthase activity, the repression of CHO1 favors PI synthesis and the Kennedy pathway for PC synthesis (5Carman G.M. Kim S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Decay analysis of CHO1 mRNA in a cki1Δ eki1Δ mutant defective in the synthesis of phospholipids via the Kennedy pathway (Fig. 1) has revealed a novel mechanism by which CHO1 expression is regulated independent of the UASINO element in the CHO1 promoter (42Choi H.S. Kim A. Han G.-S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12081-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In wild type cells, CHO1 mRNA is moderately stable with a half-life of 12 min when compared with other S. cerevisiae mRNAs that have half-lives ranging from 1 to 60 min (43Herrick D. Kim R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, CHO1 mRNA is greatly stabilized with a half-life >45 min in the cki1Δ eki1Δ (KS106) mutant (42Choi H.S. Kim A. Han G.-S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12081-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This results in increased levels of the PS synthase protein and its associated activity (42Choi H.S. Kim A. Han G.-S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12081-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The objective of this work was to identify an intermediate or end product of the Kennedy pathway that was responsible for regulation of CHO1 mRNA stability. During the course of this work, we discovered that the stabilization of CHO1 mRNA was not mediated by components of the Kennedy pathway, but instead it was mediated by a defect in mitochondrial respiration. This work underscores the importance of respiration to the regulation of phospholipid synthesis and advances our understanding of PS synthase regulation in yeast.
