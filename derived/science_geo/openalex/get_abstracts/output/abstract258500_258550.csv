However, adult cells do not express endothelial markers, but instead express markers of pericytes, such as NG2 proteoglycan and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and can be prospectively isolated from freshly dissociated ALP(+) cells. Unlike canonical myogenic precursors (satellite cells), pericyte-derived cells express myogenic markers only in differentiated myotubes, which they form spontaneously with high efficiency. When transplanted into severe combined immune deficient-X-linked, mouse muscular dystrophy (scid-mdx) mice, pericyte-derived cells colonize host muscle and generate numerous fibres expressing human dystrophin. Similar cells isolated from Duchenne patients, and engineered to express human mini-dystrophin, also give rise to many dystrophin-positive fibres in vivo. These data show that myogenic precursors, distinct from satellite cells, are associated with microvascular walls in the human skeletal muscle, may represent a correlate of embryonic 'mesoangioblasts' present after birth and may be a promising candidate for future cell-therapy protocols in patients."

To test their contribution at the network and the behavioral level, we generated genetically modified mice in which the excitatory drive was selectively reduced either by the knockout of the GluR-D or by conditional ablation of the GluR-A subunit in parvalbumin-positive cells. Comparable cell type-specific reductions of AMPA-mediated currents were obtained. Kainate-induced gamma oscillations exhibited reduced power in hippocampal slices from GluR-D−/− and GluR-APVCre−/− mice. Experimental and modeling data indicated that this alteration could be accounted for by imprecise spike timing of fast-spiking cells (FS) caused by smaller interneuronal EPSPs. GluR-D−/− and GluR-APVCre−/− mice exhibited similar impairments in hippocampus-dependent tasks. These findings directly show the effects of insufficient recruitment of fast-spiking cells at the network and behavioral level and demonstrate the role of this subpopulation for working and episodic-like memory.

GABAergic interneurons are the main source of inhibition in the brain, but in addition there is increasing evidence for their pivotal role in synchronous network activity. GABAergic interneurons can phase the output of pyramidal cells, giving rise to oscillatory activity in different frequency bands (Cobb et al., 1995Cobb S.R. Buhl E.H. Halasy K. Paulsen O. Somogyi P.

This form of network activity is associated with a number of cognitive functions and plasticity in the brain (Engel et al., 2001Engel A.K. Fries P. Singer W.

Numerous anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular studies have identified features of GABAergic interneurons that enable this cell population to control network activity (Buzsaki et al., 2004Buzsaki G.

Fisahn A. Interneurons unbound.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Thus, extensive axonal arborization permits most GABAergic interneurons to control the activity of large neuronal ensembles (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsaki G.

Neurol. 2002; 443: 346-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Expression studies identified a number of genes that are predominantly or exclusively expressed in GABAergic interneurons (Tansey et al., 2002Tansey E.P. Chow A. Rudy B. McBain C.J. Developmental expression of potassium-channel subunit Kv3.2 within subpopulations of mouse hippocampal inhibitory interneurons.Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although not entirely satisfactory and comprehensive, some of their unique features have served to classify GABAergic neurons (Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A.

Origin and classification of neocortical interneurons.Neuron. 2005; 48: 524-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Considering the heterogeneity of GABAergic interneurons, an obvious question arises as to their functional role in vivo. Of all GABAergic interneuron subgroups, cells expressing the Ca2+ buffer parvalbumin (PV) are certainly among the most and best studied. This is in part due to their prevalence—they comprise about 20% of the total GABAergic population and are hence more numerous compared to other subtypes. Also, the availability of specific antibodies (Celio et al., 1988Celio M.R. Baier W. Scharer L. de Viragh P.A. Gerday C. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the calcium binding protein parvalbumin.Cell Calcium. 1988; 9: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) has been of great value for anatomical studies that revealed the axonal arborization pattern of this cell population and showed that many of them preferentially target the perisomatic compartment of other neurons (Katsumaru et al., 1988Katsumaru H. Kosaka T. Heizmann C.W. Hama K. Immunocytochemical study of GABAergic neurons containing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin in the rat hippocampus.Exp. Brain Res. 1988; 72: 347-362PubMed Google Scholar, Ribak et al., 1990Ribak C.E. Nitsch R. Seress L. Proportion of parvalbumin-positive basket cells in the GABAergic innervation of pyramidal and granule cells of the rat hippocampal formation.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 300: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Finally, the finding that PV-positive cells were characterized by a fast-spiking action potential pattern upon depolarization (Kawaguchi et al., 1987Kawaguchi Y. Katsumaru H. Kosaka T. Heizmann C.W. Hama K. Fast spiking cells in rat hippocampus (CA1 region) contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin.Brain Res. 1987; 416: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was of great importance, and many electrophysiological studies relied on this spiking pattern that became the signature of this cell class. It was this feature that allowed their identification in the acute slice preparation and that, in combination with molecular studies, led to the identification of genes. Although it is well known that alteration of inhibition has profound effects at the network level, it is surprising that only few attempts have been made so far to alter the function of GABAergic interneurons in general or of certain subsets in particular (Joho et al., 1999Joho R.H. Ho C.S. Marks G.A. Increased gamma- and decreased delta-oscillations in a mouse deficient for a potassium channel expressed in fast-spiking interneurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar, Vreugdenhil et al., 2003Vreugdenhil M. Jefferys J.G. Celio M.R. Schwaller B. Parvalbumin-deficiency facilitates repetitive IPSCs and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1414-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mice with altered glutamate receptors and hence changed excitability have proved to be valuable models to study different forms of learning and plasticity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, specific knockouts of NMDA or AMPA receptor subunits were shown to be associated with altered plasticity and learning (Reisel et al., 2002Reisel D. Bannerman D.M. Schmitt W.B. Deacon R.M.

In these studies, a link was made between changed receptor expression in pyramidal cells and learning, although, at least in several models, the genetic modification affected interneurons as well. The present study examines the effect of reduced excitability in GABAergic interneurons at the network and behavioral level. We chose to reduce the excitatory drive in specific GABAergic interneurons, the PV-positive cells, by genetic modification of their AMPA receptors. Two mouse models with reduced excitatory drive on PV-positive interneurons were generated: the selective reduction of the AMPA-mediated current in PV-positive neurons was achieved either by the knockout of the GluR-D or of the GluR-A subunit in PV-positive GABAergic interneurons. The choice of the two knockouts was based on previous studies that had shown differential expression of AMPA receptor subtypes in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex.

It was also shown that the differential expression pattern in pyramidal and GABAergic interneurons accounted for functional differences of AMPA receptors in the two cell populations (Geiger et al., 1995Geiger J.R. Melcher T. Koh D.S. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Jonas P. Monyer H.

The two genetic manipulations selectively affected mainly PV-positive/FS cells, and the reduction of AMPA receptor-mediated current was comparable in GluR-D−/− and in GluR-APVCre−/− mice. The functional role of this neuronal type for the generation and maintenance of synchronous gamma oscillations had been demonstrated in several studies (Gloveli et al., 2005Gloveli T. Dugladze T. Saha S. Monyer H. Heinemann U. Traub R.D. Whittington M.A. Buhl E.H. Differential involvement of oriens/pyramidale interneurones in hippocampal network oscillations in vitro.J.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6651-6665PubMed Google Scholar). To directly show the effect of reduced PV-positive cell recruitment for hippocampal neuronal networks, we studied kainate-induced gamma oscillations in acute hippocampal slices from GluR-D−/− and in GluR-APVCre−/− mice. Although AMPA receptor subunit expression in hippocampal pyramidal neurons remained unchanged, alterations in the population activity of pyramidal cells occurred, as indicated by reduction in power of gamma oscillations in both models. Even though the genetic manipulations described here are discrete and affect only a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons, their reduced recruitment is associated with impairments in specific hippocampus-dependent behavioral tasks in GluR-D−/− and GluR-APVCre−/− mice. The observed deficits at the behavioral level were also similar in both models, indicating that sufficient excitation of PV-positive/FS interneurons is essential for several complex network activities. GluR-D−/− mice were generated using the Cre-lox system, and the removal of exon 11 led to the deletion of the first two transmembrane regions of the GluR-D subunit (Figure 1A, upper left panel). Successful targeting of the GluR-D locus and the subsequent establishment of the GluR-D−/− mice was verified using Southern blot analysis (Figure 1A, upper right panel). The deletion of the subunit was verified by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, which revealed the absence of the signal that is present in the wild-type (wt) (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online; Figure 1A, lower panels, left). GluR-D expression has been previously demonstrated in identified FS cells in the hippocampus (Angulo et al., 1997Angulo M.C. Lambolez B. Audinat E. Hestrin S. Rossier J.

Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). FS cells are a major subclass of GABAergic interneurons, and they are known to express PV (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsaki G.

Neurol. 2002; 443: 346-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To assess the overall colocalization of GluR-D and PV in the hippocampus, double-labeling immunocytochemistry studies were carried out (Figure 1A, lower panels, right). The quantitative evaluation revealed that in fact the majority of GluR-D-positive cells in the hippocampus are PV positive. Thus, in CA1, 86.6% ± 9.15% and, in CA3, 82.3% ± 9% of GluR-D-positive neurons (slices from three animals) contain PV. To demonstrate that the FS cells analyzed in this study are indeed PV positive, biocytin-filled FS cells in the CA1 region were analyzed for PV expression (Figure S4). In GluR-D−/−, mice the pattern and number of PV-positive cells is not altered (data not shown), indicating that the development and survival of this cell population is not affected by the lack of the GluR-D subunit. GluR-D expression was also found in calbindin (CB)-positive cells in stratum radiatum, constituting thereby a minor population of GluR-D-expressing neurons. Somatostatin-positive oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells do not express GluR-D. Since the GluR-A subunit is expressed in pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons, a selective ablation in PV-positive cells required the generation of transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase in this cell population. Hence, transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase under the control of the PV-promotor were generated. The bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technique (Meyer et al., 2002Meyer A.H. Katona I. Blatow M. Rozov A. Monyer H. In vivo labeling of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and analysis of electrical coupling in identified neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7055-7064PubMed Google Scholar) was used, and out of two lines with detectable Cre recombinase expression in PV-positive interneurons (data not shown), one line was chosen for further analysis (Figure 1B). To determine the pattern of PV-driven Cre-mediated recombination in transgenic mice, they were crossed with mice carrying the reporter R26R (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). In the R26R strain, Cre-mediated recombination enables expression of lacZ-encoded β-galactosidase. The pattern of lacZ expression in adult PVCre; R26R corresponded to that described for PV-positive interneurons in the hippocampus (Celio, 1990Celio M.R. Calbindin D-28k and parvalbumin in the rat nervous system.Neuroscience. 1990; 35: 375-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, Kosaka et al., 1987Kosaka T. Katsumaru H. Hama K. Wu J.Y. Heizmann C.W. GABAergic neurons containing the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin in the rat hippocampus and dentate gyrus.Brain Res. 1987; 419: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and indeed, we could detect PV immunoreactivity in the majority of lacZ-positive cells (Figure 1B). In cortex, Cre recombinase activity was found only in a subpopulation of PV-positive cells and in a low number of PV-positive cells in other brain regions, such as amygdala and striatum (Figure S2). The selective knockout of GluR-A in PV-positive interneurons was generated by breeding PVCre mice with GluR-A2lox mice carrying a “floxed” exon 11 of the GluR-A subunit (Zamanillo et al., 1999Zamanillo D. Sprengel R. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Kaiser K.M. Koster H.J. Borchardt T. Worley P. et al.Importance of AMPA receptors for hippocampal synaptic plasticity but not for spatial learning.Science. 1999; 284: 1805-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the selective ablation of GluR-A, double-labeling immunocytochemistry studies were carried out, and colocalization of GluR-A and PV in the adult hippocampus and other brain regions of control (homozygous GluR-A2lox mice) and GluR-APVCre−/− mice was investigated (Figure 1C and Figure S2). Expression of GluR-A could be detected in PV-positive cells in the control but not in the hippocampus of adult GluR-APVCre−/− mice. The effective loss of GluR-A expression is determined both by the transgene expression plus the expression of the endogenous “floxed” gene (here GluR-A) (Figure S3). Thus, this approach resulted in a preferential loss of GluR-A in PV-positive interneurons of the hippocampus but less in interneurons of other brain regions. The predominant expression of GluR-D in PV-positive cells permits the prediction that at a functional level the cell population that will be most significantly affected is comprised of FS cells. Indeed, electrophysiological studies carried out in FS, CB, and OLM cells of the hippocampal CA1 region revealed that the functional change preferentially affected FS cells (Figures 2A and 2B). Identification of the recorded GABAergic interneurons was based on the spiking pattern and confirmed by immunocytochemistry studies (Figure S4). Evoked synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated currents in FS cells in P14 GluR-D−/− mice were strongly reduced compared to those in wt controls as indicated by a much smaller AMPA/NMDA ratio that was 4.2 ± 1.5 in wt (n = 12 cells from 5 animals) and 1.6 ± 0.3 in GluR-D−/− mice (n = 13 cells from 4 animals; p < 0.001). In CB cells, reduction of the AMPA component was also seen, but to a lesser degree; AMPA/NMDA ratios were 2.19 ± 0.5 in the wt and 1.52 ± 0.39 in the GluR-D−/− mice; n = 8 cells each from 3 and 4 animals, respectively; p < 0.01). In contrast, the relative amplitude of synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated currents in OLM cells remained unchanged. AMPA/NMDA ratios were 1.72 ± 0.32 and 1.93 ± 0.44 in wt and GluR-D−/−, respectively (n = 9 from 2 animals each). Most importantly, the GluR-D deletion did not cause any reduction of AMPA currents in pyramidal cells where AMPA/NMDA ratios were 3.45 ± 1.12 in wt and 3.28 ± 1.1 in GluR-D−/− (n = 6 cells from 2 animals each). Analysis of kinetic properties of spontaneous AMPA receptor-mediated currents in FS cells revealed that the rise time was not significantly different in wt and in GluR-D−/− mice. However, the decay time in FS cells in GluR-D−/− mice was slower (2.29 ± 0.73 ms in wt; 2.92 ± 0.9 ms in GluR-D−/−; n = 6 cells for each; p < 0.001). This is consistent with previous studies showing that GluR-D expression in FS cells is an important determinant for the fast AMPA receptor deactivation in this cell population (Angulo et al., 1997Angulo M.C. Lambolez B. Audinat E. Hestrin S. Rossier J. Subunit composition, kinetic, and permeation properties of AMPA receptors in single neocortical nonpyramidal cells.J.

Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In GluR-D−/− mice, there was no change in kinetic properties of synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated currents in pyramidal cells as compared to controls (data not shown). Based on these studies of synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated currents in identified cells, one can conclude that the major effect of the GluR-D deletion will be an insufficient excitation of FS cells and hence reduced perisomatic inhibition that normally derives to a large extent from this cell population. In GluR-APVCre−/− mice, a reduction of the AMPA current is expected to occur only at later developmental stages for two reasons. First, Cre recombinase is not expressed before the second postnatal week since it is under control of the parvalbumin promoter (Solbach and Celio, 1991Solbach S. Celio M.R. Ontogeny of the calcium binding protein parvalbumin in the rat nervous system.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1991; 184: 103-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, Soriano et al., 1992Soriano E. Del Rio J.A. Ferrer I. Auladell C. De Lecea L. Alcantara S. Late appearance of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the rodent cerebral cortex does not follow an ‘inside-out’ sequence.Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 142: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Second, some time is required before Cre-mediated recombination occurs in both GluR-A alleles. Indeed, no reduction of the AMPA current was found in FS cells at P14 in GluR-APVCre−/− mice. A functional change, however, could be measured in the adult (P42). AMPA/NMDA ratio experiments revealed that the excitatory drive on PV-positive interneurons was significantly reduced in P42 GluR-APVCre−/− mice (Figure 2C). The appropriate “controls” for these experiments were FS cells from mice expressing either only the Cre recombinase (PvCre mice) or from mice with the “floxed” GluR-A alleles. In GluR-APVCre−/− mice, the AMPA/NMDA ratio was 2.8 ± 0.8 (n = 10 cells from 3 animals) compared to 3.9 ± 0.8 (n = 7 cells from 2 animals) in GluR-A2lox animals and 3.8 ± 0.9 (n = 8 cells from 4 animals) in PvCre animals (t test with Bonferroni correction, p < 0.05). To compare the reduction of AMPA-mediated currents in GluR-APVCre−/− mice with those in GluR-D−/− mice, measurements were also carried out at P42 for GluR-D−/− animals. The AMPA/NMDA ratio was 2.8 ± 1 (n = 10 from 6 animals) in GluR-D−/− compared to 4.1 ± 1.4 (n = 10 cells from 3 animals) in wt littermates (p < 0.05). Thus, a comparable reduction of the excitatory input onto PV-positive interneurons could be demonstrated at P42 in GluR-D−/− and GluR-APVCre−/− mice. The decay time of evoked EPSCs in FS cells was slower in GluR-D−/− but was not changed in GluR-APVCre−/− mice compared to controls (data not shown). To assess the effect of reduced excitation on FS cells in the mutants, their output was studied and compared to controls (Figure 3). Firing activity of CA1 FS and pyramidal cells were evoked by rhythmic extracellular stimulation (nine pulses at 20 Hz) in the CA3 region in GluR-D−/−, GluR-APVCre−/−, and wt mice. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were performed simultaneously from an FS cell and an adjacent CA1 pyramidal cell at P42. In both mutants, stronger stimuli were required to induce AP firing in FS"

However, their relationship to normal CNS progenitors, including dependence on common lineage-restricted pathways, is unclear. We observe expression of the CNS-restricted transcription factor, OLIG2, in human glioma stem and progenitor cells reminiscent of type C transit-amplifying cells in germinal zones of the adult brain. Olig2 function is required for proliferation of neural progenitors and for glioma formation in a genetically relevant murine model. Moreover, we show p21WAF1/CIP1, a tumor suppressor and inhibitor of stem cell proliferation, is directly repressed by OLIG2 in neural progenitors and gliomas. Our findings identify an Olig2-regulated lineage-restricted pathway critical for proliferation of normal and tumorigenic CNS stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W2051695714,"The spread of retroviruses between cells is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient when cells can physically interact with each other. The underlying mechanism is largely unknown, but transfer is believed to occur through large-surface interfaces, called virological or infectious synapses. Here, we report the direct visualization of cell-to-cell transmission of retroviruses in living cells. Our results reveal a mechanism of virus transport from infected to non-infected cells, involving thin filopodial bridges. These filopodia originate from non-infected cells and interact, through their tips, with infected cells. A strong association of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) in an infected cell with the receptor molecules in a target cell generates a stable bridge. Viruses then move along the outer surface of the filopodial bridge toward the target cell. Our data suggest that retroviruses spread by exploiting an inherent ability of filopodia to transport ligands from cell to cell."

https://openalex.org/W2143492062,"How does a visual search goal modulate the activity of neurons encoding different visual features (e.g., color, direction of motion)? Previous research suggests that goal-driven attention enhances the gain of neurons representing the target's visual features. Here, we present mathematical and behavioral evidence that this strategy is suboptimal and that humans do not deploy it. We formally derive the optimal feature gain modulation theory, which combines information from both the target and distracting clutter to maximize the relative salience of the target. We qualitatively validate the theory against existing electrophysiological and psychophysical literature. A surprising prediction is that it is sometimes optimal to enhance nontarget features. We provide experimental evidence toward this through psychophysics experiments on human subjects, thus suggesting that humans deploy the optimal gain modulation strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2123701707,"NMDA receptors promote neuronal survival but also cause cell degeneration and neuron loss. The mechanisms underlying these opposite effects on neuronal fate are unknown. Whole-genome expression profiling revealed that NMDA receptor signaling is decoded at the genomic level through activation of two distinct, largely nonoverlapping gene-expression programs. The location of the NMDA receptor activated specifies the transcriptional response: synaptic NMDA receptors induce a coordinate upregulation of newly identified pro-survival genes and downregulation of pro-death genes. Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors fail to activate this neuroprotective program, but instead induce expression of Clca1, a putative calcium-activated chloride channel that kills neurons. These results help explain the opposing roles of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors on neuronal fate. They also demonstrate that the survival function is implemented in neurons through a multicomponent system of functionally related genes, whose coordinate expression is controlled by specific calcium signal initiation sites."

https://openalex.org/W2105726658,"Flying insects have evolved sophisticated sensory capabilities to achieve rapid course control during aerial maneuvers. Among two-winged insects such as houseflies and their relatives, the hind wings are modified into club-shaped, mechanosensory halteres, which detect Coriolis forces and thereby mediate flight stability during maneuvers. Here, we show that mechanosensory input from the antennae serves a similar role during flight in hawk moths, which are four-winged insects. The antennae of flying moths vibrate and experience Coriolis forces during aerial maneuvers. The antennal vibrations are transduced by individual units of Johnston's organs at the base of their antennae in a frequency range characteristic of the Coriolis input. Reduction of the mechanical input to Johnston's organs by removing the antennal flagellum of these moths severely disrupted their flight stability, but reattachment of the flagellum restored their flight control. The antennae thus play a crucial role in maintaining flight stability of moths."
https://openalex.org/W2122252852,"Recent studies have ascribed many non-pumping functions to the Na/K-ATPase. Here, we present experimental evidence demonstrating that over half of the plasma membrane Na/K-ATPase in LLC-PK1 cells is performing cellular functions other than ion pumping. This “non-pumping” pool of Na/K-ATPase, like the pumping pump, binds ouabain. Depletion of either cholesterol or caveolin-1 moves some of the “non-pumping” Na/K-ATPase into the pumping pool. Graded knock-down of the α1 subunit of the Na/K-ATPase eventually results in loss of this “non-pumping” pool while preserving the pumping pool. Our prior studies indicate that a loss of the non-pumping pool is associated with a loss of receptor function as evidenced by the failure of ouabain administration to induce the activation of Src and/or ERK. Therefore, our new findings suggest that a substantial amount of surface-expressed Na/K-ATPase, at least in some types of cells, may function as non-canonical ouabain-binding receptors.

Therefore, our new findings suggest that a substantial amount of surface-expressed Na/K-ATPase, at least in some types of cells, may function as non-canonical ouabain-binding receptors. Na/K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein found in most mammalian cells. It was initially discovered as an energy transducing ion pump that transports 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ into the cell by hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP (1Lingrel J.B. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). This pumping process generates the transmembrane chemical and electrical gradients that are essential to the excitable activity of muscle and nerve tissue, as well as the regulation of cell volume and a number of Na+-coupled transporters. Interestingly, evidence accumulated during the last 10 years indicates that the same Na/K-ATPase also serves as a signaling receptor. This non-canonical function depends on interactions of the Na/K-ATPase with various proteins including protein and lipid kinases, membrane transporters, channels, and cellular receptors (3Bertorello A.M.

Binding of either endogenous or exogenous cardiotonic steroids, such as ouabain, to this receptor/protein complex evokes protein and lipid kinase cascades, thus generating a large number of secondary messengers (4Tian J.

Specifically, we have shown that the Na/K-ATPase is capable of interacting with Src via multiple domains in vitro. Furthermore, the interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and Src keeps Src in an inactive state. Binding of ouabain to the Na/K-ATPase/Src complex changes the interaction, resulting in activation of the associated Src (4Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.Y. Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, the receptor Na/K-ATPase resides with Src in caveolae (11Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Once the Na/K-ATPase/Src complex is activated by ouabain, it stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream effectors, which in turn recruits additional kinases and adaptor proteins to the activated receptors, resulting in the activation of protein kinase cascades and the generation of second messengers (4Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.Y. Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To further prove the above Na/K-ATPase-specific signaling mechanism, we have generated several α1 knock-down cell lines using a siRNA-based approach. These cell lines (e.g. A4-11 and PY-17) were cloned from LLC-PK1 cells that were transfected with an α1-specific siRNA-expressing vector (12Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). While A4-11 cells express about 44% of α1 subunit in comparison to the control P-11 cells, PY-17 cells contain only 8% of the α1 subunit. Functional studies indicated that graded knock-down of α1 decreased the interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and Src, and resulted in an increase in basal Src activity. Concomitantly, it also abolished ouabain-induced activation of Src and the downstream protein kinase cascade (12Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These findings clearly demonstrate that there is a pool of Src-interacting Na/K-ATPase, thus providing further support to the above newly discovered cellular signaling mechanism. They also suggest that there may be two functionally separable pools of Na/K-ATPase in the plasma membrane, one performing the canonical (pumping) function, the other carrying out non-canonical functions such as signal transduction and scaffolding. To test this hypothesis, we have further characterized the ion-pumping activity of Na/K-ATPase in the established α1 knockdown cells. The data presented here clearly demonstrate the existence of a pool of non-pumping Na/K-ATPase in the plasma membrane. Materials—Image-iT FX signal enhancer, Antifade kit, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-Na/K-ATPase β1 (clone C464.8) antibody was from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Giantin antibody was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). The monoclonal anti-α1 antibody (α6F) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa. All the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Radio-active 86Rb+ and [3H]ouabain were from PerkinElmer Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Cell Culture—The α1 knock-down stable cell lines were generated from LLC-PK1 cells and cultured in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM) 3The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin. as described (12Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Most of the experiments were performed after the cells reached 90% confluence. To test whether polarity affects the conclusion of our studies, cells were also cultured on Transwell inserts and used when the monolayer was formed (13Liu J. Kesiry R. Periyasamy S.M. Malhotra D. Xie Z. Shapiro J.I. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 227-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because serum-starved cells were used for our prior studies of non-pumping function of the Na/K-ATPase (12Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), to be consistent, cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then used for studies of pumping functions. Cell Surface Biotinylation, Streptavidin Precipitation, and Immunoblot—Labeling with biotin of plasmalemma proteins was performed with modifications according to the protocol described by Gottardi et al. (14Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, cells grown on 60-mm Petri dishes were washed once with a nominally Ca2+-free DMEM (15Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and placed on ice. Afterward, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and incubated with 2 ml of NHS-ss-biotin freshly diluted into biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 9.0, 150 mm NaCl) for 25 min at 4 °C with very gentle horizontal motion to ensure mixing. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS containing 100 mm glycine, and washed in this buffer for 20 min at 4 °C to make certain that all of the un-reacted biotin was quenched. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS to wash away the quenched biotin, and solubilized in 900 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 60 min on ice. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Control experiments showed that nearly all of the cellular Na/K-ATPase was solubilized, which is consistent with prior observations (16Liu L. Mohammadi K. Aynafshar B. Wang H. Li D. Liu J. Ivanov A.V. Xie Z. Askari A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1550-C1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To label the cells grown on Transwell inserts, the same protocol was followed after the cells were first incubated in PBS solution containing 1 mm EDTA for 5 min (14Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylation buffer was then added to the apical side of the Transwell. According to Gottardi et al. (14Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pretreatment of polarized cell cultures with PBS-EDTA solution completely opens the tight junction for the apically added biotinylation buffer to access the basolateral Na/K-ATPase (14Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleared cell lysate (750 μl) was collected and incubated overnight with 100 μl of packed streptavidin-agarose beads at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The supernatant was then collected, and 1:10 of the total volume was loaded on the polyacrylamide gel as unbound fraction (U), together with 1:10 of the cleared lysate as total (T). Protein signal was detected using an ECL kit and quantified by Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—The subcellular localization of Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit and Giantin was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. Cells cultured on cover slips were washed twice with PBS and fixed with methanol prechilled at -20 °C. The fixed cells were then rinsed with PBS for three times and blocked with 200 μl of Image-iT FX signal enhancer for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-Na/K-ATPase β1 and anti-Giantin) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, followed by incubation with secondary Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies. Image visualization was performed by Leica TCS-SP2 laser scanning microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ Uptake—Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was employed to measure the transport function of Na/K-ATPase (17Liu J. Periyasamy S.M. Gunning W. Fedorova O.V. Bagrov A.Y. Malhotra D. Xie Z. Shapiro J.I. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 12-well plates to 90% confluence, washed, and serum-starved overnight. After washing once with the fresh medium, the cells were incubated in the same medium at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of different concentrations of ouabain. Monensin (20 μm) was added to clamp intracellular Na+ to ensure maximal capacity of active uptake (18Haber R.S. Pressley T.A. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F26-F33PubMed Google Scholar). Then, 86Rb+ as the tracer for K+ (1 μCi/well) was added to start the uptake experiment. After 10 min, 3 ml of ice-cold 100 mm MgCl2 was added to stop the 86Rb+ uptake. Cells were then washed three times with the same solution. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble 86Rb+ was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated protein was dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, 0.2% SDS solution for protein assay. Preliminary experiments showed that the uptake was a linear function of time for up to 20 min. Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was about 85% of the total in control P-11 and LLC-PK1 cells, and about 70% in PY-17 cells. To test whether tight junction affects the measurement of 86Rb+ uptake in different cell lines, cells were incubated in nominally Ca2+-free DMEM medium containing 0.1 mm EGTA (15Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Afterward, the 86Rb+ uptake was conducted in this Ca2+-free medium as described in the above paragraphs. Prior studies have demonstrated that removal of extracellular Ca2+ was sufficient to open up tight junction (14Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Contreras R.G. Bolivar J.J. Ponce A. Chavez De Ramirez B. Cereijido M. Am. J.

Tech. 2000; 51: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For experiments using cells cultured on Transwell inserts, 86Rb+ solution was added to both apical and basolateral sides to measure the total pumping activity. Control experiments showed that the basolateral activity accounted for about 93% of total ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake. To measure Na/K/2Cl cotransporter activity, bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was conducted as previously described (21Gimenez I. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F1341-F1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This activity in P-11 and PY-17 cells accounted for less than 10 and 16% of the total uptake activity, respectively. [3H]Ouabain Binding—The number of ouabain binding sites in cultured cells was estimated by the protocol that had been previously used (with modifications) and discussed (22Lamb J.F. McCall D. J. Physiol. 1971; 213: 57P-58PPubMed Google Scholar, 23Baker P.F. Willis J.S. J. Physiol. 1972; 224: 441-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Griffiths N.M. Ogden P.H. Cormack R. Lamb J.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 104: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded into 12-well plates, cultured to 90% confluence, and then serum-starved overnight. Afterward, cells were rinsed, incubated in K+-free Kreb's solution (NaCl 142.4 mm; CaCl2 2.8 mm; NaH2PO4 0.6 mm; MgSO4 1.2 mm; dextrose 10 mm; Tris 15 mm; pH 7.4) in the presence of 20 μm monensin for 10 min, and then exposed to 2 μm [3H]ouabain for 15 min at 37 °C. Monensin was added to clamp intracellular Na+ and to prevent recycling of the Na/K-ATPase from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (25Iglesias-Bartolome R. Crespo P.M. Gomez G.A. Daniotti J.L. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1744-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Sorkina T. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that maximal binding was reached at 2 μm ouabain after 15 min of exposure in both P-11 and PY-17 cells. At the end of incubation, cells were washed four times with ice-cold K+-free Kreb's solution, solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH/0.2% SDS, and measured by a scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding, measured in the presence of 5 mm unlabeled ouabain, was less than 3% of total binding, and was subtracted from the total binding. Control experiments showed that PY-17 cells contained 0.21 ± 0.03 ng of protein/cell whereas P-11 had 0.19 ± 0.02 ng of protein/cell. The sizes of these cells are also similar: 15.0 ± 2.6 μm in diameter for P-11 cells and 16.0 ± 2.9 μm for PY-17 cells. Thus, the binding data were normalized by the cell numbers counted in paralleled dishes. To test whether tight junction affects the measurement of ouabain binding, the ouabain binding assay was performed in a nominally Ca2+- and K+-free Krebs solution in the presence of 0.1 mm EGTA as described above. The ouabain binding sites in P-11 cells under this condition were 8 × 105/cell, which is comparable to that (8.5 × 105/cell) in Ca2+-containing solution. For binding experiments in cells cultured on Transwell inserts, [3H]ouabain solution was added to both apical and basolateral sides to measure the total binding. The binding activity was normalized per mg total cellular proteins (3.6 × 1012/mg of protein in P-11 cells). [Na+]i Measurement—The relative intracellular Na+ content was measured according to Kim et al. (27Kim D. Barry W.H. Smith T.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 231: 326-333PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (28Kometiani P. Liu L. Askari A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured in 12-well plates were incubated at 37 °C in DMEM containing trace amounts of 22Na+ (0.5 μCi/ml) for 60 min. Control experiments showed that 60 min of incubation was sufficient to fully equilibrate the exchangeable intracellular Na+ with 22Na+ in both control and α1 knock-down cells. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold 100 mm MgCl2, and precipitated by trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-extractable 22Na+ was measured by a scintillation counter and the data were normalized by the cell number. [Na+]i Measurement with Fluoroprobe Sodium-binding Benzofuran Isophthalate (SBFI)—Intracellular Na+ concentration was measured as previously described (15Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, P-11 cells and PY-17 cells were loaded with 5 μm SBFI-AM in the presence of 0.075% pluronic for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed to remove the excess fluorescent dye. The cells were alternately illuminated by 340 nm and 380 nm UV light and the emission light at 520 nm was recorded. The emission ratio of 340/380 was used to calculate intracellular Na+ concentration based on the calibration curve constructed by varying extracellular Na+ in the presence of 10 μm gramicidin. The basal [Na+]i concentration in P-11 cells was 20 ± 2mm (n = 15). Data Analysis—Data presented are mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments, and statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. Pumping and Non-pumping Pools of Na/K-ATPase—We have recently demonstrated that knock-down of the cellular Na/K-ATPase reduces the size of a pool of Src-interacting Na/K-ATPase, resulting in an increase in basal Src activity and an inhibition of ouabain-induced Src activation (12Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These new findings led us to propose that there may be two functionally separable pools of Na/K-ATPase in cultured LLC-PK1 cells, one being the canonical ion pumping pool and the other being the non-pumping pool. Because cells need the pumping Na/K-ATPase to survive, we reasoned that knock-down of the cellular α1 subunit might preferentially deplete the non-pumping pool of Na/K-ATPase to preserve the pumping pool if these two different pools of Na/K-ATPase co-exist in the plasma membrane. Indeed, when total Na/K-ATPase activity was measured in the control and the α1 knock-down cells, we observed that while PY-17 cells expressed only 8% of the α1 protein, they exhibited 21% of ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity in comparison to the control P-11 cells (12Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These data support the notion that there is a pool of non-pumping Na/K-ATPase in the control P-11 cells. They also indicate that depletion of the α1 preferentially reduces the size of this non-pumping pool, resulting in a mismatch between the ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity and the α1 protein amount in the knock-down PY-17 cells. Because the ATPase activity was measured in the presence of alamethicin, the above assay determined the total Na/K-ATPase activity including the enzyme in the plasma membrane and other intracellular compartments (29Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could overestimate the actual pumping pool of Na/K-ATPase in the plasma membrane. Thus, to further assess how α1 knock-down affects the size of the pumping pool of Na/K-ATPase in the plasma membrane, we measured the ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake. Control experiments showed that ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake accounted for more than 85 and 70% of total uptake in the control and PY-17 cells, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the reduction of the α1 subunit content caused a roughly proportional decrease of the maximum pumping activity in A4-11 cells when compared with that of control P-11 cells (46 ± 2% of control). However, PY-17 cells that express 8% of the α1 subunit still exhibited about 42% of pumping activity. These findings provide further support to the notion that the control P-11 cells contain a large pool of non-pumping Na/K-ATPase.TABLE 1Comparison of Na/K-ATPase activities in different cellsCell linesP-11A4-11PY-17α1 content (%), n = 410044 ± 28 ± 3Pump activity (%), n = 4 (20 μm monensin)10046 ± 242 ± 3Bmax (%), n = 310045 ± 414 ± 4(Ouabain binding sites, × 104/cell)(85 ± 8)(38 ± 1)(12 ± 1) Open table in a new tab It is important to note that the above ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptakes were done in the presence of 20 μm monensin. Monensin increases the intracellular Na+ to a degree sufficient to maximally stimulate Na/K-ATPase activity (18Haber R.S. Pressley T.A. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F26-F33PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of monensin, PY-17 cells exhibited about 66% of pump activity compared with P-11 cells (Table 2). When intracellular Na+ was measured by 22Na+ equilibrium assay, we observed that the α1 knock-down significantly increased intracellular Na+ per cell. For example, intracellular Na+ in PY-17 cells was elevated to about 194% of that in P-11 cells (Table 2). To confirm these observations, we also measured intracellular Na+ concentration using a fluorescence probe SBFI in both P-11 and PY-17 cells, and observed a similar relative change as measured by 22Na+ equilibrium assay (Table 2). Importantly, while addition of monensin caused an 86% increase in ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake because of the increased turnover rate (or reserved pump capacity) in P-11 cells (18Haber R.S. Pressley T.A. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F26-F33PubMed Google Scholar), it failed to do so in PY-17 cells (Table 2). These data indicate that the pumps in PY-17 cells operated at the maximal pumping capacity, which is consistent with the fact that the Na+ content was almost doubled in these cells.TABLE 2Intracellular Na+ content and monensin-induced changes in the pump activity in different cellsCell linesP-11A4-11PY-17Pump activity in the absence of monensin (%), n = 410078 ± 366 ± 9Pump activity in the presence of monensin (% of P-11 activity in the absence of monensin)186 ± 9ap < 0.05 compared to P-11 in the absence of monensin.81 ± 274 ± 822Na+i (% of control), n = 4100161 ± 11194 ± 7[Na+]i (mm), n = 820 ± 2N/A36 ± 5a p < 0.05 compared to P-11 in the absence of monensin. Open table in a new tab Because LLC-PK1 cells can form tight junction when they are cultured at confluent density on Transwell porous inserts, it is prudent to rule out the possibility that the potential difference in tight junction formation among different cell lines may cause the observed mismatch between the pumping activity and the amount of Na/K-ATPase. Because the formation of tight junction requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (14Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Contreras R.G. Bolivar J.J. Ponce A. Chavez De Ramirez B. Cereijido M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C978-C986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we repeated the above functional assays after the cultures were incubated in a nominally Ca2+-free DMEM medium. As shown in Table 3, the pumping activity in PY-17 cells was 46% in comparison to that in control P-11 cells, which is essentially the same as that measured in the presence of extracellular Ca2+.TABLE 3Pumping activity and ouabain binding sites in cells cultured either in Ca2+ -free medium or on Transwell inserts (monolayer)Ca2+ -freeMonolayerCell linesP-11PY-17P-11PY-17Pump activity (%), n = 4 (20 μm monensin)10046 ± 310032 ± 5Ouabain binding site (%), n = 410014 ± 410014 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Because the above studies were done on cells cultured in Petri dishes, to further test whether fully polarized LLC-PK1 cells also contain a large pool of non-pumping Na/K-ATPase, we measured the pumping activity in cells cultured at confluent density on Transwell inserts. As shown in Table 3, PY-17 cells had about 32% of pumping activity in comparison to the control P-11 cells. Taken together, our findings clearly show that there is a large pool of non-pumping Na/K-ATPase in LLC-PK1 cells, cultured either in Petri dishes or on Transwell inserts. To test whether the α1 knock-down changes other K+ uptake mechanism, we measured Na/K/2Cl cotransporter mediated-86Rb+ uptake, and observed that bumetanide-sensitive uptake activity in PY-17 cells was comparable to that in P-11 cells (91 ± 3% of PY-17 cells, n = 5, p > 0.05). However, since intracellular Na+ was much higher in PY-17 cells, these data suggest that α1 knock-down probably up-regulated Na/K/2Cl cotransporter to maintain the similar transporter activity as in control P-11 cells. Because PY-17 cells exhibited a similar cell size as control P-11 cells, the above findings also suggest that α1 knock-down cells are likely adapted to the decreased Na/K-ATPase activity. Surface Distribution of Na/K-ATPase—The above data indicate that there may be a large pool of non-pumping Na/K-ATPase in the control P-11 cells. The formation of a functional pumping Na/K-ATPase requires the assembly of the αβ complex and the subsequent delivery of this complex to the plasma membrane. Although it is less likely, if most Na/K-ATPase in P-11 cells resided in cellular compartments other than the plasma membrane, this could account for the observed non-pumping pool. Thus, to rule this out, we performed the following two sets of experiments. Because the β subunit is essential for targeting Na/K-ATPase to the plasma membrane (30Geering K. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), in the first set of experiments we determined the effects of α1 knock-down on the expression and cellular distribution of the β1 subunit. As depicted in Fig. 1A, control P-11 cells presented at least three glycosylated β1 bands. The expression of these glycosylated β1 was significantly reduced in both A4-11 and PY-17 cells, and the reduction was correlated to the degrees of the α1 knock-down (Fig. 1A). When the density of the β1 band was normalized against all three glycosylated β1 bands in P-11 cells, we found that the β1in PY-17 cells was about 25% of that in P-11 cells. This was further confirmed by Western blot analysis of deglycosylated β1 prepared from these cell lysates (data not shown). Interestingly, knock-down of the α1 caused almost complete depletion of the two β1 bands that are highly glycosylated. As depicted in Fig. 1A, under normal exposure conditions, these two species were barely detectable in PY-17 cells. However, when the film was overexposed, we were able to detect the expression of these"

https://openalex.org/W2041923684,"TRPM8, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily, is expressed in thermosensitive neurons, in which it functions as a cold and menthol sensor. TRPM8 and most other temperature-sensitive TRP channels (thermoTRPs) are voltage gated; temperature and ligands regulate channel opening by shifting the voltage dependence of activation. The mechanisms and structures underlying gating of thermoTRPs are currently poorly understood. Here we show that charge-neutralizing mutations in transmembrane segment 4 (S4) and the S4-S5 linker of human TRPM8 reduce the channel's gating charge, which indicates that this region is part of the voltage sensor. Mutagenesis-induced changes in voltage sensitivity translated into altered thermal sensitivity, thereby establishing the strict coupling between voltage and temperature sensing. Specific mutations in this region also affected menthol affinity, which indicates a direct interaction between menthol and the TRPM8 voltage sensor. Based on these findings, we present a Monod-Wyman-Changeux–type model explaining the combined effects of voltage, temperature and menthol on TRPM8 gating."

It has not been shown, however, which of the two is the more decisive factor. We tested this issue at the calyx of Held synapse by combining Ca2+ uncaging and electrophysiological measurements of postsynaptic responses. After depletion of the synaptic vesicles that are responsible for synchronous release during action potentials, uniform elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by Ca2+ uncaging could still elicit rapid release. The Ca2+ sensitivity of remaining vesicles was reduced no more than 2-fold, which is insufficient to explain the slow-down of the kinetics of release (10-fold) observed during a depolarizing pulse. We conclude that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to sites where Ca2+ channels cluster, rather than fusion competence, is a limiting step for rapid neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic action potentials.

We conclude that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to sites where Ca2+ channels cluster, rather than fusion competence, is a limiting step for rapid neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic action potentials. Neurotransmitter is released within a millisecond in response to presynaptic action potentials (APs; Borst and Sakmann, 1996Borst J.G.G. Sakmann B. Calcium influx and transmitter release in a fast CNS synapse.Nature. 1996; 383: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The number of synaptic vesicles available for rapid release in response to APs determines the amplitude of postsynaptic responses (Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar, Stevens, 2003Stevens C.F. Neurotransmitter release at central synapses.Neuron. 2003; 40: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). If the releasable vesicles are depleted during a high-frequency train of presynaptic APs, synaptic responses will be depressed. On the contrary, if a large fraction of releasable vesicles still remains after a first AP, synaptic responses to subsequent ones will be facilitated due to accumulation of residual Ca2+ in the presynaptic terminal (Katz, 1969Katz B. The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, UK1969Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating these forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, however, are under debate. Recent studies on a number of glutamatergic synapses have demonstrated the existence of “reluctant” or slowly-releasing vesicles (Wu and Borst, 1999Wu L.G. Borst J.G.G. The reduced release probability of releasable vesicles during recovery from short-term synaptic depression.Neuron. 1999; 23: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, Hallermann et al., 2003Hallermann S.

Reluctant vesicles contribute to the total readily releasable pool in glutamatergic hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3842-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Typically, large postsynaptic responses can be elicited by strong stimuli (depolarizations of tens of milliseconds or tetanic stimulation) at a time when EPSCs in response to single APs are strongly depressed. At the calyx of Held, a glutamatergic synapse in the auditory pathway, the number of vesicles released during such strong depolarizations is about equal to the cumulative number of vesicles released during short, depressing trains of APs (Schneggenburger et al., 2002Schneggenburger R. Sakaba T. Neher E. Vesicle pools and short-term synaptic depression: lessons from a large synapse.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 206-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We address the question of why these reluctant vesicles cannot be released by APs. Several alternatives can be considered as an explanation. First, they may not be fully release competent and may reach the “primed” state only during prolonged depolarization or during a sustained rise in presynaptic [Ca2+]. Incomplete assembly of functional SNARE complexes or weak coupling of such complexes to the Ca2+ sensors may be the underlying molecular mechanism(s). Second, APs elevate [Ca2+] only in microdomains surrounding Ca2+ channel clusters (Roberts et al., 1990Roberts W.M. Jacobs R.A. Hudspeth A.J. Colocalization of ion channels involved in frequency selectivity and synaptic transmission at presynaptic active zones of hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3664-3684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Adler et al., 1991Adler E.M. Augustine G.J. Duffy S.N. Charlton M.P.

Sugimori M. Silver R.B. Microdomains of high calcium concentration in a presynaptic terminal.Science. 1992; 256: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). They may be unable to trigger release of vesicles outside of these microdomains, such that reluctant vesicles are activated only during sustained depolarization, when the [Ca2+] is globally elevated. Third, presynaptic Ca2+ influx may be decreased during repetitive stimulation. This last possibility can be excluded for the case of the calyx of Held, since measurements of Ca2+ currents during high-frequency trains, which lead to synaptic depression, show Ca2+ current facilitation, rather than inactivation (von Gersdorff and Borst, 2002von Gersdorff H. Borst J.G.G. Short-term plasticity at the calyx of Held.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Also, in the presence of botulinum neurotoxin A, which decreases Ca2+ sensitivity of the release apparatus, a strong facilitation of release is observed during high-frequency trains (Sakaba et al., 2005Sakaba T. Stein A. Jahn R. Neher E. Distinct kinetic changes in neurotransmitter release after SNARE protein cleavage.Science. 2005; 309: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), signaling a buildup of [Ca2+] at the release sites. We test the remaining two alternative possibilities at the calyx of Held in the present study, taking advantage of the unique experimental tools available (Borst and Sakmann, 1996Borst J.G.G. Sakmann B. Calcium influx and transmitter release in a fast CNS synapse.Nature. 1996; 383: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 1996Takahashi T. Forsythe I.D.

Comparing release induced by a depolarization with that elicited by spatially uniform [Ca2+] elevation after caged Ca2+ photolysis, we will show that the coupling between Ca2+ channels and synaptic vesicles is most critical for rapid release of synaptic vesicles. The calyx of Held, a large synapse in the auditory brainstem of mammals, allows one to voltage-clamp both pre- and postsynaptic compartments (Borst and Sakmann, 1996Borst J.G.G. Sakmann B.

When a calyx of Held synapse is stimulated at a high frequency, it undergoes rapid depression, which has a strong presynaptic component (von Gersdorff and Borst, 2002von Gersdorff H. Borst J.G.G.

As a first step toward characterization of the Ca2+ dependence of “depressed” vesicles, we performed an experiment similar to that of Wu and Borst, 1999Wu L.G. Borst J.G.G.

Presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments were simultaneously whole-cell clamped and held at −80 mV. Postsynaptic AMPA receptor-mediated currents were used for monitoring transmitter release, and cyclothiazide (CTZ) and γ-D-glutamylglycine (γDGG) were present in the extracellular solution to block AMPA receptor desensitization and saturation. We applied a short depolarization, mimicking an AP, followed by a 10 ms depolarization (Figure 1A). The AP-like stimulus evoked an EPSC of 2 nA in this example. The EPSC amplitude was similar to that evoked by fiber stimulation (Borst and Sakmann, 1996Borst J.G.G. Sakmann B. Calcium influx and transmitter release in a fast CNS synapse.Nature. 1996; 383: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, Schneggenburger et al., 1999Schneggenburger R. Meyer A. Neher E. Released fraction and total size of a pool of immediately available transmitter quanta at a calyx synapse.Neuron. 1999; 23: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The duration of the subsequent pulse was chosen such that it would be long enough to cause complete depression of a second AP-like stimulus (Wu and Borst, 1999Wu L.G. Borst J.G.G. The reduced release probability of releasable vesicles during recovery from short-term synaptic depression.Neuron. 1999; 23: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) applied 200 ms later. The elevation of global [Ca2+] by the predepolarizing pulse may cause facilitation (Wu and Borst, 1999Wu L.G. Borst J.G.G.

Neher E. Quantitative relationship between transmitter release and calcium current at the calyx of Held synapse.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 462-476PubMed Google Scholar); however, at the time when the second AP-like stimulus was applied, global [Ca2+] had returned to the basal level, as confirmed by [Ca2+] measurements (Figure 1B). The second AP-like stimulus elicited only a small EPSC (120 pA in the case of Figure 1A). Finally, a 50 ms pulse was applied to deplete all releasable vesicles. As reported by Wu and Borst, 1999Wu L.G. Borst J.G.G. The reduced release probability of releasable vesicles during recovery from short-term synaptic depression.Neuron. 1999; 23: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, this second long depolarization elicited a large EPSC, although the preceding AP-like stimulus was largely depressed. To address the question of whether this EPSC is mediated by vesicles with reduced Ca2+ sensitivity, we repeated this experiment, except that we replaced the second AP-like stimulus by a brief Ca2+ transient in the presynaptic terminal. Brief transients can be evoked by laser flash photolysis, as has been demonstrated by Bollmann and Sakmann, 2005Bollmann J.H. Sakmann B. Control of synaptic strength and timing by the release-site Ca2+ signal.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 426-434PubMed Google Scholar. In this technique, some extra nonphotolyzable buffer is included in the presynaptic pipette solution, which takes up Ca2+ rapidly after it has been released by the caged compound. We used a mix of the caged Ca2+ compound DM-Nitrophen (1–2 mM) together with EGTA (1 mM). Photolysis of DM-Nitrophen with a UV laser elevated [Ca2+], which subsequently decayed with a time constant of 10–20 ms, as measured by the rapid Ca2+ indicator Oregon-Green-BAPTA-5N (OGB-5N) (Figure 1B; Bollmann and Sakmann, 2005Bollmann J.H. Sakmann B. Control of synaptic strength and timing by the release-site Ca2+ signal.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 426-434PubMed Google Scholar). Because the indicator is not ratiometric, dF/F was used to indicate relative changes in [Ca2+]. The time course of the [Ca2+] transient was not as short as that elicited by a presynaptic AP. However, unlike a step-like change in [Ca2+], which causes massive transmitter release, the amount of release caused by this transient stimulus is small and sensitive to slight differences in amplitude or time course. Unlike real APs, flashes under this condition cause spatially homogeneous Ca2+ transients. Laser intensity was adjusted so that the amplitude of the postsynaptic current of a nondepressed synapse was comparable to that of an AP-evoked EPSC (2 nA in the case of Figure 1C). Figure 1B shows such a flash response given at the time of the second AP-like stimulus in a protocol that was otherwise exactly the same as that of Figure 1C. Unlike the AP-like stimulus, the Ca2+ transient evoked a large EPSC of 1.5 nA in the depressed synapse (insert in Figure 1B), indicating that vesicles remaining after the 10 ms predepleting depolarization are release competent, although they are reluctant to be released by an AP-like stimulus. Responses like those in Figure 1 were analyzed in seven cell pairs. In each case flashes were given both in isolation as well as within the protocol of Figure 1B. The dF/F signals were very similar for each cell pair with a ratio (after predepolarization over control) of 1.04 ± 0.03. The same ratio of EPSC amplitudes for flashes was 0.78 ± 0.21, while the ratio of EPSCs evoked by AP-like depolarization was 0.13 ± 0.05. The ratio of flash responses is slightly more than what one would expect, if ∼50% of the remaining vesicles had the same intrinsic Ca2+ sensitivity as the entire population. The ratio for short AP-like stimuli, on the other hand, is much smaller. The discrepancies in sensitivities suggests that short stimuli are inefficient for sufficiently raising [Ca2+] near the remaining vesicles. This is exactly what would be expected if these vesicles were located at larger distances from Ca2+ channels. In the following experiments, the deconvolution method (Neher and Sakaba, 2001aNeher E. Sakaba T. Combining deconvolution and noise analysis for the estimation of transmitter release rates at the calyx of Held.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 444-461PubMed Google Scholar) was used to estimate transmitter release rates from EPSCs in a more quantitative way. We estimated a quantity termed “release rate per vesicle,” which we calculated by dividing the peak release rate, as obtained by deconvolution, by the number of remaining releasable vesicles. The latter was calculated from the cumulative release (see Experimental Procedures). On average (n = 7 cell pairs), the peak release rate per vesicle of the flash response in isolation was estimated to be 0.035 ± 0.008 ms−1. In comparison, the same quantity of a flash response after a predepleting stimulus was 0.022 ± 0.004 ms−1. When these values were compared within given cell pairs, the peak release rate per vesicle was 81% ± 16% of that observed during the control. The peak release rates per vesicle during the first and the second AP-like stimulations were 0.093 ± 0.04 ms−1 and 0.028 ± 0.019 ms−1, respectively. The peak release rate per vesicle of the second AP-like stimulation was 29% ± 9% of the first one, when comparisons were made within given cell pairs. These data confirm that the effectiveness of Ca2+ influx for release was strongly reduced without losing intracellular Ca2+ sensitivity for release significantly (see also Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data). In other words, intrinsic fusion competence of remaining synaptic vesicles was reduced much less than the release evoked by depolarization. In the above set of experiments, we had to use a fast nonratiometric Ca2+ indicator dye (Escobar et al., 1997Escobar A.L. Velez P. Kin A.M. Cituento F. Fill M. Vergara J.L. Kinetic properties of DM-Nitrophen and calcium indicators; rapid transient response to flash photolysis.Pflugers Arch. 1997; 434: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ measurement is not as precise as that achieved during a step-like elevation of [Ca2+] using the ratiometric indicator Fura 2FF. We therefore probed the intracellular Ca2+ sensitivity of transmitter release with this indicator in a wider range (2–30 μM) by adjusting flash intensity and DM-Nitrophen concentration (1–2 mM). We did so for both stand-alone flashes and flashes following predepleting stimuli. Figure 2A shows results for a stand-alone flash. [Ca2+] was elevated to 8 μM after photolysis of DM-Nitrophen, which evoked an EPSC of 14 nA in amplitude. The EPSC decayed while the [Ca2+] remained elevated, and a subsequent depolarizing pulse (to 0 mV for 50 ms) evoked only a small EPSC (Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000Schneggenburger R. Neher E. Intracellular calcium dependence of transmitter release rates at a fast central synapse.Nature. 2000; 406: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The deconvolution method was used to estimate the time-dependent release rate and the cumulative release was calculated by integrating release rates (Figure 2B). The cumulative release was fitted by a double exponential, which in this example had time constants of 1.83 ms (65%) and 80 ms (dotted trace in Figure 2B). The second component is very slow, and its exact time constant cannot be estimated accurately, because it also includes synaptic vesicles newly recruited after depletion of the releasable vesicles (Wu and Borst, 1999Wu L.G.

When the effect of recruitment was corrected for (Sakaba and Neher, 2001aSakaba T. Neher E. Quantitative relationship between transmitter release and calcium current at the calyx of Held synapse.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 462-476PubMed Google Scholar), the late component reached a plateau (solid line in Figure 2B), and the cumulative release could be fitted with a double exponential with time constants of 1.56 ms (78% of the total fit) and 41 ms. In 30 similar experiments, the first component constituted 87% ± 3% of the total fit (Figure 4). When a step depolarizing pulse was applied for 50 ms in the same condition (in the presence of DM-Nitrophen/Ca2+ mixture), the fraction of the first component was 48% ± 4% of the total fit (n = 13 cell pairs) after correction for vesicle recruitment. The time constants of release were 3.22 ± 0.39 ms and 26.9 ± 3.0 ms (n = 13 cell pairs). The appearance of two components of about equal amplitude, with one rapid while the other one is about 10-fold slower, is very common in such experiments on the calyx of Held. Under a condition studied most extensively, which is 0.5 mM EGTA in the presynaptic patch pipette, time constants were reported to be 2–3 ms (50% of the total fit) and 20–30 ms (Sakaba and Neher, 2001bSakaba T.

The presynaptic terminal was depolarized to 0 mV for 15 ms (after depolarization to +70 mV for 2 ms) to deplete the rapidly-releasing vesicles. 200 ms after the predepolarization, a test pulse (to 0 mV for 50 ms after a short episode at +70 mV for 2 ms) was applied to release remaining slowly-releasing vesicles. Note that the rising phase of the EPSC is much slower than that of the prepulse. The release rate during the test pulse decays more slowly than that during the prepulse. Calmodulin binding domain peptide was included in the presynaptic patch pipette. In the presence of the peptide, recovery of the rapidly-releasing vesicles was reduced to almost zero (Sakaba and Neher, 2001bSakaba T. Neher E.

Therefore, only slowly-releasing vesicles are present to be released by the test pulse. This is reflected in the slow rise of the EPSC.

(C) The cumulative release evoked by the flash (after a prepulse, [B]) is shown. For comparison, the cumulative release during the test pulse after a prepulse (A) is also shown. Its time course is considerably slower. The deconvolution method is not highly accurate during the late phase of a prolonged period of transmitter release (Neher and Sakaba, 2001aNeher E. Sakaba T. Combining deconvolution and noise analysis for the estimation of transmitter release rates at the calyx of Held.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 444-461PubMed Google Scholar, see Experimental Procedures). Nevertheless, in the flash response, only a small fraction of synapses had slow components of amplitudes similar to those regularly observed during depolarization (Figure 4C). The majority, particularly at higher [Ca2+] levels, had a clearly dominating fast component, which suggests that spatially uniform [Ca2+] elevation displays a more homogeneous vesicle population with respect to its release probability compared with that assayed by depolarization and localized Ca2+ influx. In Figure 3A, a predepleting pulse (10–20 ms in duration) was applied to deplete the rapidly-releasing vesicle pool. A test pulse (50 ms in duration) was applied 200 ms after the prepulse. This interval was selected such that it was long enough to allow for the decay of overlapping facilitation of the slowly-releasing vesicles due to accumulation of global [Ca2+] (Wu and Borst, 1999Wu L.G. Borst J.G.G.

Neher E. Quantitative relationship between transmitter release and calcium current at the calyx of Held synapse.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 462-476PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is short enough such that the number of rapidly-releasing vesicles recovering within this interval is small (Sakaba and Neher, 2001bSakaba T. Neher E. Calmodulin mediates rapid recruitment of fast-releasing synaptic vesicles at a calyx-type synapse.Neuron. 2001; 32: 1119-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in order to block any recruitment of rapidly-releasing vesicles during the interval of 200 ms, calmodulin binding domain peptide (20 μM) was applied via the presynaptic patch pipette in the experiment of Figures 3A–3C. The peptide has been shown to retard the recruitment process (Sakaba and Neher, 2001bSakaba T. Neher E. Calmodulin mediates rapid recruitment of fast-releasing synaptic vesicles at a calyx-type synapse.Neuron. 2001; 32: 1119-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As expected, the test pulse evoked a slowly rising EPSC (see solid trace in the inset of Figure 3B), which presumably reflected release of the slowly-releasing vesicles. When the cumulative release during the test pulse was analyzed (in analogy to the case of Figure 2B), it could be fitted by a single exponential with a time constant of 18.2 ± 1.2 ms in 27 out of 28 cells, confirming depletion of the rapidly-releasing vesicles that have a time constant of 2–3 ms. In one cell pair, 30% of the fast component remained. In a second protocol applied to each pair, flash photolysis was applied instead of the test pulse (Figure 3B). The flash elicited a step-like elevation of [Ca2+] to 10 μM and evoked a rapidly rising EPSC. The inset of Figure 3B compares the rising phases of depolarization-evoked (solid trace) and flash-evoked (dotted trace) EPSCs. The slower rise of the EPSC evoked by depolarization suggests that [Ca2+] around the slowly-releasing vesicles must be lower during the depolarizing pulse than that during the flash, which is 10 μM (see below for detailed analysis). Following the flash a long-lasting depolarizing pulse was applied, which evoked little EPSC, suggesting that all vesicles, including the slowly-releasing ones, had been released by the preceding stimulation. Figure 3C shows the time course of cumulative release during the test depolarizing pulse and after flash photolysis. Cumulative release during the depolarizing pulse could be fitted by a single exponential with a time constant of 14.6 ms, whereas cumulative release evoked by the flash showed a much faster time course, and could be fitted by a double exponential with time constants of 1.54 ms (89% of the total fit) and 15.3 ms (gray trace). In this example, the amount of release during the test depolarizing pulse is less than that evoked by the flash, indicating that 50 ms of depolarization was not enough to release all releasable vesicles. Nevertheless, the fast time course of release evoked by the flash suggests that the slowly-releasing vesicles are capable of releasing rapidly when [Ca2+"

Here we present the structure-based mechanism for the first step in eukaryotic TCR, CPD-induced stalling of RNA polymerase (Pol) II. A CPD in the transcribed strand slowly passes a translocation barrier and enters the polymerase active site. The CPD 5′-thymine then directs uridine misincorporation into messenger RNA, which blocks translocation. Artificial replacement of the uridine by adenosine enables CPD bypass; thus, Pol II stalling requires CPD-directed misincorporation. In the stalled complex, the lesion is inaccessible, and the polymerase conformation is unchanged. This is consistent with nonallosteric recruitment of repair factors and excision of a lesion-containing DNA fragment in the presence of Pol II."
https://openalex.org/W2161352090,"Light deprivation lowers the threshold for long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in visual cortex by a process termed metaplasticity, but the mechanism is unknown. The decreased LTD/P threshold correlates with a decrease in the ratio of NR2A to NR2B subunits of cortical NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and a slowing of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). However, whether and how changes in NR2 subunit expression contribute to LTD and LTP have been controversial. In the present study, we used an NR2A knockout (KO) mouse to examine the role of this subunit in the experience-dependent modulation of NMDAR properties, LTD, and LTP. We found that deletion of NR2A abrogates the effects of visual experience on NMDAR EPSCs and prevents metaplasticity of LTP and LTD. These data support the hypothesis that experience-dependent changes in NR2A/B are functionally significant and yield a mechanism for an adjustable synaptic modification threshold in visual cortex."

The molecular mechanisms that govern this lamina-restricted projection are still unknown. We examined the projection pattern of mossy fibers in mutant mice for semaphorin receptors plexin-A2 and plexin-A4, and their ligand, the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A. We found that plexin-A2 deficiency causes a shift of mossy fibers from the suprapyramidal region to the infra- and intrapyramidal regions, while plexin-A4 deficiency induces inappropriate spreading of mossy fibers within CA3. We also report that the plexin-A2 loss-of-function phenotype is genetically suppressed by Sema6A loss of function. Based on these results, we propose a model for the lamina-restricted projection of mossy fibers: the expression of plexin-A4 on mossy fibers prevents them from entering the Sema6A-expressing suprapyramidal region of CA3 and restricts them to the proximal-most part, where Sema6A repulsive activity is attenuated by plexin-A2.

In many regions of the vertebrate central nervous system, afferent projections are distributed in a precise laminar pattern (for a review, see Sanes and Yamagata, 1999Sanes J.R. Yamagata M. Formation of lamina-specific synaptic connections.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This targeting of axons to specific laminae or dendritic segments of the target neurons is fundamental to the physiology of neural circuits (for a review, see Förster et al., 2006Förster E. Zhao S. Frotscher M. Laminating the hippocampus.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore, one important issue to be addressed is how individual axons are instructed to invade, arborize, and terminate at particular laminae. The hippocampus is an excellent experimental system in which to study cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern lamina-restricted termination of axons. Pyramidal cells, the principal neurons of the cornu ammonis (CA), receive inputs from a variety of sources in a lamina-specific manner. In CA3, the distal segments of the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells (the stratum lacunosum-moleculare) receive axons from the entorhinal cortex; the more proximal parts of the apical dendrites (the stratum radiatum) and the basal dendrites of pyramidal cells (the stratum oriens) are primarily innervated by axons of CA3 pyramidal cells from both the contralateral and ipsilateral sides (the commissural/associational afferent); and the proximal-most parts of the apical dendrites in CA3 (the stratum lucidum) and the basal dendrites in CA3c are occupied by axons from the dentate gyrus, the mossy fibers (Amaral and Witter, 1995Amaral D.G. Witter M.P. Hippocampal formation.in: Paxinos G. The Rat Nervous System. Academic Press, New York1995: 443-493Google Scholar; also see Figures 1A–1D). It has been proposed that specific molecular cues must be involved in guiding the different hippocampal afferents along their correct pathways into their definitive target laminae during development (for reviews, see Skutella and Nitsch, 2001Skutella T. Nitsch R. New molecules for hippocampal development.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 107-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, Förster et al., 2006Förster E. Zhao S. Frotscher M. Laminating the hippocampus.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several extracellular molecules that can guide hippocampal afferent fibers have been described. An extracellular matrix molecule, hyaluronic acid, is thought to play a role in the termination of entorhinal fibers to the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (Zhao et al., 2003Zhao S. Förster E. Chai X. Frotscher M. Different signals control laminar specificity of commissural and entorhinal fibers to the dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7351-7357PubMed Google Scholar). Eph ligand ephrin-A3 (Stein et al., 1999Stein E. Savaskan N.E. Ninnemann O. Nitsch R. Zhou R. Skutella T. A role for the Eph ligand ephrin-A3 in entorhino-hippocampal axon targeting.J.

However, the contribution of these axon guidance molecules to the lamina-specific guidance of hippocampal projections has not been demonstrated in vivo, with the exception of the contribution of netrin-1. In netrin-1-deficient mice, lamina-specific targeting of entorhinal fibers to the hippocampus proper and the associational, CA3-to-CA1 Schaffer collaterals were defective (Barallobre et al., 2000Barallobre M.J. del Río J.A.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9124-9134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but the in vivo function of the other type A plexins has not been thoroughly studied. To further elucidate the function of type A plexins in vivo, we generated protein null mutant mice for plexin-A2 (see Supplemental Material 1 in the Supplemental Data) and plexin-A4 (Suto et al., 2005Suto F. Ito K. Uemura M. Shimizu M. Shinkawa Y. Sanbo M. Shinoda T. Tsuboi M. Takashima S. Yagi T. Fujisawa H.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3628-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and examined the projection pattern of mossy fibers. We here report that plexin-A2 and plexin-A4, and their putative ligand Sema6A, a class 6 transmembrane semaphorin, play crucial roles in lamina-restricted projection of hippocampal mossy fibers, but are not a prerequisite for synaptic connectivity of the fibers. We first examined the projections of mossy fibers in the adult hippocampus by Timm staining and calbindin immunohistochemistry, which can visualize presynaptic terminals and trajectories of mossy fibers, respectively. In wild-type mice, mossy fibers first accumulated in the dentate hilus, and then invaded the stratum lucidum in the suprapyramidal region of CA3 to form the suprapyramidal bundle (Figures 1A–1D). Mossy fibers also invaded the infrapyramidal region of CA3c, forming the infrapyramidal bundle. The lamina-restricted pattern of mossy fiber projection was disrupted in plexin-A2-deficient mice and plexin-A4-deficient mice. In all plexin-A2 homozygous animals (PlexA2−/−: n = 10), mossy fibers did not grow into the suprapyramidal region, but invaded the infrapyramidal region of CA3c and the stratum pyramidalis of CA3ab (Figures 1E–1H). In plexin-A2 heterozygous animals (n = 5), mossy fibers projected to normal positions (data not shown). On the other hand, mossy fibers spread out inappropriately within CA3 in plexin-A4 homozygous animals: in all PlexA4−/− mice (n = 8), mossy fibers invaded most parts of CA3, particularly the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and the stratum oriens, and to a lesser extent the stratum radiatum (Figures 1I–1L). Some mossy fibers also entered the proximal part of the suprapyramidal region of CA3, their normal target site. However, the suprapyramidal bundle was not as tightly packed as in the wild-type animals (compare Figures 1L and 1D). Plexin-A4 heterozygous animals (n = 4) did not show obvious abnormalities of mossy fiber projections (data not shown). To examine a possible functional correlation of plexin-A2 and plexin-A4 in mossy fiber projection, we generated plexin-A2/plexin-A4 double knockout mice by crossing plexin-A2 and plexin-A4 single mutants. In PlexA2−/−::PlexA4−/− mice (n = 5), mossy fibers were widely distributed within CA3 as in PlexA4−/− animals (Figures 1M–1P), suggesting a predominant role of plexin-A4 in the laminar projection of mossy fibers. The first mossy fibers invade CA3 at around postnatal day 0 (P0), and their number gradually increases during postnatal development. Furthermore, the early formed mossy fibers serve as scaffolds for late-arriving mossy fibers. Therefore, we examined the projection pattern of mossy fibers in P5 plexin mutant mice by labeling the fibers with DiI. As in the adult animals, mossy fibers preferentially grew into the infrapyramidal region and the stratum pyramidalis of CA3 in PlexA2−/− animals (Figure 1R), and spread out within CA3 in PlexA4−/− animals (Figure 1S). These results indicate that the mossy fiber projection is defective from the beginning of its development. In situ hybridization (ISH) analyses on P1 mice revealed strong signals for plexin-A2 and plexin-A4 transcripts in both dentate granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells (Figures 2A and 2J). However, the distinct mossy fiber projection defects in plexin-A2 and plexin-A4 mutants suggested that the two plexin-A proteins might be differentially distributed in the developing hippocampus. Therefore, we generated plexin-A2-specific and plexin-A4-specific antibodies (see Supplemental Material 2 and 4) and examined the localization of these two plexins in the developing hippocampus. In P1 mice a plexin-A2-specific monoclonal antibody, Mab-A2D3, stained the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal regions of CA3, the dentate hilus, and inner parts of the dentate molecular layer (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the plexin-A2 staining was strongest in the proximal part of the suprapyramidal region, the presumptive target area for mossy fibers. At P10, the plexin-A2 staining was still strong in the dentate hilus but became weaker in CA3 (Figure 2C). The suprapyramidal bundle of mossy fibers was mostly negative for the plexin-A2 staining (Figure 2C). Immunostaining of cultured CA3 pyramidal cells with rabbit serum antibodies to mouse plexin-A2 (see Supplemental Materials 2 and 4) revealed that the plexin-A2 protein was enriched in MAP2-positive dendrites and dendritic spines (Figures 2D–2F) and less abundant in Tau-positive axons (Figures 2G–2I). Furthermore, in cultured dentate granule cells, the plexin-A2 protein was abundant in dendrites but less so in axons (Figures 2M–2O). These results indicate that the plexin-A2 protein is enriched in dendrites but less so or nil in axons. On the other hand, the plexin-A4 proteins were mainly distributed in mossy fibers. In P1 and P10 mice, a plexin-A4-specific monoclonal antibody, Mab-A4F5, labeled the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal bundles of mossy fibers and the dentate hilus (Figures 2K and 2L). Axons of cultured granule cells were immunopositive for the antibody (Figures 2M–2O), confirming the distribution of the plexin-A4 protein on mossy fibers. As ISH signals for the plexin-A4 transcripts were weak in the dentate hilus (see Figure 2J), the immunostaining in the dentate hilus most likely corresponds to plexin-A4 expression on mossy fibers. A weak expression of plexin-A4 was also detected in the suprapyramidal region of CA and in the fimbria. The preferential localization of plexin-A2 on pyramidal cell dendrites, but not on mossy fibers, and of plexin-A4 on mossy fibers suggests that plexin-A2 functions in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and plexin-A4 in mossy fibers, to regulate laminar projection of mossy fibers. To test this hypothesis, we cocultured slices of the dentate gyrus (DG slice) and CA3 (CA3 slice) of P5 to P8 wild-type or plexin mutant mice in various combinations (see Figure 3A), and examined the projection pattern of mossy fibers. In slice cultures of the wild-type hippocampus (wtHip; Figure 3B) and cocultures of wild-type DG slices (wtDG slices) with wild-type CA3 slices (wtCA3 slices) (Figure 3C), mossy fibers projected to their normal positions, the proximal part of the suprapyramidal region of CA3 and the infrapyramidal region of CA3c. In slice cultures of the PlexA4−/− hippocampus (A4Hip; Figure 3D), mossy fibers massively invaded the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and the stratum oriens, and diffusely invaded the stratum radiatum. In the proximal part of the suprapyramidal region, mossy fibers formed the suprapyramidal bundle. In cocultures of PlexA4−/− DG slices (A4DG slices) with either PlexA4−/− CA3 slices (A4CA3 slices) (Figure 3E) or wtCA3 slices (Figure 3F), mossy fibers invaded the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and diffusely invaded the stratum oriens. The suprapyramidal bundle, however, was not formed. In contrast, in cocultures of wtDG slices with A4CA3 slices, mossy fiber projection was normal (compare Figures 3G and 3C). Collectively, if the PlexA4−/− DG slices were used in the coculture, the mossy fiber projection pattern was always similar to that of PlexA4−/− animals, irrespective of the genetic origin of the CA slices (see Table S1 in Supplemental Material 3). In slice cultures of the PlexA2−/− hippocampus (A2Hip; Figure 3H), mossy fibers projected to the infrapyramidal region or the stratum pyramidalis, but not to the suprapyramidal region. The PlexA2−/−-like abnormal mossy fiber projection was always induced whenever the PlexA2−/− CA3 (A2CA3) slices were used in the coculture (Figures 3I and 3K), though the sprouting of mossy fibers was usually reduced and often absent (see Table S2 in Supplemental Material 3). In contrast, when A2DG slices were cocultured with wtCA3 slices, mossy fiber projection was normal: mossy fibers projected to the suprapyramidal region and formed the suprapyramidal bundle (Figure 3J). Taken together, these results indicate that plexin-A4 functions in mossy fibers, while plexin-A2 acts in CA3 pyramidal cells to regulate the laminar projection of mossy fibers. The spreading out of plexin-A4-deficient mossy fibers within CA3 led us to speculate that plexin-A4-deficient mossy fibers lose their responsiveness to repulsive cues in CA3. As we have previously shown that Sema6A, a class 6 transmembrane semaphorin, repels sympathetic ganglion axons and that the repulsive activity of Sema6A is mediated by plexin-A4 (Suto et al., 2005Suto F. Ito K. Uemura M. Shimizu M. Shinkawa Y. Sanbo M. Shinoda T. Tsuboi M. Takashima S. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Plexin-A4 mediates axon-repulsive activities of both secreted and transmembrane semaphorins and plays roles in nerve fiber guidance.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3628-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we asked whether Sema6A would function as a repellent for mossy fibers. We first examined Sema6A expression pattern in the hippocampus. In P1 mice Sema6A transcripts were detected in CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Figure 4A). Immunostaining for Sema6A revealed that Sema6A was widely expressed in the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal regions of CA3 and interneurons of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Figure 4B). The absence of staining of the suprapyramidal bundle and the dentate hilus indicates that mossy fibers do not express Sema6A. Sema6A expression in CA3 was rapidly downregulated during postnatal development: at P10, Sema6A protein was absent from CA3 (data not shown). To examine subcellular localization of Sema6A, we transfected and expressed myc-tagged Sema6A and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in cultured pyramidal cells. The epitope-tagged Sema6A was distributed almost evenly in all parts of the cells, including their dendrites and axons (Figures 4C and 4D). We next tested the repulsive activity of Sema6A against mossy fibers using the growth cone collapse assay. We cultured small dentate gyrus fragments from P6 wild-type and PlexA4−/− animals and applied recombinant proteins for the Fc-dimerized Sema6A ectodomain (Sema6Aect-Fc; Suto et al., 2005Suto F. Ito K. Uemura M. Shimizu M. Shinkawa Y. Sanbo M. Shinoda T. Tsuboi M. Takashima S. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Plexin-A4 mediates axon-repulsive activities of both secreted and transmembrane semaphorins and plays roles in nerve fiber guidance.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3628-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins induced growth cone collapse of wild-type and PlexA4+/− mossy fibers, in a dose-dependent manner, but not of PlexA4−/− mossy fibers (Figures 4E–4G). These results show that Sema6A is a repellent of mossy fibers and that this repulsive activity is mediated by plexin-A4. Next, we asked whether the Sema6A-induced repulsion of mossy fibers plays a role in the laminar projection of mossy fibers. To address this question, we examined mossy fiber projection pattern in Sema6A mutant mice (Sema6A−/−) that carry a gene-trap insertion in the Sema6A gene and are phenotypically null (Leighton et al., 2001Leighton P.A. Mitchell K.J. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Pinson K. Scherz P. Skarnes W.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Defining brain wiring patterns and mechanisms through gene trapping in mice.Nature. 2001; 410: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, Mitchell et al., 2001Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. et al.Functional analysis of secreted and transmembrane proteins critical to mouse development.Nat. Genet. 2001; 3: 241-249Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Sema6A−/− mice did not show any obvious abnormality in the trajectory and termination of mossy fibers (Figures 5A and 5C). To our surprise, however, an almost normal mossy fiber projection was restored in plexin-A2/Sema6A double knockout animals (PlexA2−/−::Sema6A−/−; n = 5) (Figures 5B and 5D). The rescue of the plexin-A2 loss-of-function phenotype by Sema6A loss of function suggests that during normal development, Sema6A-mediated mossy fiber repulsion is attenuated by plexin-A2 expressed in the proximal part of the suprapyramidal region of CA3, allowing mossy fibers to invade this area. This result also suggests direct molecular interaction between Sema6A and plexin-A2. Accordingly, we showed that the Fc-dimerized recombinant proteins for the alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tagged ectodomain of Sema6A (AP-Sema6Aect-Fc) bound with a high affinity to plexin-A2 expressed in L cells: the dissociation constant (Kd) value for the interaction of Sema6A with plexin-A2 was 3.21 nM (Figure 5E), and thus comparable to the Kd value for the interaction of Sema6A with plexin-A4 (3.56 nM; Suto et al., 2005Suto F. Ito K. Uemura M. Shimizu M. Shinkawa Y. Sanbo M. Shinoda T. Tsuboi M. Takashima S. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Plexin-A4 mediates axon-repulsive activities of both secreted and transmembrane semaphorins and plays roles in nerve fiber guidance.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3628-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We then tested whether plexin-A2 attenuates Sema6A response by the growth cone collapse assay. Preincubation of Sema6A with the plexin-A2 sema domain significantly suppressed the growth cone collapse activity of Sema6 (Figure 5F). These results indicate that plexin-A2 competitively suppresses binding of Sema6A to plexin-A4 and attenuates Sema6A response. We next tried to determine whether mossy fibers that project to ectopic positions in plexin mutants make synapses. The strong intensity of Timm staining in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and the stratum radiatum in plexin-A4 mutants (Figure 1K) suggests that mossy fibers formed synapses at ectopic positions. This was further confirmed by double immunostaining of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of plexin-A4 mutants with calbindin and synaptophysin, a presynaptic marker (Figures 6A–6C). As the deprivation of plexin-A2 from CA3 pyramidal cells induced the shift of mossy fibers from the suprapyramidal region to the infra- and intrapyramidal regions, we asked whether localization of plexin-A2 on the proximal dendritic segment of CA3 pyramidal cells is required for the synaptic termination of mossy fibers to this segment. To address this question, we generated chimeric mice with plexin-A2-deficient and wild-type cells (PlexA2−/−/wt chimeas: n = 5). Plexin-A2-deficient cells were labeled with GFP by crossing plexin-A2 mutant mice with GFP transgenic mice (Okabe et al., 1997Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. ‘Green mice’ as a source of ubiquitous green cells.FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). In a chimera in which about 30% of pyramidal cells were GFP-positive, and thus plexin-A2-deficient, mossy fibers invaded not only the infrapyramidal region of CA3c but also the proximal part of the suprapyramidal regions of CA3c (Figure 6D) and CA3ab (Figure 6E), which exactly corresponds to the stratum lucidum in normal mice. As the repulsive activity of the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A seems effective only at a short distance, mossy fibers might follow the wild-type pyramidal cell dendrites to invade the suprapyramidal region of CA3 in the chimera. Interestingly, several presynaptic boutons of mossy fibers were apposed to the dendritic shafts of wild-type, but also GFP-positive/plexin-A2-deficent, pyramidal cells (Figure 6F). Wild-type mossy fibers also formed synapses on the dendritic shafts of plexin-A2-deficent pyramidal cells (Figure 6G). Furthermore, the dendritic shafts of GFP-positive/plexin-A2-deficent pyramidal cells possessed thorny excrescences, the postsynaptic components for mossy fiber synapse (Figure 6H). Taken together, these results indicate that the proximal segments of the apical dendrite of plexin-A2-deficent pyramidal cells can make synaptic contacts with mossy fibers whenever they are accessed by the fibers. We next examined whether mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus of plexin-A2-deficient mice were functional with an electrophysiological approach. One of the criteria for detecting mossy fiber synapses is profound paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) (Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990Zalutsky R.A. Nicoll R.A. Comparison of two forms of long-term potentiation in single hippocampal neurons.Science. 1990; 248: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The PPF ratio at a 50 ms interstimulus interval in PlexA2−/− mice (335% ± 17%, n = 5) in the stratum lucidum of CA3 was comparable (p = 0.71) to that in wild-type mice (327% ± 9%, n = 4) (Figure 7A). Another critical feature of the mossy fiber synapse is that mossy fiber synaptic transmission is almost completely blocked by the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists (Kamiya et al., 1996Kamiya H. Shinozaki H. Yamamoto C. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2/3 suppresses transmission at rat hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which have little or no effect on the other types of excitatory synapse in the hippocampus. This property was also preserved in mossy fiber synapses of PlexA2−/− mice (Figure 7B). The application of 1 μM (2S,2′R,3′R)-2-(2′3′-decarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV), a group II mGluR agonist, inhibited excitatory synaptic responses by about 80% in PlexA2−/− mice (to 20% ± 8% of baseline, n = 8), which was comparable (p = 0.46) to the inhibition in wild-type mice (to 13% ± 5% of baseline, n ="

https://openalex.org/W1982797011,"Neurotransmitter release from mammalian sensory neurons is controlled by Ca(V)2.2 N-type calcium channels. N-type channels are a major target of neurotransmitters and drugs that inhibit calcium entry, transmitter release and nociception through their specific G protein-coupled receptors. G protein-coupled receptor inhibition of these channels is typically voltage-dependent and mediated by Gbetagamma, whereas N-type channels in sensory neurons are sensitive to a second G protein-coupled receptor pathway that inhibits the channel independent of voltage. Here we show that preferential inclusion in nociceptors of exon 37a in rat Cacna1b (encoding Ca(V)2.2) creates, de novo, a C-terminal module that mediates voltage-independent inhibition. This inhibitory pathway requires tyrosine kinase activation but not Gbetagamma. A tyrosine encoded within exon 37a constitutes a critical part of a molecular switch controlling N-type current density and G protein-mediated voltage-independent inhibition. Our data define the molecular origins of voltage-independent inhibition of N-type channels in the pain pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1988361359,"In Parkinson disease (PD), α-synuclein aggregates called Lewy bodies often involve and sequester Septin4 (Sept4), a polymerizing scaffold protein. However, the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon is unclear. Here, we show the physiological association of Sept4 with α-synuclein, the dopamine transporter, and other presynaptic proteins in dopaminergic neurons; mice lacking Sept4 exhibit diminished dopaminergic neurotransmission due to scarcity of these presynaptic proteins. These data demonstrate an important role for septin scaffolds in the brain. In transgenic mice that express human α-synucleinA53T (a mutant protein responsible for familial PD), loss of Sept4 significantly enhances neuropathology and locomotor deterioration. In this PD model, insoluble deposits of Ser129-phosphorylated α-synucleinA53T are negatively correlated with the dosage of Sept4. In vitro, direct association with Sept4 protects α-synuclein against self-aggregation and Ser129 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data show that Sept4 may be involved in PD as a dual susceptibility factor, as its insufficiency can diminish dopaminergic neurotransmission and enhance α-synuclein neurotoxicity."

When histidine instead of tyrosine is present at position 384 in the seventh complement control protein (CCP) domain of FH, the risk for age-related macular degeneration is increased. It was recently shown that these allotypic variants of FH, in the context of a recombinant construct corresponding to CCPs 6–8, recognize polyanionic structures differently, which may lead to altered regulation of the alternative pathway of complement. We show now that His-384, corresponding to the risk allele, binds C-reactive protein (CRP) poorly compared with the Tyr-384 form. We also found that C1q and phosphorylcholine do not compete with FH for binding to C-reactive protein. The interaction with extracellular matrix protein fibromodulin, which we now show to be mediated, at least in part, by CCP6–8 of FH, occurs via the polypeptide of fibromodulin and not through its glycosaminoglycan modifications. The Tyr-384 variant of FH bound fibromodulin better than the His-384 form. Furthermore, we find that CCP6–8 is able to interact with DNA and necrotic cells, but in contrast the His-384 allotype binds these ligands more strongly than the Tyr-384 variant. The variations in binding affinity of the two alleles indicate that complement activation and local inflammation in response to different targets will differ between His/His and Tyr/Tyr homozygotes.

As the mean age of the population increases it is expected that the incidence will rise even further (2Bok D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Epidemiology reveals a complex etiology with not only age but also sex, diet, and ethnic background as underlying factors for AMD predisposal. As with every multi-factorial disease there are certainly also genetic predispositions. For example, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels appear to be higher in AMD patients (3Seddon J.M. Gensler G. Milton R.C. Klein M.L. Rifai N. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2004; 291: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and recently attention has been drawn to a polymorphism in the factor H (FH) gene present in Caucasians (4Donoso L.A. Kim D.

FH is the major soluble inhibitor of the alternative pathway of the complement system. Alternative pathway activation results from a failure to appropriately regulate the constant low level spontaneous turnover of the abundant complement component C3 to C3(H2O). Complement non-activating cells and other host surfaces are protected from alternative pathway complement attack through binding of FH, which is believed to have a strong affinity for polyanionic structures such as glycosaminoglycans as well as glycoproteins containing sialic acid residues (5Clark S.J.

FH inhibits the alternative pathway by binding C3b and reducing the formation and activity of the alternative pathway C3-convertase (C3bBb).

Current data suggest that a single copy of the His-384-encoding allele (heterozygous) confers 2–4-fold increased risk of developing AMD, whereas two copies of this allele (homozygous) confer 5–7-fold increased risk.

Staples M.K. Erickson P.A. Anderson D.H. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Therefore, a hypothesis was put forward suggesting that abnormal complement activation and inflammation in drusen contributes to AMD (14Edwards A.O. Ritter III, R. Abel K.J. Manning A. Panhuysen C. Farrer L.A. Science. 2005; 308: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). At present it is unclear which substances could be activating complement in drusen but potential candidates include apoptotic cells, nuclear fragments, advanced glycation end products, CRP and glycosaminoglycans. In this regard, it was recently demonstrated that the His-384 and Tyr-384 polymorphic variants have differential heparin binding properties (5Clark S.J. Higman V.A. Mulloy B. Perkins S.J. Lea S.M.

In the case of unfractionated heparins, the His-384 construct showed higher binding compared with Tyr-384. The desulfation of heparin had a much greater effect on the interaction with His-384 (5Clark S.J. Higman V.A. Mulloy B. Perkins S.J. Lea S.M. Sim R.B. Day A.J. J. Biol.

These differences are likely to reflect the differential ability of the variants to associate with polyanionic structures on surfaces activating complement. This finding is particularly relevant because the structure and expression of proteoglycans drastically change in aging and disease, representing a possible explanation as to why AMD is a disease of advanced age (15Buckwalter J.A. Roughley P.J. Rosenberg L.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 28: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Sztrolovics R. Alini M. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. Spine. 1999; 24: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FH deficiency is also associated with type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, a rare renal disease in which drusen present in complications in the eye have a similar composition to those found in AMD (17Mullins R.F. Aptsiauri N. Hageman G.S. Eye (Lond.). 2001; 15: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CRP also binds to the CCP7 region of FH (18Giannakis E. Jokiranta T.S. Male D.A. Ranganathan S. Ormsby R.J. Fischetti V.A. Mold C. Gordon D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Jarva H. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3957-3962PubMed Google Scholar). Other ligands of FH, such as DNA (20Gardner W.D. White P.J. Hoch S.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the extracellular matrix proteoglycan fibromodulin (FMOD) (21Sjoberg A. Onnerfjord P. Morgelin M. Heinegard D. Blom A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32301-32308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), could potentially also bind at this site. Here we show that the His-384 variant of FH binds CRP less efficiently than the non-disease-associated form. We identify CCP6–8 to be a binding site for FMOD and, similar to the CRP interaction, Tyr-384 appears to bind FMOD better than the histidine variant. Interestingly, the His-384 variant of FH bound DNA and necrotic cells better than Tyr-384, which potentially could influence complement activation and opsonization in some areas of the drusen. Proteins—Full-length FH was purified from pooled human plasma of 12 donors (22Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The His-384 and Tyr-384 variants of FH were expressed, in the context of a construct corresponding to CCPs 6–8, and purified as described previously (5Clark S.J. Higman V.A. Mulloy B. Perkins S.J. Lea S.M. Sim R.B. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24713-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Proper folding of the expressed proteins was verified by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and determination of disulfide bonds by mass spectrometry of trypsin digests. These proteins were biotinylated using EZLink N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC Biotin (Pierce) as described (5Clark S.J. Higman V.A. Mulloy B. Perkins S.J. Lea S.M. Sim R.B. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24713-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). FMOD was isolated from bovine articular cartilage (23Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzen A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); recombinant CRP was obtained from Calbiochem and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Sigma. C4BP-PS complex (24Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and C1q (25Tenner A.J. Lesavre P.H. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1981; 27: 648-653Google Scholar) were purified from human plasma as described. Phosphorylcholine-bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA) was prepared by coupling p-aminophenyl-phosphorylcholine to bovine serum albumin according to the procedure described by Padilla et al. (26Padilla N.D. Ciurana C. van Oers J. Ogilvie A.C. Hack C.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 293: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deglycosylated FMOD was prepared by treatment with N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (21Sjoberg A. Onnerfjord P. Morgelin M. Heinegard D. Blom A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32301-32308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Protein/Protein Binding Assays—CRP or FMOD was coated overnight at 4 °C onto microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 75 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. LPS was coated in the same manner at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Wells treated only with coating buffer or 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma) in coating buffer served as negative controls. Between each step the wells were washed extensively with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5. All wells were blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C. Y384CCP6–8 and H384CCP6–8 or full-length FH were added at increasing concentrations in the binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2). In the experiments with FMOD, 50 μg/ml BSA was included in the binding buffer. For the competition assays FH was added at 3 μg/ml in the binding buffer containing increasing concentrations of C1q or C4BP-PS. The amount of bound protein was assessed using a goat polyclonal anti-FH antibody (catalogue number A312; Quidel) followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-goat secondary antibodies (Dako) and the OPD development kit (Dako). Detection of biotinylated protein was performed using a StreptABComplex/horseradish peroxidase kit from Dako, and in both cases absorbance at 490 nm was measured to quantify protein binding. Protein/DNA Binding Assay—The pcDNA3-vector (30 ng; Invitrogen), linearized using EcoRI (Fermentas), was incubated with 5 μg of His-384, Tyr-384, or full-length FH (positive control) in the binding buffer (as described above) in a total volume of 20 μl for 30 min at 37 °C. The negative control contained no protein. 1 μl of DNA loading buffer (0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 30% (v/v) glycerol in deionized water) was added, and the samples were run on an agarose gel (0.8% (w/v); Cambrex) containing ethidium bromide (Sigma) and visualized by UV light. Changes in DNA migration served as the means of evaluating the presence of DNA-protein complexes. Cells and Induction of Necrosis—Jurkat T cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (all from Invitrogen). Necrosis was induced by heat whereby the cells were brought to a concentration of 106/ml and incubated at 56 °C for 30 min in RPMI 1640 without fetal calf serum (27Trouw L.A. Nilsson S.C. Goncalves I. Landberg G. Blom A.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1937-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Binding of FH variants to necrotic cells was analyzed using flow cytometry. FH binding was analyzed by incubating cells with increasing concentrations of FH variants (0–10 μg/ml) in flow cytometry binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2), with shaking for 30 min at room temperature. After washing twice in the same buffer, cells were stained with goat anti-FH polyclonal antibodies (Quidel) for 30 min at room temperature. This was followed by matched fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Dako). Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)—The interaction between CRP or fibromodulin and the polymorphic variants of FH was analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore 2000; Biacore). Three flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip were activated, each with 20 μl of a mixture of 0.2 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, after which CRP (20 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0) was injected over flow cell 2 to reach 4000 resonance units. Unreacted groups were blocked with 20 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Flow cell 3 was treated in a similar fashion but, instead of CRP, FMOD at 20 μg/ml was added to the buffer. A negative control was prepared by activating and subsequently blocking the surface of flow cell 1. The association kinetics were studied for various concentrations of His-384 and Tyr-384. The flow buffer was 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% Tween 20. Protein solutions were injected for 300 s during the association phase at a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sample was first injected over the negative control surface and then over immobilized CRP or FMOD. Signal from the control surface was subtracted. The dissociation was followed for 200 s at the same flow rate. In all experiments, 30 μl of 2 m NaCl was used to remove bound ligands during a regeneration step. BiaEvaluation 3.0 software was used to analyze sensorgrams obtained, and rate affinity constants were calculated using a steady state model. One current hypothesis for involvement of FH in AMD is that the risk-associated allele has impaired ability to inhibit complement activation leading to inflammation in macular tissue (14Edwards A.O. Ritter III, R. Abel K.J. Manning A. Panhuysen C. Farrer L.A. Science. 2005; 308: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Further support for the role of complement in AMD is provided by the finding that variations in factor B and C2 also are associated with AMD (28Gold B. Merriam J.E. Zernant J. Hancox L.S. Taiber A.J. Gehrs K. Cramer K. Neel J. Bergeron J. Barile G.R. Smith R.T. Hageman G.S. Dean M. Allikmets R. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). FH may be of special importance for protection of the macula basement membrane because, in contrast to cellular structures, it most probably lacks other complement inhibitors. In most situations the complement system acts as a double-edged sword. Excessive complement activation leads to inflammation and exacerbates tissue injury. At the same time controlled, low level activation of complement is necessary for removal of dying cells and various forms of debris. Therefore, the FH H384Y polymorphism could be associated with either a decrease or an increase in its ability to inhibit complement. These opposite effects on complement activation could occur simultaneously in different locations within the same tissue. To better understand the contribution of FH to the AMD disease process and any involvement of molecules present in the local environment, we have analyzed the interactions between recombinant His-384 and Tyr-384 variants of FH and some of its known ligands. To allow direct comparison of the functional differences between the His-384 and Tyr-384 forms of FH, we have produced the two variants in the context of recombinant constructs comprising CCPs 6–8, as described previously (5Clark S.J. Higman V.A. Mulloy B. Perkins S.J. Lea S.M. Sim R.B. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24713-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This circumvents problems that arise when using FH purified from plasma, even when this is derived from individuals homozygous for the Y384H variants, because it has been reported recently that Y384H is not the only polymorphism in FH affecting AMD (29Saunders R.E. Goodship T.H. Zipfel P.F. Perkins S.J. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 21-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. such preparations would constitute a complex mixture of FH variants that could lead to difficulties when interpreting the resulting data. The use of constructs containing just three CCP domains has allowed us to focus on the Y384H variants and determine the effect of this polymorphism on the interaction with known FH ligands. The His-384 Variant of FH Binds CRP Less Efficiently than the Tyr-384 Form—CRP is a known activator of the classical pathway of complement (30Du Clos T.W. Mold C. Immunol. Res. 2004; 30: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), to which the alternative pathway serves as an amplification loop. It is implicated in AMD because circulating CRP levels are high in patients suffering from this disease (3Seddon J.M. Gensler G. Milton R.C. Klein M.L. Rifai N. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2004; 291: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). CRP binds to FH, and it has been proposed that this interaction may control CRP-mediated complement activation in order to protect host tissues from complement-mediated damage (31Aronen M. Lehto T. Meri S. Immunol. Infect. Dis. (Oxf.). 1992; 3: 83-87Google Scholar). Because the binding site for CRP has been localized to CCP7 (18Giannakis E. Jokiranta T.S. Male D.A. Ranganathan S. Ormsby R.J. Fischetti V.A. Mold C. Gordon D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Jarva H. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3957-3962PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether the two allotypic variants of CCP6–8 of FH bound to CRP with different affinity. There are reports stating that commercial recombinant CRP may be contaminated with LPS (32Taylor K.E. Giddings J.C. van den Berg C.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because a direct interaction between LPS and FH could cause aberrant results in our binding assays, we tested whether FH binds to LPS and we found that this is not the case (data not shown). A direct binding assay where CRP was immobilized on a plastic surface was used to assess interactions of the FH variants with CRP. The Tyr-384 variant bound significantly better than His-384 (p < 0.03 for all data points above zero), and this was evident in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To verify that our results reflected true differences in the interaction of CRP with His-384 and Tyr-384 and not differential recognition of the two allotypic variants by the polyclonal antibodies used for detection, we repeated the experiment with biotinylated proteins. Using a selected range of concentrations we show the same trend of lower CRP binding with the His-384 variant (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we analyzed the interactions using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore), and the data from these experiments were used to calculate affinity constants. His-384 binds CRP with a KD of 19 μm, and the corresponding value for Tyr-384 is 12 μm (Fig. 2). There were clear differences in binding shown by Biacore analysis; however, the absolute KD values calculated should be treated with some caution because it was impossible to use an ideal range of analyte concentrations in this analysis. The disease-associated variant of FH has impaired ability to interact with CRP, which may potentially lead to increased complement activation by CRP, perhaps to the point of development of chronic inflammation in the affected tissue. FH interacts with dying cells, and this binding has been reported to be increased in the presence of CRP (33Gershov D. Kim S. Brot N. Elkon K.B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1353-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Decrease in FH-CRP interaction could lead to less deposition of FH on dying cells, which in turn could potentially result in excessive complement activation on such debris. In this regard, given that AMD is a condition that takes 10–20 years to develop, it is to be expected that only a relatively subtle disruption in a biochemical mechanism is necessary for progression of the disease process. The differences we have determined for the allotypes of FH could certainly be sufficient to alter the balance of complement activation and immune clearance over this time scale.FIGURE 2Surface plasmon resonance analysis of FH variant interaction with CRP. Upper panels show overlaid sensorgrams obtained when CRP was immobilized on a CM5 chip and the two FH variants were flowed over at several concentrations. The interactions were allowed to reach steady state, and sensor responses were plotted against concentrations of analytes in order to calculate affinity constants (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FH Binds PC but Does Not Compete with C1q and PC for the Binding to CRP—Next, we wanted to further elucidate the binding characteristics of the CRP-FH interaction. A preferred approach for this was to examine the ability of FH to compete for binding to CRP with known ligands of CRP. This would provide important information regarding the location of the binding site for FH on CRP. The two faces of CRP are the A face where C1q and FcγR bind and the B face where PC binds (34Bang R. Marnell L. Mold C. Stein M.P. Clos K.T. Chivington-Buck C. Clos T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25095-25102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Using competition assays we found that full-length FH does not compete with C1q for the binding to the A face of CRP (Fig. 3A). C4b-binding protein (C4BP), in turn, very weakly inhibits FH binding to CRP (not shown) (35Biro A. Rovo Z. Papp D. Cervenak L. Varga L. Fust G. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Prohaszka Z. Immunology. 2007; (Epub. Jan. 17, 2007)PubMed Google Scholar). We recently published data that C4BP to some extent competes with C1q for the binding to CRP (36Sjoberg A.P. Trouw L.A. McGrath F.D. Hack C.E. Blom A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 7612-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data imply that the C1q- and FH-binding sites are non-overlapping but may be adjacent. However, both C4BP and C1q are large molecules (both ∼500 kDa) that can easily cause steric hindrances. Noteworthy in this context is also the possibility that an apparent lack of competition may be due to considerable differences in the affinity of the two ligands for the coated molecule. Surprisingly, when we attempted to analyze whether FH binds to face B of CRP we found that there is a direct interaction between FH and PC; at physiological ionic strength, FH is capable of directly interacting with immobilized PC conjugated to BSA (Fig. 3B). Because FH already interacted strongly with PC-BSA-coated plates, it was not possible to assess whether FH binds CRP attached to PC (36Sjoberg A.P. Trouw L.A. McGrath F.D. Hack C.E. Blom A.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 7612-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Binding of FH to immobilized CRP was not affected by the addition of phosphatidylcholine in solution (not shown), implying that FH does not bind face B of CRP. Taken together, the issue of CRP binding to its ligands is complicated. We here address the matter in a number of ways showing that FH binds CRP independently of C1q. Furthermore, FH binds directly to PC, the main cell surface CRP ligand. We hypothesize that the binding site for FH on CRP may be located on the rim of the CRP pentamer, slightly overlapping with the C4BP interaction site situated on the periphery of the A face of CRP. This, however, requires further investigation. The Tyr-384 Variant of FH Interacts with FMOD with Higher Affinity than His-384, and the Binding Is Mediated by the Polypeptide Chain of FMOD—FMOD is a member of the family of small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans and was first described as a 59-kDa protein (23Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzen A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bound to collagen fibers in cartilage (37Hedlund H.

Previous studies have shown that inhibition of CaMKII protects cardiomyocytes against β1-adrenergic receptor-mediated apoptosis. However, it is unclear whether activation of CaMKII is sufficient to cause cardiomyocyte apoptosis and whether CaMKII signaling is important in heart muscle cell apoptosis mediated by other stimuli. Here, we specifically enhanced or suppressed CaMKII activity using adenoviral gene transfer of constitutively active (CA-CaMKIIδC) or dominant negative (DN-CaMKIIδC) mutants of CaMKIIδC in cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes. Expression of CA-CaMKIIδC promoted cardiomyocyte apoptosis that was associated with increased mitochondrial cytochrome c release and attenuated by co-expression of Bcl-XL. Importantly, isoform-specific suppression of CaMKIIδC with the DN-CaMKIIδC mutant similar to nonselective CaMKII inhibition by the pharmacological inhibitors (KN-93 or AIP) not only prevented CA-CaMKIIδC-mediated apoptosis but also protected cells from multiple death-inducing stimuli. Thus, activation of CaMKIIδC constitutes a common intermediate by which various death-inducing stimuli trigger cardiomyocyte apoptosis via the primary mitochondrial death pathway.

Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). CaMKII mediates phosphorylation of a wide range of target proteins involved in vital cellular processes such as Ca2+ handling, cell growth, and cell death, particularly in the heart and the brain. There are about 30 distinct members of CaMKII family encoded by four different genes (α, β, δ, and γ). The δ isoform of CaMKII family is predominantly expressed in the heart of many mammalian species, including humans (2Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Baltas L.G. Karczewski P. Krause E.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Hoch B. Wobus A.M.

Res. 1999; 84: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Two primary splicing variants of the δ isoform, CaMKIIδB and CaMKIIδC, have been cloned from rat heart (2Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Compared with CaMKIIδC, CaMKIIδB has an additional 11-amino acid sequence that contains a nuclear targeting signal (6Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 26: 839-852Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, CaMKIIδB and CaMKIIδC localize to the nuclear and the cytosolic compartments, respectively, in cardiac myocytes (6Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 26: 839-852Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Over the past decade, a number of studies have been focused on the role of CaMKII (without reference to specific isoforms) in regulating cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Most if not all of the characterized CaMKII target proteins in the heart are involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ and excitation-contraction coupling. These include sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channels known as the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) (7Witcher D.R. Kovacs R.J. Schulmans H. Cefali D.C. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

However, CaMKII activation might be abnormally enhanced under certain pathological conditions that disrupt intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, such as cardiac ischemia, acidosis, myocardial infarction, and excessive β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) stimulation.

It has been demonstrated that CaMKII is persistently activated during sustained βAR stimulation in cardiac myocytes both in cell culture and in vivo (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T.

Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In this model, inhibition of CaMKII prevents β1AR-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis, whereas overexpression of CaMKIIδC enhances the β1AR pro-apoptotic effect (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that the cytosolic isoform, CaMKIIδC, is selectively up-regulated in a rabbit heart failure model (24Ai X. Curran J.W. Shannon T.R. Bers D.M. Pogwizd S.M. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), whereas there is little or no change in the expression or activity of the nuclear isoform (CaMKIIδB). Despite these studies implicating CaMKIIδC in the β1AR-induced cell death, it is currently unclear whether activation of the cytosolic isoform CaMKIIδC is sufficient to cause heart muscle cell apoptosis and whether other death-inducing stimuli require CaMKII activity to cause cell death. Because apoptosis is a key cause factor of chronic heart failure, the identification of fundamental molecular players involved in heart muscle cell loss has became, in the past decade, an important research focus in the field of cardiovascular biology and medicine. The goals of the present study were (a) to determine whether activation of the cardiac cytosolic isoform, CaMKIIδC, is sufficient to trigger cardiac myocyte apoptosis and, if so, (b) to determine whether CaMKIIδC is a necessary intermediate in the death signaling caused by stimuli other than chronic stimulation of β1ARs. To address these questions, we used cultured adult rat cardiac myocytes in conjunction with adenoviral gene transfer of constitutively active (CA-CaMKIIδC) or dominant negative (DN-CaMKIIδC) mutants of CaMKII-δC to elevate or suppress CaMKIIδC activity, respectively. We demonstrate that enhanced activation of CaMKIIδC is sufficient to trigger robust cardiac myocyte apoptosis via activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and that inhibition of CaMKII protects cardiomyocytes not only from β1AR-induced apoptosis, as previously reported (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), but from a number of other death-inducing stimuli as well. These findings demonstrate that activation of CaMKIIδC is an important common intermediate in the death signaling pathway of many different stimuli that induce apoptosis in heart muscle cells. Construction of Viral Vectors—HA-tagged constitutively active CaMKIIδC (CA-CaMKII) was generated by replacing the residue Thr287 with Asp (T287D) using the transformer site directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech), whereas dominant negative CaMKIIδC (DN-CaMKII) was generated by replacing the residue Lys43 with Ala (K43A), as described previously (27Wang W. Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Yang D. Crow M.T. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing WT-CAMKIIδC (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Joan Heller Brown at the Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego. The generation and amplification of adenoviruses harboring the target gene were performed in HEK293 cells (27Wang W. Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Yang D. Crow M.T. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recombinant replication-adenovirus expressing Bcl-XL was obtained from the University of Pittsburgh NHLBI, National Institutes of Health Pre-clinical Vector Core. Cell Culture and Adenoviral Gene Transfer—Single cardiac myocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2-3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats using a standard enzymatic technique, then cultured, and infected with adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) indicated, as described previously (27Wang W. Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Yang D. Crow M.T. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 28Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, myocytes were plated at a density of 0.5 to 1× 104/cm2 on coverslips or in dishes precoated with 10 μg/ml laminin. The culture medium was M199 (Sigma) plus 5 mmol/liter creatine, 2 mmol/liter l-carnitine, 5 mmol/liter taurine, 0.1% insulin-transferrin-selenium-X, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 25 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was implemented by adding adenoviral vectors encoding rat WT-CaMKIIδC, DN-CaMKIIδC, CA-CaMKδC, Bcl-XL, or β-gal into the culture dish. The experiments were done with cells cultured 24 h after infection, unless specified otherwise. Intracellular Acidosis and H2O2 Treatment—Intracellular acidosis was induced by incubating cardiomyocytes with an acidic HEPES buffer with [pH]o 5.5, resulting in equilibrated [pH]i of 6.6 (29Zheng M. Reynolds C. Jo S.H. Wersto R. Han C. Xiao R.P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specifically, cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes were incubated with the acidic HEPES buffer (137 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 15 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2), pH 5.5, for 24 h, in the presence or absence of 30-min pretreatment of cells with a CaMKII inhibitor, either KN-93 (2 μm) or AIP (5 μm), or expression of DN-CaMKIIδC. In another subset of experiments, cultured cardiac myocytes were insulted with H2O2 at 12 or 20 μm as indicated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 30-min pretreatment with KN-93 (2 μm) or expression of DN-CaMKIIδC. Cell Apoptosis—Cell apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as previously described (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The percentage TUNEL-positive cells was determined by randomly counting 500-800 cardiac myocytes over 20 randomly chosen fields in each culture dish. DNA fragmentation was also visualized by DNA laddering assay, as previously described (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of PLB at Thr17 (PLB-Thr17) was detected by Western blot using a site-specific antibody (Badrilla, West Yorkville, UK) (15Hagemann D. Kuschel M. Kuramochi T. Zhu W. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22532-22536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Wang W. Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Yang D. Crow M.T. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To quantify the expression of WT and mutant CaMKIIδC, cell lysate (30-50 μg of protein) were loaded in a Ca2+-free loading buffer containing 20 mm EDTA and immunoblotted using anti-HA (1:1000, Covance) or anti-CaMKII antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Following incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody, the films were exposed to the chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) reaction and quantified with a video documentation system (Bio-Rad). The actin amount used as protein loading control was detected with an anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz). Assay of CaMKII Activity—CaMKII activity was measured, as described (27Wang W. Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Yang D. Crow M.T. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysate (300 μg of protein) was first immunoprecipitated with anti-CaMKII antibody (1:100) in a Ca2+-free medium containing 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter Na2-EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/liter β-gal, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4. The precipitated proteins were then incubated with a specific peptide substrate (KKALRRQETVDAL) to evaluate the kinase activity by 32P incorporation into the substrate according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), as previously described (27Wang W. Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Yang D. Crow M.T. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot of Cytochrome c—Subcellular fractionation was performed using a previously described method (30Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatant and mitochondrial pellets were used for Western blot analysis. Anti-cytochrome c (0.5 μg/ml, BD Biosciences), or anti-RhoGDI (Abcam) (as a cytosolic marker), anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) (as a mitochondrial marker) (0.1 μg/ml) (BD Bioscience) monoclonal antibodies were utilized. Materials—Ionomycin, thapsigargin, and isoproterenol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, whereas KN-93 and AIP was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance or unpaired Student's t test when appropriate. A pvalue of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Manipulation of CaMKIIδC Activity in Cultured Adult Rat Cardiomyocytes—Previous studies have shown that CaMKII activation has been implicated in β1AR-induced apoptosis of adult mouse cardiomyocytes (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and Ca2+ influx-mediated apoptosis of feline cardiomyocytes (31Chen X. Zhang X. Kubo H. Harris D.M. Mills G.D. Moyer J. Berretta R. Potts S.T. Marsh J.D. Houser S.R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to determine whether there is a causal relation between the activation of CaMKIIδC and heart muscle cell apoptosis. We specifically enhanced or inhibited CaMKIIδC activity by adenoviral gene transfer of a constitutively active (CA-CaMKIIδC) or a dominant negative CaMKIIδC mutant (DN-CaMKIIδC), respectively. The expression of adenovirally delivered HA-tagged WT-, CA-, and DN-CaMKIIδC was determined by Western blotting with either an anti-HA or an anti-CaMKII antibody in cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes 24 h after infection (Fig. 1A). The autonomous activity of CaMKII, i.e. Ca2+-calmodulin-independent kinase activity, assayed by 32P incorporation into a substrate peptide, was elevated by 5.8-fold in cardiomyocytes infected with Adv-CA-CaMKIIδC, whereas it was suppressed by 70% in cardiomyocytes infected with Adv-DN-CaMKIIδC (Fig. 1B). To further evaluate the functional consequence of manipulating CaMKII activity, we examined CaMKII-mediated PLB-Thr17 phosphorylation. Consistent with the kinase activity profile, the expression of CA-CaMKIIδC and DN-CaMKIIδC caused a significant increase and decrease, respectively, in the phosphorylation of PLB-Thr17 (32Yang D. Zhu W. Xiao B. Brochet D.X. Chen S.R. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results indicate that we can specifically enhance or suppress CaMKIIδC activity using adenoviral gene transfer techniques in cultured intact adult rat cardiac myocytes. Increased CaMKIIδC Activity Is Sufficient to Cause Heart Muscle Cell Apoptosis—We next explored the potential effect of CaMKIIδC signaling on myocyte viability. Enforced expression of CA-CaMKIIδC alone caused increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, documented by increased TUNEL staining-positive cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and DNA fragmentation revealed by DNA laddering assay, whereas overexpression of WT-CaMKIIδC did not induce apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 2, A and C), consistent with the kinase activity profile under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). CA-CaMKIIδC-mediated myocyte apoptosis occurred within 24 h after adenoviral gene transfer and increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Inhibition of CaMKII activity with the peptide inhibitor, AIP (5 μm), or co-expression of the DN-CaMKIIδC mutant effectively suppressed CA-CaMKIIδC-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, CA-CaMKIIδC protein abundance and the kinase activity were closely correlated with the amount of Adv-CA-CaMKIIδC virus delivered to the cultured cells (Fig. 3, A and B), with the severity of myocyte apoptosis correlating with the level of CaMKII activity (Fig. 3, C and D).FIGURE 3Correlation between the activity of expressed CA-CaMKIIδC and its evoked apoptosis in cultured cardiac myocytes. A, typical example of Western blot of HA-tagged CA-CAMKIIδC assayed with anti-HA antibody. Similar results were observed in another three independent experiments. All of the experiments were performed after infection of cells, as indicated m.o.i. for 24 h.

D, the elevation in the autonomous activity of CaMKII was closely correlated with the increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells with R2 = 0.88.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Involvement of Mitochondrial Death Machinery in Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis Induced by CaMKIIδC Activation—To investigate whether the mitochondrial death pathway is involved in CaMKIIδC-mediated heart muscle cell apoptosis, cytochrome c release into the cytosol was monitored in subcellular fractions by Western blotting. We found that cytochrome c was markedly increased in the cytosolic fraction but decreased in mitochondrial fraction in cardiomyocytes expressing CA-CaMKIIδC, but not in those expressing DN-CaMKIIδC or WT-CaMKIIδC (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that enhanced CaMKIIδC activity leads to cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. The involvement of mitochondrial death signaling was further substantiated by the fact that overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-XL, suppressed CA-CaMKIIδC-mediated cardiac myocyte apoptosis (Fig. 4, C and D). Activation of Endogenous CaMKII by Various Stimuli That Trigger Myocyte Apoptosis—We next explored the possibility that other cell death-inducing stimuli, such as increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, acidosis, and oxidative stress, activate endogenous CaMKII to induce myocyte cell death. Indeed, CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of PLB, the key physiological regulator of SR Ca2+-ATPase whose phosphorylation at PLB-Thr17 serves as an intracellular marker of increased CaMKII activity, was augmented by 2-3-fold in myocytes treated with Ca2+-elevating agents (1 μm ionomycin, 5 μm thapsigargin, or 60 mm extracellular K+), intracellular acidosis resulting from incubating cells with an acidic buffer with a [pH]o of 5.5 (with the equilibrated [pH]i 6.6) (29Zheng M. Reynolds C. Jo S.H. Wersto R. Han C. Xiao R.P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and oxidative stress caused by the administration of H2O2 (12 μm), compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5), demonstrating that endogenous CaMKII activity was elevated in response to those treatments. The Ca2+-elevating agents markedly promoted myocyte apoptosis as assessed by increased TUNEL staining (Fig. 6A). On average, the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased ∼3.5-fold. Similarly, intracellular acidosis or oxidative stress (H2O2, 12 μm) markedly augmented the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 6, B and C). Inhibition of CaMKII with KN-93 (2 μm) or AIP (5 μm) effectively protected cells not only from the Ca2+-elevating agents (Fig. 6A) but also against acidosis- and H2O2-mediated myocyte apoptosis (Figs. 6, B and C). In contrast, KN-92 (5 μm), an inactive KN-93 analogue, had no detectable protective effect (Fig. 6B). To define the relative contributions of CaMKIIδC versus that of CaMKIIδB to the observed cell death, we suppressed CaMKIIδC activity using adenoviral gene transfer of DN-CaMKIIδC. Isoform-specific inhibition of CaMKIIδC with the DN-CaMKIIδC mutant, similar to isoform-nonselective inhibition of CaMKII with AIP, significantly reduced acidosisor H2O2-mediated (20 μm) myocyte apoptosis (Figs. 7). Thus, increased CaMKII activity is associated with the administration of a number of different cell death-inducing stimuli. Expression of DN-CaMKIIδC is able to inhibit the kinase activity and the associated cell death as well, indicating that activation of CaMKIIδC is a common intermediate in the signaling pathways triggered by multiple stimuli that induce myocyte apoptotic death.FIGURE 7Isoform-specific inhibition of CaMKIIδC by adenoviral gene transfer of DN-CaMKIIδC attenuates acidosis- and H2O2-induced cell death in cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes. 24 h after culture and adenoviral gene transfer of DN-CaMKIIδC or β-gal (as a control adenovirus), the cells were treated with H2O2 (20 μm) for 24 h (A) or an acidic buffer, [pH]o 5.5, for 8 h (B), and then TUNEL staining was performed. Expression of DN-CaMKIIδC significantly reduced both H2O2- and intracellular acidosis-induced cell death. *, p < 0.01 as indicated. n = 4-5 independent experiments in cells from six to eight hearts for each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study, there are two novel findings. First, isoform-specific activation of CaMKIIδC by expression of a constitutively active mutant is sufficient to trigger myocyte apoptosis. Second, inhibition of CaMKII effectively protects myocytes not only from adenoviral gene transfer of CA-CaMKIIδ but also from that caused by increased intracellular Ca2+, intracellular acidosis, and oxidative stress. These results support the conclusion that enhanced activation of CaMKIIδC in cardiac myocytes is a common intermediate in the death signaling pathways initiated by diverse cell death-inducing stimuli. Activation of Cardiac CaMKIIδC Functions as a Common Intermediate Converging a Multitude of Cardiac Apoptotic Signaling Pathways—As is the case for most cells, upstream apoptotic signaling of cardiac myocytes can be classified into two general pathways: the death-ligand receptor-mediated pathway involving activation of caspase-8 and downstream executioner caspases and the mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway, the terminal steps of which involve the release of cytochrome c, recruitment of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), and the activation of caspase-9 and downstream executioner caspases (33Crow M.T. Mani K. Nam Y.J. Kitsis R.N. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 34Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). In contrast to the extrinsic pathway that transduces death signaling from a specialized set of death receptors, the intrinsic pathway integrates a broader spectrum of extracellular and intracellular stresses that activate signals converging on the mitochondria, leading to the release of a number of apoptogenic proteins that either directly or indirectly activate caspases. The present study has shown that activation of the cardiac cytosolic CaMKII isoform, CaMKIIδC, is a common intermediate that integrates various apoptotic stimuli and relays the apoptotic signals to the mitochondrial death machinery, as evidenced by the robust increase in mitochondrial cytochrome c release and the protective effect of Bcl-XL, an important anti-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family (35Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3959) Google Scholar). Altogether, the present findings have identified a potentially crucial molecular intermediate involved in heart muscle cell loss and may shed new light on our understanding of the pathogenesis of heart failure and lead to a potentially important therapeutic approach for reducing myocyte loss, thus preventing or retarding the progression of heart failure caused by various etiologies. Intracellular Distribution Dictates CaMKII Isoform-specific Functions—Recent work has demonstrated that stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors such as ET-1 leads to cardiac myocyte hypertrophy via a signaling pathway sequentially involving Gq, phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated nuclear Ca2+ release, activation of nuclear CaMKII (CaMKIIδB), HDAC5 phosphorylation, and activation of MEF2-dependent transcription (35Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3959) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this Ca2+-dependent, nuclear CaMKII-mediated hypertrophy signaling pathway cannot be activated by the global Ca2+ transients that cause myocyte contraction (36Wu X. Zhang T. Bossuyt J. Li X. McKinsey T.A. Dedman J.R. Olson E.N. Chen J. Brown J.H. Bers D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the distinct intracellular localization of cardiac CaMKIIδB and CaMKIIδC may enable myocytes to distinguish simultaneous local and global Ca2+ signals and exhibit different functional roles. This assumption is supported by studies in CaMKII transgenic mouse models. Specifically, overexpression of the cytoplasmic CaMKIIδC isoform leads to hyperphosphorylation of substrates involved in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, resulting in SR Ca2+ leak and cardiomyopathy (37Zhang T. Maier L.S. Dalton N.D. Miyamoto S. Ross J. Bers D.M. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 38Maier L.S. Zhang T. Chen L. DeSantiago J. Brown J.H. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of the nuclear CaMKIIδB isoform leads to cardiac hypertrophic gene expression profile (21Zhang T. Johnson E.N. Gu Y. Morissette M.R. Sah V.P. Gigena M.S. Belke D.D. Dillmann W.H. Rogers T.B. Schulman H. Ross J. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the intracellular distribution of the kinase dictates its accessibility and sensitivity to physiological and pathological stimuli. Our previous studies have shown that overexpression of CaMKIIδC but not CaMKIIδB enhances β1AR-mediated cardiac myocyte apoptosis (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The present study has further demonstrated that increased activation of CaMKIIδC is sufficient to trigger cardiac myocyte apoptosis, whereas isoform-specific inhibition of CaMKIIδC is able to significantly protect cardiomyocytes against multiple death-inducing stimuli-mediated death. These findings provide an explanation for the observation of more severe heart failure and premature death phenotype in transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac CaMKIIδC (37Zhang T. Maier L.S.

Future investigation is merited to better appreciate the distinct functional roles of these cardiac CaMKII isoforms and their regulation under a variety of physiological or pathological circumstances. Potential Implications of CaMKII Deregulation in the Pathogenesis of Heart Failure—Multiple lines of evidence suggest that deregulation of CaMKII acts as an important pathogenic factor for heart failure, although this kinase plays a pivotal role in normal cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and pacemaker activity (10Xiao R.P.

First, previous studies have demonstrated that sustained β1AR stimulation, a characteristic of the failing heart, causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activation of CaMKII signaling, independently of the classic cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway (25Zhu W.Z. Wang S.Q. Chakir K. Yang D. Zhang T. Brown J.H. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Second, CaMKII expression is increased in the failing hearts of humans and animals (5Hoch B. Meyer R. Hetzer R. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. Circ.

Dalton N.D. Miyamoto S. Ross J. Bers D.M. Brown J.H. Circ.

Moreover, β1AR-induced fetal gene expression, a hallmark of cardiac hypertrophy, is mediated by a CaMKII-dependent mechanism in cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes (39Sucharov C.C. Mariner P.D. Nunley K.R. Long C. Leinwand L. Bristow M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: H1299-H1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of CaMKII activity prevents cardiac arrhythmias and suppresses after depolarizations, a crucial mechanism responsible for heart failure-associated arrhythmias (17Anderson M.E.

Finally, CaMKII inhibition in vivo improves cardiac functional performance and reduces catecholamine- and myocardial infarction-induced maladaptive cardiac remodeling (26Zhang R. Khoo M.S.C. Wu Y. Yang Y. Grueter C.E. Ni G. Price Jr., E.E. Thiel W. Guatimosim S. Song L.S. Madu E.C. Shah A.N. Vishnivetskaya T.A. Atkinson J.B. Gurevich V.V. Salama G. Lederer W.J. Colbran R.J. Anderson M.E. Nat.

These studies have demonstrated that deregulation of CaMKII signaling is essentially involved in many aspects of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, marking CaMKII as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of heart failure."

https://openalex.org/W2034834077,"Among organisms with chromosome-based mechanisms of sex determination, failure to equalize expression of X-linked genes between the sexes is typically lethal. In C. elegans, XX hermaphrodites halve transcription from each X chromosome to match the output of XO males1. Here, we mapped the binding location of the condensin homolog DPY-27 and the zinc finger protein SDC-3, two components of the C. elegans dosage compensation complex (DCC)2,3. We observed strong foci of DCC binding on X, surrounded by broader regions of localization. Binding foci, but not adjacent regions of localization, were distinguished by clusters of a 10-bp DNA motif, suggesting a recruitment-and-spreading mechanism for X recognition. The DCC was preferentially bound upstream of genes, suggesting modulation of transcriptional initiation and polymerase-coupled spreading. Stronger DCC binding upstream of genes with high transcriptional activity indicated a mechanism for tuning DCC activity at specific loci. These data aid in understanding how proteins involved in higher-order chromosome dynamics can regulate transcription at individual loci."

In the current studies we show that protein kinase A (PKA), a mediator of glucagon/cAMP, a fasting signaling, suppresses SREBP-1c by modulating the activity of liver X receptor α (LXRα), a dominant activator of SREBP-1c expression. Activation of PKA repressed LXR-induced SREBP-1c expression both in rat primary hepatocytes and mouse livers. Promoter analyses revealed that the LXRα-binding site in the SREBP-1c promoter is responsible for PKA inhibitory effect on SREBP-1c transcription. In vitro and in vivo PKA directly phosphorylated LXRα, and the two consensus PKA target sites (195, 196 serines and 290, 291 serines) in its ligand binding/heterodimerization domain were crucial for the inhibition of LXR signaling. PKA phosphorylation of LXRα caused impaired DNA binding activity by preventing LXRα/RXR dimerization and decreased its transcription activity by inhibiting recruitment of coactivator SCR-1 and enhancing recruitment of corepressor NcoR1. These results indicate that LXRα is regulated not only by oxysterol derivatives but also by PKA-mediated phosphorylation, which suggests that nutritional regulation of SREBP-1c and lipogenesis could be regulated at least partially through modulation of LXR.

In mammals, carbohydrates are an essential energy resource. When consumed in excess, carbohydrates are converted to lipids by lipogenic enzymes in preparation for times of energy deficiency. These processes are known to be regulated at the transcription level, and several different transcription factors are known to contribute to this regulation.

SREBP-1c plays a role primarily in triglyceride synthesis (2Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

SREBP-1a is expressed in growing cells and activates an entire array of genes involved in both triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis (4Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S.

SREBP-1c expression is highly regulated in response to the nutritional condition. Expression of SREBP-1c is undetectable during fasting, whereas its expression is strongly induced in a fed state followed by similar adapted nutritional changes in lipogenic genes (6Horton J.D.

To understand the molecular mechanism of nutritional regulation of SREBP-1c expression, the SREBP-1c gene promoter has been extensively studied. In the proximal region of the mouse SREBP-1c promoter, Sp1, NF-Y, USF, SREBP, and LXR-binding sites have been identified (7Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Yoshikawa T. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Okazaki H.

LXRs directly bind the cis element on the SREBP-1c promoter as heterodimers with RXR, leading to transcriptional activation (8Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T.

Several studies have established LXRs as dominant activators of SREBP-1c expression. LXRα/β double knock-out mice revealed dramatically reduced expression of SREBP-1c (9Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J.

Considering that hepatic SREBP-1c expression is dominated by LXRs and eliminated by fasting, it is probable that there is a mechanism by which LXR mediates the repressed SREBP-1c expression during fasting. Consistently, it has been reported that glucagons and its signal mediator, cAMP, suppresses SREBP-1c in rat primary hepatocytes (24Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X.

Protein kinase A (PKA) is a cAMP-dependent protein kinase that consists of both a catalytic and regulatory subunit and regulates numerous cellular functions in eukaryotic cells by phosphorylating target proteins. In regard to energy metabolism, PKA is subordinated to glucagon and adrenalin and, therefore, is classically recognized as a fasting signal to activate gluconeogenesis and β-oxidation and to oppose triglycerides synthesis and glucose utilization. It is known that several nuclear receptors (e.g. estrogen receptor, retinoic acid receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α) are phosphorylated by PKA leading to modification of their trans activities via diverse mechanism (25Chen D.

Transfections and Luciferase Assay—293 cells and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin and streptomycin supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 24-well plate overnight before transfection. Cells were transfected with reporter vector, expression vector using FuGENE 6. Total amounts of DNA were adjusted to 0.5 μg/well using empty vector. After 24 h of incubation, the amounts of firefly luciferase activity in transfectants were measured. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized by the amounts of Renilla luciferase activity expressed from CMV or SV40 promoter linked-Renilla luciferase unless otherwise indicated. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Histidine-tagged recombinant mouse LXRα proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21, DE3) and purified using standard techniques and purification kit Mag Extractor (TOYOBO) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, bacterial culture containing kanamycin were grown at 37 °C. After induction of recombinant proteins for 2–3 h, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 5 m NaCl (pH 8.0)) and lysed by sonication. The centrifuged supernatant was mixed for 30 min at room temperature on a rotator with magnetic nickel beads. Protein-absorbed beads were washed with lysis buffer, and recombinant LXRα proteins were eluted with elution buffer. After dialysis to exclude guanidine, the concentration and size of histidine-tagged proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting using a known quantity of molecular weight standards. The purified proteins were stored at –80 °C until experiments were performed. Bovine purified PKA catalytic subunit was purchased from Promega.

In Vivo Kinase Assay—For in vivo kinase assay, COS7 cells prepared in 100-mm collagen-coated dishes at 1 × 106 cells/dish were transfected with control or expression vector for HA-tagged human LXRα vectors. After transfection, the cells were starved in phosphate-deficient medium for 12 h and then incubated for 2 h in the same medium containing 500 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were treated with PKA activators (forskolin 10 μm, dibutyryl-cAMP 1 mm, isobutylmethylxanthine 1 mm) for 30 min before harvesting. At the end of the labeling period the cells were washed ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed on ice.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides of LXR response element in SREBP-1c promoter using in EMSA were prepared as previously described. In vitro synthetic protein lysate or nuclear extracts (∼1 μg) were incubated. DNA-protein complex were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was conducted with a chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). After H2.35 cells were treated with PKA activators (10 μm forskolin, 100 μm dibutyryl-cAMP) or vehicle under T0901317 (10 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C, H2.35 cells were cross-linked for 10 min by adding formaldehyde directly to culture medium to a final concentration of 1%. Cross-linked cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, scraped, pelleted, resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) per 1 × 106 cells and incubated for 10 min on ice. The lysates were then sonicated for 30 s each by sonicator (Sonifer 250, Branson) with 20% duty cycle and 10% output power. The samples were on ice for 1 min between the cycles. After sonication the samples were centrifuged, and supernatant was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer containing protease inhibitors. 2-ml aliquots were precleared with 75 μl of a 50% slurry of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated overnight with 3 μg of anti-RXR antibody or control IgG. Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with 60 μl of protein A. After intensive washing, pellets were eluted by freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C after adding 20 μl of 5 m NaCl. Samples were purified with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. DNA pellets were dissolved with Tris-EDTA buffer and used as templates in PCR. Eight μl of 20 μl of DNA solution was used for PCR amplification (1st step of 95 °C for 3 min (one cycle), 2nd step of 94 °C for 1 min, 62.1 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min (25 cycles)). ChIP primers were 5′-GAACCAGCGGTGGGAACACAGAGC-3′ and 5′-GACGGCGGCAGCTCGGGTTTCTC. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—COS7 cells were seeded on 100-mm dishes and transfected with the expression vectors. After incubation for 48 h, dbcAMP (100 μm), forskolin (10 μm), and isobutylmethylxanthine (100 μm) were added into medium for 30 min, and then cells were harvested.

GST Pulldown Assay—GST and GST-LXRα proteins were prepared using standard techniques according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, E. coli (BL21, DE3) transformed with the GST or GST-LXRα expression vector were incubated before induction at room temperature for 4 h with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in buffer A (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 6% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm DTT). The cells were lysed by sonication, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Recombinant GST or GST-LXRα proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were eluted (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm glutathione, protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm DTT). Amounts and sizes of GST or GST-LXRα proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting using anti-LXR antibody. GST or GST-LXRα and the PKA c subunit or equal amounts of bovine serum albumin were mixed in PKA buffer (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. After adding glutathione beads and 35S-radiolabeled SRC-1 nuclear receptor interaction domain (amino acids 576–779) synthesized in vitro to samples and incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, beads were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins bound to beads were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm glutathione), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized autoradiography. PKA Represses Expression of SREBP-1 in Vivo—Expression of SREBP-1c in the liver is highly regulated by nutrition; it is suppressed at fasting and induced in a refed state as previously reported (6Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). One potential mechanism of this suppression at fasting could be mediated through the cAMP/PKA system that mediates the glucagon signal. C57BL/6J mice in a refed state were administrated with dibutyryl-cAMP and theophylline for activation of PKA to mimic fasting signal. The SREBP-1c mRNA that was highly induced by refeeding was robustly repressed by cAMP/theophylline administration (Fig. 1A). Reciprocally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a gene that controls gluconeogenesis and a well known target of the glucagon/cAMP/PKA signal, was suppressed by refeeding but restored by these PKA activators. The reduction of SREBP-1 mRNA level by PKA activation was associated with a robust decrease in active SREBP-1c protein in hepatic nuclear extracts (Fig. 1B). SREBP-1c expression is dominantly controlled by LXR/RXR that binds directly to the two LXREs in the SREBP-1c promoter (8Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T.

https://openalex.org/W1980587214,"In the brain, calcium influx following a train of action potentials activates potassium channels that mediate a slow afterhyperpolarization current (I(sAHP)). The key steps between calcium influx and potassium channel activation remain unknown. Here we report that the key intermediate between calcium and the sAHP channels is the diffusible calcium sensor hippocalcin. Brief depolarizations sufficient to activate the I(sAHP) in wild-type mice do not elicit the I(sAHP) in hippocalcin knockout mice. Introduction of hippocalcin in cultured hippocampal neurons leads to a pronounced I(sAHP), while neurons expressing a hippocalcin mutant lacking N-terminal myristoylation exhibit a small I(sAHP) that is similar to that recorded in uninfected neurons. This implies that hippocalcin must bind to the plasma membrane to mediate its effects. These findings support a model in which the calcium sensor for the sAHP channels is not preassociated with the channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091065187,"Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is a large tumor suppressor that is truncated in most colorectal cancers. The carboxyl-terminal third of APC protein mediates direct interactions with microtubules and the microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB1. In addition, APC has been localized to actin-rich regions of cells, but the mechanism and functional significance of this localization have remained unclear. Here we show that purified carboxyl-terminal basic domain of human APC protein (APC-basic) bound directly to and bundled actin filaments and associated with actin stress fibers in microinjected cells. Actin filaments and microtubules competed for binding to APC-basic, but APC-basic also could cross-link actin filaments and microtubules at specific concentrations, suggesting a possible role in cytoskeletal cross-talk. APC interactions with actin in vitro were inhibited by its ligand EB1, and co-microinjection of EB1 prevented APC association with stress fibers. Point mutations in EB1 that disrupted APC binding relieved the inhibition in vitro and restored APC localization to stress fibers in vivo, demonstrating that EB1-APC regulation is direct. Because tumor formation and metastasis involve coordinated changes in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, this novel function for APC and its regulation by EB1 may have direct implications for understanding the molecular basis of tumor suppression."

Mutations in the TREX1 gene are an underlying cause of the neurological brain disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome implicating TREX1 dysfunction in an aberrant immune response. TREX1 action during apoptosis likely prevents autoimmune reaction to DNA that would otherwise persist. To understand the impact of TREX1 mutations identified in patients with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome on structure and activity we determined the x-ray crystal structure of the dimeric mouse TREX1 protein in substrate and product complexes containing single-stranded DNA and deoxyadenosine monophosphate, respectively. The structures show the specific interactions between the bound nucleotides and the residues lining the binding pocket of the 3′ terminal nucleotide within the enzyme active site that account for specificity, and provide the molecular basis for understanding mutations that lead to disease. Three mutant forms of TREX1 protein identified in patients with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome were prepared and the measured activities show that these specific mutations reduce enzyme activity by 4–35,000-fold.

Processing of DNA ends is an important step in many DNA metabolic pathways such as replication, repair, and recombination. The 3′ → 5′ exonucleases play a critical role in correcting fragmented, modified, mispaired, or even normal nucleotides to generate 3′ termini suitable for downstream events. The drastic consequences that result from impaired 3′ exonuclease activities underscore the importance of these enzymes for cell survival.

A hallmark of the DnaQ family exonucleases is three conserved sequence motifs known as Exo I, II, and III. These motifs contain four conserved acidic residues that participate in coordination of divalent metal ions required for catalysis. The TREX exonucleases are members of a DnaQ family subset that contain a His rather than a Tyr in the ExoIII motif, referred to as the ExoIIIϵ motif (18Barnes M.H. Spacciapoli P. Li D.H. Brown N.C.

Although the mammalian TREX1 and TREX2 proteins share about 40% amino acid sequence identity, there are distinct structural differences between the two that point to different biological roles for these proteins. The TREX1 protein contains a C-terminal domain of about 75 amino acids that is not present in the TREX2 protein. The amino acid sequences of the C-terminal domains of TREX1 proteins from different mammalian species are moderately conserved, but have no sequence identity to other proteins in the available data base. Additionally, the TREX1 amino acid sequence reveals the presence of a non-repetitive proline-rich region that is also not present in the TREX2 protein. Furthermore, the TREX2 enzymes contain a conserved DNA binding loop positioned adjacent to the active site that has a sequence distinct from the corresponding loop in the TREX1 enzymes. The non-processive autonomous nature of the TREX enzymes suggested that these proteins might serve a proofreading function for one of the multiple human DNA polymerases (10Hoss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, Trex1-/- mice show no increase in spontaneous mutation rates but rather display dramatically reduced survival and develop inflammatory myocarditis, indicating a previously unrecognized cellular role for this enzyme (21Morita M.

Recently, it was also discovered that the TREX1 protein, but not TREX2, participates in the SET complex and acts to rapidly degrade 3′ ends of nicked DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell death (26Chowdhury D.

TREX1 was shown to function in concert with the NM23-H1 nuclease, pp32, HMG-2, and APE1 proteins and to directly associate with the SET protein. Unlike NM23-H1, however, the TREX1 exonuclease activity does not seem to be inhibited by its interaction with the SET protein and the TREX1 protein is not a substrate for granzyme A protease, as are the SET, APE1, and HMG-2 proteins. The crystal structure of the human TREX2 protein revealed the unique dimeric nature of the TREX family exonucleases and provided the initial picture of a human DnaQ family member (27Perrino F.W.

Symmetry in the dimer positions the active sites of each monomer on opposite edges providing open access for DNA interactions and suggested a mechanism for its non-processive catalysis. However, the TREX2 structure was determined in the absence of divalent metal ions, or nucleotides that prevented a complete understanding of how these incredibly efficient enzymes interact with DNA to facilitate hydrolytic cleavage. In an effort to better understand the biological and exonucleolytic function of this important family of enzymes we have determined the x-ray structures of the TREX1 protein in a substrate complex with ssDNA and calcium ions, as well as, a product complex containing a 2′-deoxyadenosine monophosphate (dAMP) and manganese ions, both to a resolution of 2.1 Å. The structures reveal important protein-nucleotide interactions that participate in defining the specificity of 3′ terminal nucleotide recognition, binding, and cleavage. Additionally, the structure of the non-repetitive proline-rich region within TREX1 suggests a potential mechanism for interactions with other proteins. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—A gene fragment encoding amino acids 1–242 of the human or mouse TREX1 protein was expressed as a fusion with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) using a modified pMAL-C2 vector (New England Biolabs). The vector was modified to encode a polyhistidine sequence on the N terminus of MBP and to encode the rhinovirus 3C protease recognition site between the mbp and TREX1 genes. The plasmid was transformed into the BL21 Star (DE3) strain of Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) for overexpression. The cells were grown to an A600 ∼0.5 at 37 °C and quickly cooled on ice to 17 °C. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside the cells were allowed to grow for 15 h at 17 °C. The MBP-mTREX1 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The MBP protein was removed from the fusion by treatment with PreScission Protease™ (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 20 h. The mTREX1ΔC protein was separated from the MBP by cation exchange chromatography, and dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. Protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml and frozen at -80 °C until needed. All TREX1 mutant plasmid constructs were produced using a PCR site-directed mutagenesis strategy (44Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Shinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar), and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—The protein was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique. Substrate or product complex was formed by mixing protein with ssDNA (GACG) in a molar ratio of 1:2 or dAMP in a 1:3 ratio. 2 μl of protein complex at 5 mg/ml was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and placed on a bridge above the 500-ml reservoir solution. The ssDNA complex was crystallized using 22% PEG3350, 6% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and the dAMP complex crystallized using 22% PEG 3350, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 2 mm MnCl2, and 500 μm nucleotide monophosphate. Crystallization experiments were carried out at 20 °C and crystals appeared within 2 days. Prior to data collection crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing 15% glycerol for 2 min in preparation for freezing. Crystals were then mounted in a nylon loop and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the TREX1-dAMP complex belong to space group R3 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 119.7 Å, c = 83.3 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. Crystals of the TREX1-ssDNA complex belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 64.8, b = 57.1, c = 68.5 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 107.5° (Table 1). Two TREX1 molecules occupy the asymmetric unit of each crystal form (VM = 2.3 Å3/Da for dAMP complex and 2.1 Å3/Da for ssDNA complex).TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statistics Statistics for outer resolution shell (2.17 – 2.10 Å) are given in parentheses.TREX1 complexdAMPssDNASpace groupR3P21Unit cell, Åa = b = 119.7, c = 83.3a = 64.8, b = 57.1, c = 68.5α,β = 90°, γ = 120°α,γ = 90°, β = 107.5°Molecules/asymmetric unit22Wavelength, Å1.541.54Resolution, Å50–2.150–2.1Completeness, %99 (100)99 (99)Rmerge, %aRmerge = Σ|I – 〈I〉|/ΣI, where I is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity8.9 (35.2)5.0 (29.5)Mean I/σ17 (4)11 (4)Average redundancy114R-factor, %bR factor = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|.

Phases for the data were obtained by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (29McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

The TREX1-dAMP-Mn and TREX1-ssDNA-Ca models were built using the program COOT (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The change in the free R-factor was monitored at each step in refinement, as well as the inspection of stereochemical parameters with the programs PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) and ERRAT (34Colovos C. Yeates T.O. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). The models converged with a final R-factor of 20.5% (Rfree = 25.1%) for the TREX1-ssDNA complex and 20.4% (Rfree = 24.8%) for the TREX1-dAMP complex using all observed x-ray data measurements in the resolution range 50-2.1 Å. A Ramachandran plot shows that greater than 91% of all residues in the models have ϕ and Ψ angles in the most preferred regions with no residues in the disallowed regions. Coordinates have been deposited for mTREX1-ssDNA-Ca (2OA8) mTREX1-dAMP-Mn (2IOC) with the indicated accession codes. TREX1 Activity Assays—The exonuclease activities of TREX1 enzymes (supplemental materials Fig. S1, b and c) were measured in reactions (30 μl) using 50 nm fluorescein-labeled (6-FAM) 30-mer oligonucleotide substrate as described (27Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All incubations were 20 min at 25 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by A280 using the molar extinction coefficient for the human TREX1 ϵ = 23,950 m-1 cm-1 and mouse TREX1 ϵ = 24,325 m-1 cm-1. Structure of the TREX1 Protein—We crystallized a truncated form of the mouse TREX1 protein that lacks 72 amino acids at the C terminus (mTREX1ΔC) in complexes with ssDNA-Ca2+ and dAMP-Mn2+. Full-length recombinant TREX1 protein is insoluble and prone to proteolytic degradation under a variety of expression and purification conditions. The truncated TREX1 protein is able to form stable dimers and possess enzymatic activity nearly identical to the full-length protein. 3U. de Silva, S. Choudhury, S. L. Bailey, S. Harvey, F. W. Perrino, and T. Hollis, unpublished results. Manganese has been shown to be able to substitute for magnesium in the nucleolytic activity of TREX1 (12Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17022-17029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas calcium inhibits enzymatic activity. The structures were determined by molecular replacement using the human TREX2 protein as a search model (Fig. 1, Table 1). The correct solutions each provided an initial R-factor of about 45% after placement of the two TREX1 monomers and a round of rigid body refinement, with good electron density for most of the residues in the asymmetric unit. Density for the nucleotides and two metal ions (not in search model) was also present in the active sites of both structures (Fig. 2). The position and identity of the metal ions was confirmed by calculation of an anomalous difference map that showed only the density for the metal ions at a contour level of 5 σ in each case. The crystallographic models of the TREX1 dimers have been refined to a final R-factor of 20.5% (Rfree = 25.1%) and 20.4% (Rfree = 24.8%) for the ssDNA complex and dAMP complex, respectively, using all x-ray data to a resolution limit of 2.1 Å (Table 1).FIGURE 2Omit Fo - Fc electron density for ssDNA and dAMP complexes.

Each TREX1 monomer consists of a mixed α/β-fold with 5 anti-parallel β-strands surrounded by 9 α-helices, closely structurally resembling the ϵ subunit and Exo I proteins, both members of the DnaQ family of 3′ exonucleases (SCOP data base) (35Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5610) Google Scholar). The TREX1 monomers interact with each other along the outermost β-strand (β3) to form an extended, central antiparallel β-sheet that stretches through the length of the dimer, as seen in the TREX2 protein structure. TREX1 has an extensive dimer interface that involves 1650 Å2 of buried surface area from each monomer (∼15% of monomer surface) with stabilizing contributions from hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and hydrophobic interactions. DNA Binding and Substrate Specificity—The TREX1 protein was crystallized in both substrate and product complexes. The ssDNA is bound in the TREX1 active site mostly through a combination of sequence independent hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3a). The phosphate oxygens of the 3′ nucleotide contribute to the coordination of two divalent metal ions along with carboxylate oxygens of Asp18, Glu20, Asp130, and Asp200 and several water molecules. A superposition of the substrate and product complexes shows minimal change in the protein structure between the two complexes (root mean square deviation = 0.6 Å). The 3′ nucleotide of the ssDNA is bound in the same orientation as the dAMP in the product complex with only a minor change in orientation of the phosphate group of the dAMP (Fig. 3b), as similarly seen in the substrate and product complexes of the exonuclease domain of the E. coli DNA polymerase I protein (36Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The structures of the substrate and product complexes reveal a nucleotide binding pocket formed by strand (β1) and helix (α2) within the active site that provides interactions with the base, deoxyribose sugar, and phosphate moieties of the 3′ end of DNA that in turn provides substrate specificity and spatial positioning of terminal nucleotides for efficient catalysis (Fig. 3a). The adenine base of the bound nucleotide sits in a cleft formed between Leu24 and the hydrophobic face of helix α2. The deoxyribose of the nucleotide is positioned by hydrogen bonding interactions between the 3′ hydroxyl group and the backbone amide nitrogen of Ala21 and a carboxylate oxygen of Glu20. These specific interactions within the nucleotide binding pocket are significant because they explain the inability of the TREX1 enzyme to hydrolyze bases that have modified 3′ termini. DNA containing a phosphate, phosphoglycolate, or tyrosyl residues at the 3′ terminus is resistant to digestion by the TREX1 enzyme (37Inamdar K.V. Yu Y. Povirk L.F. Radiat. Res. 2002; 157: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) because such a bulky modification sterically hinders the proper positioning of the nucleotide in the binding pocket and thereby prevents catalysis. Likewise, an abasic nucleotide is resistant to hydrolysis by TREX enzymes (data not shown) presumably due to the missing interactions of the base within the cleft that help anchor the terminal nucleotide in the correct orientation for hydrolysis. Efficient hydrolysis of 3′ nucleotides by the TREX enzymes seems to be, in part, a consequence of their ability to interact efficiently with DNA. The apparent high affinity of TREX1 and TREX2 for DNA, compared with other DnaQ exonucleases such as ϵ (38Maki H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4389-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39Miller H. Perrino F.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12919-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), has been attributed to a flexible loop between helices α6 and α7, adjacent to the active site, that contains conserved arginine residues (12Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17022-17029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the human TREX2 protein the loop contains 3 arginines shown to contribute to tight DNA binding (Arg163, Arg165, and Arg167). Mutation of any of the individual arginines to alanine increases the apparent Km value for DNA of TREX2 by about 5-fold and as much as 100-fold when all three are mutated. By contrast, the corresponding loop in TREX1 has only a single conserved arginine residue (Arg174), and yet the apparent Km value of TREX1 for single-stranded DNA (∼10 nm) is about 10-fold lower than that of the TREX2 protein (∼100 nm) with nearly identical kcat values measured for the two enzymes (∼12 s-1) (12Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17022-17029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There are several possible explanations for this apparent paradox. The first is that there are other residues outside the α6–α7 loop in the TREX1 protein contributing to DNA binding. A comparison of the TREX1 and TREX2 protein structures shows that TREX1 utilizes residue Arg128, located at the edge of the active site, to participate in DNA binding through hydrogen bond interactions with the O6 and N7 of the 5′ guanine base that is rotated in a syn conformation (Fig. 3a). Although the arginine is interacting specifically with the guanine, it could potentially make similar hydrogen bond interactions with the exocyclic oxygen or amine of any base, and might contribute to destabilizing double-stranded DNA to provide single-stranded substrate for the enzyme active site. The corresponding residue in the TREX2 protein is Asp121, which has a much shorter side chain and therefore is unable to participate in similar interactions with the DNA. An additional explanation for the apparent differences between TREX1 and TREX2 in DNA binding affinity might result from entropic differences during the DNA binding event. The DNA binding loop in TREX2 was proposed to be flexible based on the lack of electron density in the structure for 9 residues including the 3 arginines (27Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the TREX1 structure much of the same loop is disordered, however, the proximal part of the loop contain"

One characteristic of this protein family is that constituent proteins can exist in both transmembrane and soluble forms. Recently, gliomedin expressed at the tips of Schwann cell microvilli was found to bind axonal adhesion molecules neurofascin and NrCAM in interactions essential for Na+-channel clustering at the nodes of Ranvier in myelinating peripheral nerves.

Here we analyze the tissue form of gliomedin and demonstrate that the molecule not only exists as full-length gliomedin but also as a soluble form shed from the cell surface in a furin-dependent manner. In addition, gliomedin can be further proteolytically processed by bone morphogenetic protein 1/Tolloid-like enzymes, resulting in release of the olfactomedin domain from the collagen domains.

Collagens and other proteins with collagenous domains constitute the most abundant components of the extracellular matrix. They also play essential roles in development and provision of structural integrity to most tissues and organs and can be divided into nine subgroups (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I.

Such cleavage is by furin-like proprotein convertases of the S8 family of Kex/subtilisin-related serine endopeptidases (6Nakayama K. Biochem.

In contrast, collagen XVII is not directly cleaved by furin-like convertases. Rather, furin-like convertases activate ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family proteinases that cleave collagen XVII (2Franzke C.W. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol.

The molecular mechanism by which olfactomedin domains carry out adhesive functions remains unknown. The colmedin gliomedin has been identified in all sequenced vertebrate genomes. In invertebrates several orthologous genes have been identified, with one copy of the gene found in Drosophila melanogaster and two copies, unc-122 (uncoordinated movement) and Cof-2 (colmedin family member 2), identified in Caenorhabditis elegans. Duplication like the latter has not been detected in other species. Of all collagen types, essentially only collagens IV and XVIII are conserved throughout the animal kingdom (1Myllyharju J.

Thus, conservation of gliomedin-like genes in such a broad range of species suggests functions fundamental to life.

Myelinated axons allow saltatory conduction at the nodes of Ranvier, which are periodic interruptions in the myelin sheath that are characterized by clustering of voltage-gated Na+ channels (24Waxman S.G. Ritchie J.M. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Development of the nodes is not intrinsically regulated by axons but instead requires close contact with Schwann cell processes for Na+ channel clustering (25Vabnick I. Novakovic S.D. Levinson S.R. Schachner M. Shrager P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4914-4922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gliomedin, expressed on the tips of Schwann cell microvilli flanking the nodes, appears to interact with axonal receptors NrCAM and neurofascin in an early step necessary to the clustering of Na+ channels and associated scaffolding molecules that define node formation (23Eshed Y.

The bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1)/Tolloid-related metalloproteinases play key roles in morphogenetic events by regulating formation of mammalian extracellular matrix via biosynthetic processing of precursor proteins into mature, functional matrix components. These include collagens I-III, V, VII, and XI; the collagen cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase, basement membrane component laminin 332, and proteoglycans biglycan, osteoglycin, and perlecan (26Scott I.C.

BMP-1/Tolloid-related proteinases also affect morphogenesis by activating a subset of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily of growth factors, including BMP-2 and -4 and growth and differentiation factors 8 and 11 (30Ge G. Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res. C. Embryo Today. 2006; 78: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In fact, BMP-1/Tolloid-related proteinases may serve to orchestrate extracellular matrix formation and signaling by such molecules in morphogenesis and homeostasis. Here we describe shedding and processing of the Schwann cell transmembrane protein gliomedin. Our results demonstrate that shedding of the ectodomain is accomplished by proteases of the furin family using the juxtamembrane RNKR cleavage site. Additional processing of gliomedin is dependent on BMP-1/Tolloid-related proteinases and occurs in the linker region between collagenous and olfactomedin domains. The latter processing gives rise to free olfactomedin domains, which initiate formation of high order insoluble molecular aggregates. cDNA Isolation—In a search for novel transmembrane collagens, a novel expressed sequence tag (dbEST) was identified (GenBank™ accession number NM_177350) that showed homology to the UNC-122 protein (uncoordinated movement) in C. elegans (10Loria P.M. Hodgkin J. Hobert O. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Prediction programs used for the primary structure analysis of gliomedin were TMHMM Server Version 2.0, Coils Version 2.1, NetNGlyc Version 1.0, NetOGlyc Version 3.1, and Pfam Version 19.0. Sequences used for comparison were the following: CG6867 (D. melanogaster) AAF48788; gliomedin (murine) NP_796324; olfactomedin (murine) AAH26547.1; colmedin family member 2 (C. elegans) AAN60526.2; unc-122 (C. elegans) NP_493598.1; collagen XIII (murine) NP_031757. Recombinant Expression of Secreted Gliomedin and Its Fragments—The following fragments of gliomedin were amplified and cloned into an episomal expression vector: the olfactomedin domain (nucleotides 814-1686, NM_177350), the ectodomain (nucleotides 147-1686, NM_177350), and the full-length molecule (nucleotides 21-1686, NM_177350). One μg of total RNA from murine skeletal muscle, retina, and brain was reverse-transcribed, and PCR was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Expand Long Template PCR System, Roche Diagnostics). For the olfactomedin domain construct, NheI and BglII sites were introduced using primers aacgctagcacggccaccaaacgtgttcaacag (fw) and gtgagatctccgctgacttgatgccgctgac (rev), respectively. To clone the ectodomain, NheI (fw, cacgctagcagtgctgtgccagtggcggggg) and BglII (rev, gtgagatctccgctgacttgatgccgctgac) sites were introduced. For cloning the gliomedin full-length construct, KpnI and BglII sites were inserted using primers fw (aacggtaccccggcctgagcacgcagacatg) and rev (gtgagatctccgctgacttgatgccgctgac). PCR products were purified on an agarose gel (Qiagen) and subcloned (rapid DNA ligation kit, Roche Diagnostics) into a PCEP-4 expression vector (modified by M. Koch) that contains 3′ His8 and FLAG tags. Site-directed mutagenesis of full-length gliomedin was carried out using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce R91A91 (fw, gcagcggccaacaagcgcagccacaacggc; rev, cttgttggccgctgcgctcatggggtcctg) and D278A/D279A mutations (fw, cccaatgctgctaccttggtgggaagagctgat; rev, caaggtagcagcattgggtatgacacacgtctc). Ligated vectors were transformed into TOP 10 bacterial cells (Invitrogen), and the clones were verified by sequencing (ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer, Applied Biosystems, ZBA CMM Cologne). HEK-293 cells (Invitrogen) cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) F-12 (Invitrogen) were transfected (FuGENE, Roche Diagnostics or Lipofectamin-2000, Invitrogen) with the expression vector and selected with puromycin (Sigma) after 2 days. Stably transformed HEK-293 cells were pseudo-subcloned, and the clones with the highest protein production were expanded for large scale production. Other cell lines used were Cos-7 (ATCC CRL 1651) and RN-2 (schwannoma cell line, a kind gift from Prof. Stoffel) cultured in DMEM-F-12 (Invitrogen) and C6 (ATCC CCL 107, a kind gift from Prof. Stoffel) cultured in Ham's F-10 medium. Purification of Recombinant Fragments—Three liters of serum-free supernatant from these cells were collected and supplemented with 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Fluka). The supernatant was titrated with 0.5 m NaH2PO4 buffer to a final pH of 7.6 and applied to a cobalt-charged Talon Superflow column (Takara, Clontech) or nickel-charged nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 10 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl at pH 8, and elution was carried out with 20 mm Tris and 300 mm NaCl at pH 7.8 and increasing imidazole concentrations (5-80 mm). In some cases the His tag was digested with thrombin (isolated from bovine plasma, Sigma) according to the protocol from EMD Bioscience, and protein was again applied to a cobalt-charged Sepharose column. Antibody Production—The purified olfactomedin domain of murine gliomedin was injected into a rabbit (KR 34) and a guinea pig (KG 44) for polyclonal antibody production. The resulting KR 34 and KG 44 antisera were affinity-purified on a murine gliomedin protein column that was prepared by coupling the olfactomedin domain to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). Bound antibodies were eluted with triethylamine at pH 11.5 and immediately neutralized. N-Glycosidase F Digestion—To remove all N-linked glycans of the highly glycosylated gliomedin protein, an N-glycosidase F digestion was performed. 3-5 μg of protein of the different purified gliomedin fragments were diluted in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% SDS, heated for 15 min at 95 °C, and diluted again to achieve a final concentration of 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. 3 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) were added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Digested fragments were analyzed on a 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. Rotary Shadowing—Solutions of single proteins were diluted to 10 μg/ml with 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, and after the addition of an equal volume of glycerol, the solutions were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica sheets. The samples were immediately placed on the holder of a MED 010 evaporator (Balzers S.p.A., Milan, Italy), and rotary shadowing was carried out as previously described (31Rousselle P. Keene D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of Gliomedin—KR 34 and KG 44 pAbs were used for immunofluorescence staining of mouse sciatic nerve as described previously (32Bosio A. Binczek E. Haupt W.F. Stoffel W. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The dissected sciatic nerves of 3-10-week-old mice were incubated in collagenase (3.5 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and dispase II (2.4 units/ml, Roche Diagnostics, Germany) for up to 30 min at 37 °C. Nerves were then rinsed with 50 mm PBS, pH 7.4, and placed on coverslips previously coated with collagen solution type I from calf skin (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:10 in PBS. Nerve fibers were gently separated with fine needles to achieve single fibers followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. Nerves were rinsed again with 50 mm PBS, pH 7.4, and dried for 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were blocked for 1.5 h using 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% fetal calf serum in 100 mm PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibodies pAb KR 34 (1:1000 in blocking solution), pAb KG 44 (1:1000), rat anti-laminin γ1 chain monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA; 1:2000), or anti-Na+ channel (III-IV linker region rabbit affinity-purified IgG, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; 1:100) was done overnight at 4 °C or 3 h at room temperature. A 1-h incubation was followed with Cy3 goat anti-rabbit 1:400 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa 488 goat anti-rat 1:400 (Molecular Probes), or Cy3 goat anti-guinea pig 1:300 (Dianova, Germany) coupled secondary antibody at room temperature. Samples were rinsed again with PBS, pH 7.4, and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Cytomation). Nerves were imaged with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS SL). Images shown here were created using Adobe Photoshop (Version 7.0). No enhancements other than contrast and brightness were performed on the images. For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Where indicated, 6 m urea was added to the SDS gel and sample buffer to avoid protein aggregation. 4-20% pre cast gels (NuPAGE Bis-Tris Gels, Invitrogen) were used for improved separation. The affinity-purified antibody KR 34 was diluted 1:1000-1:5000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 3% milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20 or PBS-Tween containing 5% milk. Incubation overnight (4 °C) was followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked swine anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000) (Dako Cytomation) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:20,000 in PBS-Tween with 0.5% milk. The monoclonal mouse anti-His6 antibody (Dianova, Germany) was diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight (4 °C) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were visualized with Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare and Pierce). For densitometric measurements signals were recorded with a Diana III (camera) and quantified with an Aida image analyzer 3.27. Coomassie staining was performed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. Tissue and Cell Culture Extractions—For analysis of gliomedin in tissue, sciatic nerves of 2-month-old mice were dissected and extracted in buffer containing 6 m urea plus 2% Triton X-114 at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. For collagenase digestion, 40 μl of supernatant was used, and immunoblotting was carried out with 30 μl of supernatant. Extraction of cultured cell layers was performed for 30 min on ice using a neutral buffer containing 1% Nonidet-P40, 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Diagnostics) and other protease inhibitors (Complete mix, Roche Diagnostics). The cell lysate was then harvested with a cell scraper and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for further analysis. To analyze proteins in culture media, 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche diagnostics) were added to the medium. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Collagenase Digestion—As part of analyzing the domain structure of gliomedin, tissue extracts were subjected to collagenase digestion. Incubation with 200 units/ml highly purified bacterial collagenase (Advanced Biofactures Inc., Lynbrook, NY) was carried out using 50 μl of tissue extraction buffer containing 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Diagnostics) and 10 mm CaCl2 at pH 8. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding EDTA. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells previously cultured in 0.25 mm ascorbate (Sigma) and ascorbate-phosphate (0.45 mm, Sigma) were washed 3 times with PBS and surface-biotinylated for 5 min with Biotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem) followed by extensive washing with PBS. Cells were then cultured in medium supplemented with ascorbate and ascorbate-phosphate, and both media and cell extracts were collected at different time points for up to 48 h. Protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed with pAb KR 34 coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), and precipitates were immunoblotted. Biotinylated gliomedin was detected with a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (GE Healthcare). Protease Inhibitor Studies—Stably transfected Cos-7 or HEK-293 cells were plated at subconfluence and incubated with media supplemented with ascorbate/ascorbate-phosphate and inhibitors of interest in different concentrations for a defined period of time. Cell extracts and media were handled as described above, and protein concentrations were quantified. Equal amounts of supernatant were precipitated with 4× acetone at -20 °C overnight and collected by centrifuging 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 65 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Pefabloc, pH 7.4. The following protease inhibitors were used: AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; Merck), furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), E-64 (l-3-carboxy-2, 3-trans-epoxypropionyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane), pepstatin A (Sigma), aprotinin, 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline, BB-3103 and BB 3241 (both British Biotech), and IC-3 (Immunex Corp.). For BMP-1/Tolloid inhibitor studies, stably transfected HEK-293 cells were cultured in complete medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1mm l-glutamine, and 10 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin. At 80% confluence, cells were incubated for 24 h in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor with/without 20 μm FG2575 (a kind gift of FibroGen, Inc.), a specific inhibitor of the BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases (33Ge G. Hopkins D.R. Ho W.B. Greenspan D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5846-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells were then rinsed in PBS, washed for 15 min in serum-free DMEM, and incubated an additional 24 h in serum-free DMEM with 100 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor in the presence or absence of 20 μm FG2575. Conditioned media were collected from cells and adjusted to 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EDTA. Conditioned media were then precipitated in 75% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. Precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 58,000 × g for 45 min. Pellets were dried and resuspended in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide (1 mm), p-aminobenzoic acid (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), and EDTA (5 mm). N-terminal Sequencing of Gliomedin Fragments—Purified gliomedin fragments were subjected to electrophoresis using a 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), and proteins were visualized by 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Desired protein bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing using a 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, ZBA CMM Cologne). In Vitro BMP-1 Cleavage Assay and N-terminal Amino Acid Analysis—150 ng of recombinant gliomedin ectodomain was incubated in the presence or absence of 40 ng BMP-1 at 37 °C for 18 h in a total reaction volume of 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij 35 (Sigma). Reactions included protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide (1 mm), p-aminobenzoic acid (1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) to prevent nonspecific proteolysis. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10× SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 1% β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min. For amino acid analysis, 1.5 μg of gliomedin ectodomain was incubated with 500 ng of BMP-1 for 18 h at 37 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. Samples were electro-transferred to Sequi-blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and proteins were visualized with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Bands representing cleaved gliomedin and aggregated gliomedin were excised, and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation at the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility using a PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems Division Procise 494 HT Protein Sequencing System. Because of the important roles that known transmembrane collagens have been shown to play in development and disease (2Franzke C.W. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4005-4008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we initiated investigation of a novel transmembrane protein with collagenous domains, which has since been designated gliomedin (23Eshed Y.

Gliomedin is predicted to be a 59-kDa type II transmembrane protein with an N-terminal intracellular stretch comprising 12 amino acids, a juxtamembrane coiled-coil region of 14 amino acids, and 2 collagenous repeats, representing 20% of the protein mass. A highly conserved olfactomedin domain comprising 245 amino acids constitutes the protein C terminus (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence contains six cysteine residues for possible inter- and intradisulfide bonding as well as putative N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1A). An orthologous gliomedin gene in C. elegans is termed unc-122 (uncoordinated movement) (Fig. 1B). In verte-brates gliomedin is the only protein possessing both collagen and olfactomedin domains, whereas in C. elegans both unc-122 and a second gene product, Cof-2 (collagen/olfactomedin domain-containing protein 2), contains b"

Trigger factor (TF) is the first chaperone to interact with nascent polypeptides as they emerge from the bacterial ribosome. It binds to the ribosome as a monomer but forms dimers in free solution. Based on recent crystal structures, TF has an elongated shape, with the peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) domain and the N-terminal ribosome binding domain positioned at opposite ends of the molecule and the C-terminal domain, which forms two arms, positioned in between. By using site specifically labeled TF proteins, we have demonstrated that all three domains of TF interact with nascent chains during translation. Interactions with the PPIase domain were length-dependent but independent of PPIase activity. Interestingly, with free TF, these same sites were found to be involved in forming the dimer interface, suggesting that dimerization partially occludes TF-nascent chain binding sites. Our data indicate the existence of two regions on TF along which nascent chains can interact, the NC-domains as the main site and the PPIase domain as an auxiliary site.

Subsequent studies have demonstrated that TF has a general role in cytosolic protein folding that overlaps partially with that of the Hsp70 chaperone system, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (2Deuerling E.

Although the tig and dnaK genes are not individually essential, their combined deletion at temperatures >30 °C results in synthetic lethality, apparently because of large scale protein aggregation (4Genevaux P.

However, the combined deletion of both systems is possible at lower temperature, and the resulting ΔtigΔdnaK cells can be adapted to growth at up to 30 °C (4Genevaux P. Keppel F. Schwager F.

In these structures, the TF N-domain interacts with proteins L23, L29, and the 23 S rRNA near the peptide exit tunnel. Upon binding to eubacterial ribosomes, a conformational change in the structure of the N-domain was observed (13Baram D. Pyetan E. Sittner A. Auerbach-Nevo T. Bashan A. Yonath A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12017-12022Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), resulting in increased solvent exposure of hydrophobic surface area compared with the structure of free TF (11Schlunzen F. Wilson D.N. Tian P. Harms J.M. McInnes S.J. Hansen H.A. Albrecht R. Buerger J. Wilbanks S.M. Fucini P.

Consistent with such a conformational change, a recent study has demonstrated that fluorescently labeled full-length TF undergoes a structural expansion upon ribosome binding. The rates with which TF relaxed to its compact conformation upon ribosome departure varied depending on the characteristics of the nascent chain (15Kaiser C.M. Chang H.-C. Agashe V.R. Laksmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A marked delay in the relaxation rate was correlated with the presence of nascent chain segments with high mean hydrophobicity. The model protein firefly luciferase was shown to have two such preferred TF binding sites (15Kaiser C.M. Chang H.-C. Agashe V.R. Laksmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Previous analysis of the primary structure of TF identified three distinct domains (10Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W.

The function of the PPIase domain remains unclear. Although prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase activity has been detected in vitro, the domain is dispensable for TF function in vivo (4Genevaux P. Keppel F.

Moreover, the PPIase domain binds preferentially to peptide segments of at least eight amino acids that are enriched in basic and aromatic amino acids but do not necessarily contain proline residues, suggesting a more general chaperone function (18Patzelt H.

This domain can be divided into two subdomains consisting of arm 1 and arm 2. The TF structure (12Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) suggests that these arms and a segment of the N-domain constitute a crevice that may interact with polypeptides emerging from the exit tunnel (22Merz F.

Numerous ribosome-associated polypeptide chains, including membrane proteins and cytosolic proteins, have been chemically or site-specifically cross-linked to TF (22Merz F. Hoffmann A. Rutkowska A.

These interactions are abolished with a ribosome binding-deficient mutant TF F44A/R45A/K46A and thus depend on the ability of TF to dock onto the ribosome in close proximity to the opening of the polypeptide exit tunnel (25Tomic S. Johnson A.E. Hartl F.U. Etchells S.A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TF displays a 30-fold increase in affinity for translating versus non-translating ribosomes (15Kaiser C.M. Chang H.-C. Agashe V.R. Laksmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M.

To determine which domain(s) of TF interact with elongating nascent polypeptides, we placed photoreactive probes at specific sites in each domain of TF and added the purified probe containing proteins to a reconstituted in vitro translation system essentially free of chaperones (15Kaiser C.M. Chang H.-C. Agashe V.R. Laksmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 31Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that probes in the N- and C-domains lining the proposed binding crevice are adjacent to the nascent chain. The PPIase domain also participates in nascent chain interaction in a manner dependent on chain length and the specific polypeptide analyzed. Probe sites in the N- and C-domains that cross-linked to nascent chains (but not sites in the PPIase domain) proved to be involved in forming the TF dimer interface for free TF in solution. Plasmids—The pYC-JYCUA and pBKpBpa plasmids were a generous gift from laboratory of Dr. Peter Schultz (32Chin J.W. Schultz P.G. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 1135-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The wild-type TF or the triple mutant F44A/R45A/K46A genes were subcloned into the pYC-JYCUA vector, resulting in the addition of C-terminal Myc and His6 tags. This vector also encoded the mutRNATYRCUA under the control of the constitutively active lpp promoter, the terminator rrnC as well as Tetr. These vectors were used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis in which TF codons encoding residues 14, 34, 73, 88, 118, 168, 177, 185, 198, 233, 320, 322, 373, 377, 378, 384, 387, or 419 were changed to encode an amber stop codon (33Etchells S.A. Meyer A.S. Yam A.Y. Roobol A. Miao Y. Shao Y. Carden M.J. Skach W.R. Frydman J. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28118-28126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The firefly luciferase (luc) gene was in plasmid pET15d as was the Luc5amb gene. α-Synuclein was in plasmid pSTS500, as described previously (25Tomic S. Johnson A.E. Hartl F.U. Etchells S.A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). tig was also subcloned into the pOFX vector under an IPTG-inducible promoter (pOFX-TF). The pBKpBpa plasmid encoded the Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl tRNA synthetase under the glnRS promoter (32Chin J.W. Schultz P.G. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 1135-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—BL21 cells were co-transformed with plasmids pBKpBpa and pYC-JYCUA (encoding one of the TF mutants described above). Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin (Kan), 25 μg/ml tetracycline (Tet), and 1 mm para-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa) to an A600 = 0.6 at 30 °C. Protein expression was induced with 0.2% d-arabinose for 4 h. His6-tagged TF proteins were isolated from the soluble fraction of cell extracts on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were stored at -80 °C in amber-colored tubes. TF and TF-NC (a version composed of the N- and C-domains only), which each had a cleavable N-terminal His6 tag, were purified according to Ref. (15Kaiser C.M. Chang H.-C. Agashe V.R. Laksmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The linker sequence between the N- and C-domains was GTSAAAG (15Kaiser C.M. Chang H.-C. Agashe V.R. Laksmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In Vivo Activity Test of TF and TF Variants—E. coli MG1655ΔdnaK::CmrΔtig cells 4P. Genevaux, unpublished data. were co-transformed as above and grown at 23 °C in LB agar supplemented with 30 μg/ml Kan and 25 μg/ml Tet. After 36 h, colonies were inoculated in LB medium supplemented with Kan/Tet, as above, and grown at 23 °C overnight. The growth of cells serially diluted on LB Kan/Tet plates containing either 0.2% arabinose or 1 mm pBpa or both and incubated at 23, 30, and 37 °C was examined. Only the TF constructs that rescued growth at 37 °C were used in subsequent cross-linking experiments. The F44A/R45A/K46A construct, defective in ribosome binding, did not support growth at 37 °C and served as a negative control in subsequent cross-linking experiments. In Vitro Cross-linking Reactions with TF and TF Single Site Mutants—In vitro runoff transcription/translation of Luc constructs lacking stop codons was performed in the PURE SYSTEM (Post Genome Institute Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (31Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 55 min in the presence of 0.8 μCi/μl[35S]Met. When indicated, TF variants labeled with pBpa were added to a final concentration of 1 μm. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.15 μl of chloramphenicol (34 mg/ml) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Next, the samples were placed under a 500 W Mercury Arc lamp (LOT-Oriel, Darmstadt, Germany) for 2-60 min on ice. A 20-μl aliquot of a 25-μl reaction was layered over a 100-μl sucrose cushion (0.5 m sucrose, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KOAc, and 200 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and centrifuged in a TLA 100 rotor (Beckman) at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pelleted ribosome-nascent chain complexes were resuspended in 100 μl of water, and then RNase A (protease-free) (Roche Applied Science) and EDTA were added to final concentrations of 100 μg/ml and 10 mm, respectively, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the reactions were resolved on 4-10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The identities of the photoadducts were confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TF antibodies. Western Blots of TF and TF Single Site Mutants—5 μm purified TF and TF single site mutants were photolyzed for 15 min, loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman). The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 136 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20), washed three times with TBST, and then a primary antibody against the Myc tag (American Type Culture Collection) was used to probe the membrane at a dilution of 1:5000 followed by three washes and detection with a secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) used at 1:5000 in TBST. The signal was developed using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using Imagereader LAS-3000 (Fuji). In Vitro Proteinase K Assay—All proteinase K assays were performed as described previously (25Tomic S. Johnson A.E. Hartl F.U. Etchells S.A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brief, in vitro translations of Luc-nascent chains of three lengths (92, 125, and 280 residues) were preformed either in the absence of chaperone or in the presence of 1 μm TF or 1 μm TF-NC. Each reaction was stopped by the addition of chloramphenicol, and then samples were treated for the indicated time with proteinase K (Merck). The reactions were then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and separated by gel electrophoresis, and the resulting radioactively labeled p-tRNA-Luc-nascent chains were quantified using an Imagereader LAS-3000 (Fuji). In Vitro Cross-linking Reaction with the Probe in the Nascent Chain—In vitro runoff transcription/translation reactions were preformed with Luc-nascent chains of various lengths from 77 to 280 amino acids (as above). Nascent chains contained a single amber stop codon at position 5 from the N terminus, as previously described (25Tomic S. Johnson A.E. Hartl F.U. Etchells S.A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TF or TF-NC was present at 1 μm. Characterization of TF with Photoreactive Probes at Different Locations—To determine which regions of TF interact with the nascent chain as it emerges from the ribosome, we made use of a recently developed technology (32Chin J.W. Schultz P.G. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 1135-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) allowing for in vivo expression of a protein with a benzophenone photoreactive probe incorporated at a specific site through amber codon suppression. Benzophenone, a phenylalanine analog, consists of two phenol rings with the photoreactive moiety residing in between the two rings (supplemental Fig. 1). Purified TF proteins with single probes incorporated were then added to a fully reconstituted bacterial translation system lacking chaperones. Following runoff translation in the presence of TF and upon exposure to UV light, covalent bonds formed between TF and nascent chains adjacent to the photoreactive probe in TF. Several sites in each domain of TF (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 2A), including residues 34, 88, 118, 185, 233, 320, 373, and 419, were chosen for probe incorporation. We confirmed that the amber codon was suppressed and the TF variants were translated, resulting in full-length proteins with C-terminal Myc and His6 tags (Fig. 1B). The benzophenone-carrying proteins were expressed in MG1655 cells from an arabinose promoter at a level ∼2-fold above that of endogenous TF (data not shown). In contrast, under the same conditions, recombinant wild-type TF was expressed at substantially higher levels, because it does not contain an amber site and does not rely on suppression for completion of translation. Truncated TF products that were not suppressed and therefore did not contain probes or C-terminal tags were not observed after purification. To test whether the probe-containing TF proteins were functional, we used an in vivo complementation assay. ΔdnaKΔtig cells are not viable at 37 °C unless TF is expressed from a plasmid (4Genevaux P.

Kurz T.A. Merz F. Rauch T. Vorderwulbecke S. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3777-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TF14, TF34, TF73, TF88, TF118, TF185, TF233, TF320, TF373, and TF419, carrying the probe at the indicated residue, rescued growth at 37 °C (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 2C). Because overexpression of wild-type TF in MG1655 ΔdnaKΔtig cells is toxic (4Genevaux P. Keppel F. Schwager F. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Hartl F.U. Georgopoulos C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), an IPTG-inducible promoter was used to express wild-type TF at lower levels. However, when probes were placed at positions 377, 378, or 387 in arm 2 of TF, no E. coli growth was observed. Because the mutant proteins were produced (data not shown), incorporation of the probe at these positions likely interferes with TF chaperone activity or folding of the protein. These sites were therefore not further analyzed. Notably, probe incorporation at positions 233 and 185 in the PPIase domain resulted in a partial loss of PPIase activity measured with RNase T1 as a substrate, consistent with previous mutational studies (34Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (and data not shown). Tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements demonstrated the absence of significant conformational differences in the probe-containing mutant proteins compared with wild-type TF (supplemental Fig. 3 and supplemental Table 1). Photocross-linking of TF Single Site Mutants to Ribosome-nascent Chain Complexes—Using the TF single site mutants with probes in each of its domains, in vitro translation reactions were performed to determine which probes were adjacent to the nascent chain as it emerged from the ribosome. Luc was chosen as a model substrate, because it efficiently interacts with TF upon translation (9Agashe V.R. Guha S. Chang H.C. Genevaux P. Hayer-Hartl M. Stemp M. Georgopoulos C. Hartl F.U.

Luc-nascent chains of 60, 77, and 164 amino acids in length were stalled on the ribosome and analyzed. Cross-links to each domain of TF were observed for the 60- and 164-mer (Fig. 2, A and C). N-domain interactions were observed with TF34 to Luc-nascent chains of 60, 77, and 164 amino acids in length (Fig. 2). TF320 and TF373, in which probes are in the tip of arm 1 and arm 2 of the C-domain, respectively, cross-linked to all lengths of Luc-nascent chains tested (Fig. 2). Photoadducts with TF320 were the most intense and hence were used as a reference in all panels of Fig. 2. Interestingly, TF320 resulted in two photoadducts to the Luc 60- and 77-mers differing in size, presumably because of TF binding to two independent sites on the nascent chain (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, no cross-links were observed when the probes were placed on the back surface of the TF molecule at positions 419 (Fig. 2) or 118 (supplemental Fig. 2D), thus suggesting that the nascent chain moves through or spans the proposed binding crevice accessible from the front side of the molecule. No cross-links were observed with the TF320 version of the F44A/R45A/K46A mutant, confirming that ribosome binding is a prerequisite for nascent chain interaction (Fig. 2). Cross-linking to the PPIase domain displayed a nascent chain length dependence. Short nascent chains of 60 amino acids in length cross-linked to positions 185 and 233 in the PPIase domain, whereas nascent chains of 77 amino acids did not (Fig. 2) (15Kaiser C.M. Chang H.-C. Agashe V.R. Laksmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, between the lengths of 60 and 77 amino acids, a portion of the Luc-nascent chain changes position relative to the probes in the PPIase domain. Taking the dimensions of TF in the crystal structure into account, cross-linking of the short 60-mer chain to the PPIase domain suggests that the nascent polypeptide must be in a rather extended conformation. Interestingly, longer nascent chains of 164 amino acids again cross-linked to TF233 but not to TF185 (even after 30 min of irradiation; data not shown), suggesting that different portions of the Luc nascent chain are adjacent to the probe at position 233 as the chain elongates from 60 to 164 amino acids (Fig. 2C). Luc 125-mers were also shown to cross-link to TF233 (Fig. 3B). The differential cross-linking to TF233 and/or TF185 suggests that the interaction with the PPIase domain does not merely result from collision with a flexible nascent chain but rather reflects a more specific participation of this domain in nascent chain binding. The yield of Luc folding is known to be improved by t"

This process can be triggered in vitro by the common germinants inosine and alanine. Kinetic analysis of B. anthracis spore germination revealed synergy and a sequential mechanism between inosine and alanine binding to their cognate receptors. Because inosine is a critical germinant in vitro, we screened inosine analogs for the ability to block in vitro germination of B. anthracis spores. Seven analogs efficiently blocked this process in vitro. This led to the identification of 6-thioguanosine, which also efficiently blocked spore germination in macrophages and prevented killing of these cells mediated by B. anthracis spores. 6-Thioguanosine shows potential as an anti-anthrax therapeutic agent.

This led to the identification of 6-thioguanosine, which also efficiently blocked spore germination in macrophages and prevented killing of these cells mediated by B. anthracis spores. 6-Thioguanosine shows potential as an anti-anthrax therapeutic agent. The 2001 anthrax bioterrorist attacks rekindled interest in the anthrax causative agent, Bacillus anthracis. The spores derived from B. anthracis survive exposure to extreme temperatures and harsh chemicals (1Nicholson W.L. Munakata N. Horneck G. Melosh H.J. Setlow P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 548-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 2Setlow P. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2006; 101: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) and represent an infectious agent with significant potential for biowarfare and bioterrorism. The severity of anthrax pathogenicity is dependent on the uptake route. Following inhalation, the most toxic route, B. anthracis spores are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in the lungs of infected hosts (3Guidi-Rontani C. Weber-Levy M. Labruyere E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 4Guidi-Rontani C. Levy M. Ohayon H. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). During the migration of infected macrophages to regional lymph nodes, B. anthracis spores germinate into the vegetative form (4Guidi-Rontani C. Levy M. Ohayon H. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which secretes the anthrax toxins, the primary virulence factors of the bacterium (5Moayeri M. Haines D. Young H.A.

The transformation process from a dormant spore to a fully vegetative bacterium is a critical initial step in anthrax pathogenicity (3Guidi-Rontani C. Weber-Levy M. Labruyere E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11Dixon T.C. Fadl A.A. Koehler T.M. Swanson J.A. Hanna P.C. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, drugs that prevent germination of phagocytosed spores are attractive candidates for controlling the anthrax disease. The transformation into vegetative bacteria is a two-step process in vitro. Following activation of spores by heavy metals, heat, or hydrostatic pressure, bacterium-specific germinants trigger germination (12Splittstoesser D.F. Farkas D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 92: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different bacterial species use an array of germinants, which include amino acids and nucleosides (13Hills G.M. Biochem. J. 1949; 45: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Warren S.C. Gould G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 170: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Yousten A.A. Can. J. Microbiol. 1975; 21: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which these compounds induce germination is not clearly understood. It has been proposed that germinants trigger signal transduction pathways upon binding to specific receptors (16Wolgamott G.D. Durham N.N. Can. J. Microbiol. 1971; 17: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Fisher N. Hanna P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8055-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the B. anthracis genome led to the identification of germination operons, which control the germination process (17Fisher N. Hanna P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8055-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Hornstra L.M. de Vries Y.P. Wells-Bennik M.H. de Vos W.M. Abee T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on these mutational assays, seven germination (ger) operons have been identified in B. anthracis (19Read T.D. Peterson S.N. Tourasse N. Baillie L.W. Paulsen I.T. Fraser C.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Moreover, four distinct amino acid- and nucleoside-dependent germination pathways have been described for B. anthracis (17Fisher N. Hanna P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8055-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These pathways are purportedly initiated by binding of specific germinants to their corresponding receptors during the initial phase of germination (20Moir A. Corfe B.M. Behravan J. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Efficient germination of B. anthracis spores in vitro requires the presence of purine ribonucleosides and amino acid co-germinants. Although specific amino acids like alanine are able to germinate B. anthracis spores at unphysiologically high concentrations, the presence of a second co-germinant, like inosine, can promote germination at lower concentrations (21Ireland J.A. Hanna P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). B. anthracis spores have a dense, highly structured morphology and scatter light more strongly than their vegetative form. Upon germination, there is a marked decrease in the optical density at 600 nm. Analysis of optical density has been applied extensively to monitor the germination process. The kinetics of spore germination have been fitted to an exponential equation that describes the changes in optical density as spores germinate (22Woese C.R. Vary J.C. Halvorson H.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previous reports postulated that spore germination kinetics could be described using a rapid equilibrium approach (23Massa M.R. Cardillo M.R. Tarsi R. Burberi S. Nuovi. Ann. Ig. Microbiol. 1975; 26: 450-460PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Ireland and Hannah (21Ireland J.A. Hanna P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) demonstrated that B. anthracis germination with alanine follows complex kinetics. It has been observed that Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus megaterium spore germination can be blocked by alkyl alcohols (24Trujillo R. Laible N. Appl. Microbiol. 1970; 20: 620-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ion channel blockers (25Mitchell C. Skomurski J.F. Vary J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1986; 34: 211-214Crossref Google Scholar), protease inhibitors (26Boschwitz H. Milner Y. Keynan A. Halvorson H.O. Troll W. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 700-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Boschwitz H. Halvorson H.O. Keynan A. Milner Y. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 302-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sulfydryl reagents (28Foster S.J. Johnstone K. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and a vast array of other compounds (29Cortezzo D.E. Setlow B. Setlow P. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2004; 96: 725-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most of these studies targeted specific germination pathways in different organisms and are not directly comparable. A more recent study tested subsets of the different types of compounds against B. subtilis and B. megaterium germination (29Cortezzo D.E. Setlow B. Setlow P. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2004; 96: 725-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All of these potential Bacillus germination inhibitors have been tested in vitro but, to our knowledge, their ability to protect mammalian cells from B. anthracis-mediated killing has not been tested. In the present study, we examined the kinetics of the germination process triggered by the common in vitro germinants, inosine and alanine. We first determined kinetic parameters for germination using inosine and alanine as co-germinants. Michaelis-Menten analysis revealed that B. anthracis spore germination follows a sequential mechanism and that germinants show remarkable synergy. Because inosine is a strong germinant in vitro, we screened nucleoside analogs against inosine/alanine-mediated spore germination. These assays led to the identification of a series of germination inhibitors. One of these compounds, 6-thioguanosine (6-TG), 5The abbreviations used are: 6-TG, 6-thioguanosine; 6-MMPR, 6-methylmercapto-purine riboside; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PI, propidium iodide; v, germination rates.5The abbreviations used are: 6-TG, 6-thioguanosine; 6-MMPR, 6-methylmercapto-purine riboside; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PI, propidium iodide; v, germination rates. was also able to inhibit spore germination in macrophages and prevent anthrax-mediated cell death. 6-TG therefore shows potential as an anti-anthrax agent. Chemicals and Equipment—Unless noted, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Spore germination was monitored on a Biomate 5 spectrophotometer at 580 nm or a Labsystems iEMS 96-well plate reader (ThermoElectron Corporation, Waltham, MA) fitted with a 540-nm cut-off filter. Bacterial Strains and Spore Preparation—The B. anthracis Sterne 34F2 strain was a gift from Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The Sterne strain lacks the pXO2 plasmid for encapsulation but contains the pXO1 plasmid for the production of virulence factors. For spore preparation, the Sterne strain was grown on BD Biosciences nutrient agar for 5 days followed by harvesting in ice-cold water. After three washing steps, spores were separated from vegetative and partially sporulated forms by centrifugation through a 20–50% Histo-Denz gradient. The spore pellet was washed six times with water and stored at 4 °C. Analysis of Germination—Spore germination was monitored spectrophotometrically whereby the loss in light diffraction following the addition of inosine and alanine was reflected by decreased optical density at 580 nm (for Biomate 5 spectrophotometer) or above 540 nm (for Labsystems iEMS 96-well plate reader). Spores were heat-activated at 70 °C for 30 min before resuspension in germination buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl) to an A580 of 1. The spore suspension was monitored for auto-germination at A580 for 1 h. Only spores that did not auto-germinate were used for subsequent assays in 96-well format. All germination experiments were carried out in 96-well plates in a total volume of 200 μl/well. Every experiment was done in triplicate with at least two different spore preparations. Spores were allowed to germinate upon exposure to varying concentrations of both germinants in the presence of 1 mm d-cycloserine, which inhibits alanine racemase activity in the spores. For inosine titrations, spores were exposed to varying concentrations of inosine (0.1, 0.175, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mm) at specific constant alanine concentrations (0.075, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.25 mm). For alanine titrations, spores were exposed to varying concentrations of alanine (0.05, 0.1, 0.133, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 5 mm) at specific constant inosine concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm). The concentration range for both co-germinants was selected to avoid data clusters in the double reciprocal plots. Spore germination was evaluated based on decrease in A540 at room temperature each minute for 35 min. The germination extent of each well at each time point was expressed as a fraction of the actual OD divided by the OD obtained at the beginning of germination. Relative OD values were plotted against time. All measurements show standard deviations of less than 10%. Germination rates (v) were determined for the various combinations of germinants used. Germination rates were calculated as the slope of the linear portion immediately following the initial lag phase of relative OD values over time. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The resulting data were plotted as double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[variable germinant concentration]. All plots were fitted using the linear regression analysis from the SigmaPlot v.9 software to determine apparent Km and Vmax values. Calculation of Inhibition Constants (Ki)—Purified spores were diluted in 1 ml of germination buffer. Nucleoside analogs were added to 10 mm final concentration. Spore suspensions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature while monitoring A580. If no germination was detected, inosine and alanine were then added to 2.5 and 0.04 mm final concentration, respectively. Germination was monitored as above. Compounds that showed inhibitory properties were added to fresh spore aliquots at decreasing concentrations. Relative A580 values obtained at arbitrary time points were plotted against the logarithm of inhibitor concentrations. The data were fitted using the four-parameter logistic function of SigmaPlot v.9 software to obtain IC50 values (30Rodbard D. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1255-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from a modified Chang-Prusoff equation (31Cheng H.C. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2001; 46: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Germination Inhibition Assays—6-TG and 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (6-MMPR) were characterized in detail as inhibitors of germination. To determine 6-MMPR effects on inosine binding, spores were exposed to varying concentrations of inosine (0.1, 0.175, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mm) at specific constant (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mm) 6-MMPR concentrations. Alanine was kept at saturating concentrations. To study 6-MMPR effects on alanine binding, spores were exposed to varying concentrations of alanine (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, and 0.2 mm) at specific constant (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mm) 6-MMPR concentrations. Inosine was kept at saturating concentrations. All assays were carried out in triplicate. All plots were fitted using the linear regression analysis from the SigmaPlot v.9 software to determine apparent Km and Vmax values. Spore Germination Mediated by Murine Macrophages—Murine RAW264.7 macrophages were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and seeded at 8 × 105 cells/ml on 96-well fluorescent plates in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum and no antibiotic (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). After the cells had adhered, the medium was replaced with RPMI supplemented with germination inhibitors. Spores were added to the cultures at an m.o.i. of 20. The plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then shifted to a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 to synchronize infection of RAW264.7 cells. In our hands, conditioned medium alone did not elicit germination from spores. Cytopathic effects following spore challenge of RAW264.7 cells were assessed by a propidium iodide exclusion assay (32Alileche A. Serfass E.R. Muehlbauer S.M. Porcelli S.A. Brojatsch J. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Alileche A. Squires R.C. Muehlbauer S.M. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After 6 h in culture, 25 μm propidium iodide was added to each well, and the plates shaken for 10 min. Fluorescence was read in a Wallac Victor II multititer plate reader at 590 nm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescence Microscopy of Spore Germination Mediated by Macrophages—RAW264.7 cells were seeded on either Lab-Tek glass chambered cover slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) or glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). Spores were added to the macrophages at an m.o.i. of 20, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 6-TG for 7 h. Subsequently, 5 μm SYTO 13, a cell-permeable nucleic acid staining dye (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA), was used to stain both living RAW264.7 cells and the vegetative form of B. anthracis, whereas 0.5 μm propidium iodide was used to stain dead macrophages. Experiments were performed with an Olympus IX81 electrically motorized microscope (Center Valley, PA). Spore germination is the first step in B. anthracis infection. Agents that impede germination, preventing the generation of vegetative bacteria, could thereby block disease induction. Efficient germination of B. anthracis spores can be induced by particular ribonucleosides and amino acids, specifically inosine and alanine (17Fisher N. Hanna P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8055-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Ireland J.A. Hanna P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34Weiner M.A. Read T.D. Hanna P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1462-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We determined the kinetics of the germination process triggered by inosine and alanine as well as by inosine analogs, with the hypothesis that inosine analogs could function as germination inhibitors. Spores derived from the B. anthracis Sterne strain were used for germination assays. Germination of heat-activated spores was initiated by the addition of inosine and alanine and monitored at 540 nm. The optical density (A540) decreases during the progression of germination. The spores were allowed to germinate upon exposure to varying concentrations of both germinants in the presence of saturating concentrations of d-cycloserine. Upon the addition of inosine and alanine to spores, we observed a rapid increase in germination, even at micromolar concentrations of both germinants. We observed an early lag phase during the germination process, and germination rates (v) were calculated from the changes in optical density during the linear phase of the sigmoidal curves. The resulting germination rates were used for Michaelis-Menten analysis. Titrations of the germination rate with either germinant yielded hyperbolas indicating saturation of germinant binding to specific receptor sites. Rate studies were carried out using a matrix of germinant concentrations, and the data were plotted in double reciprocal format (35Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley Classics Library Edition, Wiley Interscience Publication, New York1993Google Scholar). Vmax parameters were determined from the interception of the best-fitted lines with the y axis. Similarly, the interception of the fitted lines with the x axis allowed the determination of an apparent Km. Double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[inosine] at increasing alanine concentrations yielded a family of plots that converged in the upper left quadrant (Fig. 1A). Since every line intersects the y axis at different points, Vmax for germination increased with alanine concentrations. Furthermore, each line intersects at different x axis values, suggesting that alanine binding increases the affinity of spores for inosine. From these plots, apparent Km and Vmax values of inosine at infinite alanine concentrations were calculated to be 270 μm and 0.04 OD/min, respectively. The fact that the apparent germination Vmax increases with increasing alanine concentrations (Fig. 1A) indicates that germinants bind to separate sites. Moreover, the intersection of the curve family at a single point strongly supports the notion that both germinants are present simultaneously on their receptor(s) to achieve the synergy in both velocity and affinity. The Km for inosine calculated at the highest and lowest alanine concentration tested were extrapolated to 35 and 164 μm, respectively. This represents an almost 5-fold increase in the affinity of the spore for inosine over a 3-fold alanine concentration range, revealing a remarkable cooperativity between the germinants. Double reciprocal plot analysis of the effect of alanine on spore germination rate yielded a family of plots that intersect the x axis at different points, indicating that the affinity of spores for alanine goes up with increasing inosine concentrations (Fig. 1B). Thus, the affinity of either germinant increases when the complementary germinant is bound at its specific site. This is consistent with a sequential mechanism, which requires binding of both ligands, and where binding of the first alters binding of the second ligand. Our kinetic analysis suggested that the germination process requires inosine binding to a specific spore receptor. Therefore, we hypothesized that inosine analogs might interfere with inosine-receptor interactions and prevent germination. For inhibition assays, we selected commercially available inosine and guanosine analogs (36Kaina B. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 104: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Francis J.E. Webb R.L. Ghai G.R. Hutchison A.J. Moskal M.A. deJesus R. Yokoyama R. Rovinski S.L. Contardo N. Dotson R. Barclay B. Jtone G.A. Jarvis M.F. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Coulthard S. Hogarth L. Investig. New Drugs. 2005; 23: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The inosine analogs were based on 6-thioinosine containing a sulfur substitution in place of a 6-oxo group. The 6-thioinosine analog, 6-MMPR, has a methyl group attached to the sulfur atom (Table 1). 6-TG, 6-O-methylguanosine, 6-chloroguanosine, and 6-aminoguanosine are guanosine analogs with thio, methoxy, chloro, and amino group substitutions of the 6-oxo groups. The inosine analog xanthosine has oxo groups at positions 2 and 6 (Table 1).TABLE 1Germination inhibition constant for different nucleosides Values were obtained in the presence of saturating concentrations of inosine and alanine. X represents substitution at the 6-position, and Y represents substitutions at the 2-position. N/A, not applicable. Open table in a new tab For inhibitor studies, B. anthracis spores were preincubated with nucleoside analogs for 15 min. Germination was then initiated by the addition of inosine and alanine. Germination rates were slower in the presence of nucleoside inhibitors as compared with those obtained with untreated spores. Thus, at any arbitrary time point, the optical density of inhibitor-treated spores was higher than that of untreated spores. Using this assay, we identified several potent germination inhibitors (Fig. 2). IC50 values were calculated using the inflection points of the dose-response curves (30Rodbard D. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1255-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The IC50 of the inhibitor and the apparent Km for inosine were then used to determine the apparent Ki of the nucleoside analog using a modified Chang-Prussof equation (31Cheng H.C. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2001; 46: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The inosine analog 6-thioinosine did not interfere with inosine-mediated germination, even in the presence of excess alanine (data not shown). In contrast, 6-MMPR efficiently blocked inosine-triggered spore germination with a Ki of 31 μm (Table 1). Thus, the presence of a single methyl group at position 6 allowed binding to the germination receptor and interfered with the germination process. The guanosine analogs, 6-TG, 6-O-methylguanosine, 6-chloroguanosine, and 6-aminoguanosine, have substitutions at positions 2 and 6 and efficiently blocked spore germination in the presence of inosine. Therefore, substitutions at positions 2 and 6 are important for receptor recognition and inhibitory properties. Xanthosine, with carbonyl groups at positions 2 and 6, on the other hand, did not interfere with spore germination. The Ki values obtained for the inosine analogs are shown in Table 1. The nucleoside analogs 6-TG and 6-MMPR that blocked germination of B. anthracis are currently used in the treatment of cancer and Crohn disease, and their pharmacological properties are well established (39Presta M. Rusnati M. Belleri M. Morbidelli L. Ziche M. Ribatti D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2417-2424PubMed Google Scholar, 40Derijks L.J. de Jong D.J. Gilissen L.P. Engels L.G. Hooymans P.M. Jansen J.B. Mulder C.J. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2003; 15: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We used 6-TG and 6-MMPR for kinetic analysis using double reciprocal plots. To understand the competitive nature of the nucleoside analogs, we performed the inhibitor studies using alanine at saturating, inosine at subsaturating, and nucleoside analogs at variable concentrations (Fig. 3A). As expected, Lineweaver-Burk plots for the 6-MMPR inhibitor converged close to the y axis, suggesting that 6-MMPR competes with inosine. This indicates that 6-MMPR affected the affinity of the spores for inosine without greatly interfering with the maximum germination rate. Unlike inosine, 6-MMPR affected both the maximal velocity of germination and the affinity of alanine for spores (Fig. 3B). Our system yielded similar results in the presence of 6-TG, which, like 6-MMPR, competed with inosine for receptor binding. Michaelis-Menten analysis of 6-MMPR and 6-TG inhibition of germination suggested that both nucleoside analogs inhibit germination by interfering with inosine binding to its cognate receptor. Moreover, both 6-MMPR and 6-TG were also able to induce spore germination in the presence of excess alanine and in the absence of inosine (Fig. 4). However, both the germination rate and the total decrease in optical density were significantly lower than rates observed using inosine as a co-germinant. These results indicated that 6-MMPR and 6-TG are only weak germinants. We assumed that the low germination induction potential of 6-MMPR and 6-TG is linked to their ability to inhibit inosine/alanine germination. As expected, inosine analogs competed with the potent germination inducer inosine for receptor binding and prevented efficient spore germination. A productive infection and disease progression requires phagocytosis of B. anthracis spores and subsequent germination (41Brittingham K.C. Ruthel G. Panchal R.G. Fuller C.L. Ribot W.J. Hoover T.A. Young H.A. Anderson A.O. Bavari S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5545-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast to in vitro assays, intracellular factors that promote germination of B. anthracis within macrophages are unknown. Multiple cellular factors have been postulated to play a role in germination within macrophages, including amino acids and nucleosides (42Weiner M.A. Hanna P.C. Infect Immun. 2003; 71: 3954-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 43Ireland J.A. Hanna P.C. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 5870-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We tested whether the nucleoside analogs that blocked germination in in vitro assays also prevented germination of spores phagocytosed by macrophages. This would establish whether the tested inosine analogs represent potential therapeutics against B. anthracis infections. Because the vegetative form of the B. anthracis spore efficiently kills murine macrophages, we determined cytopathic effects following spore challenge using propidium iodide (PI) exclusion assays. We infected murine RAW264.7 macrophages with B. anthracis spores at an m.o.i. (spore to cell ratio) of 20 to 1. PI fluorescence intensity (and thus macrophage death) showed a marked increase within 6 h following anthrax inoculation (Figs. 5A and 6).FIGURE 6The inosine derivative 6-TG prevents macrophage killing mediated by B. anthracis spores. A, uninfected RAW264.7.1 macrophages stained with SYTO 13 (green, live cells) and propidium iodide (red, dead cells) show less than 5% dead cells. B, RAW264.7 cells 3 h after exposure to B. anthracis spores show ∼20% dead cells. C, 90% of RAW264.7 cells were dead 7 h after exposure to B. anthracis spores. The vegetative form of B. anthracis is indicated by arrows. D, 6-TG-treated RAW264.7 cells 7 h after exposure to B. anthracis spores show that the number of dead cells is similar to the uninfected control. Furthermore, no vegetative B. anthracis cells are observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Strikingly, of all nucleoside analogues that efficiently blocked germination in vitro, only 6-TG prevented germination and cytotoxic effects in spore-infected murine macrophages. 6-TG efficiently blocked (88%) macrophage killing by B. anthracis spores at concentrations between 1 and 2 μm (Fig. 5B). However, a residual background of PI-positive macrophages was detected in the presence of even the highest 6-TG concentrations, possibly due to the ability of 6-TG to function as a weak germinant. No inhibition of B. anthracis germination was detected in the presence of the germination inhibitors 6-MMPR, 6-chloroguanosine, 6-O-methylguanosine, 2-amino-adenosine, or xanthosine, even at the highest concentrations used (Fig. 5C and data not shown). Macrophage-spore interaction was further examined by fluorescence microscopy. The green dye SYTO 13 is cell-permeable, whereas red PI is impermeable to cellular membranes. Both dyes bind to DNA. Thus, the macrophage nucleus shows green fluorescence in healthy cells and red fluorescence in necrotic cells. Macrophages were treated with SYTO 13 and PI simultaneously. As expected, more than 90% of untreated macrophages showed green fluorescence (Fig. 6A). Exposure to B. anthracis spores resulted in ∼20 and 90% PI-positive macrophages 3.5 and 7 h after infection, respectively (Fig. 6, B and C). This is consistent with the rapid increase in PI fluorescence 5–6 h following B. anthracis inoculation (Fig. 5A). SYTO 13 also stained vegetative bacteria, which were present in macrophages cultures 7 h after B. anthracis treatment (Fig. 6C, white arrow). The addition of 6-TG prevented the killing of B. anthracis-infected macrophages indicated by a lack of PI-positive cells, even 7 h after inoculation. Furthermore, no vegetative bacteria were detected in 6-TG-treated macrophages (Fig. 6D). Inosine and alanine are powerful germinants of B. anthracis in vitro. Kinetic analysis of the germination process revealed that germination requires simultaneous binding of inosine and alanine and that the germinants show significant synergy. Intracellular inosine concentrations are extremely low in mammalian cells as this nucleoside is a degradation product of the purine biosynthesis pathway and is rapidly converted to uric acid (44Barankiewicz J. Cohen A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1985; 15: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, high intracellular alanine concentrations in the low millimolar range might drive germination in macrophages even at suboptimal nucleoside concentrations. Given the importance of inosine in initiating germination of B. anthracis, we screened inosine analogs for their ability to interfere with this process. This led to the identification of multiple powerful inhibitors that blocked germination in vitro. Kinetic analysis revealed that the inosine analogs 6-TG and MMPR compete with inosine for spore binding. It is not surprising that these competitive inhibitors are able to germinate B. anthracis in the presence of alanine, albeit with a drastically lower efficiency than inosine. Strikingly, of all inosine analogs that blocked germination in vitro, only 6-TG prevented germination in macrophages. Germination in macrophages is a complex and poorly understood process. At least four germination pathways have been described in B. anthracis (17Fisher N. Hanna P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8055-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), including germination triggered by a combination of amino acids alone. It is conceivable that inosine is the principal germinant inside cells and that 6-TG prevents germination by competing with endogenous inosine. Low intracellular inosine concentrations might be the reason for the high efficiency of 6-TG at blocking germination of B. anthracis spores in macrophages. Future experiments will help to identify cellular factors that drive B. anthracis germination in macrophages. It remains to be shown why 6-TG efficiently blocked germination in macrophages, whereas closely related nucleoside analogs failed when tested with macrophages. It is possible that the failure to block germination in vivo is due to a lack of membrane permeability for the nucleoside analogs or due to rapid intracellular degradation of these compounds. Since all inhibitors tested were able to compete with inosine in vitro, it is conceivable that the inosine receptors are not the main activator of germination within macrophages. 6-TG (but not any other nucleoside tested) may also compete with germinants present in macrophages other than inosine. These results would suggest that alternative receptors contribute to spore germination in macrophages. Seven different germination operons have been identified for B. anthracis. Two chromosomal operons, gerS and gerH, have been linked to alanine-inosine-dependent germination responses (17Fisher N. Hanna P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8055-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Ireland J.A. Hanna P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Studies using germination inhibitors such as 6-TG might help to identify endogenous agents that drive germination of B. anthracis in macrophages. Taken together, we established that the nucleoside analog 6-TG inhibits B. anthracis spore germination in macrophages and efficiently blocks cell death mediated by these spores. Future tests might identify 6-TG analogs with improved inhibition and reduced germination potential. These agents could represent powerful prophylaxes against anthrax infections. The potential of 6-TG to prevent germination and disease progression in mice infected with B. anthracis spores remains to be tested.

Many components of the PC pathway have been identified in epidermal keratinocytes, including endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which is the specific receptor for PC/activated PC (APC), but the core member of this pathway, PC, and its function in keratinocytes has not been defined. In this study, we reveal that PC is strongly expressed by human keratinocytes at both gene and protein levels. When endogenous PC was blocked by siRNA the proliferation of keratinocytes was significantly decreased. This inhibitory effect was restored by the addition of recombinant APC. PC siRNA treatment also increased cell apoptosis by 3-fold and inhibited cell migration by more than 20%. When keratinocytes were pretreated with RCR252, an EPCR-blocking antibody, or PD153035, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, cell proliferation was hindered by more than 30%. These inhibitors also completely abolished recombinant APC (10 μg/ml)-stimulated proliferation. Blocking PC expression or inhibiting its binding to EPCR/EGFR decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but increased p38 activation. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK decreased cell proliferation by ∼30% and completely abolished the stimulatory effect of APC on proliferation. Taken together, these results indicate that keratinocyte-derived PC promotes cell survival, growth, and migration in an autocrine manner via EPCR, EGFR, and activation of ERK1/2.

APC plays a key role in the regulation of blood coagulation and also has significant anti-inflammatory properties associated with inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and a reduction of leukocyte recruitment (6Murakami K.

The effectiveness of APC as an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agent is demonstrated by its efficacy as a treatment for patients with severe sepsis (12Griffin J.H. Zlokovic B. Fernandez J.A.

Jackson C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel function of APC as a promoter of cutaneous wound healing was identified. In a rat healing model APC accelerated full thickness wound closure by stimulating re-epithelialization, promoting angiogenesis, and preventing inflammation (16Jackson C.J. Xue M. Thompson P. Davey R.A. Whitmont K. Smith S. Buisson-Legendre N. Sztynda T. Furphy L.J. Cooper A. Sambrook P. March L. Wound Repair Regen. 2005; 13: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The epidermis is the outermost skin layer and provides the first line of defense against the external environment. Keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in human skin, exist at various stages of differentiation corresponding to different epidermal layers (17Bikle D.D. Ng D. Tu C.L. Oda Y. Xie Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Dransfield D.T. Griner R.D. Ray S. Keskintepe M. Bollag W.B. J. Investig.

Dividing cells in the basal layer progressively differentiate and withdraw from the cell cycle as they are displaced toward the skin surface. Keratinocytes play a fundamental role in skin metabolism and in wound closure by proliferating and migrating, to compensate for superficial cell loss or to cover the exposed connective tissue, and by producing various mediators including cytokines/chemokines, the T cell receptor, and antimicrobial peptides (19Pivarcsi A. Bodai L. Rethi B. Kenderessy-Szabo A. Koreck A. Szell M. Beer Z. Bata-Csorgoo Z. Magocsi M. Rajnavolgyi E. Dobozy A. Kemeny L. Int.

Keratinocytes in the basal and suprabasal layers of the epidermis express many components of the PC pathway, including thrombomodulin (20Jackson D.E. Mitchell C.A. Bird P. Salem H.H. Hayman J.A. J.

Prior to this study, PC was thought to be synthesized almost exclusively by the liver and vascular endothelial cells with a circulatory half-life of ≈20 min (23Rezaie A.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The current study shows that PC is strongly expressed by skin keratinocytes. Furthermore, this keratinocyte-derived PC promotes cell survival, growth, and migration in an autocrine manner via EPCR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and activation of ERK1/2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESKeratinocyte Culture and Reagents—Normal keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskins (n = 30) as described previously (15Xue M. Thompson P. Kelso I. Jackson C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in accordance with the local ethics regulations. Extracted cells were cultured in keratinocyte-serum free medium (K-SFM, Invitrogen). When more than 70% confluent, primary cultured cells were trypsinized and used in experiments. Cells were seeded into either 24-well culture plates at 5 × 105 cells/well or 8-well Permanox™ slides (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Rochester, NY) and incubated for 12 h to allow for adhesion. The confluent cells were then treated with recombinant APC (Xigris, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), PC (Sigma), EPCR-blocking antibody RCR252, EPCR-nonblocking antibody RCR92 (gift from Prof. Fukudome, Dept. of Immunology, Saga Medical School, Nabeshima, Saga, Japan), PD153035, an inhibitor of EGFR, and inhibitors of c-Jun (2 μm), p38 (70 nm), and ERK (10 μm) (EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego). Medium used for cells treated with PD153035 and the related control contained 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), as PD153035 was originally dissolved in Me2SO. MAP kinase inhibitors and PD153035 did not exert any cytotoxic effect on keratinocytes when used at indicated concentrations (data not shown). Cells and culture supernatants were collected for detection of mRNA and protein expression.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Preparation and Nucleofection—Small interfering RNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from Proligo (Sigma-Proligo). The siRNAs designed for PC were: sense 5′-GAGGUGAGCUUCCUCAAUUGC-3′ and antisense 5′-AAUUGAGGAAGCUCACCUCGC-3′. A scrambled form of PC siRNA was used as a negative control. Keratinocytes were adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in growth medium and subjected to nucleofection using the human keratinocyte Nucleofector™ kit and Amaxa Nucleofector™ II machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany). Cells were allowed to attach overnight, then trypsinized and seeded into either 24-well plates (4 × 105 cells/ml) or 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/ml), and incubated for 48 and 72 h. The specificity of siRNAs was confirmed by a validated short hairpin RNA (Superarray, Frederick, MD).RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription Real-time PCR— Total RNA was extracted from keratinocytes using Tri Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)15 as a primer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The levels of mRNA were semiquantified using real-time PCR on a Rotor-gene 3000A (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). Samples were normalized to the housekeeping gene RPL13A, and results were reported for each sample relative to the control. PC PCR product was also separated on a 2% agarose gel and imaged using the Infinity-Capt gel documentation system (Vilber, Lourmat, France). The primers used were as follows: PC (213 bp), sense 5′-TCTTCGTCCACCCCAACTAC-3′ and antisense 5′-GGTTTCTCTTGGCCTCCTTC-3′; RPL13A (152 bp), sense 5′-AAGCCTACAAGAAAGTTTGCCTATC-3′ and antisense 5′-TGTTTCCGTAGCCTCATGAGC-3′.APC Activity Assay—The activity of APC in culture supernatants and cell lysates was quantitated using the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme PCa (American Diagnostica Inc., Stamford, CT) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A standard curve was generated using human recombinant APC.MTT Assay—The colorimetric 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to quantitate the effect of different test agents on cell growth and viability. Briefly, 1 × 104 cells/well were seeded into a 96-well microplate to a final volume of 200 μl and then incubated for 4 h to allow cells to attach. Cells were then treated with different test agents. Three hours prior to the completion of the treatment, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) was added to cells. After a further incubation for 3 h, the MTT solution was removed and replaced by 100 μl Me2SO. The optical density of each well was determined at a wavelength of 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm.In Vitro Migration Assay—Cells were seeded into 24-well plates and cultured to confluence. Cell monolayers were then scratched with a 1000-μl blue plastic pipette tip (Greiner Bioone, Greiner Int., Longwood, FL), creating a cell-free area ∼2 mm in width. “Wounded” monolayers were washed twice with PBS to remove loose cell debris, and a defined area of the wound was photographed under phase-contrast microscopy. To standardize the position of the wound when photographing, small indents were made in the plastic well using a sterile 31-gauge needle. To prevent cell proliferation, cells were pretreated with mitomycin C (10 μg/ml, Sigma), which was applied to the cells 2 h before wounding and removed with three PBS washes. Cell migration was determined after 24 h by counting the cells that had moved into the wounded area; the percentage of cell migration was calculated as [number of migrated PC siRNA-treated cells/number of migrated scrambled siRNA-treated cells] × 100.Western Blot—Keratinocytes were washed three times with PBS and lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02 m Tris, 6 m urea/H2O) was added. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-human EPCR antibody (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen); mouse anti-human PC (HC-2, 1:500 dilution, Sigma); rabbit anti-phosphorylated forms of p38, c-Jun, and ERK2 (1:1000 dilutions, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); and rabbit anti-phospho-EGFR (Y1173) and rabbit anti-human active caspase-3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-human β-actin antibody was included to normalize against unequal loading.Immunohistochemical Staining—Cultured keratinocytes in Permanox slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Human foreskin was fixed with 10% PBS-buffered formalin. Paraffin-embedded tissue was deparaffinized and subjected to immunohistochemistry. After quenching with 2% H2O2 in methanol and equilibrating in PBS, samples were incubated with mouse anti-human PC antibody or mouse IgG (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then processed for staining using Dako LSAB+ systems stain kit and counter-stained with hematoxylin and Scott’s bluing solution. After mounting, tissue sections were observed under a light microscope (ECLIPSE 80i, Nikon Corp.).For dual staining, deparaffinized foreskin tissues were blocked by 5% horse serum in PBS and incubated with goat anti-human EPCR and rabbit anti-human EGFR antibodies (R&D Systems) for 2 days at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, tissue sections were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3 (red) and anti-goat IgG conjugated with FITC (green) (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich). Tissue sections were washed with PBS and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE 80i). Images were acquired and processed using a Nikon digital camera and software (Diagnostic Instruments) and Image J (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).Apoptosis Detection—Apoptotic keratinocytes were detected using an in situ cell death detection kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics).Statistical Analysis—Significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSPC Is Expressed by Human Keratinocytes—To investigate whether epidermal keratinocytes produce PC, mRNA from unstimulated primary cultured cells was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR. PC mRNA was detected in cultured keratinocytes as shown by the prominent band at 213 bp (Fig. 1A). In concordance with gene expression, immunohistochemistry results showed that cultured keratinocyte monolayers stained strongly positive with an antibody against APC/PC (Fig. 1B). The expression of PC was also assessed in neonatal foreskin tissues by immunohistochemistry. The basal and suprabasal layers of the epidermis were strongly positive for PC, whereas the outer stratum corneum where the keratinocytes lose their viability showed weak staining (Fig. 1C). PC was also immunolocalized to dermal vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 1C).Inhibition of Endogenous PC with siRNA Suppresses Keratinocyte Proliferation and Migration and Promotes Apoptosis—Because recombinant APC stimulates keratinocyte proliferation (15Xue M. Thompson P. Kelso I. Jackson C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we investigated whether endogenous PC/APC could stimulate the growth of keratinocytes in an autocrine manner. PC siRNA was used to suppress the endogenous PC expression by keratinocytes. The efficacy of PC siRNA was examined at 48 h by real-time PCR and Western blot (Fig. 2, A and B). PC siRNA dose-dependently reduced PC mRNA levels by up to 80% when used at 0.5 μm. This concentration of siRNA was used in subsequent experiments unless otherwise specified.FIGURE 2PC siRNA treatment inhibits the growth of keratinocytes. A, efficacy of PC siRNA at blocking PC mRNA expression by keratinocytes at 48 h, detected by reverse transcription real-time PCR. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 3).

Cell proliferation is expressed as a percentage of control (mean ± S.D.). Graphs represent one of three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After a 24-h incubation, APC activity (1.53 μg of APC activity/106 cells) was detected in the whole cell lysates but not the culture medium (data not shown) of unstimulated keratinocytes, as measured using the Spectrozyme PCa activity assay. Because the basal culture medium contained no exogenous APC, the activity detected in cell lysates was most likely derived from the activation of endogenous PC. This was confirmed by the finding that the level of APC was reduced by ∼50% in PC siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2C).PC siRNA reduced keratinocyte proliferation by ∼35% after 72 h compared with control (Fig. 2D). This inhibition was dose-dependently reversed by adding recombinant APC, with the growth rate being restored at a concentration of 20 μg/ml APC (Fig. 2D).The effect of PC siRNA on keratinocyte apoptosis was detected by measuring the amount of active caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis, using Western blotting. An 8-fold increase in active caspase-3 was observed in PC siRNA-treated cells when compared with that in cells treated with scrambled control (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm this result, apoptotic cells were evaluated by an in situ cell death detection kit. PC siRNA treatment resulted in ∼3 times more apoptotic cells than with scrambled siRNA treatment at 48 h (Fig. 3, C and D).FIGURE 3Endogenous PC/APC prevents keratinocyte apoptosis. Keratinocytes were treated with PC siRNA (0.5 μm). After 48 h, cells were harvested, and cell lysates were used to detect the activation of caspase-3 by Western blot (A) and semiquantified using image analysis software (B). Cells were used for a TUNEL (terminal dUTP nick-end labeling) assay to detect apoptotic cells (black arrows indicate apoptotic cells) (C) and quantitated by counting apoptotic cells under high power microscopy (×20) (D). Data were expressed as the average number of apoptotic cells per field of 15 fields (mean ± S.E., n = 3). Images represent one of three independent experiments. **, p < 0.01.

Confluent keratinocytes were scratch-wounded, and cell migration was evaluated 24 h after wounding. PC siRNA-treated cells exhibited ∼20% less migration into the wounded areas than control cells (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4PC siRNA treatment decreases migration of keratinocytes. Cell monolayers were pretreated with mitomycin C and then scratched with a 1000-μl blue plastic pipette tip. A, the defined area of the wound was photographed under a phase-contrast microscopy at time 0 h and 24 h. To standardize the position of the wound for photography, small indents were made in the plastic well (marked by outlined arrows). B, cell migration was determined after 24 h by counting the cells that had moved out of the initial area, and the percentage of cell migration was calculated as [number of migrated PC siRNA-treated cells/number of migrated scrambled siRNA-treated cells] × 100.

After 72 h, this treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the proliferation of keratinocytes, showing a greater than 30% reduction when cells were treated with 10 μg/ml EPCR (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that keratinocyte-derived PC acts via EPCR to stimulate cell proliferation under normal unstimulated conditions. In addition, the stimulatory effect of recombinant APC on cell proliferation was abrogated by blocking EPCR (Fig. 5A). The nonblocking control antibody, RCR92, had no effect (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Blocking EPCR and EGFR decreases the growth of unstimulated and APC-stimulated keratinocytes. Cell proliferation was detected using the MTT assay.

After incubation for 72 h, cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay.

Functional activation of EGFR results from phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This activation can be blocked specifically by tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as PD153035. In this study, PD153035 (2.5 μm) inhibited the proliferation of unstimulated keratinocytes by more than 30% (Fig. 5B), suggesting that EGFR is required for normal cell growth. The stimulatory effect of 1 or 10 μg/ml recombinant APC on proliferation was nearly abolished by 2.5 μm PD153035 (Fig. 5B), indicating that APC requires EGFR to stimulate keratinocyte growth. Inhibition of both EPCR and EGFR together caused a further modest but significant (p < 0.05, under basal conditions and in response to 10 μg/ml APC) reduction in proliferation compared with individually blocking either EPCR or EGFR (Fig. 5).APC Up-regulates the Expression/Activation of EPCR and EGFR— When cells were stimulated with 1 or 10 μg/ml recombinant APC, the expression of EPCR and the phosphorylation of EGFR were markedly increased (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, when cells were treated with PC siRNA, EPCR protein in cell lysates was reduced by more than 50% (Fig. 6A), and the phosphorylated form of EGFR was also dramatically inhibited (Fig. 6B). Thus, APC appears to enhance its effect by increasing the expression/activation of EPCR and EGFR. Using dual immunofluorescent staining, we found that both EPCR and activated EGFR were co-localized in the same areas of basal and suprabasal keratinocytes in the epidermis (Fig. 6C), which is similar to PC localization in skin epidermis (Fig. 1C), Endothelial cells in the dermis stained positively for EPCR but not for activated EGFR.FIGURE 6EPCR and EGFR are co-localized in skin and up-regulated by PC/APC in keratinocytes. Keratinocytes were treated with recombinant APC or PC siRNA, and the expression of EPCR (A) and the phosphorylated form of EGFR (P-EGFR) (B) were detected in whole cell lysates by Western blot.

https://openalex.org/W2110099382,"Herpes simplex virus has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with directly repeated terminal sequences needed for cleavage and packaging of replicated DNA. In infected cells, linear genomes rapidly become endless. It is currently a matter of discussion whether the endless genomes are circles supporting rolling circle replication or arise by recombination of linear genomes forming concatemers. Here, we have examined the role of mammalian DNA ligases in the herpes simplex virus, type I (HSV-1) life cycle by employing RNA interference (RNAi) in human 1BR.3.N fibroblasts. We find that RNAi-mediated knockdown of DNA ligase IV and its co-factor XRCC4 causes a hundred-fold reduction of virus yield, a small plaque phenotype, and reduced DNA synthesis. The effect is specific because RNAi against DNA ligase I or DNA ligase III fail to reduce HSV-1 replication. Furthermore, RNAi against DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 does not affect replication of adenovirus. In addition, high multiplicity infections of HSV-1 in human DNA ligase IV-deficient cells reveal a pronounced delay of production of infectious virus. Finally, we demonstrate that formation of endless genomes is inhibited by RNAi-mediated depletion of DNA ligase IV and XRCC4. Our results suggests that DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 serves an important role in the replication cycle of herpes viruses and is likely to be required for the formation of the endless genomes early during productive infection.

Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HSV-1, herpes simplex virus, type I; RNAi, RNA interference; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MOI, multiplicity of infection; PFU, plaque-forming units; p.i., post-infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: HSV-1, herpes simplex virus, type I; RNAi, RNA interference; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MOI, multiplicity of infection; PFU, plaque-forming units; p.i., post-infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. has a 152-kb linear double-stranded genome with direct repeats, a sequences, presented at the genomic termini (1Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Once the genomic DNA is delivered through the nuclear pores, it rapidly becomes converted to an endless state (2Garber D.A. Beverley S.M. Coen D.M. Virology. 1993; 107: 459-462Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Poffenberger K.L. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 587-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Strang B.L. Stow N.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12487-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The endless genomes may be circular molecules, products of rolling circle replication, and/or concatemers formed by recombination or intermolecular ligation. It has been a commonly held opinion that circular genomes are replicated from the viral origins of replication, oriS and oriL, by theta type replication and that later a switch into a rolling circle mode of replication will take place (1Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As a result, the products of viral DNA synthesis appear as linear concatemers, which are the immediate precursors for the cleavage packaging process. This view has recently received strong support by the observation that a genetically modified HSV-1 genome undergoes fusion of the termini rapidly upon infection and in the presence of inhibitors of viral DNA synthesis (4Strang B.L. Stow N.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12487-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that circularization does not take place during the productive phase of wild-type HSV-1 infection (5Jackson S.A. DeLuca N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7871-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Sandri-Goldin R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7428-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Instead, the linear genomes are substrates for replication, and concatemers are formed later by recombination. Circular molecules, on the other hand, are proposed to be unique to latently infected neurons. To provide some insights into the issues raised above, it would be beneficial to identify the enzymes required for replication and recombination of viral genomes. HSV-1 encodes seven gene products directly involved in DNA synthesis: the origin-binding protein encoded by the UL9 gene binds and activates oriS and oriL; the processive heterodimeric DNA polymerase is composed by the UL30 and UL42 gene products; the heterotrimeric helicase-primase is formed by the UL5, UL8, and UL52 gene products; the single-strand DNA-binding protein ICP8, a product of the UL29 gene, is required during initiation of DNA synthesis as well as during the propagation of the replication fork (1Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Together, these proteins form a replisome capable of coordinated synthesis of leading and lagging strands (7Falkenberg M. Elias P. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, a nuclease, the UL12 gene product, is required for efficient virus production (8Porter I.M. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Goldstein J.N. Weller S.K. Virology. 1998; 244: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It seems evident that additional proteins, probably of cellular origin, are required to complete synthesis of HSV-1 DNA. We have previously presented evidence for a direct and specific involvement of topoisomerase II in HSV-1 DNA replication (10Hammarsten O. Yao X. Elias P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we examine the role of cellular DNA ligases I, III, and IV during replication of HSV-1. DNA ligases I, III, and IV have a common catalytic function, but they are designed to specifically execute the last step in distinct reaction pathways (11Martin I.V. MacNeill S.A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3005.1-3005.7Crossref Google Scholar, 12Pascal J.M. O′Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T.

The ligases seem to be targeted to the appropriate substrates by virtue of specific protein-protein interactions. DNA ligase I interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and it is required for ligation of Okazaki fragments formed during discontinous DNA synthesis as well as long patch base excision repair (14Mackenney V.J. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11550-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Levin D.S. McKenna A.E. Motycka T.A. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). DNA ligase III with its partner XRCC1 seals the nicked site in the final step of short patch base excision repair (16Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). DNA ligase IV, finally, is together with XRCC4 uniquely responsible for performing the final step of nonhomologous end joining (18Sibanda B.L. Critchlow S.E. Begun J. Pei X.Y. Jackson S.P. Blundell T.L. Pellegrini L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Weterings E. van Gent D.C. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). There must, however, exist some functional overlap between the three mammalian DNA ligases. This is perhaps best illustrated by the observation that proliferating fibroblasts can be derived from knock-out mice for DNA ligase I, although they display an accumulation of DNA replication intermediates and increased genomic instability (20Bentley D.J. Harrison C. Ketchen A.-M. Redhead N.J. Samuel K. Waterfall M. Ansell J.D. Melton D.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used RNAi directed against DNA ligases I, III, and IV in human fibroblasts to examine the effects on HSV-1 DNA replication. Interestingly, only RNAi against DNA ligase IV and its partner XRCC4 caused a significant reduction of HSV-l DNA synthesis and virus production. In contrast, adenovirus replication was not affected. We suggest that DNA ligase IV is needed early to promote formation of circular templates for DNA replication. Cells—1BR.3.N (ECACC), 293 (ATCC/LGC) and GM16089 (Coriell Cell Repositories), which has a R278H mutation in the DNA ligase IV gene (21Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.H. Doherty A.J. Priestly A.

BHK-21cells (ATCC) were cultured in Glasgow minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. siRNA Transfection—RNA oligonucleotides were directed against the following target sequences: DNA ligase I, 5′-AAGGGCAAGACAGCAGAGGCC; DNA ligase III, 5′-AACUGCAACCCAGAUGAUAUG; DNA ligase IV, 5′-AAGCCAGACAAAAGAGGUGAA; DNA ligase IVmut, 5′-AAGCCAAACAACAGAGGCGAA; XRCC4, 5′-AAUCUUGGGACAGAACCUAAA; and XRCC4b, AUAUGUUGGUGAACUGAGAdTdT. The sequence XRCC4b was from Ahnesorg et al. (24Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Double-stranded siRNA molecules were purchased from Dharmacon and contained a dT-dinucleotide at the 3′ ends. Cell monolayers in 12-well plates were transfected with 450 pmol of siRNA duplexes by using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Mock transfected cells were treated with oligofectamine only. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Reverse transcription was performed using the BD Bioscience/Clontech Advantage RT-for-PCR kit as described by the manufacturer. Quantitative PCR was performed on duplicate samples using Corbett Research Rotorgene 3000. Fluorescence measurements were made after the elongation step in each cycle. Each cDNA sample was quantified in duplicate and normalized to β-actin cDNA. Primers were designed to produce a PCR product spanning the RNAi binding sites in DNA ligase mRNAs, and β-actin mRNA was used as a reference. The analyses were performed by TATAA Biocenter, Lundberg Laboratory, Göteborg, Sweden. Protein Analysis—At 72 h post-transfection, 1BR.3.N monolayers were harvested with SDS lysis solution containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.6% SDS, 12% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitors mix (Roche Applied Science). The protein lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with primary mouse monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to human DNA ligase I (ab615; Abcam), human DNA ligase III (ab587; Abcam), human XRCC4 (ab2857; Abcam), and a synthetically produced β-cytoplasmic actin N-terminal peptide (ab6276; Abcam). A secondary goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was used for detection. DNA ligase IV is present in very small amounts in the cell, and as recommended by the supplier of the antibody, immunoprecipitation was therefore performed prior to the Western blot analysis. The cells were treated with Triton lysis solution (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete protease inhibitors; Roche Applied Science) and immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human DNA ligase IV (SP1275, Acris). The immunoprecipitates were collected using insoluble Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (Sigma). Western blot analysis was performed as described above using primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human DNA ligase IV (ab6145; Abcam) and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). For detection of UL30, siRNA-treated cells were infected with HSV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 8 plaqueforming units (PFU)/cell, in the presence or absence of phosphonoacetic acid at 400 μg/ml. At 12 h p.i., the cells were collected with SDS lysis solution and subjected to Western blot analysis, as described above, using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HSV-1 UL30. All of the protein bands were detected by chemiluminescense. Virus Assays—HSV-1 (Glasgow strain 17 syn+) titers were determined by plaque assay on BHK cells. Infected monolayers were overlaid with minimum essential medium containing 2% FBS and 0.5% agarose (Invitrogen). After fixation of the cells with 7% formaldehyde (Sigma) and removal of the agarose overlay at 5 days post-infection, the plaques were visualized by staining with 1.3% crystal violet (Sigma) in 20% ethanol. Adenovirus (wt900) was provided by Göran Akusjärvi (Uppsala University). Titers were determined by plaque assay on 293 monolayers grown on collagen-treated plates. Infected cells were overlaid with minimum essential medium containing 2% FBS and 0.4% agarose. The plaques were visualized at 7 days post-infection as described above. To measure virus production, the cells were treated with siRNA for 48 or 72 h. The cell monolayers were then infected with either HSV-1 or adenovirus at a MOI of 8 PFU/cell. The cell culture supernatants were collected at the indicated times, clarified, and stored at –80 °C. The virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Growth curves of HSV-1 on human cells were performed as follows. Monolayers of 1BR.3.N, GM17523, GM16089, and GM16097 cells were infected with HSV-1 virus at a MOI of 8 PFU/cell. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed, and the monolayers were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by incubation with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% FBS. The cell culture supernatants were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h p.i., clarified by centrifugation, and stored at –80 °C. Titers were determined by plaque assays in BHK cells. Growth curve analyses on siRNA-treated cells were performed at 72 h post-transfection, as described above, and cell culture supernatants were harvested at 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h p.i. Plaque Immunostaining—At 72 h post-transfection, 1BR.3.N cells were infected with HSV-1 for 1 h and overlaid with minimum essential medium containing 2% FBS and 0.5% agarose. After 3 days of incubation, the agarose overlays were carefully removed, and the cells were fixed with cold isopropanol for 10 min at 4 °C. Monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HSV-1 ICP8 (diluted 1:5,000 in PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS, incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:200 in PBS; Pierce), and washed as before. Monolayers were then incubated with the ImmunoPure ABC alkaline phosphatase staining kit (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature, and plaques were visualized by using the ready-to-use 1-step™ nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate (Pierce). To terminate the reaction, the cells were rinsed with destilled water. DNA Replication Assays—Monolayers of 1BR.3.N were treated with RNAi for 72 h. The cells were then infected with HSV-1 at a MOI of 8 PFU/cell. DNA was isolated 20 h p.i. using 500 μl/well of 1.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K, and 10 μg/ml CT-DNA for 2–3 h at 37 °C. Total DNA was prepared by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA samples were cleaved overnight with BamHI and subjected to electrophoresis on 0.9% agarose gels, followed by alkaline transfer to Hybond-H+ membranes, as recommended by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with a 1.0-kb radiolabeled probe (Megaprime labeling system; Amersham Biosciences) derived from a BamHI fragment from the UL9 gene. The amount of radioactivity in individual bands of the Southern blots was measured by a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Analysis of the Formation of Endless Genomes—Untreated or siRNA-treated 1BR.3.N monolayers were infected at a MOI of 8 PFU/cell for 1 h at 37°C. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed with 0.14 m NaCl, pH 3.0, and treated with 0.1 m glycine, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 3.0, for inactivation of residual virus, as previously described (4Strang B.L. Stow N.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12487-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The infection was allowed to proceed for 4 h, and DNA was isolated as described above. The DNA samples were cleaved overnight with BamHI and subjected to electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels followed by Southern blotting and membrane hybridization using a radio-labeled a sequence probe, as described above. For analysis of input virus DNA, the cells were harvested at 1 h p.i. and processed as described above. RNAi-mediated Knockdown of DNA Ligase I, III, and IV—To investigate the role of DNA ligases in the life cycle of HSV-1, we have attempted to specifically knock down the level of these enzymes in human cells using RNA interference. Conserved target sequences in DNA ligases I, III, and IV in mice and men were selected considering suggestions by Elbashir et al. (25Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). The resulting double-stranded 21-mer oligonucleotides were used to transfect a SV40 T-antigen transformed human fibroblast cell line 1BR.3.N. The knockdown effects were monitored by real time PCR and Western blotting. Quantitative PCR using β-actin mRNA as a control showed a significant and specific reduction of mRNA levels for DNA ligases I, III, and IV at 48 h post-transfection (Table 1). The levels of β-actin mRNA were not affected (results not shown). A very significant and specific reduction in the amount of DNA ligase I, III, and IV after treatment with siRNA for 72 h could also be demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). In a similar way, we investigated the effects of RNAi against the DNA ligase IV co-factor XRCC4 (Fig. 1 and Table 1.). The concentrations of siRNA and lipids used in the transfection experiments throughout these investigations were chosen to avoid giving rise to altered morphology of the cells and limit nonspecific toxic effects.TABLE 1Effects of RNAi-mediated knock-down of DNA ligases on herpes simplex virus replicationRNAimRNAamRNA was quantified by quantitative real time PCR at 48 h post-RNAi transfection.

We found that RNAi against DNA ligase I and DNA ligase III had no effect on virus production, whereas treatment of cells with RNAi against DNA ligase IV for 48 h caused an 8-fold reduction on virus yield. If treatment with siRNA was extended to 72 h before infection with HSV-1, the reduction of virus production was ∼100-fold (Table 1). Finally, we used siRNA against XRCC4, which is an essential co-factor for DNA ligase IV. The release of infectious virus was reduced ∼19-fold after 48 h of siRNA treatment and 100-fold after 72 h of siRNA treatment (Table 1). These observations also indicated that maximal reduction of protein levels were achieved after 3 days of treatment with siRNA. Serial dilutions of mock transfected cell extracts were made to determine the levels of DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 in cells treated with siRNA for 72 h. We estimate a 70% knockdown of these proteins upon siRNA treatment (supplemental Fig. S1). We have also used a mutant version of siRNA against DNA ligase IV, Lig IVmut, with three scattered base pair mutations, which does not significantly reduce the levels of DNA ligase IV mRNA. Lig IVmut siRNA only cause a 3-fold reduction in HSV-1 replication under conditions where Lig IV siRNA results in an 80-fold reduction in virus yield (supplemental Table S1). Mutant siRNAs with five or more base pair changes cause no reduction on virus yield (results not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that siRNA Lig IVmut mentioned above may give rise to a mild RNAi effect. To ascertain that the RNAi-mediated inhibition was specific, a second siRNA, XRCC4b, against XRCC4 was used. The sequence of this species was derived from a previous study on XRCC4 (24Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). We found, using siRNA against DNA ligase I as a control, that siRNA against XRCC4 reduced the yield of infectious virus 100-fold (supplemental Table S2). To confirm these results, we looked at the formation of HSV-1 plaques on 1BR.3.N cells (Fig. 2). Plaques were identified by immunostaining using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against ICP8. Infected mock transfected cells displayed plaques with a hollow center surrounded by an intensely staining ring of cells expressing ICP8. Monolayers that were transfected with siRNA against either DNA ligase I or DNA ligase III and subsequently infected with HSV-1 exhibited plaques of normal size and morphology. On the other hand, monolayers treated with siRNA against DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 prior to infection with HSV-1 exhibited miniscule plaques (Fig. 2). We also measured how RNAi against DNA ligase IV and/or XRCC4 affected synthesis of HSV-1 DNA. Our results demonstrate a 10–25-fold reduction in the amount of virus DNA synthesized at 20 h p.i. (Fig. 3). As a control, we looked at the effects of RNAi on synthesis of HSV-1 DNA polymerase, UL30, in the presence or absence of the DNA synthesis inhibitor phosphonoacetic acid. The amount of UL30 protein was not altered by the treatment of cells with siRNA directed against DNA ligase IV or XRCC4 (results not shown). We conclude that the reduction in DNA synthesis was not caused by inhibition of synthesis of HSV-1 DNA polymerase. As expected, treatment of cells with siRNA against DNA ligase IV, which inhibits DNA synthesis, caused a prominent reduction in synthesis of the late protein glycoprotein B (results not shown). DNA Ligase IV Is Not Required for Adenovirus Replication—To further assess the specificity of the RNAi-mediated effects and the viability of cells upon this treatment, we examined the role of DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 for replication of adenovirus. Adenovirus does not form endless concatemers during replication, most likely as a result of inactivation of the NBS-Mre11-Rad50 complex involved in nonhomologous end joining (26Stracker T.H. Carson C.T. Weitzman M.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In accordance with this observation, we found only a small reduction of adenovirus replication after treatment of 1BR.3.N cells with siRNA against DNA ligase IV or XRCC4. In contrast, HSV-1 DNA replication was reduced 100-fold (Table 2). This result argues in favor of a specific role for DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 in HSV-1 replication.TABLE 2Effects of RNAi-mediated knock-down of DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 on replication of adenovirus and herpes simplex virusRNAiVirus yieldHSV1a1BR.3.N monolayers were transfected with siRNA for 72 h, followed by HSV-1 infection at a MOI of 8 PFU/cell for 20 h.

Opiate dependence is a major public health issue whose incidence rate may dramatically increase in the next years. Recent reports show an alarming raise in the recreational use of heroin and other opiate drugs among adolescents (NIDA, 2005NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse). (2005). Monitoring the future: national results on adolescent drug use (http://www.monitoringthefuture.org).Google Scholar). In opiate-dependent individuals, heroin “highs” are inexorably followed by a severe opiate withdrawal syndrome comprised of somatic signs and symptoms and negative affective states (O'Brien, 1996O'Brien C.P. Drug addiction and drug abuse.in: Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 557-577Google Scholar). Besides a positive reinforcement theory of drug addiction (Shaham et al., 2003Shaham Y. Shalev U. Lu L. De Wit H. Stewart J. The reinstatement model of drug relapse: history, methodology and major findings.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2003; 168 (Published online October 26, 2002): 3-20https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-002-1224-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar), studies indicate that escape from the extremely aversive and stressful opiate withdrawal syndrome may motivate heroin-seeking and -taking behaviors (Carrera et al., 1999Carrera M.R.

However, current treatments do not effectively relieve the opiate withdrawal syndrome, thus leaving opiate-dependent individuals vulnerable to relapse to drug intake. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system is a major coordinator of behavioral and endocrine responses to stress (Heinrichs et al., 1994Heinrichs S.C. Menzaghi F. Pich E.M. Baldwin H.A. Rassnick S. Britton K.T. Koob G.F.

The CRF system might also mediate the motivational effects of drug dependence. Functional antagonism of CRF neurotransmission reduces stress-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior and ameliorates negative affective-like states associated with alcohol, cocaine, or opiate withdrawal (Heinrichs et al., 1995Heinrichs S.C.

In mammals, CRF actions are mediated by two distinct receptor pathways, termed CRF1 and CRF2 (Hauger et al., 2003Hauger R.L. Grigoriadis D.E. Dallman M.F. Plotsky P.M. Vale W.W. Dautzenberg F.M. International Union of Pharmacology. XXXVI. Current status of the nomenclature for receptors for corticotropin-releasing factor and their ligands.Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Genetically engineered mouse models have allowed the observation of distinct, and often opposite, functions for the two known CRF receptor pathways in HPA axis and affective-like behavioral responses to stressors (Bale and Vale, 2004Bale T.L.

In particular, studies with CRF1 receptor-deficient mice have revealed that the CRF/CRF1 receptor pathway mediates HPA axis functions and behavioral strategies essential to cope with stressful events (Contarino et al., 1999Contarino A.

Moreover, using CRF1 receptor-deficient mice, we have recently found that disruption of the CRF/CRF1 receptor pathway eliminates the negative affective states of opiate withdrawal (Contarino and Papaleo, 2005Contarino A. Papaleo F. The corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 pathway mediates the negative affective states of opiate withdrawal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the involvement of the stress-responsive HPA system and brain extrahypothalamic CRF/CRF1 receptor circuitry in behavioral, gene expression, and endocrine alterations relevant to somatic opiate withdrawal remains largely unknown. To elucidate the role for the CRF/CRF1 receptor pathway in somatic components of the opiate withdrawal syndrome, here we used CRF1 receptor-deficient (CRF1+/− and CRF1−/−) mice and the CRF1 receptor-preferring antagonist antalarmin (Smith et al., 1998Smith G.W. Aubry J.M. Dellu F. Contarino A. Bilezikjian L.M. Gold L.H. Chen R. Marchuk Y. Hauser C.

In keeping with the clinical setting, where signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal “spontaneously” and gradually rise along with the drug removal from the body (O'Brien, 1996O'Brien C.P. Drug addiction and drug abuse.in: Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 557-577Google Scholar), our studies were conducted in mice undergoing spontaneous opiate withdrawal. Active heroin-dependent individuals have reduced plasma levels of corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol, flattened circadian rhythms of cortisol, and blunted HPA axis responses to stressors (Facchinetti et al., 1985Facchinetti F. Volpe A. Farci G. Petraglia F. Porro C.A. Barbieri G. Cioni A. Balestrieri A. Genazzani A.R.

CRF1−/− mice also display flattened circadian rhythms of corticosterone, the main glucocorticoid hormone in rodents, and deficient ACTH and corticosterone responses to stressors (Smith et al., 1998Smith G.W. Aubry J.M. Dellu F. Contarino A. Bilezikjian L.M. Gold L.H. Chen R. Marchuk Y. Hauser C.

Thus, to examine the specific contribution of impaired HPA axis functions to opiate withdrawal, we treated CRF1−/− mice with nonstressful amounts of corticosterone. Moreover, the use of antalarmin allowed us to investigate the HPA axis-independent role for the CRF/CRF1 receptor pathway in opiate withdrawal. Antalarmin attenuates behavioral responses to stress but does not affect basal or stress-related activity of the HPA axis (Deak et al., 1999Deak T. Nguyen K.T. Ehrlich A.L. Watkins L.R. Spencer R.L.

Furthermore, we examined the specific role for impaired HPA axis functions associated with the CRF1 receptor deficiency upon opiate withdrawal-induced expression of CRF and the opioid peptide dynorphin in the PVN and the striatum, brain regions integrating behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic responses to stress (Koob and Heinrichs, 1999Koob G.F.

PVN CRF drives basal and stress-related activity of the HPA axis (Sawchenko et al., 1993Sawchenko P.E. Imaki T. Potter E. Kovacs K. Imaki J. Vale W.

Moreover, recent evidence indicates a role for striatal dynorphin circuitry in somatic components of the opiate withdrawal syndrome (Zachariou et al., 2006Zachariou V. Bolanos C.A. Selley D.E.

The present study reveals a fundamental role for the HPA system and brain extrahypothalamic CRF/CRF1 receptor circuitry in somatic, gene expression, and endocrine changes associated with the stressful condition of opiate withdrawal. To induce opiate dependence, wild-type, CRF1+/−, and CRF1−/− mice were repeatedly treated with escalating morphine doses. Unlike constant morphine infusions or pellets, intermittent treatment with escalating morphine doses closely parallels the drug intake pattern of opiate-dependent humans. Also, in rodents termination of intermittent morphine treatment is followed by HPA axis alterations that are similar to those seen in opiate-withdrawn humans (Houshyar et al., 2004Houshyar H.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9414-9424Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CRF1 receptor deficiency did not affect body weight (BW) loss induced by intermittent morphine administration (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Analysis of somatic opiate withdrawal occurring 8 hr after the last morphine injection revealed a genotype × opiate withdrawal interaction effect for the jump (F2,49 = 4.18, p < 0.05), wet dog shake (F2,49 = 3.35, p < 0.05), and diarrhea (F2,49 = 3.84, p < 0.05) signs. Opiate-withdrawn CRF1−/− mice made more jumps (p < 0.01; Figure 1A), wet dog shakes (p < 0.005; Figure 1B), and diarrhea (p < 0.01; Figure 1C) than all other groups. In contrast, opiate-withdrawn wild-type and CRF1+/− mice did not differ from control mice (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C). Accordingly, during the conditioning trials of an opiate withdrawal conditioned place aversion experiment, opiate-withdrawn CRF1−/− mice displayed elevated levels of jumping and wet dog shake, as compared to wild-type and CRF1+/− mice (Contarino and Papaleo, 2005Contarino A. Papaleo F. The corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 pathway mediates the negative affective states of opiate withdrawal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 (Published online December 8, 2005): 18649-18654https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506999102Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CRF1 receptor deficiency did not affect other opiate withdrawal signs: overall, opiate-withdrawn mice showed more paw tremors (F1,49 = 9.93, p < 0.005), body stretches (F1,49 = 11.99, p < 0.005), chews (F1,49 = 20.47, p < 0.0001), teeth chatters (F1,49 = 9.46, p < 0.005), palpebral ptoses (F1,49 = 4.17, p < 0.05), and body weight loss (F1,49 = 21.10, p < 0.0001) than control mice (Figure S2). Analysis of global opiate withdrawal (GOW) scores also revealed a genotype × opiate withdrawal interaction effect (F2,49 = 8.00, p < 0.001). Opiate-withdrawn wild-type, CRF1+/−, and CRF1−/− mice displayed higher GOW scores than control mice (p < 0.005). In addition, opiate-withdrawn CRF1−/− mice showed higher GOW scores than opiate-withdrawn wild-type and CRF1+/− mice (p < 0.0005; Figure 1D). These results clearly indicate a dramatic increase in major somatic signs of opiate withdrawal in mice lacking functional levels of CRF1 receptors. Another cohort of wild-type, CRF1+/−, and CRF1−/− mice was used to assess the duration of somatic opiate withdrawal. Monitoring of opiate withdrawal up to 152 hr after the last morphine injection revealed a genotype × opiate withdrawal × time interaction effect (F10,155 = 2.12, p < 0.05). CRF1−/− mice displayed elevated GOW scores at least up to 104 hr after the last opiate injection (p < 0.05 versus all other groups). In net contrast, in wild-type and CRF1+/− mice somatic opiate withdrawal lasted less than 32 hr (Figure 1E). Thus, somatic opiate withdrawal was not only more severe but also lasted much longer in CRF1−/− mice than in wild-type and CRF1+/− mice. These results also rule out a genotype-dependent time shift in somatic opiate withdrawal: in all three genotypes, GOW scores were maximal 8 hr after the last morphine injection (compare Figures 1D and 1E). To search for brain changes underlying the increased somatic opiate withdrawal found in CRF1−/− mice, we examined CRF and dynorphin expression in the PVN (bregma interval −0.94/−1.22 mm). Analysis of PVN CRF expression in control and opiate-withdrawn wild-type and CRF1 receptor-deficient mice revealed an interesting genotype × opiate withdrawal interaction effect (F2,96 = 46.02, p < 0.0001). Opiate withdrawal increased CRF mRNA levels in both wild-type and CRF1+/− mice (p < 0.0005 versus same genotype control mice). In net contrast, opiate withdrawal markedly decreased PVN CRF expression in CRF1−/− mice (p < 0.0005 versus control CRF1−/− mice; Figure 2A). Thus, disruption of the CRF/CRF1 receptor pathway severely impairs activation of PVN CRF circuitry in response to the stress of opiate withdrawal. Examination of PVN dynorphin expression revealed a genotype × opiate withdrawal interaction effect (F2,96 = 9.05, p < 0.0005). Opiate withdrawal did not affect dynorphin expression either in wild-type or in CRF1+/− mice. Drug-naive control CRF1−/− mice showed higher dynorphin mRNA levels than either control or opiate-withdrawn wild-type and CRF1+/− mice (p < 0.0005). Moreover, despite the already elevated dynorphin mRNA levels, opiate withdrawal further increased dynorphin expression in CRF1−/− mice (p < 0.0005 versus control CRF1−/− mice; Figures 2B and 2C). These results clearly indicate that lack of functional CRF1 receptors induces aberrant PVN CRF and dynorphin responses to opiate withdrawal. HPA axis deficiencies associated with the genetic inactivation of the CRF/CRF1 receptor pathway might have contributed to the PVN CRF and dynorphin alterations reported above. Drug-naive adrenalectomized rats display increased hypothalamic dynorphin levels (Almeida et al., 1992Almeida O.F. Hassan A.H. Harbuz M.S. Linton E.A. Lightman S.L. Hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone and opioid peptide neurons: functional changes after adrenalectomy and/or castration.Brain Res. 1992; 571: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as stress-induced decreases in PVN CRF expression (Tanimura and Watts, 1998Tanimura S.M. Watts A.G. Corticosterone can facilitate as well as inhibit corticotropin-releasing hormone gene expression in the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus.Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3830-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, here we show that CRF1+/− mice, which display neither basal nor stress-related ACTH or corticosterone deficits (Contarino and Papaleo, 2005Contarino A. Papaleo F. The corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 pathway mediates the negative affective states of opiate withdrawal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 (Published online December 8, 2005): 18649-18654https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506999102Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Timpl et al., 1998Timpl P. Spanagel R. Sillaber I.

Genet. 1998; 19: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), displayed PVN CRF and dynorphin mRNA levels similar to those of wild-type mice. Then, we decided to assess the specific role for the impaired HPA axis in the exacerbated somatic opiate withdrawal displayed by CRF1−/− mice. To examine the contribution of impaired HPA axis functions to somatic opiate withdrawal, CRF1−/− mice were given free access to corticosterone in the home-cage drinking water throughout intermittent opiate administration. Corticosterone intake restored nadir plasma corticosterone levels (p < 0.05 versus corticosterone-untreated CRF1−/− mice) but did not produce “stressful” plasma corticosterone concentrations throughout the light-dark cycle of the housing room (Figure 3). Eight hours after the last opiate injection, corticosterone-untreated opiate-withdrawn CRF1−/− mice showed higher levels of paw tremor (p < 0.0005; Figure 4A), wet dog shake (p < 0.0005; Figure 4B), diarrhea (p < 0.005; Figure 4C), and GOW scores (p < 0.0005; Figure 4D) than control mice and opiate-withdrawn wild-type mice. Treatment with corticosterone effectively reduced paw tremors, wet dog shakes, and GOW scores in CRF1−/− mice (p < 0.0005 versus corticosterone-untreated opiate-withdrawn CRF1−/− mice), completely abolishing the difference between opiate-withdrawn CRF1−/− and wild-type mice, but did not affect the diarrhea sign (Figures 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D). These results clearly indicate that deficient HPA axis activity strongly contributes to aggravate the somatic outcome of opiate withdrawal. At the end of the 30 min opiate withdrawal test, corticosterone-treated and -untreated CRF1−/− mice had similar plasma corticosterone levels that were much lower than the stress-like levels displayed by wild-type mice (p < 0.0005; Figure S3). The latter results indicate that the beneficial effects of exogenous corticosterone upon somatic components of opiate withdrawal were not accompanied by a stress-like activity of the HPA axis.Figure 4Treatment with Nonstressful Amounts of Corticosterone Decreases the Somatic Expression of Opiate Withdrawal in CRF1−/− MiceShow full caption(A) Paw tremors, (B) wet dog shakes, (C) diarrhea, and (D) global opiate withdrawal scores displayed by control or opiate-withdrawn wild-type, corticosterone-untreated (CRF1−/−), or -treated (CRF1−/− CORT) CRF1−/− mice during a 30 min test carried out 8 hr after the last morphine injection.

To examine if the decrease of somatic opiate withdrawal by intake of nonstressful amounts of corticosterone was associated to brain region-specific changes in gene expression, we examined CRF and dynorphin mRNA levels in the PVN and the striatum of control and opiate-withdrawn wild-type, corticosterone-untreated, or -treated CRF1−/− mice. Analysis of PVN CRF expression (bregma interval −0.94/−1.22 mm) revealed a group × opiate withdrawal interaction effect (F2,103 = 31.17, p < 0.0001). As in our prior experiment reported above, opiate withdrawal increased CRF expression in wild-type mice (p < 0.0005 versus control wild-type mice); in net contrast, opiate-withdrawn corticosterone-untreated CRF1−/− mice displayed an aberrant decrease in CRF activity (p < 0.0005 versus corticosterone-untreated control CRF1−/− mice; Figure 5A). Intake of corticosterone strongly reduced PVN CRF expression in control CRF1−/− mice (p < 0.0005 versus control corticosterone-untreated CRF1−/− mice; Figure 5A). Most interestingly, similar to the wild-type mice, opiate-withdrawn corticosterone-treated CRF1−/− mice displayed higher PVN CRF mRNA levels than corticosterone-treated control CRF1−/− mice (p < 0.05; Figures 5A and 5B). Thus, in line with the behavioral results reported above, CRF1−/− mice treated with corticosterone showed “wild-type-like” patterns of PVN CRF expression both under drug-naïve and opiate withdrawal conditions.

The substituted cysteine accessibility method was used to probe the solvent exposure of single cysteine residues engineered to replace residues Tyr101 through Gln135 of EL1 in the presence and absence of the tridecapeptide α-factor and a receptor antagonist. Surprisingly, many residues, especially those at the N-terminal region, were not solvent-accessible, including residues of the binding-competent yet signal transduction-deficient mutants L102C, N105C, S108C, Y111C, and T114C. In striking contrast, two N-terminal residues, Y101C and Y106C, were readily solvent-accessible, but upon incubation with α-factor labeling was reduced, suggesting a pheromone-dependent conformational change limiting solvent accessibility had occurred. Labeling in the presence of the antagonist, which binds Ste2p but does not initiate signal transduction, did not significantly alter reactivity with the Y101C and Y106C receptors, suggesting that the α-factor-dependent decrease in solvent accessibility was not because of steric hindrance that prevented the labeling reagent access to these residues. Based on these and previous observations, we propose a model in which the N terminus of EL1 is structured such that parts of the loop are buried in a solvent-inaccessible environment interacting with the extracellular part of the transmembrane domain bundle. This study highlights the essential role of an extracellular loop in activation of a G protein-coupled receptor upon ligand binding.

This study highlights the essential role of an extracellular loop in activation of a G protein-coupled receptor upon ligand binding. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; G protein, heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; TM, transmembrane domain; EL, extracellular loop; MLT, medium lacking tryptophan; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIPA, radioimmunoprecipitation assay; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; MTSEA-biotin, (2-[(biotinoyl)amino]ethyl methanethiosulfonate; PNGase, peptide:N-glycosidase. are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and have been found in a diversity of organisms ranging from yeast to humans. In most eukaryotes, GPCRs comprise 1–2% of the total genes in the genome (1Fredriksson R. Schioth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1414-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and participate in virtually all aspects of cellular physiology, including hormonal responses, neuronal transmission, and mediation of taste, smell, and vision (2Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Modulation of GPCR function is a major pharmaceutical target, currently accounting for >30% of all drugs prescribed (3Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Drews J. Science. 2000; 287: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar, 5Schlyer S. Horuk R. Drug Discov. Today. 2006; 11: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus a thorough understanding of the nature of the receptor-ligand interaction and subsequent signal transduction is essential for the development of more effective and safer therapeutic agents. The structural hallmarks of this diverse collection of receptors are seven membrane-spanning domains linked by extracellular and intracellular loops, oriented such that the N terminus is external to the cell and the C terminus is internal. Although the structure-function relationships in the membrane-spanning domains and the intracellular loop regions have been well examined in many GPCRs (6Celic A. Connelly S.M. Martin N.P. Dumont M.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 105-120PubMed Google Scholar, 7Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 743-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), few studies have focused on the importance of the extracellular loop structures and their role in receptor activation. In those studies where the extracellular domains were studied in detail, their role in binding ligand was the focus of the investigations (12Shi L. Javitch J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). GPCRs sense signals in the extracellular environment, transduce that information across the cell membrane, and trigger specific changes in intracellular physiology. Signal transduction is initiated when a specific ligand binds to its cognate GPCR. Ligand binding can occur within the bundle of transmembrane domains such as for the β-adrenergic receptor and/or with the extracellular domains as occurs for some peptide or protein ligands (10Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Ligand binding promotes a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in the exchange of GTP for GDP on the α-subunit of the coupled heterotrimeric G protein. Because signaling depends on interactions between the intracellular G proteins and the receptor, molecular events occurring on the cytoplasmic side of the receptor have been a focus of attention (10Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 13Feng Y.H. Karnik S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9279-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, concomitant changes are undoubtedly occurring on the extracellular surface of the receptor, including the extracellular loops, and these events have not been systematically investigated. With the elucidation of the crystal structure of the ground state of bovine rhodopsin (15Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), the role of the extracellular loops as integral to receptor structure and function has begun to emerge (16Lawson Z. Wheatley M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 1048-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to confirming the presence of the disulfide linkage between Cys187 in EL2 and Cys110 in TM3, both highly conserved cysteines found in most GPCRs, it was determined that the extracellular domains, including the N terminus and extracellular loops 1–3, interact to form an organized structure. In particular, extracellular loop 2 has extensive contacts with the other extracellular domains and also plunges down into the transmembrane bundle, contacting the retinal ligand. It was postulated that the organization of the extracellular domain serves to orient and position the seven membrane-spanning domains. Recent studies with the complement factor 5a receptor (C5a receptor) indicate that the first extracellular loop is important in ligand-mediated activation of the receptor, whereas the second loop functions as a negative regulator of receptor activation and serves to stabilize the inactive state of the receptor (17Klco J.M. Nikiforovich G.V. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12010-12019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus both structural and functional evidence indicates that the extracellular loops of GPCRs play important roles in the signal transduction pathway. In yeast, the receptor for the tridecapeptide mating pheromone, α-factor, is the GPCR Ste2p. Our previous work has suggested that the first extracellular loop of Ste2p plays a critical role in receptor activation. Although mutation to cysteine of most residues in the Tyr101 through Gln135 EL1 domain had no effect on binding and signal transduction, mutation of residues Leu102, Asn105, Ser108, Tyr111, and Thr114 to cysteine resulted in receptors that could effectively bind pheromone, but they were partially (Leu102 and Gln135) or severely (Asn105, Ser108, and Tyr111) compromised with respect to signal transduction. The periodicity of every third residue leading to a compromised receptor suggested that this region had structural organization. Subsequent modeling and biophysical studies on a synthetic EL1 peptide indicated that residues 106–114 may form a 310 helix, whereas the extreme C terminus of the loop (residues 126–135) may contain β-strands (19Akal-Strader A. Khare S. Xu D. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30581-30590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus this loop appeared to have a defined secondary structure, and we hypothesized that disrupting this structure resulted in a signaling-deficient receptor. Here we further expand upon the functional role of EL1 in Ste2p by determining the solvent accessibility of the residues in this loop using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (20Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 21Javitch J.A. Shi L. Liapakis G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To apply this methodology, each residue in the first extracellular loop of a Cys-less Ste2p was mutated to Cys to generate a collection of 35 single Cys receptors. The accessibilities of EL1 single Cys receptors to MTSEA-biotin were compared in the ligand-bound and -unbound state. Our results indicate that many residues are not solvent-accessible, suggesting that EL1 is structured in a way that results in part of the loop being buried in a hydrophobic environment. Furthermore, the presence of pheromone influences the accessibility of specific residues in EL1, suggesting that this loop changes conformation upon binding of α-factor to Ste2p. Strains, Media, and Plasmids—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJS21 was used in all assays (22Son C.D. Sargsyan H. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13193-13203Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The relevant genotype is MATa, prc1-407 prb1-1122 pep4-3 leu2 trp1 ura3-52 ste2::KanR. For high level, constitutive expression of Ste2p, plasmid pBEC1 was constructed from p424GPD, a 2-μm based shuttle vector with a GPD promoter, CYC1 terminator, and TRP marker for selection in yeast (23Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). STE2 containing C-terminal FLAG and His epitope tags was PCR-amplified from plasmid pNED (24David N.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15553-15561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using primers that introduce a BamHI and EcoRI restriction site. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the complementary sites of p424GPD to yield plasmid pBEC1. For use as a negative control in SCAM analysis, a Cys-less version of pBEC1 was generated by in vivo ligation (25Oldenburg K.R. Vo K.T. Michaelis S. Paddon C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) of a Cys-less STE2 PCR product amplified from pGA314.Cys-less.STE2.FT.HT (19Akal-Strader A. Khare S. Xu D. Naider F.

For SCAM analysis, 35 single Cys mutants ranging from Tyr101 through Gln135 of EL were generated in the pBEC2 background by in vivo ligation of PCR products from single Cys receptors already described (19Akal-Strader A.

In addition, mutants T199C, Y203C, and Y266C were also constructed for use as controls. The sequences of all STE2 inserts were verified by DNA sequence analysis completed by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility located on the campus of the University of Tennessee. Primers were purchased from Sigma Genosys or IDT (Coralville, IA). After sequence confirmation, constructs were transformed by the method of Geitz et al. (26Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 201425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar) into yeast strain BJS21 (ste2-deletion strain), and transformants bearing the pBEC2 constructs were selected by their growth in the absence of tryptophan on MLT medium (24David N.E.

All media components were obtained from Difco and were of the highest quality available. Whole-cell MTSEA Labeling, Membrane Preparation, and Immunoblots—Labeling with MTSEA-biotin (Biotium, Hayward, CA) was based on the method originally described by Lin et al. (27Lin J.C. Duell K.

Cells expressing the various pBEC2 Cys-scanned Ste2p constructs were grown in MLT overnight at 30 °C. Cells (200 ml) were harvested at mid-log phase, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 3 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The absorbance (A600) was determined, and 20–30 absorbance units were resuspended in a final volume of 1 ml of PBS. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min in the presence or absence of α-factor (WHWLQLKPGQPBY12; where B indicates norleucine) or the des-Trp1des-His2 antagonist (28Eriotou-Bargiota E. Xue C.B.

Pheromones were synthesized and characterized as described previously (28Eriotou-Bargiota E. Xue C.B. Naider F. Becker J.M.

Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were also tested along with the coumermycin antibiotic novobiocin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 2 μm. The cells were warmed to room temperature and then supplemented with MTSEA-biotin at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The MTSEA-biotin was prepared immediately before use as a 20 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction was stopped after 2 min by the addition of a freshly prepared aqueous cysteine solution to a final concentration of 10 mm, which brought the reaction mixture to pH 4, and was incubated on ice for an additional 5 min. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. MTSEA-biotin-treated cells were pelleted, resuspended in PBS, and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. Following a low speed spin (700 × g, 5 min) to remove cell wall debris, unbroken cells, and glass beads, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at high speed (15,000 × g, 30 min) to pellet membranes. The pellet was resuspended in PBS, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Membranes were solubilized in RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA in 1× PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature with end-over-end mixing. The solubilized, biotinylated proteins were collected on UltraLink Immobilized Streptavidin Plus beads (Pierce) by incubation overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. The beads were washed four times with ice-cold RIPA buffer, once with 2% SDS in PBS (room temperature), followed by a final wash with ice-cold RIPA buffer. During the washes the beads were resuspended and then allowed to settle by gravity for 20 min prior to removal of the supernatant. Bound proteins were extracted from the beads using SDS sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 55 °C, 5 min) and used for immunoblot analysis. Solubilized proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) along with pre-stained Precision Plus protein standards (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Immobilon™-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The blot was probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.), and bands were visualized with West Pico chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Blots were imaged, and the total density of all Ste2p bands in each lane was determined using a ChemiDoc XRS photodocumentation system with Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad). To verify Ste2p expression levels, an aliquot of total membrane was solubilized in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (2–20 μg/lane), and immunoblotted in parallel with the biotinylated proteins extracted from the beads. Deglycosylation of Membrane Proteins—Total membrane proteins (5–25 μg) prepared as described above were resuspended in sodium phosphate (50 mm, pH 7.5), supplemented with 500 units of glycerol-free PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. A negative control was run in parallel in which no enzyme was added prior to incubation at 37 °C. Upon termination of the incubation interval, the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min), and the resulting pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The samples were used for FLAG immunoblot analysis as described above. Saturation Binding Analysis—Tritiated α-factor (10.2 Ci/mmol, 12 μm), prepared as described previously (29Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used in saturation binding assays on whole cells. BJS21 cells were grown to mid-log phase in MLT, harvested, washed twice with ice-cold YM1 medium (30Abel M.G. Zhang Y.L. Lu H.F. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and resuspended at a final concentration of 4 × 107 cells/ml in YM1i (YM1 plus potassium fluoride (1 mg/ml), p-toluene-sulfonyl-l-arginine methyl ester (3.8 mg/ml), NaN3 (0.6 mg/ml), bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) and tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone (1 mg/ml)). Cells (600 μl) were combined with 150 μl of ice-cold 5× binding medium (YM1i supplemented with 3H-labeled α-factor) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The final 1× concentrations of pheromone ranged from 0.6 to 50 nm. Upon completion of the incubation interval, 200-μl aliquots of the cell/pheromone mixture were collected in triplicate and washed over glass fiber filter mats using the Standard Cell Harvester (Skatron Instruments, Sterling, VA). Retained radioactivity on the filter was counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. BJS21 cells lacking Ste2p, expressing only the empty vector (p424GPD), were used as a nonspecific binding control for the assays. Specific binding for each mutant receptor was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific values from those obtained for total binding. Specific binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis for single-site binding using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to determine the Bmax value (receptors/cell) for each mutant receptor. Expression Levels of Single Cys and Cys-less Receptors—To determine the accessibility of residues in extracellular loop 1 of Ste2p (Fig. 1), mutants with single cysteine residues engineered into positions 101–135 were subcloned into a yeast expression vector under the control of a constitutive GPD promoter. To verify that the mutant receptors were expressed, total membranes were isolated from yeast expressing each of the 35 single Cys mutant receptors and the Cys-less control, immunoblotted, and probed with FLAG antibody (Fig. 2). For most EL1 mutants, 2 μg of total cell protein was loaded per lane. Expression of Ste2p for these mutants (Fig. 2) was determined by quantitation of band density to range from 30 to 110% of the Cys-less control level. Mutants N105C, S108C, Y111C, and T114C were expressed at significantly reduced levels (7–21% compared with the Cys-less wild-type receptor as determined by quantitation of band density); thus 20 μg of total cell protein was loaded per lane to improve visualization and quantitation of these receptors. If only 2 μg of total membrane protein of these poorly expressed mutants had been loaded, the bands corresponding to monomeric Ste2p would have been barely visible on the blot.FIGURE 2FLAG immunoblot of total cell protein. Membranes were prepared from cells expressing each of the mutant receptors. For most receptors, 2 μg of total membrane protein was immunoblotted and probed with anti-FLAG antibody. For residues indicated with an asterisk, 20 μg of total membrane protein was analyzed. Molecular mass markers (kDa) are indicated on the left-hand side of each panel. The prominent bands visible at ∼50 kDa corresponds to the monomeric forms of glycosylated Ste2p. Bands with higher molecular weights represent aggregated (i.e. dimerized and trimerized) forms of the receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to reduced levels of expression in the total membrane fraction, the mutants N105C, S108C, Y111C, and T114C exhibited a different banding pattern as compared with that of the other mutant receptors. For the Cys-less control as well as the other well expressed mutants, Ste2p appeared as a set of three main bands (plus small amounts of some higher molecular weight oligomers), centered roughly about 55 kDa. Based on the primary amino acid sequence of the FLAG- and His-tagged construct used in these studies, the predicted molecular mass for Cys-less Ste2p is 50.8 kDa. Glycosylation of the protein accounts for the observed higher molecular weights of the Ste2p monomer (31Jenness D.D. Li Y. Tipper C. Spatrick P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the poorly expressed mutants, the Ste2p signal on the immunoblot is more diffuse, with signal for the monomer ranging from 52 to 70 kDa. Interestingly, these same mutants had been reported earlier to be compromised with respect to signal transduction, although they were expressed on the cell surface as evidenced by their ability to bind pheromone with affinities equal to that of the wild-type receptor (19Akal-Strader A. Khare S. Xu D. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30581-30590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the immunoblot analysis can verify that the EL1 mutants were expressed in the total membrane fraction, it does not provide information regarding their expression on the cell surface. Our previous studies indicated that the EL1 Cys-scanned mutants were expressed at the cell surface and bound pheromone with near wild-type affinity, indicating that the receptors were properly folded (19Akal-Strader A. Khare S. Xu D. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30581-30590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, to determine the cell surface expression of select EL1 Cys mutants under the control of a constitutive promoter in the BJS21 strain background, saturation binding experiments using whole cells were conducted (Table 1). All mutants assayed were expressed on the cell surface, the majority at wild-type levels. All mutants except S108C, T110C, Y111C, and T114C were expressed at greater than 50% of the Y101C mutant level. Many mutants that did not label with the MTSEA-biotin reagent (L102C, L103C, S104C, N105C, L113C, N132C, and I134C) were expressed at near wild-type levels, suggesting that the absence of labeling with the MTSEA-biotin was because of inaccessibility of the cysteine residue, rather that lack of cell surface expression. Nonlabeled receptors expressed at the cell surface at reduced levels (S108C, T110C, Y111C, and T114C) were still present at sufficient quantity to be detected if they had been biotinylated.TABLE 1Surface expression and MTSEA labeling of cysteine-scanned mutants of Ste2pMutant% surface expressionaSte2p expressed on the cell surface was determined by saturation binding expressed as a percentage of receptor number normalized to the Y101C receptor (72,400 ± 5,000 receptors/cell)% labelingbSte2p recovered from streptavidin beads was expressed as a percentage of Y101C levelsCys-less90 ± 120c0 indicates no detectable labelingY101C100 ± 6100 ± 13L102CdBoldface indicates signaling-compromised receptors119 ± 220L103C95 ± 50S104C89 ± 110N105C100 ± 100Y106C156 ± 1990 ± 26S107C–e– indicates that these measurements were not made in this study.

Although residues Asn46, Asn105, and Asn205 are all potential glycosylation sites, analysis by site-directed mutagenesis of these sites indicates that they were not utilized (32Mentesana P.E. Konopka J.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9685-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

Here we show that TopBP1 is also required for G1 to S progression in a normal cell cycle. TopBP1 deficiency inhibited cells from entering S phase by up-regulating p21 and p27, resulting in down-regulation of cyclin E/CDK2. Although co-depletion of p21 and p27 with TopBP1 restored the cyclin E/CDK2 kinase activity, however, cells remained arrested at the G1/S boundary, showing defective chromatin-loading of replication components. Based on these results, we suggest a dual role of TopBP1 necessary for the G1/S transition: one for activating cyclin E/CDK2 kinase and the other for loading replication components onto chromatin to initiate DNA synthesis.

During successive eukaryotic cell cycles, accurate duplication of the genome is important for the transmission of intact genetic information to daughter cells. The beginning of S phase marks the initiation of chromosomal replication and is therefore strictly regulated by various and complex control systems, necessary for cells to duplicate their genome at the proper time and only once during each cell cycle. Beginning from late M phase to early G1 phase, the origin recognition complex binds to replication origins and recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1 (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). These two licensing factors collaborate with ORC to load MCM2–7 onto chromatin, which completes assembly of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). 4The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, prereplicative complex; pre-IC, preinitiation complex; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DNA pol-ɛ, DNA polymeraseɛ; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; DAPI, 4′-6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RNAi, RNA interference; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; pRb, retinoblastoma protein. The onset of S phase in mammalian cells requires the activity of two important kinase complexes, cyclin E/CDK2 and Cdc7/Dbf4 (2Hwang H.C. Clurman B.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 3Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Woo R.A. Poon R.Y. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These kinases activate the pre-RC, facilitating Cdc45 loading at replication origins and recruitment of DNA polymerases and assembly of the preinitiation complex (pre-IC). Cyclin E/CDK2 kinase complex plays pivotal roles in G1/S transition. It inactivates retinoblastoma protein (pRb) by phosphorylation preventing formation of pRb-chromatin remodeling complexes. As a result, E2F transcription is de-repressed and genes required for DNA replication and S phase progression are up-regulated (5Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 6Moroy T. Geisen C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1424-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cyclin E/CDK2 is also believed to be directly implicated in initiation of chromosomal replication by activating replication components via phosphorylation, although its substrates and the activation mechanisms remain to be elucidated (7Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). CDK2 activity is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner by its regulatory partner cyclin E, whose protein level is the highest at the G1/S boundary (8Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). It is also negatively regulated by CDK specific inhibitors such as p21 and p27 which bind directly to the cyclinE/CDK2 complex (9Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Since TopBP1 contains eight BRCA1 C terminus domains, which are commonly found in proteins involved in DNA repair or cell cycle checkpoints, studies of TopBP1 have mainly focused on its function in the DNA damage response. TopBP1 participates in checkpoint control by responding to various DNA damages (12Greer D.A. Besley B.D. Kennedy K.B. Davey S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4829-4835PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamane K.

Additional roles of TopBP1 in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling have been reported: TopBP1 physically interacts with transcriptional factors such as Miz-1 and E2F1 on their target gene promoters and negatively regulates gene transcription (21Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V. Frohme C. Beul D. Hillukkala T. Syvaoja J. Saluz H.P. Haenel F. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 22Liu K.

TopBP1 homologues such as Cut5/Rad4 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Dpb11 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus101 in Drosophila, and Xcut5/Xmus101 in Xenopus are all known to be required for DNA replication and S phase progression in a normal cell cycle as well as DNA damage response. In both fission yeast and Drosophila, their cut5/mus101 mutants show a block in DNA synthesis (19Yamamoto R.R. Axton J.M. Yamamoto Y. Saunders R.D. Glover D.M. Henderson D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Saka Y. Yanagida M. Cell. 1993; 74: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Dpb11 in budding yeast physically interacts with DNA polymerase ɛ (DNA pol-ɛ) and loaded onto replication origins together in a complex, which is required for recruitment of DNA polymerase α (24Masumoto H. Sugino A. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Xenopus Xcut5, also referred to as Xmus101, is required for recruiting Cdc45 to chromatin (25Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. J.

Chromosoma. 2004; 113: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In human cells, however, the role of TopBP1 in DNA replication or S phase progression has yet to be determined; only the physical interaction between TopBP1 and DNA pol-ɛ implies its involvement in DNA replication (28Makiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I. Westerling T. Makela T.P. Syvaoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30399-30406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that TopBP1 depletion using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) induced G1 arrest via down-regulation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity, by increasing levels of p21 and p27. However, although cyclin E/CDK2 kinase activity was restored by co-depletion of p21 and p27 with TopBP1, cells still could not progress into S phase due to a defect in pre-IC formation. Therefore our results suggest a sequential mode of TopBP1 function during G1/S transition: one for activating cyclin E/CDK2 kinase and the other for loading replication components onto chromatin to initiate DNA synthesis. Cell Culture and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—U2OS and Saos-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Highly confluent cultures promote p27 accumulation, especially in Saos2 cells; therefore, final confluency of all cultured samples was maintained at less than 80%. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry with standard propidium iodide staining methods. siRNA Transfection—siRNA oligonucleotides (Samchully Pharm Co.) were synthesized to the following target sequences: TopBP1 #1, ACCGUCGUUACACCUUUAG; TopBP1 #2, ACCGAGUACGCCACUCUCA; p21, CCAGCATGACAGATTTCTA; p27, CGACGATTCTTCTACTCAA; control siRNA, CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGATT (GL3). Cells were transfected with siRNAs at a final concentration of 240 μm using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Transfections were performed up to three times at 24-h intervals for TopBP1 depletion, while one transfection was enough for both p21 and p27 depletion, and this depleted state lasted for 72 h. Thus, for co-depletion with TopBP1, p21 and/or p27 RNAi was performed once at 24 h with the second transfection of TopBP1 siRNA, at which point both p21 and p27 levels have yet to increase in response to TopBP1 depletion. Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—Anti-TopBP1 polyclonal antibody was raised against the TopBP1 fragment corresponding to amino acids 1019–1167. Anti-Rb and anti-DNA pol-ɛ antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma), anti-cyclin D1 antibody (NeoMarkers), anti-MCM2 (Abcam Inc.), and antibodies to phospho-Chk1 (Ser317) and phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) (Cell Signaling) were purchased from the indicated companies. All remaining antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were treated with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors) for 1 h on a rotator at 4 °C. 100–400 μg of lysates was immunoprecipitated for 1.5 h with anti-cyclin E and -Cdc7 antibodies immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase assays with the immunoprecipitates were performed as described previously (29Ukomadu C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43586-43594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Sato N. Sato M. Nakayama M. Saitoh R. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Anti-Cdc7 antibody and GST-MCM2 (carrying N-terminal 60 amino acid residues) used as a substrate for the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase assay were kind gifts from Dr. Joon-Kyu Lee (Seoul National University). Immunostaining—Cells grown on coverslips were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in CSK buffer (supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors) for 5 min at 4 °C, followed by 15 min of methanol fixation at -20 °C. For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining, cells on coverslips were incubated with 15 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 24 h. After fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for another 15 min. Anti-BrdUrd antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was supplemented with 1 unit/μl micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) and 20 mm CaCl2 before use. For all immunostaining experiments, primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and coverslips were mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories) containing 1 μg/ml DAPI. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from RNAi-treated samples using Trizol (Invitrogen), and 20 μg of each sample was subjected to Northern blotting. Full-length cDNA of p27 or a PCR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 141–492 of the p21 cDNA sequence was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as a probe. Promoter-Luciferase Assay—p21 and p27 promoter regions between -2 kb to +1 were amplified from PAC/BAC clones of RP3–431A14 and RP11–180M15 (BACPAC Resources Center, Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute), respectively, followed by cloning into NheI/HindIII site of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Cells were transfected with both pCMV-lacZ plasmid and a promoter construct in the ratio of 1:5, which was performed using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 60 h after the transfection. TopBP1-depleted Cells Are Arrested in G1 Phase—To address the role of human TopBP1 during cell cycle progression, we investigated the consequences of loss of TopBP1 function using RNAi method. Six different siRNA oligonucleotides, each targeting a unique sequence of TopBP1 mRNA, were tested for TopBP1 knockdown using GL3 siRNA as a control. U2OS cells were transfected up to three times with the siRNAs at 24-h intervals and harvested at the indicated times (Fig. 1A). TopBP1 protein levels began to decrease after 48 h, and most of TopBP1 was eliminated by 72 h after the first transfection. This depletion lasted for at least 96 h (Fig. 1B). All of the TopBP1 siRNAs efficiently depleted the target protein, and #1 and #2 were used for the remaining experiments (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1A). Cell cycle profiles of siRNA-treated cells were determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). Compared with the control, TopBP1-depleted cells exhibited an increase in G1 phase cells, while G2/M and S phase populations were relatively decreased. We also observed a considerable increase in the number of floating cells with TopBP1 RNAi. This is consistent with the larger sub-G1 populations present in TopBP1 siRNA-treated cells when we used both floating and attached cells for analyses, suggesting a fraction of TopBP1-deficient cells underwent apoptosis as reported previously (13Yamane K. Chen J. Kinsella T.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3049-3053PubMed Google Scholar, 22Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since the sub-G1 populations in both #1 and #2 TopBP1 siRNA-treated cells were not more than 24% until 96 h, we excluded floating cells and focused on non-apoptotic cells in the following experiments. To confirm the cell cycle effects of TopBP1 depletion, cells were synchronized after siRNA transfection using thymidine (Fig. 2, A and B). Following incubation with thymidine, both control and TopBP1-deficient cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary with 2 n DNA content. However, when cells were released into fresh media, a significant portion of TopBP1-depleted cells retained 2 n DNA content, whereas control cells progressed into S phase. Similarly, a significant population of TopBP1-deficient cells remained in G1 phase in the presence of nocodazole, whereas the control cells arrested in M phase. Therefore our results indicate that TopBP1 depletion causes accumulation of G1-arrested cells. We also obtained similar results using four additional independent TopBP1 siRNAs (supplemental Fig. 1). The levels of cyclins after TopBP1 RNAi were examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). Cyclins E, A, and B are all expressed in a cell-cycle dependent manner, but their expression patterns are distinct from one another; cyclin E protein is maximal at the G1/S transition, while cyclin A and B are expressed during S and M phase, respectively. Cyclin D level is relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, with the exception that it is not expressed in quiescent (G0) cells (31Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 126-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). With TopBP1 depletion, no significant changes were observed in the cyclin D levels indicating cells were still in a proliferating state. TopBP1-depleted cells showed an increase in cyclin E accompanied with a decrease in cyclin A and B, even following nocodazole treatment. Considering that cyclin E is degraded in S phase (8Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), these results suggest that TopBP1-deficient cells failed to progress into S phase resulting in the accumulation of cyclin E. The observed decrease in both cyclin A and B with TopBP1 depletion is also consistent with arrest prior to S phase. As a result we narrowed down the cell cycle arrest point of TopBP1 depletion to late G1 phase. To further confirm the cell cycle arrest in G1, DNA replication was measured by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2D). Incubating control cells with BrdUrd for 24 h resulted in the majority of cells (92%) staining positive for BrdUrd incorporation as this was sufficient time for cells to undergo a complete cell cycle. In contrast, BrdUrd incorporation in TopBP1-depleted cells was less than 30% of control cells further supporting the conclusion that TopBP1-deficient cells fail to enter S phase. We also examined the levels of pre-RC subunits and geminin (supplemental Fig. 2). Although most pre-RC subunit levels were not changed by TopBP1 RNAi, the amount of phospho-MCM2 (MCM2-P) decreased significantly, indicating that pre-RC is still inactive in TopBP1-deficient cells (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 7Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). On the other hand, geminin was greatly reduced after TopBP1 depletion. This is quite distinct from the double-thymidine block sample (2-Thy) of which geminin level was unchanged (or slightly increased) but Cdt1 has already been degraded. Considered that both geminin accumulation and Cdt1 degradation begin with S phase entry (32McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 33Zhong W. Feng H. Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T. Nature. 2003; 423: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the results are again suggesting that the lack of TopBP1 causes the G1 arrest. Taken together, these data show that TopBP1 depletion results in accumulation of cells with 2 n DNA, increased protein levels of cyclin E, reduced incorporation of BrdUrd, and the low levels of geminin and phospho-MCM2. Therefore, we conclude that cells cannot progress into S phase in the absence of TopBP1 but instead arrest in late G1 phase. The G1 Arrest Caused by TopBP1 Depletion Independent of Both p53 and pRb—p53 and pRb are two well characterized regulators of cell cycle progression. In response to multiple stresses that promote genome instability during the cell cycle, these two proteins induce various signal-transduction pathways, which results in either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (34Harris S.L. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 35Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Since the U2OS cell line in which the G1 arrest occurred upon TopBP1 depletion is both pRb- and p53-positive, we next examined whether the G1 arrest was mediated through either p53 or pRb using different cell lines. Saos-2 is also an osteosarcoma-derived cell line like U2OS but lacks both pRb and p53. When depleted of TopBP1, Saos-2 cells remained in the 2 n state by flow cytometry analyses even when treated with nocodazole or released from a thymidine block. These G1 arrest profiles were even more pronounced than observed in U2OS cells (Fig. 3). Similar results were also obtained using HeLa cells, another pRb- and p53-negative cell line (data not shown). Our results indicate that the G1 arrest following TopBP1 depletion is independent of p53 and pRb. TopBP1 Depletion Reduces Cyclin E/CDK2 Activity by Increasing Levels of p21 and p27—The kinase activity of cyclin E/CDK2 peaks at the G1/S transition and is critical for promoting S phase. Despite having high levels of cyclin E/CDK2 protein, most TopBP1-deficient cells failed to enter S phase. Therefore we were interested in determining whether the activity of cyclin E/CDK2 was affected. We first assessed cyclin E/CDK2 activity by examining the extent of pRb phosphorylation. TopBP1-depleted U2OS cells showed hypophosphorylated pRb in comparison with control cells, indicating reduced cyclin E/CDK2 activity with TopBP1 depletion (Fig. 4A). To measure cyclin E/CDK2 activity directly, in vitro kinase assays were also performed (Fig. 4B). Since cyclin E protein is increased following TopBP1 depletion (Fig. 2C), immunoprecipitation using anti-cyclin E antibody resulted in more immunoprecipitated cyclin E/CDK2 complexes from the extract of TopBP1-deficient cells compared with the control. However, despite the increased cyclin E/CDK2 protein, the kinase activities in TopBP1-depleted U2OS and Saos-2 cells were three to four times lower than the control sample (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we hypothesized that TopBP1 depletion down-regulates cyclin E/CDK2 activity thereby preventing cells from progressing into S phase. The decreased activity also explains the accumulation of cyclin E, since autophosphorylation is required for its degradation via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (2Hwang H.C. Clurman B.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of decreased cyclin E/CDK2 activity in TopBP1-depleted cells, we examined several candidate regulators of CDKs. A number of checkpoint pathways activated by various genomic stresses are reported to target cyclin E/CDK2 and arrest cells in G1 phase, most of which are mediated by Chk1 and Chk2 (36Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 37Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 38Uto K. Inoue D. Shimuta K. Nakajo N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3386-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When TopBP1 was depleted, however, neither phospho-Chk1 nor phospho-Chk2 was detected in both U2OS and Saos-2 cells, whereas hydroxyurea and γ-irradiation treatments demonstrated robust phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2. Instead, we observed a dramatic induction of two CDK inhibitors, p21 and p27, in TopBP1-depleted U2OS and Saos-2 cells (Fig. 5A). Time course analyses revealed that the protein levels of p21 and p27 became elevated by 48 h, and this induced state lasted until the 96 h time point (Fig. 5B). Consistent with these results, cyclin E/CDK2 kinase activity began to decrease at 48 h and was further reduced by 96 h. To validate the involvement of p21 and p27 in down-regulation of cyclin E/CDK2 after TopBP1 depletion, the interaction between these CDK inhibitors and cyclin E/CDK2 was examined by immunoprecipitation using anti-cyclin E antibody (Fig. 5C). The amount of co-immunoprecipitated p21 and p27 was significantly increased with TopBP1 depletion compared with that of co-immunoprecipitated CDK2. These results indicate that the up-regulated p21 and p27 indeed interact with cyclin E/CDK2 and inhibit its action in the absence of TopBP1. p21 and p27 Are Induced by Different Mechanisms in the Absence of TopBP1—To investigate the mechanism of p21 and p27 up-regulation following TopBP1 RNAi, we first determined whether p21 and p27 are transcriptionally up-regulated. The mRNA levels of p21 and p27 in siRNA-treated cells were determined by Northern blotting (Fig. 6A). Compared with the control cells, p21 mRNA was greatly induced after TopBP1 depletion in both U2OS and Saos-2 cell lines and correlated well with the temporal induction pattern of the protein. On the other hand, there was no significant change in the p27 mRNA level. Transcriptional activation of p21 and p27 promoters in response to TopBP1 depletion was also examined by performing promoter-luciferase assay (Fig. 6B). Consistent with the Northern blotting results, the luciferase activity of p27 promoter in TopBP1-depleted cells was similar to that in control cells, suggesting non-transcriptional regulation of p27. In contrast, p21 promoter showed a 3-fold increase in luciferase activity with TopBP1 RNAi, confirming that p21 is up-regulated by transcriptional activation in response to TopBP1 depletion. TopBP1 Function Is Required Not Only for Cyclin E/CDK2 Action but Also for Pre-IC Assembly Necessary for S Phase Progression—Last, we determined whether depletion of p21 and/or p27 could suppress the G1 arrest caused by the absence of TopBP1. The p21 and p27 siRNAs efficiently depleted corresponding proteins, but the elimination of either p21 or p27 alone only partially restored cyclin E/CDK2 activity in TopBP1-deficient cells. However, co-depletion of both p21 and p27 recovered about 80% of cyclin E/CDK2 activity (Fig. 7, A and B). The elevated protein levels of cyclin E, shown in TopBP1-depleted cells, also returned to the levels seen in control cells by the co-depletion, demonstrating that kinase activity is required for its autophosphorylation and degradation. Flow cytometry analyses were performed to examine the cell cycle progression of these siRNA-treated cells in the presence or absence of nocodazole (Fig. 7C). When TopBP1 is present, elimination of p21 and/or p27 did not affect cell cycle profiles significantly from control cells. In contrast, TopBP1-deficient cells remained primarily arrested in G1 phase. Depletion of p21 or p27 alone could not rescue this G1 arrest, which is consistent with the in vitro kinase assay results showing only partial restoration of cyclin E/CDK2 activity by depletion of one inhibitor. Thus, it was surprising to find that a large population of cells remained arrested in G1 when both p21 and p27 were depleted with TopBP1 despite restoring cyclin E/CDK2 by 80%. Therefore CDK2 kinase activity is not sufficient for G1/S transition in the absence of TopBP1. These results prompted us to consider Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase, another critical factor for G1/S transition. While cyclin E/CDK2 functions globally for transitioning from G1 to S phase, Cdc7/Dbf4 has been reported to act directly in initiation of DNA replication (39Bousset K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 40Donaldson A.D. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence from yeasts to mammals indicate that MCM proteins are the main substrates of Cdc7/Dbf4 during G1/S transition and that MCM phosphorylation is required for recruiting additional replication components, such as Cdc45 and DNA polymerases, onto replication origins (3Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, if Cdc7/Dbf4 activity is also down-regulated by TopBP1 depletion, it could explain how TopBP1/p21/p27 triple-depleted cells remain arrested in G1 phase despite the normal cyclin E/CDK2 activity. To estimate Cdc7/Dbf4 activity, we first examined the phosphorylation of MCM2 protein from siRNA-treated samples (Fig. 8A). Cdc7/Dbf4 phosphorylates a specific residue of MCM2 which increases its mobility on SDS-PAGE (41Montagnoli A. Valsasina B. Brotherton D. Troiani S. Rainoldi S. Tenca P. Molinari A. Santocanale C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10281-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The phospho-MCM2 band (marked with an asterisk) on the SDS-PAGE disappeared in TopBP1-deficient cells, indicating low Cdc7/Dbf4 activity. However, co-depletion of p21 and p27 from TopBP1-depleted cells restored the Cdc7/Dbf4 activity as shown by the normal extent of phospho-MCM2. Furthermore, in vitro kinase assay for Cdc7/Dbf4 activity showed similar results, in which the reduced Cdc7/Dbf4 activity upon TopBP1 depletion was recovered to 60–80% of the control by co-depletion of p21 and p27 (Fig. 8, A and B). Since p21 and p27 are specific inhibitors of CDKs, not of Cdc7, these results suggest that Cdc7/Dbf4 acts after the cyclin E/CDK2 action, which results in the activation of pre-RC by phosphorylating MCM2. To precisely define the point in replication arrested by TopBP1 depletion, next we investigated the loading of two re"

In the first step of partition by the archetypical P1 system, ParB binds a complicated centromere-like site to form a large nucleoprotein segrosome. ParB is a dimeric DNA-binding protein that can bridge between both A-boxes and B-boxes located on the centromere. Its helix-turn-helix domains bind A-boxes and the dimer domain binds B-boxes. Binding of the first ParB dimer nucleates the remaining ParB molecules onto the centromere site, which somehow leads to the formation of a condensed segrosome superstructure. To further understand this unique DNA spreading capability of ParB, we crystallized and determined the structure of a 1:2 ParB-(142–333):A3-B2-box complex to 3.35Å resolution. The structure reveals a remarkable four-way, protein-DNA bridged complex in which both ParB helix-turn-helix domains simultaneously bind adjacent A-boxes and the dimer domain bridges between two B-boxes.

Partition or segregation is the process whereby the genetic material in a cell is accurately moved and positioned to daughter cells during cell division. The segregation of prokaryotic and plasmid DNA is typically mediated by functionally homologous par systems comprising three essential elements, a cis-acting centromere-like (partition) DNA site(s) and the ParA and ParB proteins (1Hayes F.

The P1 plasmid is the prophage of bacteriophage P1 and exists as a stable, autonomously replicating unit (7Prentki P. Chandler M. Caro L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 152: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The P1 par system is encoded by a 2.5-kb region of the plasmid, the par operon, that contains the genes for the ParA (44 kDa) and ParB (38 kDa) proteins and the centromere-like site, also called the partition site parS, which is located downstream of parB (4Funnell B.E.

Biochemical and molecular biological studies compiled to date suggest a P1 partition model that includes several steps. In the first step, ParB binds parS to form the so-called partition complex or segrosome (8Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3616-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bouet J.Y.

A. 1999; 96: 14905-14910Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is believed that pairing between two plasmids occurs next. In this step, interactions between ParB-ParB and ParB-DNA would lead to a “trans” segrosome complex to mediate this pairing event (12Edgar R. Chattoraj D.K. Yarmolinsky M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). P1 ParA, a Walker A protein, then binds the partition complex (but only in its ATP-bound conformation) and drives plasmid separation (13Fung E. Bouet J-Y. Funnell B.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4901-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol.

The centromere-like site parS, which is bound by ParB, is a surprisingly complicated DNA-binding site containing four copies of a heptamer sequence called the A-box (with consensus (G/T)TGAAAT) and two copies of a hexamer site, the B-box (with consensus TCGCCA) (9Funnell B.E.

Thus, the parS site can be divided into three main regions, left, central, and right (see Fig. 1A). These left and right portions flank a central region, which is bound by the integration host factor (IHF). 2The abbreviations used are: IHF, integration host factor; HTH, helix-turn-helix; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: IHF, integration host factor; HTH, helix-turn-helix; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. When IHF binds to the central site, it creates a large bend in the DNA (20Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14328-14337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA bending by IHF can be partially replaced by intrinsically bent DNA, indicating that the role of IHF in this complex is just to bring the left and right sides of parS into close proximity, thus allowing ParB to bind the A-box and B-box elements across the bend to each arm (17Hayes F. Austin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, IHF is not absolutely required for P1 partition, and the right side of parS (parS-small), which contains two A-boxes (A2 and A3) and one B-box (B2), can serve as a minimal centromere-like site or ParB nucleation site and is active for partition. However, partition in the absence of IHF is less efficient (20Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14328-14337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once the initial partition complex is formed between a dimer of ParB, IHF and the parS site (termed the “I + B1” complex), the remaining ParB molecules in the cell all appear to load onto and the around the centromere site (∼500 bp on each side), leading to the creation of a large nucleoprotein superstructure known as the segrosome (21Rodionov O. Lobocka M. Yarmolinsky M. Science. 1999; 283: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Rodionov O. Yarmolinsky M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 283: 1215-1223Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the cellular localization of ParB molecules to discrete foci coincident with the segrosome can be visualized by immunofluorescence spectroscopy (11Erdmann N. Petroff T. Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14905-14910Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). P1 ParB is a 333-residue protein that shows only limited sequence homology to other ParB homologues. However, all ParB homologues are modular in their arrangement, consisting of several flexibly attached domains. Indeed, P1 ParB is proteolytically labile and can be digested into multiple fragments (19Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12385-12394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Surtees J.A. Funnell B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5898-5908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of P1 ParB, residues 1–141, is bound by ParA. This region is highly flexible as evidenced by the fact that limited exposure of ParB to proteases leads to rapid degradation of this part of the protein (23Surtees J.A. Funnell B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5898-5908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A relatively stable P1 ParB proteolytic fragment that remains after tryptic digestion corresponds to residues 142–333. It has been shown that this region of ParB, called ParB-(142–333), contains all of the determinants required for parS binding and partition complex formation (19Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12385-12394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our recent crystal structures of ParB-(142–333), bound to the minimal centromere parS-small, revealed novel and unexpected DNA-binding characteristics of ParB that suggest how it can bind the complicated parS centromere-like site (24Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E.

Specifically, the structures showed that ParB-(142–333) forms an asymmetric dimer with extended N-terminal HTH domains that interact with the parS A-box elements. The two HTH domains emanate from a dimerized dimer domain that contacts the B-box motifs. The dimer domain consists of three β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix, which in the dimer combine to form a six-stranded β-sheet coiled coil. The HTH domain and dimer domain are linked by a short and highly flexible linker (residues 271–274) that permits essentially free rotation of the domains, thus explaining the ability of ParB to interact with box elements arranged in a variety of orientations, as found in parS. The structures, which showed that ParB can act as a bridging factor, indicated how ParB may bind across the bent full-length parS site and aid in plasmid pairing. A poorly understood but critical aspect of the partition process is the creation, by ParB-DNA interactions, of a large condensed DNA superstructure called the segrosome. Formation of this complex involves the nucleation of the thousands of ParB molecules in the cell onto the DNA near and around the centromere-like site. Previous models had suggested that contacts between ParB and the two parS B-boxes would likely be important in the formation of solenoid-like partition complexes and would also likely play a role in the ability of ParB to spread onto DNA to form large nucleoprotein superstructures (19Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12385-12394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although, the ParB-(142–333)-parS-small structures revealed DNA bridging between two A-boxes and between an A-box and a B-box, a “double B-box interaction” was not observed (24Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A model of the ParB-(142–333) dimer domain bound to two B-boxes showed a very close approach of the two DNA molecules, suggesting that this DNA-binding motif may only be capable of an interaction with a single B-box. Alternatively, such an interaction may be possible, but it was not observed in our ParB-parS-small structures due to the 2:1 stoichiometry of ParB dimer to B-box in these complexes (24Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether ParB can bind two B-boxes simultaneously and gain further insight into the mechanism of P1 segrosome formation, we crystallized and determined the structure of a complex of ParB-(142–333) bound to a 16-mer DNA site corresponding to the A3-B2 right side region of full-length parS in a ratio of one ParB-(142–333) dimer to two DNA duplexes. The structure shows that, as in the previous structure, the ParB HTH domains interact simultaneously with two A-boxes located on two different DNA duplexes. However, in this structure, each face of the ParB dimer domain contacts a separate B-box from distinct DNA duplexes. This dimer domain-double B-box interaction represents a new type of protein-nucleic acid interaction and suggests a mechanism for how ParB may form condensed nucleoprotein complexes. Specifically, the structure shows that this bridging interaction juxtaposes the two bound DNA molecules in very close proximity and at sharp angles relative to each other. This remarkably tight bridging structure suggests a model for how ParB may wrap the DNA around itself to form the solenoid-like nucleoprotein superstructures that have been suggested to be important in partition (19Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12385-12394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This unique multibridging feature of a protein-DNA complex observed in the ParB-16-mer structure may also serve as a model in understanding higher order protein-nucleic acid superstructures relevant to chromatin structure in higher organisms. Crystallization and Data Collection—To crystallize a ParB dimer bound simultaneously to two A-boxes and two B-boxes, we utilized several oligonucleotides that encompass the right-most side of parS, which contains one A-box (A3) and one B-box (B2). We mixed these oligonucleotides with the ParB-(142–333) dimer at a ratio of 2 DNA duplexes to 1 ParB-(142–333) dimer. Based on modeling, we predicted that the packing may be improved by the closer approach of the dimer domain-double B-box interaction compared with our previous crystallization studies with ParB and parS-small oligonucleotides. Indeed, after crystallization trials with 35 such duplexes, we obtained 20 different crystal forms, one of which diffracted to beyond 3.5 Å resolution. These crystals were grown by combining ParB-(142–333) with the blunt 16-mer, 5′-CGTGAAATCGCCACGA-3′ (see Fig. 1A) in a 1:2 stoichiometry and mixing equal volumes of the macromolecular solution with a reservoir consisting of 7% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, and 15 mm MgCl2. These crystals are trigonal: P3121, a = b = 144.4 Å, c = 78.8 Å. For cryoprotection, glycerol was added to the drop to a final concentration of ∼20%, and the crystals were flash frozen in a nitrogen cryostream. Data for both a selenomethionine-ParB-(142–333)-16-mer crystal and a native crystal were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) Beamline 8.2.1 at 100 K, processed with MOSFLM and scaled with SCALA. Structure Determination and Refinement—To determine the structure of the ParB-16-mer complex by molecular replacement, the individual DNA-binding modules from the 2.98-Å resolution ParB-DNA structure (24Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were broken into separate search models and used in the program Evolutionary Programming for Molecular Replacement (EPMR) (25Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). We started with the HTH domain-A-box search model. After EPMR correctly positioned this fragment, it was used as a static model to start a second EPMR search for a second HTH domain-A-box complex. After both HTH domain-A-box complexes were located, they served as a static starting model, and the dimer domain fragment was located again using EPMR. The crystallographic asymmetric unit consists of one ParB-(142–333) dimer and two 16-mers, and when all three solutions were combined and the two B-boxes were located (in difference Fourier maps), the DNA formed the two continuous 16-mer DNA sites. The model was subjected to rigid body refinement (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Crosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The correctness of the model was further confirmed by utilizing phases derived from multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data obtained from a selenomethionine-ParB-(142–333)-16-mer crystal (Table 1). Briefly, the positions of the selenomethionines were first obtained from the molecular replacement model (after several rounds of refinement with multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data) (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Crosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The selenium positions were then used for phases, and after density modification, an improved electron density map was calculated. This unbiased map was used to rebuild short regions of the model and also revealed density for N- and C-terminal residues, not present in the original model, for one ParB subunit. This final model was then refined by simulated annealing and xyz refinement in CNS resulting in an Rfree of 33.6% to 3.35 Å resolution (Table 1) (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The final model contains one ParB dimer (residues 144–270:275–332 of one subunit and 150–269:275–326 of the other subunit) and all 16 bp of both parS-16-mer duplexes and shows excellent stereochemistry (28Laskowski R.A.

Samples were excited at 490 nm, and fluorescence emission was measured at 520 nm.A5′-fluoresceinated parS-small deoxy-oligonucleotide duplex (F-ATTTCAAGGTGAAATCGCCA, where F = 5′-fluorescein label) was used in the binding studies, which were carried out by titrating either the ParB-(142–333) wild-type protein or mutants (K287A, R298A, and R306A) into a 0.990-ml reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5% glycerol) containing 1 nm fluoresceinated DNA. The resulting data were fit to a simple bimolecular binding model by nonlinear regression (29Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Plasmid Stability Assays—Wild-type and plasmid stability assay was used to test the ability of the ParB-(142–333) mutant proteins, R298A and R306A, to stabilize the pBEF246 mini-P1 plasmid, which is deleted for parOP, parA, and parB but retains parS. In this assay, ParA and ParB are provided in trans from the plasmid pEF5 and the parA and parB genes under the control of the β-lactamase promoter called blaP1 (13Fung E. Bouet J-Y. Funnell B.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4901-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Vector pBR322 is used as a control. The C-terminal regions of the ParB-(142–333) mutants were swapped into pEF5 to place them in the context of the full-length protein, and the resulting mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The stability assay was that reported by Fung et al. (13Fung E. Bouet J-Y. Funnell B.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4901-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh colonies of DH5 containing pEF5 or pBR322 and pBEF246 were grown for several generations in LB medium with ampicillin and chloramphenicol and then diluted several thousand-fold into medium containing only ampicillin and allowed to grow overnight. The cultures were sampled at the beginning and the end of the growth in ampicillin medium by plating on LB/amp plates. The colonies were then transferred by toothpicks onto medium with chloramphenicol to see whether the original cells contained pBEF246. The retention values reported are percentages of cells with mini-P1 at the end compared with the beginning (over ∼18–20 generations). The data reported are the average of three experiments. Overall Structure of ParB-(142–333)-16-Mer parS Site—To obtain a structure of a ParB-(142–333) dimer bound simultaneously to two B-boxes and two A-boxes, we crystallized ParB-(142–333) dimer:DNA in a ratio of 1:2 using a 16-mer DNA site containing one A-box and one B-box based on the parS-small A3–B2 region and solved the structure by molecular replacement (Fig. 1A). Because previous ParB-DNA structures revealed that the DNA-binding domains are flexibly attached, the individual domains and their bound DNA sites were used separately as search models in molecular replacement (see “Experimental Procedures”). After the two HTH domain-A-box fragments and the dimer domain were located, refinement commenced. After minimal positional refinement, a difference Fourier revealed clear density for the bound B-boxes, which are bound by both “faces” of the dimer domain. The tracing was also aided by phases obtained from multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data collected on a crystal grown using selenomethionine-substituted ParB-(142–333). This experimental map also revealed clear density for both B-boxes in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, consistent with the initial difference Fourier map. Thus, the crystallographic asymmetric unit consists of one ParB-(142–333) dimer and two 16-mer DNA duplexes in which the A-boxes of each site are bound by an HTH domain from each ParB-(142–333) subunit and where the B-box motifs are each bound to one side or face of the dimerized dimer domain (Fig. 1B). ParB-A-box Interactions—The HTH domain of ParB is solely responsible for mediating contacts with the A-box. The majority of the contacts are provided by the residues from the HTH-motif, which is composed of α2–α3 (residues 168–189). Comparisons of the HTH motif of ParB to HTH motifs found in other proteins reveal that the ParB HTH is essentially a canonical prokaryotic HTH motif, in that it docks onto the DNA such that the N-terminal region of the recognition helix α3 is inserted into the major groove. Interestingly, most of the thirteen contacts made by the HTH domain to the A-box are to the phosphate backbone. These phosphate contacts are tightly clustered on either side of the A-box, thus permitting precise docking of the domain onto the DNA (Fig. 2A). The side chains of Thr-183 and Arg-184 from the recognition helix provide the only two base interactions. However, only the contact from Arg-184, which is to G(4) appears specific. Three residues outside the HTH motif contribute to the anchoring phosphate contacts at either end of the DNA site. The side chain of Lys-162 from the C terminus of α1 contacts phosphate 8′, and the side chain of Thr-206 and the amide nitrogen of Phe-207, both from the N terminus of α4, interact with phosphate group 1 (see Fig. 2). The only structure that shows some homology to P1 ParB is that of KorB, the ParB homologue from plasmid RP4 (30Khare D. Ziegelin G. Lanka E. Heinemann U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This structure includes only the HTH-containing DNA-binding domain, and the dimer domain of KorB does not interact with DNA. KorB recognizes a centromere-like site, consisting of 12 different 13-bp inverted repeats, which is very different from the P1 centromere parS. The structure of the KorB DNA-binding domain was solved bound to a 17-bp DNA site containing one centromere-like repeat (30Khare D. Ziegelin G. Lanka E. Heinemann U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Comparison of P1 ParB-(142–333) with the KorB DNA-binding domain structures reveals that three helices from the HTH domain, including the two helices of the HTH, are structurally conserved between these proteins (24Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Khare D. Ziegelin G. Lanka E. Heinemann U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C-α atoms of residues from these helices, corresponding to α1–α3 of P1 ParB, superimpose with the root mean squared deviation of 1.3 Å. Outside these helices, however, there are no structural homologies between the two proteins. Moreover, the HTH domains of each protein recognize their cognate DNA sites in very different manners. Specifically, the only base contacts observed in the P1 ParB HTH-A-box interaction are provided by residues from the recognition helix. In contrast, KorB utilizes residues outside its recognition helix, namely Thr-211 and Arg-240, to specify bases in its DNA site. Also distinct from the P1 ParB HTH-A-box interaction, these base contacts ensure high specificity in the KorB-operator interaction (30Khare D. Ziegelin G. Lanka E. Heinemann U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the HTH of related ParB-like proteins may be conserved structurally, it appears that the motif will likely interact in unique manners with its respective cognate DNA site in each case. This suggests a partial explanation for how related ParB-like proteins with apparently structurally similar HTH domains can recognize such remarkably diverse DNA sites. Also contributing to diversity are additional DNA-binding regions, such as the dimer domain of ParB (see below). The DNA bound by KorB appears mostly B-DNA in nature. Interestingly, the P1 ParB-bound A-box, which is A/T-rich, displays a distinctly narrowed minor groove (3 Å width compare with 6 Å for B-DNA). Because narrow minor grooves are a characteristic of DNA A/T tracts, indirect readout may play a role in the ParB interaction with the A/T-rich A-box (31Vlieghe D. Tuekenburdg J.P. VanMeervelt L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In that regard, it is notable that the DNA surrounding the parS site is extremely A/T-rich. These combined findings su"

All XLAS alloantibodies recognized conformational epitopes in the NC1 domain of α5(IV) collagen, which were mapped using chimeric α1/α5 NC1 domains expressed in mammalian cells. Allograft-eluted alloantibodies mainly targeted two conformational alloepitopes mapping to α5NC1 residues 1-45 and 114-168. These regions also encompassed the major epitopes of circulating XLAS alloantibodies, which in some patients additionally targeted α5NC1 residues 169-229.

Glomerulonephritis is an important cause of renal injury leading to end-stage kidney failure.

Although anti-GBM antibody nephritis can be triggered by either autoimmune or alloimmune mechanisms, both autoantibodies and alloantibodies target the α3α4α5(IV) collagen network of the GBM, producing similar pathology findings and clinical presentations (1Borza D.B. Hudson B.G. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 2003; 24: 345-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Studies of the epitopes targeted by anti-GBM antibodies and their relationship to the tertiary and quaternary structures of the antigen can provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms at the molecular level. For instance, most patients with autoimmune anti-GBM nephritis and its variant, Goodpasture disease, have circulating autoantibodies targeting two conformational epitopes, EA and EB, within the non-collagenous (NC1) domain of α3(IV) collagen (2Netzer K.O.

These autoepitopes are structurally sequestered (cryptic) in the GBM by quaternary interactions among NC1 domains (3Borza D.B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

In the α3α4α5 NC1 hexamer found in the GBM, the accessibility of the α3NC1 auto-epitopes is limited by their proximity to the α4NC1 and α5NC1 subunits (5Borza D.B. Bondar O. Todd P. Sundaramoorthy M.

Abnormal exposure of these cryptic epitopes by putative pathogenic factors has been postulated to circumvent immune self-tolerance to α3(IV) collagen, inducing autoantibodies and autoimmune glomerulonephritis. Anti-GBM alloantibodies also target the NC1 domains of α3α4α5(IV) collagen but are elicited by a distinct mechanism, an alloimmune reaction to “foreign” collagen IV chains in the renal allograft of transplanted Alport patients. In these patients, mutations in the COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes (in autosomal recessive Alport syndrome) or in the COL4A5 gene (in X-linked Alport syndrome, XLAS) prevent the normal assembly of α3α4α5(IV) collagen in the GBM (6Hudson B.G. Tryggvason K. Sundaramoorthy M. Neilson E.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2543-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), causing progressive glomerulonephritis and eventually end-stage renal failure. Among patients receiving a kidney transplant, about 3-5% develop Alport post-transplant nephritis mediated by anti-GBM alloantibodies, a serious complication resulting in allograft loss in the majority (∼88%) of cases (7Kashtan C.E.

Thus far, the alloantigenic sites recognized by XLAS alloantibodies have not been identified, although the majority of cases of post-transplant nephritis occur in patients with XLAS, the most common form of Alport syndrome (∼85% cases). The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the major alloantigenic sites of α3α4α5(IV) collagen in XLAS patients with post-transplant anti-GBM nephritis. Using newly engineered chimeric α1/α5 NC1 domains, two immunodominant conformational alloepitopes within the NC1 domain of α5(IV) collagen were identified as major targets of kidney-bound and circulating XLAS alloantibodies. The accessibility of the XLAS alloepitopes within the α3α4α5 NC1 hexamers of human GBM, contrasting with the crypticity of autoepitopes, implicates distinct molecular forms of the antigen as initiators of the pathogenic process in alloimmune versus autoimmune anti-GBM disease. Patients—All alloantibodies characterized in this work were from transplanted male XLAS patients with clinically proven Alport post-transplant nephritis (APTN). Patient APTN-1 had hearing loss and developed end-stage kidney disease at age 20; acid-eluted alloantibodies were available from the fourth allograft. From patient APTN-2 (same as “AS-I” in Ref. 13Hudson B.G. Kalluri R. Gunwar S. Weber M. Ballester F. Hudson J.K. Noelken M.E. Sarras M. Richardson W.R. Saus J. Abrahamson D.R. Glick A.D.

Pieces of the allograft were thawed, homogenized, and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and GBM-bound alloantibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine at pH 2.8 and 2.2. The acid eluates were pooled and neutralized with Tris buffer, pH 8.0. By SDS-PAGE analysis, the wash fraction contained plasma proteins (albumin, IgG) trapped in the blood vessels of the renal allograft, including alloantibodies not bound to the allograft GBM. Alloantibodies in the wash fraction had distinct properties from those eluted at low pH, likely representative of the circulating alloantibodies of this patient. From patient APTN-3 (same as “patient c” in Ref. 9Brainwood D. Kashtan C. Gubler M.C. Turner A.N.

Serum positive for anti-GBM alloantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence was available from patient APTN-4, who developed proteinuria and hematuria at 35 days after transplantation; the initial biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis, and linear IgG along the allograft GBM was found at 4 and 7 months post-transplant (14Gluckman J.C.

Recombinant human NC1 monomers were expressed in human 293 cells (16Sado Y. Boutaud A. Kagawa M. Naito I. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G.

DNA Constructs—The cDNAs for human α1NC1 and α5NC1 were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) for its low error rate. The α1NC1 cDNA was subcloned with the 5′ end into the NheI and the 3′ end into the SacII site of a pRC-X expression vector containing the BM40 signal peptide and FLAG peptide (2Netzer K.O.

The α5NC1 cDNA was ligated into the NheI and ApaI sites of the same vector. Because α1NC1 cDNA contained unique restriction sites for ApaI and NarI and α5NC1 cDNA for KpnI (see Fig. 1), cleavage sites for these restriction enzymes and for XbaI were introduced at the appropriate positions into the α1NC1 or α5NC1 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using the primers listed in Table 1. Segments of α5NC1 cDNA between consecutive restriction sites were ligated into the respective sites of the α1NC1 cDNA. Restriction enzymes and ligases were purchased from New England Biolabs. All cDNAs in pBluescript SK-vector were sequenced to verify the sequence of each construct and then subcloned into pRC-X expression vector.TABLE 1Primers used in PCR amplification reactionsChimeraPrimerSequence 5′ to 3′ direction5111A1 Faga ccc aag ctt ctg cct gcc gcc tB1 Rcag gtc tag acc gtg ggc tct ttt att tcc tA2 Fatt atc tag act tgg gca cgg ccg gca gctB2 Rcag cga gct cta gca ttt agg1511A3 Fata aaa ggg ccc acg gtc aag actB3 Ragt tgg cgc ctc aca tac tgc aca tcg act a1151A4 Fata agg cgc cag ctg tgg tga tcg cag ttc aB4 Rgta tcc gcg gtg tcc tct tca tgc aca ctt gA5 Fggc cgt ggt acc tgc aat tac tacB5 Rgta tcc gcg gtg ttc ttc tca tac aga ctt g1115A6 Ftaa tac gac tca cta tag ggB6 Raca ggt acc acg gcc gtg aca ctc Open table in a new tab Cell Transfection and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells were cultured in 90-mm cell culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For each construct, 4 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation into 70% confluent HEK 293 cells. After 2 days, transfected cells were seeded onto a new plate and selected with 250 μg/ml G418. Resistant cells were screened for expression of recombinant proteins by Western blot using anti-FLAG mAb M2. After G418-resistant cells reached confluence, culture supernatants were collected every 2 days. Recombinant proteins were affinity-purified on immobilized anti-FLAG M2 mAb columns, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored frozen in aliquots. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 4-20% gradient gels under non-reducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transfer to Immobilon P membranes for Western blotting with antibodies to FLAG or α1-α6 NC1 domains. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA)—Indirect ELISA was performed in 96-well plastic plates (Nunc-Immuno) coated overnight with purified antigens (100 ng/well) in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, the antigen was reduced prior to coating by treatment with 50 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride for 10 min at 60 °C. Binding of human IgG or mouse mAbs to the immobilized antigens was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies to human or mouse IgG. Hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was monitored at 405 nm using a SpectraMax 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices). For inhibition ELISA, alloantibodies were preincubated overnight at room temperature with various concentrations of NC1 antigens before measuring binding to immobilized α5NC1 or chimeras. Capture ELISA was adapted from Ref. 4Borza D.B. Bondar O. Colon S. Todd P. Sado Y. Neilson E.G. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27147-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, using different pairs of capture and detecting antibodies. NC1 hexamers from human kidney cortex (1 μg), native or dissociated by brief exposure to low pH, were incubated in wells precoated with 300 ng of mAb 8D1 (recognizing α3NC1 epitopes accessible in NC1 hexamers). The binding of human anti-GBM allo- or autoantibodies to captured antigen was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-human IgG. ELISA measurements were performed in duplicate determinations and repeated three times. The results are shown as means and standard deviations. For each alloantibody, the significance of differences in binding to various antigens was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons (versus control α1NC1). For overall comparisons among all alloantibodies, the binding data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Significance was inferred when p was < 0.05. GraphPad Prism version 4.03 was used for all statistical analyses. Anti-GBM Alloantibodies from XLAS Patients with Post-transplant Nephritis Primarily Target Conformational Epitopes within the NC1 Domain of α5(IV) Collagen—Before selecting a strategy for mapping the XLAS alloepitopes, the specificity of alloantibodies for recombinant human NC1 monomers expressed in HEK-293 cells was determined by indirect ELISA (Fig. 1). Allograft-eluted XLAS alloantibodies from patient APTN1 (Fig. 1a) reacted strongly and specifically with α5NC1, whereas those from APTN-2 (Fig. 1b) also exhibited weak binding to α3NC1 and α4NC1 (∼6% relative to α5NC1). Circulating XLAS alloantibodies from all four patients (Fig. 1, c-f) bound to α5NC1, and two patients (APTN-4 and -5) also had alloantibodies to α3NC1. Reduction of disulfide bonds in the reactive NC1 monomers strongly decreased the binding of XLAS alloantibodies from all patients by 50-90% (Fig. 1, solid bars), verifying the conformational requirements of the alloepitopes. For comparison, the binding of Mab5 to α5NC1 was not affected by reduction (less than 3% decrease in reactivity; data not shown), indicating that Mab5 recognizes linear epitopes. An overall comparison among all patients revealed that the binding of XLAS alloantibodies to α5NC1 was significantly higher than that to any other NC1 domain; other differences were not statistically significant. To map the conformational α5NC1 alloepitope(s), a strategy based on chimeric α1/α5 NC1 domains was chosen, analogous to those used for mapping conformational α3NC1 epitopes (2Netzer K.O. Leinonen A.

The α1NC1 was selected as inert scaffolding because it is highly homologous to α5NC1 (∼83% sequence identity) but did not bind XLAS alloantibodies. Expression of Chimeric NC1 Constructs for Mapping Conformational α5NC1 Epitopes—The alignment of α1NC1 and α5NC1 sequences identified 38 different residues (17%) clustered in four regions (Fig. 2A). To identify which of these regions encompass the alloepitopes of XLAS alloantibodies, the α5NC1 domain was divided into four quarters, which were substituted into the α1NC1 scaffold, yielding four chimeras designated “5111,” “1511,” “1151,” and “1115” (Fig. 2B). Recombinant α1/α5 NC1 chimeras containing an amino-terminal FLAG-tag were expressed in human 293 cells for correct folding and purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of α1NC/α5 chimeras. Recombinant α1/α5 chimeras isolated from the culture medium were separated by SDS-PAGE in 4-20% gradient gels under non-reducing conditions and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (A) or transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting with anti-FLAG mAb (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of α5NC1 Regions Containing XLAS Alloepitopes and the Conformational Dependence of Alloantibody Binding—The relative binding of XLAS alloantibodies to α1/α5 NC1 chimeras was determined by indirect ELISA, assigning 100% reactivity to α5NC1 (Fig. 4). Three chimeras exhibited significant reactivity for alloantibodies, but the patterns of specificity varied among patients. Alloantibodies from all but one patient bound to chimera 1151 (α5NC1 residues 114-168), which was the sole target of eluted APTN-1 alloantibodies (Fig. 4a) and a major target of circulating alloantibodies APTN-2, -3, and -4 (Fig. 4, c-e). Chimera 5111 (α5NC1 residues 1-45) reacted most strongly with kidney-eluted APTN-2 (Fig. 4b) and circulating APTN-5 (Fig. 4f) alloantibodies. Circulating alloantibodies from patients APTN-3 and APTN-5 also bound to chimera 1115. The alloantibody binding to any of the three chimeras was abolished after the reduction of disulfide bonds, whereas Mab5 binding to chimera 5111 was not affected (see supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that all immunoreactive chimeras harbor conformational XLAS alloepitopes. Analysis of XLAS Alloantibodies by Inhibition ELISA—In each alloantibody sample, the relative reactivity for distinct α5NC1 alloepitopes was measured by inhibition ELISA (Fig. 5). The inhibition of alloantibody binding to immobilized α5NC1 was determined after incubation with soluble immunoreactive chimeras (5111 and 1151 in most patients), relative to soluble α5NC1. For kidney-eluted APTN-1 alloantibodies (Fig. 5a), inhibition by chimera 1151 was similar to that produced by α5NC1 (93% versus 97% inhibition at 10 μg/ml antigen), indicating that α5NC1 residues 114-168 fully encompass the alloepitope(s). This epitope region was also immunodominant in the serum APTN-4 (Fig. 5d), the binding of which was inhibited 70% by 1151 but only 7% by 5111 (as compared with 84% by α5NC1). For patient APTN-2, whereas circulating alloantibodies (Fig. 5c) were inhibited 30% by 5111 and 39% by 1151, allograft-bound alloantibodies (Fig. 5b) were significantly more reactive toward 5111 (57%) than 1151 (12%). The inhibition by the combined chimeras was less than that by α5NC1 (60% versus 79% for circulating and 63% versus 89% for kidney eluted alloantibodies), indicating that ∼27% of APTN-2 alloantibodies target epitopes spanning two or more α5NC1 regions. Because serum IgG from patient APTN-3 reacted with three α1/α5 chimeras, the existence of alloantibodies targeting three distinct epitopes was verified by reciprocal inhibition. The binding of APTN-3 serum IgG to each of the immobilized chimeras 5111, 1151, and 1115 was fully inhibited only by the same chimera in soluble form, which was as effective as a mixture of all chimeras or the whole α5NC1 (Fig. 5, e-g). The binding of APTN-3 to immobilized α5NC1 (Fig. 5h) was more strongly inhibited by chimera 1151 (46%) than by 5111 (22%) or 1115 (21%). The combined inhibition by all chimeras was 65%, as compared with 90% by α5NC1, indicating that ∼28% of APTN-3 alloantibodies target composite α5NC1 epitopes. Binding of XLAS Alloantibodies to Human NC1 Hexamers and the Accessibility of Alloepitopes in α3α4α5NC1 Hexamers—Differences in epitope specificity between kidney-eluted and circulating alloantibodies, as in patient APTN-2, suggest that subsets of alloantibodies with higher affinity for the native form of the alloantigen are enriched in the allograft GBM. Consistent with this hypothesis, human kidney NC1 hexamers strongly inhibited the binding to immobilized α5NC1 of kidney-eluted alloantibodies (Fig. 6). The binding to α5NC1 of circulating alloantibodies was also inhibited but at higher concentrations of hexamer, indicating lower affinity of interaction. Because NC1 hexamers could inhibit the binding to α5NC1 of kidney-bound and circulating XLAS alloantibodies, the α5NC1 alloepitopes must be accessible in the quaternary structure of the NC1 hexamers. The subsets of NC1 hexamers from human kidney cortex targeted by XLAS alloantibodies were identified by analyzing the composition of NC1 fraction bound or not bound to APTN-1 alloantibody (Fig. 7A). All α3, α4, α5, and α6 NC1 monomers and dimers, along with small amounts of α1NC1 and α2NC1, were found in the alloantibody-bound fraction. The unbound fraction contained only α1NC1 and α2NC1 domains. This result indicates that the alloantibodies bind both α3α4α5 and α1α2α5α6 NC1 hexamers but not α1α2 NC1 hexamers. The reactivity of XLAS alloantibodies with both sets of α5NC1-containing hexamers was also verified by indirect ELISA using affinity-purified human NC1 hexamers (Fig. 7B); for comparison, anti-GBM (Goodpasture) autoantibodies selectively targeted α3α4α5NC1 hexamers. Based on the location of collagen IV networks in normal human kidneys, XLAS alloantibodies bind to α1α2/α5α6(IV) collagen in the Bowman's capsule basement membrane and to α3α4α5(IV) collagen in the GBM of the renal allograft. The accessibility of XLAS alloepitopes in α3α4α5 NC1 hexamers was verified by capture ELISA. To avoid alterations of the quaternary structure by harsh elution conditions, native α3α4α5 NC1 hexamers were purified in situ by using immobilized mAb 8D1, which recognizes accessible α3NC1 epitopes. The relative binding of human anti-GBM allo- and autoantibodies to native α3α4α5 NC1 hexamers or their isolated subunits (generated by acid dissociation) was then compared (Fig. 8). For all patients, XLAS alloantibodies reacted strongly with native α3α4α5NC1 hexamers, demonstrating that the alloepitopes are fully accessible in the hexamer structure. In contrast, anti-GBM autoantibodies bound significantly less to native α3α4α5 hexamers than to dissociated subunits captured by mAb 8D1 (α3NC1 monomers and α3/α5 NC1 dimers), confirming that the autoepitopes are cryptic in the NC1 hexamer. Similar results were obtained by using for capture other mAbs that bind native α3α4α5 NC1 hexamers (not shown). This study identifies for the first time the major alloantigenic sites of α5(IV) collagen, targeted by both kidney-bound and circulating anti-GBM alloantibodies from XLAS patients with post-transplant nephritis. All XLAS alloantibodies characterized in this work reacted predominantly (and some exclusively) with conformational epitopes within the α5NC1 domain. Within the α5NC1 domain, three allo-reactive regions were identified based on the binding of XLAS alloantibodies to α1/α5 NC1 chimeras. All three XLAS alloepitopes were conformation-dependent, as shown by the loss of alloantibody binding to α1/α5 chimeras after the reduction of disulfide bonds. Furthermore, the XLAS alloepitopes were found to be accessible in the native α3α4α5NC1 hexamers, and thus, in the α3α4α5(IV) collagen network occurring in the normal human GBM. In all patients, the immunodominant XLAS alloepitopes were encompassed by chimeras 1151 or 5111 (α5NC1 residues 114-168 and 1-45, respectively). Together, these regions accounted for between 60 and 97% of the α5NC1 immunoreactivity present in kidney-bound and circulating alloantibodies. The alloepitope present in chimera 1151 was exclusively targeted by kidney-bound APTN-1 alloantibodies and a major target of circulating APTN-2, -3, and -4 alloantibodies. The alloepitope present in chimera 5111 was the main target of kidney-eluted APTN-2 and circulating APTN-5 alloantibodies. A third alloepitope found in chimera 1115 (α5NC1 residues 169-229) was a relatively minor target of circulating APTN-3 and -5 alloantibodies, and thus, the pathogenic significance of this region cannot be ascertained. Overall, the epitope specificity of kidney-eluted alloantibodies indicates that two distinct nephri-togenic XLAS alloepitopes must reside within the α5NC1 regions 1-45 and 114-168. Within the two nephritogenic regions of α5NC1, the candidate residues that form the XLAS alloepitopes were identified (Fig. 9). This was achieved by comparing the primary structure of α5NC1 with that of the non-immunoreactive α1NC1 to identify the α5NC1-specific residues followed by an analysis of the accessibility of each residue within the NC1 hexamer by comparison with the x-ray structure of the homologous α1α2 NC1 hexamers (18Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The candidate alloepitope residues are: Asp-3, Thr-15, Ala-17, Gln-22, Leu-25, Gln-26, Glu-20, Val-116, His-129, Gln-132, and Asp-135. Notably, most of these residues clustered in two narrow regions of the α5NC1 domain, residues 15-29 and 125-139, designated EA and EB (Fig. 9), based on their homology to the respective epitope regions of α3NC1 (2Netzer K.O.

A distinctive feature of the XLAS alloepitopes is their accessibility in the α3α4α5 NC1 hexamer. This was demonstrated by three lines of evidence: (a) the ability of human kidney NC1 hexamers to inhibit alloantibody binding to immobilized α5NC1; (b) the complete binding of α3-α6NC1 monomers and dimers to XLAS alloantibodies; and (c) strong reactivity of XLAS alloantibodies with native rather than dissociated α3α4α5NC1 hexamers in capture ELISA. Except for kidney-eluted alloantibodies from one patient, APTN-2 in this study, the accessibility of XLAS alloepitopes in NC1 hexamers has not previously been investigated. A comparison of the properties of the α5NC1 alloepitopes with those of α3NC1 autoepitopes reveals commonalities and distinctions. The immunodominant alloepitopes and auto-epitopes both reside at homologous EA and EB regions. However, the alloepitopes are accessible on the surface of the two known subsets of α3α4α5 hexamers, non-cross-linked and cross-linked, whereas the autoepitopes are sequestered within the cross-linked hexamers (4Borza D.B. Bondar O. Colon S. Todd P. Sado Y. Neilson E.G. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27147-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The contrast between the accessibility of alloepitopes and the crypticity of autoepitopes implicates distinct molecular forms of antigen as initiators of the pathogenic process in anti-GBM disease. In XLAS patients who develop post-transplant nephritis, the likely antigen is the native form of α3α4α5(IV) collagen present in the renal allograft. Because this network is not assembled in the basement membranes of the affected XLAS patients, B cells specific for epitopes within the α3α4α5NC1 hexamers (whether accessible or sequestered in the quaternary structure) cannot undergo deletion, anergy, or receptor editing. In contrast, anti-GBM autoantibodies do not target exposed epitopes in the α3α4α5NC1 hexamer, suggesting that central or peripheral tolerance to this epitope is normally established in the B cell compartment. Autoimmune anti-GBM (or Goodpasture) disease may be triggered if immune self-tolerance to α3(IV) collagen is circumvented by putative pathogenic modifications that expose cryptic auto-epitopes in the NC1 hexamers, for instance by reactive oxygen species (19Kalluri R. Cantley L.G. Kerjaschki D. Neilson E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20027-20032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The repertoire of alloreactive T helper cells in XLAS patients may also shape the specificity of the alloantibody response. Because the defect in the COL4A5 gene that causes the loss of α5(IV) chains also prevents the stable incorporation of α3, α4, and α6(IV) chains in the basement membranes of XLAS patients, it is unlikely that B cells reactive with any of these chains undergo negative selection. However, XLAS alloantibodies consistently target α5NC1 epitopes and only occasionally react with α3NC1, whereas α4NC1 or α6NC1 do not appear to be significant targets. The overall pattern of alloantibody specificity is consistent with the primary defect in the COL4A5 gene, leading to a failure to establish T cell tolerance to the missing α5(IV) collagen chain. However, operational tolerance to α3, α4, and α6(IV) chains may still be established in the T cell compartment because at least some, if not all, of these chains continue to be produced intracellularly (20Heidet L. Cai Y. Guicharnaud L. Antignac C. Gubler M.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1901-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alloantibodies to the α3NC1 domain found in some XLAS patients may be elicited by epitope spreading: for instance, if B cells recognizing α3NC1 epitopes process α3-α5NC1 dimers and present α5NC1 peptides to activated Th cells specific for α5NC1 epitopes. This mechanism is consistent with the observation that XLAS alloantibodies are initially specific for α5NC1 in the early stages of post-transplant nephritis, but then reactivity to α3NC1 arises as the disease progresses (21Browne G. Brown P.A. Tomson C.R. Fleming S. Allen A. Herriot R. Pusey C.D. Rees A.J. Turner A.N. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 675-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Detailed knowledge of the B cell and T cell alloepitopes implicated in the pathogenesis of post-transplant nephritis may facilitate the development of preemptive therapeutic strategies aiming to restore immune tolerance to normal α3α4α5(IV) collagen in X-linked Alport patients prior to a renal transplant. Protocols for inducing immune tolerance are widely used to prevent the production of inhibitory alloantibodies against transfused factor VIII in patients with hemophilia A (22Collins P.W. Haemophilia. 2006; 12: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In principle, similar strategies may be developed to induce tolerance in Alport patients before a kidney transplant. Such therapeutic approaches would be particularly beneficial for Alport patients with a history of post-transplant anti-GBM nephritis, who have a very high risk of disease recurrence in subsequent allografts. The availability of dog and mouse models of Alport syndrome provides the necessary platform for experimental studies seeking to understand how immune tolerance to α3α4α5(IV) collagen can be modulated for therapeutic purposes.

Furthermore, reporter gene assays confirmed that PKCα regulates IFN-β promoter activity, since overexpression of dominant negative PKCα but not PKCβI repressed interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3)-dependent but not NF-κB-mediated promoter activity upon TLR3 engagement in HEK 293 cells. Dominant negative PKCα inhibited IRF-3 transcriptional activity mediated by overexpression of TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β and Tank-binding kinase-1. Additional biochemical analysis demonstrated that Goö6976-treated dendritic cells exhibited IRF-3 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding activity analogous to their control counterparts in response to polyinosine-polycytidylic acid. In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that TLR3-induced cPKC activity is essential for mediating the interaction of IRF-3 but not p65/RelA with the co-activator CREB-binding protein. Furthermore, PKCα knock-down with specific small interfering RNA inhibited IFN-β expression and down-regulated IRF-3-dependent promoter activity, establishing PKCα as a component of TLR3 signaling that regulates IFN-β gene expression by targeting IRF-3-CREB-binding protein interaction. Finally, we analyzed the involvement of cPKCs in other signaling pathways leading to IFN-β synthesis. These experiments revealed that cPKCs play a role in the synthesis of IFN-β induced via both TLR-dependent and -independent pathways.

Promoter region analysis of the Ifnβ gene revealed that PRDII and PRDIV are bound by NF-κB and ATF-2/c-Jun, respectively, and that these elements cooperate with PRDI and PRDIII in the induction of the IFN-β promoter (21Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The PRDI and PRDIII elements were shown to be bound by distinct members of the IRF family with much attention focused on IRF-3, which binds to the PRDIII-I composite site on the IFN-β promoter and is required for IFN-β gene transcription (22Sato M.

PKCs mediate an evolutionarily conserved function in host defense against fungal and bacterial infections from primitive organisms up to mammals (25Spitaler M. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 26Tan S.L. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The PKC family subdivides into three main groups based on the presence or absence of distinct motifs determining co-factor requirements for their activity. Conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) require Ca2+ binding and are activated by diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, whereas novel PKCs (δ, ɛ, and η) do not require Ca2+ but are also diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-sensitive. The last subgroup, atypical PKC (ζ and l/λ) require neither Ca2+ nor diacylglycerol/phorbol esters (27Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 28Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that PKC isoforms regulate several signaling pathways, including innate immune responses induced by microbial products (26Tan S.L. Parker P.J. Biochem.

Specifically, PKCɛ is an essential integrator of LPS-mediated inflammatory cytokine production through activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (29Aksoy E. Amraoui Z. Goriely S.

Med. 2001; 194: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Importantly, PKCɛ-deficient MΦs display defects in clearing both Gram-negative and positive bacterial infections (34Castrillo A. Pennington D.J. Otto F. Parker P.J. Owen M.J. Lisardo B. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although PKC involvement in poly(I:C)-mediated innate responses was previously observed using broad range pharmacological inhibitors (35Gessani S. Di Marzio P. Baglioni C. J. Interferon Res. 1989; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 36Thacore H.R. Lin H.Y. Davis P.J. Schoenl M. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71 (Pt 12): 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), participation of PKC isoforms in poly(I:C)-mediated activation of TLR3 pathway still remains unknown. In this work, we investigated the role of cPKC isoforms in poly(I:C)-induced cytokines, particularly IFN-β and the molecular targets downstream of the TLR3 signaling pathway. Cellular inhibition assays, using a conventional PKC inhibitor, Goö6976, performed in monocyte-derived DCs, HEK 293, and HEK 293 cells stably expressing TLR3 demonstrated that conventional PKC activity is involved in IFN-β gene expression. In support of this observation, we showed that overexpression of dominant negative (DN) PKCα as well as Goö6976 inhibits IRF-3-dependent but not NF-κB-mediated reporter gene activities, correlating with repression of IFN-β promoter activity. Further biochemical analysis revealed an unexpected role for cPKC activity that is essential for mediating IRF-3 association with CBP. Particularly, PKCα knockdown by siRNA in TLR3-293 cells established that PKCα participates in IRF-3-mediated IFN-β gene expression. Finally, our data show that cPKCs play a general role in IFN-β synthesis induced either by TLR-dependent or TLR-independent pathways. Generation of Monocyte-derived DC—DCs were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as described by Romani et al. (37Romani N. Reider D. Heuer M. Ebner S. Kampgen E. Eibl B. Niederwieser D. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 196: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested from healthy volunteers by density centrifugation on Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway), resuspended in culture medium, and allowed to adhere onto 75-cm2 flasks. After 2 h at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were cultured in 20 ml of medium containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (800 units/ml) and IL-4 (100 units/ml). Every 2 days, 800 units of granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor and 100 units of IL-4 were added. After 6 days, nonadherent cells that corresponded to the DC-enriched fraction routinely contained more than 95% DC as assessed by morphologic and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described previously (38Goriely S.

Data are expressed as the mean relative stimulation ± S.D. siRNA Transfection—Duplexed siRNAs targeting human PKCα and GFP, each labeled with 3′ Alexafluor 647, were purchased from Qiagen (KJ Venlo, The Netherlands). HEK 293 cells stably expressing TLR3 were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1.25 × 105. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with the indicated concentrations of PKCα siRNA or control, GFP siRNA using X-treme gene (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 h of incubation, the supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh medium and subsequently stimulated with poly(I:C) (10 μg/ml). The cells were collected after 18 h of stimulation, and the efficiency of PKCα knockdown was assessed by Western blotting. The cell supernatants were analyzed for IFN-β and IL-8 production, as described below. For DNA/RNA co-transfection studies, TLR3-293 cells (1.25 × 105/ml) were transfected with 1 μg of IRF-3-Gal4 reporter plasmid using X-treme gene (Roche Applied Science). 24 h later, PKCα- or GFP-siRNA was added.

HEK 293 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 105/ml. The following day, cells were transfected with 2 μg of synthetic ds-β-DNA, using FuGENE™-6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s specification, for 20 h. IFN-β levels were measured with ELISA kits from BIOSOURCE (Nivelles, Belgium). Quantification of IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α were performed using antibodies from BIOSOURCE. RNA Purification and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular mRNA from DC (1 × 106/ml) was extracted using a MagnaPure LC mRNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s specification.

Equal volumes of WCEs from each condition were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoblots were probed with polyclonal antibodies directed against phosphopan-PKC (Cell Signaling, Leusden, the Netherlands), phospho-IRF-3 Ser396, kindly provided by R.

The immunoreactive bands were revealed using the ECL® detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, WCEs (400 μl) of DCs or TLR3-293 cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3Vo4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in EtOH, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet-P40 (Nonidet P-40)) and then incubated overnight with 1 μg of anti-CBP antibody (C-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). WCEs were incubated with 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A/protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C.

The immunoprecipitated complexes and WCEs were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-IRF-3 antibody (BD Biosciences) or an anti-p65 antibody (SC-372; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Native PAGE—DCs (1 × 106/ml) were collected and lysed in native lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na3Vo4, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in EtOH, protease inhibitor mixture, and 1% Nonidet P-40). The SDS-free 7.5% polyacrylamide gel was prerun with 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine with and without 1% deoxycholate in the cathode and anode chamber, respectively, for 30 min at 40 mA. Samples (6 μg) were combined 1:1 with native sample buffer (Bio-Rad), loaded, and electrophoresed for 60 min at 35 mA. Proteins were transferred to membranes and probed for IRF-3 dimerization with monoclonal antibody IRF-3 (BD Biosciences). Determination of NF-κB and IRF-3 DNA Binding Activities— Nuclear extracts were prepared as described earlier (41Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). IRF-3 or NF-κB DNA-binding activities in nuclear extracts were measured by Trans-AM IRF-3 or p65 transcription factor assay kits (Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, 3 μg of each nuclear extract was incubated in plates coated with consensus IFN-stimulated response elements and NF-κB oligonucleotides, respectively. Plates were washed, and anti-IRF-3 or p65 antibodies were added to the wells. Antibody binding was detected with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and developed with TMB substrate. The intensity of the reactions was measured at 450 nm. Confocal Microscopy—DCs (2 × 105) were seeded on glass coverslips and allowed to adhere for 1 h. Following cellular activation, DCs were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 100% cold methanol and then were incubated in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% bovine serum albumin) for 20 min. The cells were incubated with IRF-3 monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences) followed by p65/RelA (4 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected with ALEXA-488- and ALEXA-568-conjugated secondary antibodies (2 μg/ml) from Invitrogen. Following RNase treatment, nuclei were stained with TOTO®-3 iodide (5 μm) (Invitrogen). The cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Brussels, Belgium) and visualized with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL). Images were acquired using immersion oil objective ×100 HCV PL APO CS with a ×1.40 numerical aperture. The scanned images were acquired with Leica confocal software. Statistical Analysis—Data were compared using paired Wilcoxon’s nonparametric test or Student’s t test (where indicated). Supplemental Material—Fig. S1 shows that inhibition of conventional PKC activity suppresses IFN-β production mediated by the engagement of TLR3. Selective Inhibition of Poly(I:C)-mediated Type I IFN-β Synthesis by a Conventional PKC Inhibitor—Engagement of distinct TLRs by their specific ligands induces activation of several PKC isoforms in various cell types (26Tan S.L. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first assessed whether poly(I:C) induced the activation of PKC isoforms in monocyte-derived DCs. As shown in Fig. 1A, DCs exhibited phosphorylated forms of conventional PKCα/β and novel PKCδ isoforms within 30 min following the poly(I:C) encounter. Goö6976, a potent and selective conventional PKC inhibitor targeting Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms (42Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely abolished the phosphorylation-dependent activation of conventional PKC isoforms without effecting PKCδ activation. The following experiments were designed to evaluate the functional outcomes of blocking poly(I:C)-mediated conventional PKC activation on cytokine production in DCs. As shown in Fig. 1B, Goö6976 dose-dependently inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IFN-β secretion from DCs. Next, we analyzed whether the inhibitory effect of Goö6976, observed on IFN-β protein secretion, was due to an effect on IFN-β mRNA transcription. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we observed that the accumulation of IFN-β mRNA transcripts occurred as early as 2 h, peaking maximally at 4 h following poly(I:C) stimulation (data not shown). At 4 h, Goö6976-treated poly(I:C)-activated DCs exhibited significantly reduced IFN-β mRNA levels in comparison with poly(I:C)-activated control counterparts (Fig. 1C). In contrast, poly(I:C) exposure of DCs resulted in IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-"

We have recently determined the crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster protein disulfide isomerase-related protein Wind and have described two essential substrate binding sites within the protein, one within the thioredoxin b-domain and another within the C-terminal D-domain. Although a mammalian ortholog of Wind (ERp29/28) is known, conflicting interpretations of its structure and putative function have been postulated. Here, we have provided evidence indicating that ERp29 is indeed similar in both structure and function to its Drosophila ortholog. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we have demonstrated that homodimerization of the b-domains is significantly reduced in vitro upon replacement of key residues at the predicted dimerization interface. Investigation of Wind-ERp29 fusion constructs showed that mutants of the D-domain of ERp29 prevent transport of a substrate protein (Pipe) in a manner consistent with the presence of a discrete, conserved peptide binding site in the D-domain. Finally, we have highlighted the general applicability of these findings by showing that the D-domain of a redox-active disulfide isomerase, from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, can also functionally replace the Wind D-domain in vivo.

Although relatively much is known about the respective mechanisms of chaperone action of the calnexin/calreticulin proteins and BiP (6Kleizen B. Braakman I. Curr. Opin.

This is, to a significant extent, due to the weak character of PDI-substrate interactions. Thus, although it is now known that not only the chaperone function of these proteins but to varying extents their redox activity as well relies on their non-covalent interaction with substrate proteins (4Freedman R.B.

The principle peptide binding site in PDI has been mapped to the b′-domain, although contributions from other domains occur (12Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, much attention has been focused on the redox-inactive domains. Recently, peptide binding sites in the b-domains of PDI, ERp57, and the ERp29 ortholog Wind have been described (14Barnewitz K. Guo C. Sevvana M. Ma Q. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Ferrari D.M. J.

Interestingly, these binding sites all map to a region close to what would be the catalytically active redox-active sites in the a and a′ domains of PDI.The first crystal structure of a complete PDI family member of the eukaryotic ER was determined in 2003 (13Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), allowing a direct structural interpretation of the peptide-binding sites. This Drosophila melanogaster protein, Wind, contains an N-terminal thioredoxin b-type domain found in most PDI-related proteins as well as a unique C-terminal domain (the D-domain) found only in the PDI-D group of PDI-related proteins (3Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar).The PDI-D proteins comprise two subgroups. PDI-Dα proteins contain one or more redox-active a-type thioredoxin domains, whereas only redox-inactive b-type domains are present in PDI-Dβ proteins. Current knowledge suggests that PDI-Dβ proteins possess chaperone-like activities. Wind is required for export from the ER of an essential Golgi transmembrane proteoglycan-modifying enzyme, Pipe (a 2-O-sulfotransferase), which otherwise remains trapped in the ER (8Mayer M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and human and rat ERp29 (the human protein is also known as ERp28) interact with mutant hepatitis B surface antigen and thyroglobulin, respectively (17Ferrari D.M. Nguyen Van P. Kratzin H.D. Söling H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Sargsyan E. Baryshev M. Szekely L. Sharipo A. Mkrtchian S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17009-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Interestingly, in D. melanogaster Wind, it was shown that substrate-processing activity requires both the b- and D-domains, and a putative peptide binding site has been mapped to each of these domains (13Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Barnewitz K. Guo C.

This identified for the first time, in mammalian PDI-related proteins, a putative peptide-binding site in a domain not related to thioredoxin. Although a mammalian Wind ortholog ERp28/29 cannot replace Wind in Pipe processing, the D-domains of both proteins could be exchanged, indicating functional conservation between the proteins (13Ma Q.

The findings on the Wind protein structure and function are an important milestone in the elucidation of PDI and PDI-D chaperone-substrate interaction mechanisms. However, the general applicability of the findings was unclear, as variant dimerization models for the b-domain and tertiary structures of the D-domains of mammalian orthologs had been suggested (19Liepinsh E.

This is in conflict with the findings from our group (13Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Barnewitz K. Guo C. Sevvana M. Ma Q. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol.

In addition, Pro-116 (a structurally important residue of the thioredoxin fold) in ERp29 was suggested to have a trans-conformation, whereas the corresponding residues in Wind and other PDI proteins clearly have a cis conformation (3Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 13Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proposed structure of the D-domain of ERp29 deviates dramatically from that of Wind in the relative orientation of helices 8 and 9 to helices 6 and 7, and the cumulative data together with in vitro biophysical analysis of ERp29 were interpreted as indicating variant functional roles of the respective proteins (20Hermann V.M. Cutfield J.F. Hubbard M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13529-13537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).We provide data based on in vivo functional assays and in vitro molecular characterization showing similarities in structure and function between mammalian ERp29 and its D. melanogaster ortholog Wind. Homodimerization of the PDI-D protein, based on association of the thioredoxin b-type domains, occurs via a conserved interface and requires the presence of key residues, the replacement of which reduce dimer formation significantly. For substrates such as Pipe, conservation of function is tightly linked to structural integrity of the D-domain and more precisely to the integrity of a discrete, conserved peptide binding site spanning two structural elements.In PDI-Dα proteins, identified in yeast and plants, a different domain structure and distribution exists than in PDI-Dβ proteins. Here, two redox-active a-type thioredoxin domains generally precede the D-domain, and b-type domains are absent. In contrast to PDI-Dβ proteins, PDI-Dα proteins are capable of complementing PDI-deficient yeast (13Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3469-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PDI-Dα proteins generally lack classical ER retrieval sequences (3Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 22Monnat J. Hacker U. Geissler H. Rauchenberger R. Neuhaus E.M. Maniak M. Soldati T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the degree of similarity between the two subclasses of protein is low (overall ∼30% identity between human PDI-Dβ and slime mold PDI-Dα). We show that, despite these differences, the D-domain of a PDI-Dα protein is capable of replacing the D-domain of Wind functionally, suggesting common functional properties among all PDI-D proteins, despite significant evolutionary divergence in primary sequence.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Expression Vectors—Mammalian COS-7 and Vero cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue bacterial cells was from Stratagene, the pEGFP-N1 expression vector was from Clontech, and pQE-30 and pQE-60 expression vectors were from Qiagen.Antibodies—Antibodies against full-length Drosophila Wind and human ERp29 were raised as described previously (13Ma Q.

For human ERp29, BamHI/HindIII PCR products amplified from pDsb-m28 (17Ferrari D.M. Nguyen Van P. Kratzin H.D. Söling H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) encoding mature ERp29 were ligated into pQE-30, generating a construct with an N-terminal His6 tag extension. The ERp29 mutants ERp29-L39D, ERp29-D42N, ERp29-K52S, and the double mutant ERp29-D42N/K52S were made from this construct using standard mutagenesis techniques after recloning into BamHI/NcoI sites of pQE60. Single domain mouse ERp29 D-domain constructs encoding the complete D-domain and three residues of the linker region (residues Gly-155–Cys-159), harboring the mutations ΔE222 (hereafter referred to as D-ΔE222), E222Q (D-E222Q), A224S/R225A (D-A224S/R225A), R225A (D-R225A), K228E (D-K228E), L229S (D-L229S), or CΔ13 (D-CΔ13), respectively, as well as the WT D-domain (D-WT), were prepared as pQE-30 expression constructs via ligation into the KpnI/HindIII sites. For full-length mouse ERp29, sequences encoding the mature fragments of the WT protein and the mutants ERp29-E222Q, ERp29-R225A/G227S, and ERp29-K228E were created by standard mutagenesis techniques and ligated into BamHI/NcoI sites of pQE-60, generating constructs with a C-terminal His6 tag.Mammalian Expression Vector Constructs—Full-length windbeutel and Wind-b-p29D, incorporated into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1, with a stop codon preceding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence (Wind*-EGFP-N1 and Wind-b-p29D*-EGFP-N1) are as described in Ma et al. (13Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol.

Wind-b-p29D point mutants (E222Q, R225A, K228E, L229S, and L242K), double mutant A224S/R225A, the deletion mutants ΔE222 and L242K-CΔ13, as well as the ERp29 thioredoxin domain mutant D42N were constructed using appropriate primers and standard site-directed mutagenesis protocols, using Wind*-EGFP-N1 or Wind-b-p29D*-EGFP-N1 as the template. Dictyostelium discoideum Dd-PDI was amplified by PCR from a GFP-Dd-PDI construct (21Monnat J. Neuhaus E.M. Pop M.S. Ferrari D.M. Kramer B. Soldati T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3469-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the fragment corresponding to D-domain residues 260–363 fused to the Wind-b cDNA fragment (residues 1–145) generating the vector Wind-b-DdPDI-D*-EGFP-N1. This construct has an additional 6-residue insert between Wind and the D. discoideum Dd-PDI D-domain sequences coding for Glu-Thr, and a 3′ sequence encoding the KEEL retrieval signal.Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence Assays—COS-7 cells were grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum with 2 mm l-glutamine and antibiotics at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor (Sigma), was applied to the cells 16 h after transfection by electroporation at 0.2 mg/ml for 4 h. For immunofluorescence labeling, the cells were grown on coverslips overnight (16–20 h) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Bound Wind antibody, used at a 1:300 dilution, was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody. Visualization of Cy3 and GFP was carried out on an Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss) with excitation filters of 565/30 and 480/40 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 595 and 505 nm, and emission filters of 645/75 and 527/30 nm, respectively.Protein Expression and Purification—All proteins were expressed in XL1-Blue by induction of A600 = 0.7 cultures for 3 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Recombinant ERp29 proteins were harvested by sonication of lysozyme-treated cells in pH 8.0 adjusted phosphate-buffered saline or 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 8 mm imidazole, including 1 mm Pefabloc SC protease inhibitor followed by the addition of Triton X-100 to 0.1% (v/v) and application on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen). Bound protein was washed and eluted as recommended by the manufacturer. Eluted protein was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), concentrated to 15–30 mg/ml, and stored at 4 °C. For far UV circular dichroism measurements, all proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography on either Q-Sepharose or S-Sepharose media (GE Healthcare), dependent on protein pI values (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined with the ProtParam tool (23Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Hatfield, UK2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar) using a calculated absorption coefficient at 280 nm. Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE.In Vitro Cross-linking of Recombinant Protein—Purified His6-tagged ERp29 and Wind proteins were rebuffered in assay buffer (50 mm sodium borate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Cross-linking was performed with 0.2 μg/μl protein by the addition of glutaraldehyde to 1% (w/v) followed by quenching after 2 min with 2 m NaBH4. Samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Biophysical Analysis of ERp29—Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J710 spectrophotometer. All scans at 20 °C were collected as an average of 5–7 scans, whereas temperature gradient scans were repeated 2–3 times. A cell with a path length of 0.1 cm, a scan speed of 50–100 nm/min, a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a time constant of 0.5 s for thermal denaturation was used. The maximal high tension voltage was 700 V. All proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100 before analysis and were used at 11 μm (full-length proteins), 21 μm (single domain construct D-CΔ13), or 19 μm (all other D-domain constructs).RESULTSDimerization of Human ERp29—The b-domain of Wind includes a homodimerization surface encompassing residues to either side of β1 (residues 24–34), residues within and after α1 (residues 37–43), and residues within and after α2 (residues 70–75) (13Ma Q.

Here, important stabilizing interactions are mediated by Gly-26, Val-28, Asp-31, and Arg-41. Dimerization is critical for the function of Wind, and mutants of Wind that cannot dimerize fail to support Pipe processing (14Barnewitz K. Guo C. Sevvana M. Ma Q. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39829-39837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Dimerization of Pipe brings the substrate binding site of each b-domain to within ∼13 Å of each other, which may be important for chaperone action. In contrast, for rat ERp29, it has been suggested (19Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that the dimerization site of rat ERp29 comprises residues Asp-71 (helix α2, corresponds to Wind Glu-60), Phe-118, Arg-122, Asp-123, (within and after strand β4, Wind Ile-108, Lys-112, Gly-113), and Trp-144 (Phe-135 in helix 4 of Wind). The proposed dimerization surfaces are on different faces of the thioredoxin fold. If this were the case, it might also be the reason for the lack of activity of WT ERp29 in the processing of Pipe in our assays (14Barnewitz K. Guo C. Sevvana M. Ma Q. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39829-39837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Clearly, a correct interpretation of the mode of dimerization of ERp29 is important for understanding its function in vivo, and therefore we chose to analyze participation of residues at the dimerization interface via a mutagenesis approach. In Wind, mutation of Val-28 (V28D) or Asp-31 (D31N) leads to a significant reduction in dimerization (14Barnewitz K. Guo C. Sevvana M. Ma Q. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39829-39837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), as expected. If mammalian ERp29 proteins have the same structure, mutation of either of the corresponding residues of the human protein, Leu-39 and Asp-42, could have a similar effect. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1, the dimer:monomer ratio in glutaraldehyde-cross-linked, recombinant ERp29 is significantly shifted toward the monomer for both the L39D and the D42N mutants (Fig. 1a, lanes 1 and 2, respectively; single arrow) compared with the ratio observed for WT protein (Fig. 1a, lane 4), which is strongly shifted toward dimer formation (double arrow). Under the same conditions, the reduction in the proportion of dimer in favor of the monomer can clearly be seen for Wind-D31N, the Drosophila equivalent of human ERp29-D42N, compared with the WT protein (Fig. 1b, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). For ERp29-K52S, dimerization is also impaired, although to a lesser extent (Fig. 1a, lane 3). We can exclude the possibility that an alternative dimer interface comes into play at altered pH or salt conditions, as our assays were performed under various conditions (pH 6–8, 0–1 m NaCl) with a similar outcome (data not shown).The D-domain of ERp29 Harbors a Peptide-binding Site Similar to That of Wind—We have previously shown that, in Drosophila Wind, five residues of the D-domain (Glu-212, Arg-215, Arg-218, Leu-219, and Leu-232) are essential for Pipe processing. Mutation of either Arg-215, Arg-218, or Leu-232 was sufficient to cause significant reduction in Pipe transport, whereas mutation of Glu-212 and Leu-219 had no significant effect unless combined (14Barnewitz K. Guo C. Sevvana M. Ma Q. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39829-39837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). With the exception of Leu-232, these residues reside on α-helix 8 of the D-domain (Fig. 2). Together with Leu-232 on helix 9, the residues form a tight, surface-exposed cluster on the same face of the protein as the b-domain binding site (13Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Surrounding residues do not seem to be involved (14Barnewitz K. Guo C. Sevvana M. Ma Q. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39829-39837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 4M. Sevvana, G. M. Sheldrick, and D. M. Ferrari, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, work by Ma et al. (13Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) also shows that the D-domain of ERp29 could complement the corresponding domain in Wind. However, Mkrtchian and co-workers (19Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have obtained a significantly different fold for the mammalian PDI-Dβ protein by NMR, leading us to ask whether the peptide binding site identified in the Wind protein is conserved in mammalian ERp29. We therefore studied the effects on Pipe protein translocation to the Golgi using 8 different mutants of the mouse ERp29 D-domain, based on the published Wind data (14Barnewitz K. Guo C. Sevvana M.

The PDI-Dβ proteins Wind and ERp29 lack redox-active thioredoxin domains but contain a D-domain with weak but significant similarity to the Dictyostelium PDI-Dα ortholog. rERp29, rat ERp29; hERp29, human ERp29; PDI-Dα, D. discoideum Dd-PDI. Yellow boxes indicate experimentally determined secondary structure elements in the Wind and ERp29 sequences. Identical residues are colored red, and the corresponding positions in the human ERp29 sequence of residues replaced by mutagenesis are indicated by dots. In the b-domain (β1-α4), the dots also indicate residues involved in dimerization of ERp29, whereas the dots in the D-domain (α5–α9) indicate residues within the substrate binding site of the protein. The region encoding the PDI-D loop, unique to PDI-D proteins, is indicated by a line. The linker region connecting the thioredoxin domain and D-domain, in which the conserved (in PDI-Dβ proteins) Cys-159 residue is located, is between α-helices 4 and 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In COS cells expressing both Pipe-GFP and Wind or one of its mutants, Golgi transport of Pipe signifies productive ER processing and"
