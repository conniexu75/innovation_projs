https://openalex.org/W2044627079,"A new class of electrode materials for high energy density, rechargeable batteries based on topochemical reactions of lithium and transition metal compounds is evolving. The physical and structural properties relevant to the ability of transition metal oxides with framework structures to topochemically incorporate lithium are discussed. Perovskite-related structures are particularly attractive hosts for lithium."
https://openalex.org/W1984144072,"alpha-Tomatine, an alkaloid in tomato plants, is toxic to an endoparasite of a major lepidopterous pest of tomatoes. The parasite acquires the alkaloid from its host after the host ingests the alkaloid. This form of interaction creates a potential dilemma to controlling herbivorous pests through chemical antibiosis in plants."

Transplant experiments indicate that the limited distribution is not due to physiological restriction. Instead, it requires predictable annual disturbance of moderate intensity for local persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2045197993,"After adult zebra finches (Poephila guttata) received injections of tritiated testosterone, fewer hormone-concentrating cells were found in females than in males in two brain regions involved in song: hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale and magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum. In some other regions, no sexual difference was detected. It is, therefore, possible that sex differences in the sensitivity of specific neural populations to hormones underlie the striking anatomical dimorphism observed in neural regions controlling song."
https://openalex.org/W2018377495,"Field-grown alder (Alnus glutinosa) root nodules were disrupted in liquid nitrogen to release the actinomycete endophytes. The endophytes were broken by mild sonic oscillation and yielded a cell-free nitrogenase preparation capable of reducing acetylene and protons. In addition, the preparation carried a cell-free uptake hydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W2010734964,"In 1977, heating, cooling, lighting, and other operations in residential and commercial buildings used 27 quads (1 quad = 10(15) British thermal units) of energy. This is more than one-third of the nation's total energy budget. Future trends in energy use in buildings are likely to depend strongly on fuel prices and government policies designed to save energy. Three scenarios are examined: (i) a base line in which fuel prices rise as projected by the Department of Energy; (ii) a conservation case that includes higher gas and oil prices plus the regulatory, financial incentive, and information programs authorized by the 94th Congress and proposed in the April 1977 National Energy Plan; and (iii) another conservation case that also includes new technologies (more efficient equipment, appliances, and structures). These scenarios are analyzed for changes in energy use, costs, and employment by means of detailed engineering-economic models of energy use in residential and commercial buildings developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and input-output analyses developed at the University of Illinois."
