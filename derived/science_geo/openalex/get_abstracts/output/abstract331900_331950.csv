https://openalex.org/W2004737831,"Corn seedlings release large amounts of terpenoid volatiles after they have been fed upon by caterpillars. Artificially damaged seedlings do not release these volatiles in significant amounts unless oral secretions from the caterpillars are applied to the damaged sites. Undamaged leaves, whether or not they are treated with oral secretions, do not release detectable amounts of the terpenoids. Females of the parasitic wasp Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson) learn to take advantage of those plant-produced volatiles to locate hosts when exposed to these volatiles in association with hosts or host by-products. The terpenoids may be produced in defense against herbivores but may also serve a secondary function in attracting the natural enemies of these herbivores."
https://openalex.org/W1987204103,"Saltation is important in the transport of sand-sized granular material by wind and in the ejection of dust from the bed both on Earth and on Mars. The evolution of the saltating population and all its characteristic profiles is calculated from inception by pure aerodynamic entrainment through to steady state. Results of numerical simulations of single-grain impacts into granular beds are condensed into analytic expressions for the number and speeds of grains rebounding or rejected (splashed) from the bed. A model is combined with (i) this numerical representation, (ii) an expression for the aerodynamic entrainment rate, and (iii) the modification of the wind velocity profile by saltating grains. Calculated steady state mass fluxes are within the range of mass fluxes measured in wind tunnel experiments; mass flux is nonlinearly dependent on the shear velocity. Aerodynamically entrained grains in the system are primarily seeding agents; at steady state, aerodynamic entrainment is rare. The time for the entire system to reach steady state is roughly 1 second, or several long-trajectory hop times."
https://openalex.org/W2088277406,"Recent developments in the direct measurements of forces between surfaces in liquids at the Ã¥ngstrom resolution level are reviewed. The results reveal a rich variety of interactions and interaction potentials that depend on the nature of the surfaces and intervening liquids. These results also shed new insights into liquid structure adjacent to surfaces and the interactions occurrig in complex systems, with implications in many different areas of chemical physics, biology, and technology. The origin of some important fundamental interactions, such as repulsive ""hydration"" forces and attractive ""hydrophobic"" forces, are still not understood and offer a challenge for experimental and theoretical work in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2150272005,"Organizational errors are often at the root of failures of critical engineering systems. Yet, when searching for risk management strategies, engineers tend to focus on technical solutions, in part because of the way risks and failures are analyzed. Probabilistic risk analysis allows assessment of the safety of a complex system by relating its failure probability to the performance of its components and operators. In this article, some organizational aspects are introduced to this analysis in an effort to describe the link between the probability of component failures and relevant features of the organizaton. Probabilities are used to analyze occurrences of organizational errors and their effects on system safety. Coarse estimates of the benefits of certain organizational improvements can then be derived. For jacket-type offshore platforms, improving the design review can provide substantial reliability gains, and the corresponding expense is about two orders of magnitude below the cost of achieving the same result by adding steel to structures."

The memory elements are based on a chain of electron-transfer molecules and the information is shifted by photoinduced electron-transfer reactions. This device integrates designed electronic molecules onto a very large scale integrated (silicon microelectronic) substrate, providing an example of a ""molecular electronic device"" that could actually be made. The design requirements for such a device and possible synthetic strategies are discussed. Devices along these lines should have lower energy usage and enhanced storage density."

Structural units with periodicities rangng from 21 to 3.4 angstroms have been clearly imaged, demonstrating that atomic resolution imaging of an ionic, wide band gap (3.2 electron volts) semiconductor is possible. The observed surface structures can be explained by a model involving ordered arrangements of two-dimensional defects known as crystallographic shear planes and indicate that the topography of nonstoichiometric oxide surfaces can be complex."
https://openalex.org/W2073612097,"The horizontal displacements accompanying the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake are computed from geodetic survey measurements. The 1906 earthquake displacement field is entirely consistent with right-lateral strike slip on the San Andreas fault. In contrast, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake exhibited subequal components of strike slip and reverse faulting. This result, together with other seismic and geologic data, may indicate that the two earthquakes occurred on two different fault planes."
https://openalex.org/W1987546031,"Highly parallel computing architectures are the only means to achieve the computational rates demanded by advanced scientific problems. A decade of research has demonstrated the feasibility of such machines, and current research focuses on which architectures are best suited for particular dasses of problems. The architectures designated as MIMD and SIMD have produced the best results to date; neither shows a decisive advantage for most near-homogeneous scientific problems. For scientific problems with many dissimilar parts, more speculative architectures such as neural networks or data flow may be needed."
https://openalex.org/W2009754549,"Notwithstanding its widespread use, the government's deficit is not a well-defined measure of fiscal policy from the perspective of neoclassical economics; the equations of neoclassical models do not define the deficit. Rather than being a fundamental economic concept, the deficit is an arbitrary cash flow accounting construct with no necessary relation to the true stance of fiscal policy. Although the deficit is supposed to indicate how the burden of paying for the government's consumption is spread across different generations, actual changes in the measured deficit in the United States have had little if any relation to changes in the burden imposed by the government on different generations. The deficit's lack of definition is illustrated with a simple model, and the potential for misreading fiscal policy is discussed with U.S. fiscal policy in the 1980s as an example. In this article, creation of present value generational accounts are called for that would properly measure the intergenerational stance of fiscal policy."
https://openalex.org/W1981446594,"Large earthquakes occur episodically in the Cascadia subduction zone. A numerical model has been used to simulate and assess the hazards of a tsunami generated by a hypothetical earthquake of magnitude 8.5 associated with rupture of the northern sections of the subduction zone. Wave amplitudes on the outer coast are closely related to the magnitude of sea-bottom displacement (5.0 meters). Some amplification, up to a factor of 3, may occur in some coastal embayments. Wave amplitudes in the protected waters of Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia are predicted to be only about one fifth of those estmated on the outer coast."
https://openalex.org/W2000899705,"Recent and subfossil calcareous structures resembling cystose and subclathrate Paleozoic stromatoporoids have been discovered in a sea-linked, stratified, alkaline crater lake on Satonda Island, Indonesia. The structures are produced by mats of coccoid cyanobacteria growing along the lakeshore from the water surface down to the O2-H2S interface located at a depth of 22.8 meters. Calcification of the mats is controlled by seasonal changes in calcium carbonate supersaturation in the epilimnion. The internally complex structures are a product of two different calcification processes: (i) periodic in vivo calcification of the surficial cyanobacterial layers by low-Mg calcite, and (ii) early postmortem calcification of the cyanobacterial aggregates below the mat surface by microbially precipitated aragonite. The finding supports the idea that Paleozoic stromatoporoids represent fossilized cyanobacteria (stromatolites). It also implies that the stromatoporoid-generating epicontinental seas during the early Paleozoic may have been more alkaline and had a higher carbonate mineral supersaturation than modern seawater."
