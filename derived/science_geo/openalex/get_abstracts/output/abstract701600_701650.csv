https://openalex.org/W4297496650,"High-throughput RNA sequencing offers broad opportunities to explore the Earth RNA virome. Mining 5,150 diverse metatranscriptomes uncovered >2.5 million RNA virus contigs. Analysis of >330,000 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) shows that this expansion corresponds to a 5-fold increase of the known RNA virus diversity. Gene content analysis revealed multiple protein domains previously not found in RNA viruses and implicated in virus-host interactions. Extended RdRP phylogeny supports the monophyly of the five established phyla and reveals two putative additional bacteriophage phyla and numerous putative additional classes and orders. The dramatically expanded phylum Lenarviricota, consisting of bacterial and related eukaryotic viruses, now accounts for a third of the RNA virome. Identification of CRISPR spacer matches and bacteriolytic proteins suggests that subsets of picobirnaviruses and partitiviruses, previously associated with eukaryotes, infect prokaryotic hosts."
https://openalex.org/W4297996539,"The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain is a key component of immune receptors that identify pathogen invasion in bacteria, plants and animals1-3. In the bacterial antiphage system Thoeris, as well as in plants, recognition of infection stimulates TIR domains to produce an immune signalling molecule whose molecular structure remains elusive. This molecule binds and activates the Thoeris immune effector, which then executes the immune function1. We identified a large family of phage-encoded proteins, denoted here as Thoeris anti-defence 1 (Tad1), that inhibit Thoeris immunity. We found that Tad1 proteins are 'sponges' that bind and sequester the immune signalling molecule produced by TIR-domain proteins, thus decoupling phage sensing from immune effector activation and rendering Thoeris inactive. Tad1 can also efficiently sequester molecules derived from a plant TIR-domain protein, and a high-resolution crystal structure of Tad1 bound to a plant-derived molecule showed a unique chemical structure of 1 ''-2' glycocyclic ADPR (gcADPR). Our data furthermore suggest that Thoeris TIR proteins produce a closely related molecule, 1''-3' gcADPR, which activates ThsA an order of magnitude more efficiently than the plant-derived 1''-2' gcADPR. Our results define the chemical structure of a central immune signalling molecule and show a new mode of action by which pathogens can suppress host immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4297977428,"Genome-wide association studies provide a powerful means of identifying loci and genes contributing to disease, but in many cases, the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. In the present study, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing, epigenomic SNP-to-gene maps and genome-wide association study summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted notable cell-disease relationships, including γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurons in major depressive disorder, a disease-dependent M-cell program in ulcerative colitis and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease-dependent immune cell-type programs were associated, whereas only disease-dependent epithelial cell programs were prominent, suggesting a role in disease response rather than initiation. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease."
https://openalex.org/W4297977523,"Trogocytosis is an active process that transfers surface material from targeted to effector cells. Using multiple in vivo tumor models and clinical data, we report that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) activation in natural killer (NK) cells promoted transfer of the CAR cognate antigen from tumor to NK cells, resulting in (1) lower tumor antigen density, thus impairing the ability of CAR-NK cells to engage with their target, and (2) induced self-recognition and continuous CAR-mediated engagement, resulting in fratricide of trogocytic antigen-expressing NK cells (NKTROG+) and NK cell hyporesponsiveness. This phenomenon could be offset by a dual-CAR system incorporating both an activating CAR against the cognate tumor antigen and an NK self-recognizing inhibitory CAR that transferred a ‘don’t kill me’ signal to NK cells upon engagement with their TROG+ siblings. This system prevented trogocytic antigen-mediated fratricide, while sparing activating CAR signaling against the tumor antigen, and resulted in enhanced CAR-NK cell activity. A new dual-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) system enhances the antitumor activity of CAR natural killer cells and makes them less susceptible to therapeutic resistance in preclinical models."
https://openalex.org/W4297977472,"We identify the sodium leak channel non-selective protein (NALCN) as a key regulator of cancer metastasis and nonmalignant cell dissemination. Among 10,022 human cancers, NALCN loss-of-function mutations were enriched in gastric and colorectal cancers. Deletion of Nalcn from gastric, intestinal or pancreatic adenocarcinomas in mice did not alter tumor incidence, but markedly increased the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastases. Treatment of these mice with gadolinium-a NALCN channel blocker-similarly increased CTCs and metastases. Deletion of Nalcn from mice that lacked oncogenic mutations and never developed cancer caused shedding of epithelial cells into the blood at levels equivalent to those seen in tumor-bearing animals. These cells trafficked to distant organs to form normal structures including lung epithelium, and kidney glomeruli and tubules. Thus, NALCN regulates cell shedding from solid tissues independent of cancer, divorcing this process from tumorigenesis and unmasking a potential new target for antimetastatic therapies."

In this study, we examined the association between exposure to mass media and maternal health care services utilization among women in sub-Saharan Africa.We used data from the recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 2010 and 2020. A total of 28 countries with a survey dataset within 2010-2020 were included in our study. We included 199,146 women who had ever had a pregnancy in the last five years preceding the survey. Weighting was applied. Multilevel mixed-effect models were considered to account for cluster-level variations and correct inferences. Fixed and random effects estimates were reported. Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to present the results. Also, we presented the random intercept variations, intraclass correlation coefficient, and model fitness.Women who listened to radio at least once every week (aOR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.07,1.15) were more likely to attend ANC as against those who did not listen to radio at all. Also, women who watched television at least once a week (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.33,1.46) were more likely to attend ANC compared to those who did not watch television at all. Women who read newspaper/magazine at least once a week (aOR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.14,1.41); listened to radio at least once a week (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07,1.17); and watched television at least once a week (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.24,1.40), were more likely to utilize SBA than those who did not read newspaper/magazine; listen to radio; and watch television at all. Women who read newspaper/magazine at least once a week (aOR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.27,1.45); listened to radio at least once a week (aOR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.32,1.42); and watched television at least once a week (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.32,1.47) were more likely to utilize PNC compared to those who did not.The study identified a strong positive relationship between mass media exposure and maternal health care services utilization. Specifically, exposure to radio and television were positively associated with ANC visitations. Moreover, exposure to mass media (newspaper/magazine, radio and television) were positively associated with SBA and PNC utilization. Policymakers and other non-governmental organizations should continuously invest resources in the design and implementation of maternal health service utilization educational programs through all the mass media channels to scale up women's maternal health service services utilization uptake in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4297996562,"Bile acids are prominent host and microbiota metabolites that modulate host immunity and microbial pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which bile acids suppress microbial virulence are not clear. To identify the direct protein targets of bile acids in bacterial pathogens, we performed activity-guided chemical proteomic studies. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) most effectively inhibited the expression of virulence genes and invasion of epithelial cells and interacted with many proteins. Notably, we discovered that CDCA can directly bind and inhibit the function of HilD, an important transcriptional regulator of S. Typhimurium virulence and pathogenesis. Our characterization of bile acid-resistant HilD mutants in vitro and in S. Typhimurium infection models suggests that HilD is one of the key protein targets of anti-infective bile acids. This study highlights the utility of chemical proteomics to identify the direct protein targets of microbiota metabolites for mechanistic studies in bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4297996597,"Prevention of infection and propagation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a high priority in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here we describe S-nitrosylation of multiple proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for viral entry. This reaction prevents binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting viral entry, infectivity and cytotoxicity. Aminoadamantane compounds also inhibit coronavirus ion channels formed by envelope (E) protein. Accordingly, we developed dual-mechanism aminoadamantane nitrate compounds that inhibit viral entry and, thus, the spread of infection by S-nitrosylating ACE2 via targeted delivery of the drug after E protein channel blockade. These non-toxic compounds are active in vitro and in vivo in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model and, thus, provide a novel avenue to pursue therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4297473102,"Elucidating the neural circuits supporting odor identification remains an open challenge. Here, we analyze the contribution of the two output cell types of the mouse olfactory bulb (mitral and tufted cells) to decode odor identity and concentration and its dependence on top-down feedback from their respective major cortical targets: piriform cortex versus anterior olfactory nucleus. We find that tufted cells substantially outperform mitral cells in decoding both odor identity and intensity. Cortical feedback selectively regulates the activity of its dominant bulb projection cell type and implements different computations. Piriform feedback specifically restructures mitral responses, whereas feedback from the anterior olfactory nucleus preferentially controls the gain of tufted representations without altering their odor tuning. Our results identify distinct functional loops involving the mitral and tufted cells and their cortical targets. We suggest that in addition to the canonical mitral-to-piriform pathway, tufted cells and their target regions are ideally positioned to compute odor identity."
https://openalex.org/W4297990728,"Lung cancer is a severe menace to human health, due to which millions of people die because of late diagnoses of cancer; thus, it is vital to detect the disease as early as possible. The Computerized chest analysis Tomography of scan is assumed to be one of the efficient solutions for detecting and classifying lung nodules. The necessity of high accuracy of analyzing C.T. scan images of the lung is considered as one of the crucial challenges in detecting and classifying lung cancer. A new long-short-term-memory (LSTM) based deep fusion structure, is introduced, where, the texture features computed from lung nodules through new volumetric grey-level-co-occurrence-matrices (GLCM) computations are applied to classify the nodules into: benign, malignant and ambiguous. An improved Otsu segmentation method combined with the water strider optimization algorithm (WSA) is proposed to detect the lung nodules. Otsu-WSA thresholding can overcome the restrictions present in previous thresholding methods. Extended experiments are run to assess this fusion structure by considering 2D-GLCM computations based 2D-slices fusion, and an approximation of this 3D-GLCM with volumetric 2.5D-GLCM computations-based LSTM fusion structure. The proposed methods are trained and assessed through the LIDC-IDRI dataset, where 94.4%, 91.6%, and 95.8% Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are obtained, respectively for 2D-GLCM fusion and 97.33%, 96%, and 98%, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively, for 2.5D-GLCM fusion. The yield of the same are 98.7%, 98%, and 99%, for the 3D-GLCM fusion. The obtained results and analysis indicate that the WSA-Otsu method requires less execution time and yields a more accurate thresholding process. It is found that 3D-GLCM based LSTM outperforms its counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W4297990819,"Black soldier fly ( Hermetia illucens ) larvae can convert biowaste and by-products into body mass high in protein (~40% dry matter, DM) and lipid (~30% DM). However, the type of rearing substrate also affects the larval body composition and thus its nutritional value. Hitherto, it remains unclear how and to what extent the larval body composition can be altered by the substrate. This study was therefore performed to examine the possibilities of modifying larval body composition using different rearing substrates. To investigate this, 5-days old larvae were reared for seven days on different locally available waste and by-products: brewer’s spent grain, mitigation mussels ( Mytilus edulis ), rapeseed cake, and shrimp waste meal ( Pandalus borealis ). Larval composition and performance were compared to larvae reared on a commercial chicken feed as well as a mixed feed (mixture of chicken feed and by-products, with a similar macronutrient composition to chicken feed). Larval body weight was recorded daily to determine growth over time whereas larvae and substrates were sampled at the start and end of the trial and analysed for their nutritional composition. The type of rearing substrate affected both larval body composition and growth performance. There was a clear relation between the nutritional composition of the substrate and larvae for certain fatty acids. Larvae reared on marine-based waste substrates contained a higher share of omega-3 fatty acids than larvae reared on the other substrates, indicating an accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids from the substrate. There was a strong positive linear correlation between the ash content in the substrate and larvae whereas larval lipid, protein, amino acid, and chitin content seemed more affected by larval development. Overall, this study showed that the rearing substrate affects larval composition and development, and that larval composition of certain nutrients can be tailored depending on further food and feed applications."
https://openalex.org/W4297996587,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal fibrosing interstitial lung disease with a mean survival time of less than 5 years. Nonspecific presentation, a lack of effective early screening tools, unclear pathobiology of early-stage IPF and the need for invasive and expensive procedures for diagnostic confirmation hinder early diagnosis. In this study, we introduce a new screening tool for IPF in primary care settings that requires no new laboratory tests and does not require recognition of early symptoms. Using subtle comorbidity signatures identified from the history of medical encounters of individuals, we developed an algorithm, called the zero-burden comorbidity risk score for IPF (ZCoR-IPF), to predict the future risk of an IPF diagnosis. ZCoR-IPF was trained on a national insurance claims database and validated on three independent databases, comprising a total of 2,983,215 participants, with 54,247 positive cases. The algorithm achieved positive likelihood ratios greater than 30 at a specificity of 0.99 across different cohorts, for both sexes, and for participants with different risk states and history of confounding diseases. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for ZCoR-IPF in predicting IPF exceeded 0.88 and was approximately 0.84 at 1 and 4 years before a conventional diagnosis, respectively. Thus, if adopted, ZCoR-IPF can potentially enable earlier diagnosis of IPF and improve outcomes of disease-modifying therapies and other interventions. A machine learning algorithm can predict the future risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a disease that is difficult to diagnose at its early stages, based on comorbidity signatures in electronic health records."
https://openalex.org/W4297496628,"Zika virus (ZIKV) can infect human developing brain (HDB) progenitors resulting in epidemic microcephaly, whereas analogous cellular tropism offers treatment potential for the adult brain cancer, glioblastoma (GBM). We compared productive ZIKV infection in HDB and GBM primary tissue explants that both contain SOX2+ neural progenitors. Strikingly, although the HDB proved uniformly vulnerable to ZIKV infection, GBM was more refractory, and this correlated with an innate immune expression signature. Indeed, GBM-derived CD11b+ microglia/macrophages were necessary and sufficient to protect progenitors against ZIKV infection in a non-cell autonomous manner. Using SOX2+ GBM cell lines, we found that CD11b+-conditioned medium containing type 1 interferon beta (IFNβ) promoted progenitor resistance to ZIKV, whereas inhibition of JAK1/2 signaling restored productive infection. Additionally, CD11b+ conditioned medium, and IFNβ treatment rendered HDB progenitor lines and explants refractory to ZIKV. These findings provide insight into neuroprotection for HDB progenitors as well as enhanced GBM oncolytic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4297399251,"PHD fingers are modular domains in chromatin-associated proteins that decode the methylation status of histone H3 tails. A PHD finger signature is found in plant vernalization (VEL) proteins, which function as accessory factors of the Polycomb system to control flowering in Arabidopsis through an epigenetic silencing mechanism. It has been proposed that VEL PHD fingers bind to methylated histone H3 tails to facilitate association of the Polycomb silencing machinery with target genes. Here, we use structural analysis by X-ray crystallography to show that the VEL PHD finger forms the central module of a larger compact tripartite superdomain that also contains a zinc finger and a four-helix bundle.

Plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers were discovered in Arabidopsis (1Schindler U. Beckmann H. Cashmore A.R. HAT3.1, a novel Arabidopsis homeodomain protein containing a conserved cysteine-rich region.Plant J. 1993; 4: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) but subsequently found throughout eukaryotes, typically in nuclear proteins associated with chromatin. They are zinc-binding domains typified by a Cys4-His-Cys3 motif with characteristically spaced cysteine and histidine residues that ligate two Zn2+ ions in a crossbraced fashion. In addition, the PHD signature also contains a highly conserved aromatic residue upstream of the penultimate cysteine pair (2Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F.

The main structural feature of PHD fingers is a three-pronged pocket that binds to histone H3 tails in a methylation-dependent manner, engaging with lysine 4 (K4) and arginine 2 (R2) through two adjacent pockets (4Musselman C.A.

The general principle that emerged from these studies is that the variously shaped histone-binding pockets and surfaces of individual PHD fingers empower them to decode combinations of specific histone H3 tail modifications that mark actively transcribed or repressed genes (16Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. How chromatin-binding modules interpret histone modifications: lessons from professional pocket pickers.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). In addition, some PHD fingers also bind to nonhistone proteins and thus form ternary complexes that determine transcriptional outcomes (4Musselman C.A. Kutateladze T.G.

A classical PHD signature motif is also found in plant VEL proteins (18Whittaker C. Dean C. The FLC locus: a platform for discoveries in epigenetics and adaptation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33: 555-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). During vernalization, VEL proteins associate with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and are required for epigenetic silencing of the Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) (19De Lucia F. Crevillen P. Jones A.M. Greb T. Dean C. A PHD-Polycomb repressive complex 2 triggers the epigenetic silencing of FLC during vernalization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 16831-16836Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Previous evidence based on pull-down assays suggested that the PHD finger of VIN3 (VIN3PHD) binds to histone H3 tails bearing specific methylations (20Kim D.H. Sung S. Coordination of the vernalization response through a VIN3 and FLC gene family regulatory network in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2013; 25: 454-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), despite the lack of a predicted aromatic cage in its putative K4 pocket. Furthermore, a mutation that restored an aromatic cage in VIN3 enhanced its binding to histone H3K4me3 and resulted in hyper-repression of FLC (21Kim D.H. Sung S. The binding specificity of the PHD-finger domain of VIN3 moderates vernalization response.Plant Physiol. 2017; 173: 1258-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Based on their results, the authors proposed that the decoding of modified histone H3 tails at FLC by VIN3PHD was crucial for FLC silencing and for the vernalization response of Arabidopsis plants (21Kim D.H. Sung S. The binding specificity of the PHD-finger domain of VIN3 moderates vernalization response.Plant Physiol. 2017; 173: 1258-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to determine the crystal structure of VIN3PHD to examine the shape of its putative histone-binding pockets. Here, we show that this PHD finger is flanked by a zinc finger (ZnF) and a four-helix bundle (4HB) and thus forms an integral part of a compact tripartite superdomain. This PHD superdomain is found only in one other family of proteins, namely the OBERON (OBE) proteins that function in the shoot and root meristems to control the growth of Arabidopsis plants (22Saiga S. Furumizu C. Yokoyama R. Kurata T. Sato S. Kato T. et al.The Arabidopsis OBERON1 and OBERON2 genes encode plant homeodomain finger proteins and are required for apical meristem maintenance.Development. 2008; 135: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Saiga S.

Saiga S. Abe M. Laux T. OBE3 and WUS interaction in shoot meristem stem cell regulation.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0155657Google Scholar). However, the PHD finger modules in OBE proteins exhibit a typical three-pronged pocket architecture found in histone-binding PHD fingers and we show using isothermal calorimetry (ITC) that the purified PHD superdomain of OBE1 binds to methylated histone H3 tails, as expected from its predicted pocket architecture. In contrast, the VIN3 PHD finger is markedly different from this architecture, and its putative histone-binding surface (‘front’ face) exhibits a positively charged patch that may prevent it from binding to positively charged histone tails. Indeed, using ITC and NMR spectroscopy, we were unable to detect binding of the purified VIN3 PHD superdomain nor of its minimal PHD finger to various modified and unmodified histone H3 tail peptides. This argues against a role of VEL proteins in histone H3 decoding. We provide evidence that their PHD superdomain can interact instead with negatively charged polymers such as DNA and RNA, supporting the notion that VEL PHD superdomains bind to nonhistone tail ligands bearing predominantly negative charges. We expressed a minimal fragment of Arabidopsis thaliana (At) VIN3 spanning its PHD signature (VIN3150-208) in Escherichia coli and purified this to homogeneity, but its crystallization was unsuccessful. We noticed that VEL PHD fingers are flanked by highly conserved sequences: their N-terminal flanking region contains four invariant cysteines, while their C-terminal flanks are predicted to be helical (Fig. 1A). We thus purified an extended fragment spanning the whole conserved region (VIN3116-307), but this proved to be toxic upon expression in E. coli. We next expressed the equivalent fragment from several other plants species and eventually succeeded in crystallizing the equivalent protein fragment (VIN3123-326) from the palm tree Phoenix dactilyfera (Pd). VIN3123-326 produced diffracting crystals under multiple conditions, whereby the best crystals diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution in space group P3121. We thus determined its structure by single wavelength anomalous dispersion using the intrinsic Zn2+ signals from ZnF and PHD (Table 1).Table 1Crystal data collection and refinement statisticsPdVIN3123-326PDB accession code7QCECrystal data Wavelength (Å)0.97934 Resolution (Å)50.78–2.1 (2.16–2.1) Space groupP 31 2 1Unit cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)58.64, 58.64, 225.40 α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 120.00 Total reflections535,114 (45,246) Unique reflections27,349 (2183) Multiplicity19.6 (20.7) Mean I/σ (I)13.3 (2.7) R merge (%)13.5 (151.8) CC 1/20.997 (0.810) Completeness (%)100 (100) Complexes in A.U2Refinement Resolution50.78–2.1 Number of reflections27,262 (2652) Rwork/Rfree (%)23.02–26.45 Nº of atoms2701 Protein2630 Ligand19 Water52Average B Factors (Å2) Wilson/overall43.73 Protein36.99 Ligand66.79 Water molecules51.30 All atoms37.37RMSDs deviations Bond lengths (Å)0.005 Bond angles (°)1.28Ramachandran plotStatistics (%) Favored regions98.81 Allowed regions1.19 Disallowed regions0Statistics for the highest-resolution shell are shown in parentheses.

VIN3123-326 forms a single compact domain, with an N-terminal ZnF and a C-terminal 4HB, packing tightly against the central PHD module (Fig. 1B). The topology of the α-helices in 4HB is up-down-up-down, with each helix packing in an antiparallel fashion against the preceding one, thereby forming two straight helical hairpins that associate with each other around a hydrophobic core (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). These cores are stabilized by Zn2+ ions (one in ZnF and two in PHD) that are coordinated by four conserved cysteines or by three cysteines and a histidine in the case of the first Zn2+ of the PHD finger (Fig. S1). This is the characteristic Cys4-His-Cys3 signature motif that defines classical PHD fingers (2Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. The PHD finger: implications for chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 3Bienz M. The PHD finger, a nuclear protein-interaction domain.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The interface between ZnF and PHD finger is relatively small and exhibits only a small number of interactions mediated by water molecules (Fig. 1E), while that between PHD and 4HB is more extensive and formed by conserved residues engaging in multiple hydrophobic and polar interactions (Fig. 1F). Notably, one of the key interacting residues in the latter interface is Phe216 (Fig. 1F), the aromatic residue upstream of the final two zinc-coordinating cysteines, which constitutes part of the PHD signature (2Aasland R.

Sci. 2006; 31: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Interestingly, its equivalents in classical PHD fingers, such as those from the Wnt signaling protein Pygo or from the lysine methyltransferase MLL1, are crucial in mediating interactions with nonhistone ligands (17Wang Z. Song J. Milne T.A. Wang G.G. Li H. Allis C.D. et al.Pro isomerization in MLL1 PHD3-bromo cassette connects H3K4me readout to CyP33 and HDAC-mediated repression.Cell. 2010; 141: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Miller T.C.

Biol. 2010; 401: 969-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This suggests a common role for this aromatic PHD signature residue in mediating cis or trans interactions with nonhistone protein modules. The domain organization and sequence conservation of the tripartite superdomain structure of VIN3123-326 implies that the same superdomain would be present in the other VEL paralogs, a notion confirmed by structural predictions by AlphaFold (27Jumper J.

We note that there are precedents of PHD fingers forming superstructures with flanking domains, for example, with bromodomains in the KAP1 corepressor and in several TRIM proteins (28Zeng L. Yap K.L.

Allis C.D. et al.Pro isomerization in MLL1 PHD3-bromo cassette connects H3K4me readout to CyP33 and HDAC-mediated repression.Cell. 2010; 141: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or with a ZnF module in the ubiquitin ligase UHRF1 (32Hu L.

Crystal structure of PHD domain of UHRF1 and insights into recognition of unmodified histone H3 arginine residue 2.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, our searches of known protein structures confirmed that the tripartite architecture of the VIN3123-326 superdomain with a PHD finger at its core and flanking ZnF and 4HB domains is unique and unprecedented. Given that the PHD superdomain fold of the VEL proteins is unique amongst known protein structures, we asked whether this fold might be present in proteins whose structure has not yet been determined. We therefore conducted a DALI search of protein structures predicted by AlphaFold (27Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronneberger O. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.Nature. 2021; 596: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (6920) Google Scholar), which identified a closely related PHD superdomain fold in a family of proteins called OBERON (OBE), comprising four paralogs in Arabidopsis. OBE proteins function in shoot and root meristems to control the growth of Arabidopsis plants, apparently by controlling the expression of a wide range of auxin-responsive genes (22Saiga S. Furumizu C. Yokoyama R. Kurata T. Sato S.

Saiga S. Abe M. Laux T. OBE3 and WUS interaction in shoot meristem stem cell regulation.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0155657Google Scholar). Sequence comparison between VEL and OBE proteins confirms that the spacing of the three subdomains (ZnF, PHD, and 4HB) is highly conserved between the two families, as are the positions of the zinc-coordinating cysteines and histidines (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the predicted fold of the OBE PHD superdomain is closely related to that of the VEL proteins (Fig. 2B), with low RMSD values for their backbones. For example, the RMSD values between the PHD superdomains of VIN3 and OBE1 is 3.13 Å and that between their PHD finger modules 1.46 Å, although we note an additional β-strand in the PHD fingers of all OBE family members, not present in VEL proteins (Fig. 2, A and B, compare to Fig 1A). Interestingly, while the PHD fingers of VEL proteins lack an aromatic pocket divider residue between the K4 and R2 pocket, which is critical for binding to methylated H3 tail in classical histone-binding PHD modules, OBE PHD fingers contain a tryptophan in this position (Figs. 2A and S2). The latter also exhibit a three-pronged pocket architecture typical of histone-binding PHD fingers (5Sanchez R. Zhou M.M. The PHD finger: a versatile epigenome reader.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 364-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 6Fiedler M. Sanchez-Barrena M.J. Nekrasov M. Mieszczanek J. Rybin V.

This suggests that the OBE but not the VEL PHD fingers contain functional histone H3-binding pockets that may underpin their function in gene control. Regarding the 4HB module, we note two main differences between VEL and OBE proteins. Firstly, the loops connecting individual α-helices are longer in VEL compared to OBE 4HB modules, whereby the loops between α2 and α3 are formed by five (VEL) instead of two residues (OBE), and those between α4 and α5 by 21 (VEL) instead of four residues (OBE), bulking out the distal end of the VEL 4HB modules, which thus tend to be larger than their OBE counterparts (Figs. 2 and 3A). The lengths of these loops at the distal 4HB ends are highly conserved within each family (Fig. 2A), pointing to functional significance. Notably, the long loops in the VEL proteins contain four highly conserved arginine residues (R242, R243, R294, and R299 in Pd VIN3) that are not present in their OBE counterparts (Fig. 2A). This arginine quadruplet forms a pronounced positively charged surface patch on the distal 4HB ends of VEL proteins (Fig. 3A). A striking feature of the VIN3 PHD superdomain is its extensive positive electrostatic surface potential. Indeed, positively charged surface patches are seen on both faces of the PHD superdomain, with one of these being located at the distal end of the 4HB module, as mentioned previously, and another extending across the PHD finger surface (Fig. 3A). The latter contrasts with the negative electrostatic surface potential typically found in canonical histone-binding PHD fingers (5Sanchez R. Zhou M.M. The PHD finger: a versatile epigenome reader.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 364-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 6Fiedler M. Sanchez-Barrena M.J. Nekrasov M.

It is also distinct from the PHD finger surface of the OBE proteins whose overall surface potential is negative (Figs. 2C and S2), compatible with binding to the positively charged histone H3 tail. The positively charged surface patch extending across the Pd VIN3 PHD finger is formed by basic amino acids from each of the three subdomains (R142 and R154 of ZnF; K167 of PHD; R232 and K233 of 4HB; Fig. 1A). Notably, basic residues in these locations of the three subdomains are near-invariant across different species (Fig. 4A). The same is true for the positively charged distal patch in the 4HB module (Fig. 3A) whose contributing four basic residues (R242, R243, R294, and R299 in Pd VIN3) are found throughout the plant kingdom, from flowering plants all the way to bryophytes (Fig. 4A). ConSurf analysis confirmed that the positive surface patches on the front face of the PHD superdomain are deeply conserved across species, coinciding with areas of highest conservation (Fig. 4B). To determine whether these deeply conserved positively charged residues of VEL PHD superdomains also form contiguous surface patches in PHD superdomains of distant species, we conducted AlphaFold structure predictions of these domains from angiosperms to algal species. Indeed, this confirmed that the backbones of the predicted structures are highly similar to our VIN3123-326 structure determined for the Phoenix protein, exhibiting low RMSD and high template-modeling (TM) score values between the experimentally determined structure and the AlphaFold predictions for other VEL PHD superdomains. In particular, the TM scores resulting from comparisons between different species range from 0.85 to 0.94 (Fig. 4C), whereby 1 indicates a perfect match between two structures. For example, the predicted fold of the PHD superdomain of the alga Chara braunii (Fig. 4D) closely resembles that of our crystal structure for the palm tree domain (Fig. 3A). This close resemblance of the folds amongst the different species allowed us to confirm that the deep conservation extends to the positively charged surface patch across the PHD finger and that located at the distal end of the 4HB subdomain, even though one of the arginines in the arginine quadruplet that constitutes this patch is missing in this algal species (Fig. 4A). We conclude that the front face of the VEL PHD superdomain is highly likely to exhibit positive surface potential even in evolutionary distant species, which suggests functional relevance of this striking feature, for example, in ligand binding. ITC is commonly used to monitor binding of histone H3 tail peptides to PHD fingers, which typically exhibit affinities in the low micromolar range (6Fiedler M. Sanchez-Barrena M.J. Nekrasov M.

https://openalex.org/W4297983764,"Tourism and nature-based recreation has changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions caused sharp declines in visitation numbers, particularly in remote areas, such as northern Norway. In addition, the pandemic may have altered human-nature relationships by changing visitor behaviour and preferences. We studied visitor numbers and behaviour in northern Norway, based on user-generated data, in the form of photographic material that was uploaded to the popular online platform Flickr. A total of 195.200 photographs, taken by 5.247 photographers were subjected to Google's ""Cloud Vision"" automatic content analysis algorithm. The resulting collection of labels that were assigned to each photograph was analysed in structural topic models, using photography date (relative to the start of the pandemic measures in Norway) and reported or estimated photographers' nationality as explanatory variables. Our results show that nature-based recreation relating to ""mountains"" and ""winter"" became more prevalent during the pandemic, amongst both domestic and international photographers. Shifts in preferences due to the pandemic outbreak strongly depended on nationality, with domestic visitors demonstrating a wide interest in topics while international visitors maintained their preference for nature-based experiences. Among those activities that suffered the most from decline in international tourism was northern lights and cruises as indicated by the topic models. On the other hand, images depicting mountains and flora and fauna increased their prevalence during the pandemic. Domestic visitors, on the other hand, spent more time in urban settings as a result of restrictions, which results in a higher prevalence of non-nature related images. Our results underscore the need to consider the dynamic nature of human-nature relationships. The contrast in flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and travel restrictions should be incorporated in collaborative efforts of municipalities and tour operators to develop sustainable local nature-based tourism products, particularly in remote areas."
https://openalex.org/W4297990424,"The Indonesian government has issued various policies to control COVID-19. However, COVID-19 new cases continued to increase, and there remain uncertainties as to the future trajectory. We aimed to investigate how medical and health academics view the Indonesian government’s handling of COVID-19 and which areas of health systems need to be prioritized to improve the government’s response to COVID-19. We conducted a modified Delphi study adapting the COVID-19 assessment scorecard (COVID-SCORE) as the measurement criteria. We invited medical and health academics from ten universities across Indonesia to take part in the two-round Delphi study. In the first round, participants were presented with 20 statements of COVID-SCORE and asked to rate their agreement with each statement using a five-point Likert scale. All participants who completed the first cycle were invited to participate in the second cycle. They had the opportunity to revise their answers based on the previous cycle’s results and ranked a list of actions to improve government response. We achieved a moderate consensus level for five statements, a low consensus level for 13 statements and no consensus for two statements. The prioritization suggested that top priorities for improving the government’s response to COVID-19 in Indonesia encompass: (1) strengthening capacity to ensure consistent, credible and targeted communication while adopting a more inclusive and empathic communication style to address public concerns; (2) ensuring universal access to reliable COVID-19 testing by expanding lab infrastructure, facilitating operational readiness, and scaling up implementation of proven alternative/complementary tests to RT-PCR; and (3) boosting contact tracing implementation capacity and facilitating contact tracing for all positive cases, involving key stakeholders in further development of the existing contact tracing system (i.e. PeduliLindungi) as well as its evaluation and quality assurance. Ultimately, our study highlights the importance of strengthening health system functions during the pandemic and improving health system resilience for dealing with future public health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4297990650,"Background There are conflicting results regarding the relationship between overweight/obesity and the outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), termed “the obesity paradox”. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of body mass index (BMI) on the midterm outcomes of CABG. Methods This historical cohort study included all patients who underwent isolated CABG at our center between 2007 and 2016. The patients were divided into five categories based on their preoperative BMIs (kg/m 2 ): 18.5≤BMI&lt;25, 25≤BMI&lt;30, 30≤BMI&lt;35, 35≤BMI&lt;40, and BMI≥40. Patients with BMIs below 18.5 kg/m 2 were excluded. The endpoints of this study were all-cause mortality and major adverse cardio-cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), comprising acute coronary syndromes, cerebrovascular accidents, and all-cause mortality at five years. For the assessment of the linearity of the relationship between continuous BMI and the outcomes, plots for time varying hazard ratio of BMI with outcomes were provided. Results Of 17 751 patients (BMI = 27.30 ±4.17 kg/m 2 ) who underwent isolated CABG at our center, 17 602 patients (mean age = 61.16±9.47 y, 75.4% male) were included in this study. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that patients with pre-obesity and normal weight had similar outcomes, whereas patients with preoperative BMIs exceeding 30 kg/m 2 kg/m 2 had a significantly higher risk of 5-year all-cause mortality and 5-year MACCEs than those with pre-obesity. Additionally, a positive association existed between obesity degree and all-cause mortality and MACCEs. Further, BMIs of 40 kg/m 2 or higher showed a trend toward higher MACCE risks (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.95), possibly due to the small sample size. A nonlinear, albeit negligible, association was also found between continuous BMI and the study endpoints. Conclusions Our findings suggest that preoperative obesity (BMI&gt;30 kg/m 2 ) in patients who survive early after CABG is associated with an increased risk of 5-year all-cause mortality and 5-year MACCEs. These findings indicate that physicians and cardiac surgeons should encourage patients with high BMIs to reduce weight for risk modification."

This study had two aims: (1) to identify changes in family coping-strategy profiles among parents pre- and during the first COVID-19 lockdown and (2) to analyze interactions between the clusters of coping strategies pre-COVID with FQOL during the first lockdown. A sample of 253 parents (58.5% mothers) of children (3 to 18 yr old) completed the Family Pandemic Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales and the FQOL Scale about their family life pre- and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Four family coping-strategy clusters were found. Differences were found between those clusters pre- and during the first COVID-19 lockdown, with a high percentage of families using the positive appraisal strategy more often. Significant interactions were found between the family coping-strategy clusters pre-COVID-19 and the FQOL factors before and during the pandemic. Most families maintained their FQOL levels during the first lockdown. Close and frequent interactions between family members had relationships with positive emotions and significant effects on well-being. Results showed that positive cognitive appraisal was a protective factor against a significant decrease in FQOL during the first COVID-19 lockdown."

Retromer has been implicated in other cellular processes, including mitochondrial homeostasis, nutrient sensing, autophagy, and fission events. Mechanisms for mammalian retromer assembly remain undefined, and retromer engages multiple sorting nexin proteins to sort cargoes to different destinations. Published structures demonstrate mammalian retromer forms oligomers in vitro, but several structures were poorly resolved. We report here improved retromer oligomer structures using single-particle cryo-EM by combining data collected from tilted specimens with multiple advancements in data processing, including using a 3D starting model for enhanced automated particle picking in RELION. We used a retromer mutant (3KE retromer) that breaks VPS35-mediated interfaces to determine a structure of a new assembly interface formed by the VPS26A and VPS35 N-termini. The interface reveals how an N-terminal VPS26A arrestin saddle can link retromer chains by engaging a neighboring VPS35 N- terminus, on the opposite side from the well-characterized C-VPS26/N-VPS35 interaction observed within heterotrimers. The new interaction interface exhibits substantial buried surface area (∼7000 Å2) and further suggests that metazoan retromer may serve as an adaptable scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W4297399473,"The cellular response to hypoxia is regulated through enzymatic oxygen sensors, including the prolyl hydroxylases, which control degradation of the well-known hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). Other enzymatic oxygen sensors have been recently identified, including members of the KDM histone demethylase family. Little is known about how different oxygen-sensing pathways interact and if this varies depending on the form of hypoxia, such as chronic or intermittent. In this study, we investigated how two proposed cellular oxygen-sensing systems, HIF-1 and KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C, respond in cells exposed to rapid forms of intermittent hypoxia (minutes) and compared to chronic hypoxia (hours). We found that intermittent hypoxia increases HIF-1α protein through a pathway distinct from chronic hypoxia, involving the KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C histone lysine demethylases. Intermittent hypoxia increases the quantity and activity of KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C, resulting in a decrease in histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) trimethylation near the HIF1A locus. We demonstrate that this contrasts with chronic hypoxia, which decreases KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C activity, leading to hypertrimethylation of H3K9 globally and at the HIF1A locus. Altogether, we found that demethylation of histones bound to the HIF1A gene in intermittent hypoxia increases HIF1A mRNA expression, which has the downstream effect of increasing overall HIF-1 activity and expression of HIF target genes.

Chronic hypoxia is common in solid tumors and is associated with treatment resistance and aggressive disease (1Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factors: mediators of cancer progression and targets for cancer therapy.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2012; 33: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Along with chronically hypoxic regions, solid tumors contain regions of intermittent hypoxia, which arise from fluctuations in perfusion and red blood cell flux (2Saxena K. Jolly M.K. Acute vs. Chronic vs. Cyclic hypoxia: their differential dynamics, molecular mechanisms, and effects on tumor progression.Biomolecules. 2019; 9: 339Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Systemic intermittent hypoxia also occurs in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common disorder characterized by repetitive interruptions in breathing during sleep due to collapse of the upper airway. Like chronic hypoxia, perfusion-limited intermittent hypoxia and OSA-induced intermittent hypoxia have been shown to promote a more malignant tumor phenotype, despite the different range of time scales for the hypoxic periods (3Hunyor I.

While there is no precise definition of the time periods for chronic or intermittent hypoxia, chronic hypoxia is generally defined as sustained low oxygen lasting for hours, while intermittent or cyclical hypoxia involves intermittent periods of low oxygen varying from minutes to hours/days punctuated by periods of increased oxygenation (2Saxena K.

Acute vs. Chronic vs. Cyclic hypoxia: their differential dynamics, molecular mechanisms, and effects on tumor progression.Biomolecules. 2019; 9: 339Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The cellular response to chronic hypoxia is largely coordinated by hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). HIF is controlled by the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) oxygen-sensing enzymes, which use oxygen to hydroxylate HIF-α subunits, targeting them for degradation. Factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) also uses oxygen to hydroxylate HIF-α subunits, which blocks binding to the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP. In the presence of insufficient oxygen, PHD and FIH activity substantially decreases, enabling HIF-α to bind to HIF-β and initiate the transcription of target genes (5Choudhry H. Harris A.L. Advances in hypoxia-inducible factor biology.Cell Metab. 2018; 27: 281-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Similar to chronic hypoxia, longer periods of intermittent hypoxia (hours to days) have been shown to increase HIF-1 activity (3Hunyor I. Cook K.M. Models of intermittent hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea: molecular pathways and their contribution to cancer.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2018; 315: R669-R687Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HIF-1α also increases in the carotid body in response to rapid intermittent hypoxia (minutes) using sleep apnea models through activation of mTOR and impaired prolyl hydroxylation. In contrast, HIF-2α decreases in the carotid body in rapid intermittent hypoxia through increased degradation by Ca2+-activated calpain proteases (6Prabhakar N.R. Semenza G.L. Regulation of carotid body oxygen sensing by hypoxia-inducible factors.Pflügers Archiv. 2016; 468: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Epigenetic modifications of histones are also involved in the response to chronic hypoxia (7Hancock R.L. Dunne K. Walport L.J. Flashman E. Kawamura A. Epigenetic regulation by histone demethylases in hypoxia.Epigenomics. 2015; 7: 791-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the nucleus of cells, DNA is wrapped around octamers of histone proteins and organized into chromatin. Methylation of histone tail lysine residues alters the accessibility of chromatin to transcription factors and therefore the expression of genes (8Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8298) Google Scholar). Histone lysines can be monomethylated, dimethylated, or trimethylated, and these modifications can be gene activating or repressive depending on the location of the modified amino acid residue and the degree of methylation (7Hancock R.L. Dunne K. Walport L.J. Flashman E. Kawamura A. Epigenetic regulation by histone demethylases in hypoxia.Epigenomics. 2015; 7: 791-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Histone methylation levels are a balance between methylation by histone methyltransferases, known as KMTs, and demethylation by histone lysine demethylases known as KDMs (or JmjCs). KDMs belong to the same family of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)–dependent oxygenases as the PHDs and they require 2OG, oxygen, and Fe(II) to maintain their demethylase activity (7Hancock R.L. Dunne K. Walport L.J. Flashman E. Kawamura A. Epigenetic regulation by histone demethylases in hypoxia.Epigenomics. 2015; 7: 791-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Specific members of the KDM family have been found to act as enzymatic oxygen sensors, including KDM4A (9Hancock R.L. Masson N. Dunne K. Flashman E. Kawamura A. The activity of JmjC histone lysine demethylase KDM4A is highly sensitive to oxygen concentrations.ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), KDM5A (10Batie M. Frost J. Frost M. Wilson J.W. Schofield P. Rocha S. Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin.Science. 2019; 363: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and KDM6A (11Chakraborty A.A. Laukka T. Myllykoski M. Ringel A.E. Booker M.A. Tolstorukov M.Y. et al.Histone demethylase KDM6A directly senses oxygen to control chromatin and cell fate.Science. 2019; 363: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), meaning that their activity is affected by changes in physiologically relevant oxygen levels. Chronic hypoxia inhibits KDM activity resulting in global hypermethylation of multiple histone lysine residues, altering the expression of several genes (10Batie M. Frost J. Frost M. Wilson J.W. Schofield P. Rocha S. Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin.Science. 2019; 363: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Chakraborty A.A. Laukka T. Myllykoski M. Ringel A.E. Booker M.A. Tolstorukov M.Y. et al.Histone demethylase KDM6A directly senses oxygen to control chromatin and cell fate.Science. 2019; 363: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no one has examined how KDMs behave in intermittent hypoxia or how KDMs interact with the HIF pathway under these conditions. In this study, we describe a unique role for the KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C histone demethylases in regulating the expression of HIF1A and therefore controlling the HIF-1 response in rapid intermittent hypoxia. This pathway is distinct from the canonical oxygen-dependent degradation pathway and does not occur in chronic hypoxia. We have previously shown that HIF-1α protein and HIF-1 target gene expression increases in intermittent hypoxia (5 min/5 min cycles) in HCT116 cells (12Martinez C. Kerr B. Jin C. Cistulli P. Cook K. Obstructive sleep apnea activates HIF-1 in a hypoxia dose-dependent manner in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 445Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To examine if this is a generalized cellular response, we exposed MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and PC3 cells to 18 h of intermittent hypoxia (alternating 5 min/5 min cycles of normoxia/hypoxia (see Fig. S8 for pericellular oxygen measurements) and compared the results to 18 h of normoxia (12% O2 v/v) or chronic hypoxia (0.5% O2 v/v). Relative to normoxia, HIF-1α protein increased under both chronic and intermittent hypoxia but to a lesser extent in intermittent hypoxia, similar to HCT116 cells (12Martinez C. Kerr B. Jin C. Cistulli P. Cook K. Obstructive sleep apnea activates HIF-1 in a hypoxia dose-dependent manner in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 445Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We also found that expression of select HIF-1 target genes increased (Fig. S1). Overall, the increase in HIF-1α and HIF target gene expression in chronic and intermittent hypoxia supports the idea that HIF-1 is activated as a general response to both forms of hypoxia, and as we showed previously, the degree of gene expression is related to a hypoxia dose-dependent effect (12Martinez C. Kerr B. Jin C. Cistulli P. Cook K. Obstructive sleep apnea activates HIF-1 in a hypoxia dose-dependent manner in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 445Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To assess how different protocols of intermittent hypoxia affect HIF-1α protein levels, we tested various lengths of normoxia, followed by an identical length of hypoxia, which was cycled for 18 h and compared to 18 h of normoxia or chronic hypoxia (see Experimental procedures for further details). As shown in Figure 1B, all tested periods of intermittent hypoxia (3 min/3 min, 5 min/5 min, 8 min/8 min, and 12 min/12 min, see Fig. S8 for pericellular oxygen measurements) increased HIF-1α protein to an intermediate level between normoxia and chronic hypoxia. This indicates that various short periods of intermittent hypoxia result in an increase in HIF-1α. Expression of the HIF1A gene is believed to be constitutive under most conditions (13Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Guénet J.-L. Gassmann M. Nucleotide sequence, chromosomal assignment and mRNA expression of mouse hypoxia-inducible factor-1α.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), though exposure to chronic hypoxia dampens HIF1A expression (14Cavadas M.A. Mesnieres M. Crifo B. Manresa M.C. Selfridge A.C. Scholz C.C. et al.REST mediates resolution of HIF-dependent gene expression in prolonged hypoxia.Sci. Rep. 2015; 517851Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Having identified that HIF-1 activity increases in a wide range of cells exposed to intermittent hypoxia, we wanted to know if HIF1A mRNA expression was affected by intermittent hypoxia or if regulation of HIF-1α protein levels was occurring primarily through the oxygen-dependent posttranslational modifications pathway as in chronic hypoxia. We found that intermittent hypoxia increases HIF1A mRNA in HCT116 cells ((12Martinez C. Kerr B. Jin C. Cistulli P. Cook K. Obstructive sleep apnea activates HIF-1 in a hypoxia dose-dependent manner in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 445Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Fig. 1C) and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1C) when compared to normoxia. In contrast, when cells are exposed to chronic hypoxia, expression of HIF1A mRNA decreases (Fig. 1C). We also compared the levels of HIF1A mRNA in brain (U251), prostate (PC3), and additional breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines following exposure to normoxia, chronic, and intermittent hypoxia (Fig. S2). All cell lines showed a similar decrease in HIF1A mRNA in chronic hypoxia and an increase in HIF1A mRNA following intermittent hypoxia relative to normoxia. We also measured EPAS1 (HIF-2α) expression following intermittent and chronic hypoxia to determine if expression was regulated in a similar manner to HIF1A and found that it was not (Fig. S3). To assess how different protocols of intermittent hypoxia affected HIF1A gene expression, we tested the same cycling periods of intermittent hypoxia as shown in Figure 1B and measured HIF1A expression in MCF7 cells following exposure. All intermittent hypoxia protocols (5 min/5 min, 8 min/8 min, and 12 min/12 min) significantly increased HIF1A expression when compared to normoxia and chronic hypoxia, except 3 min/3 min, which did not change from normoxia (Fig. 1D). This indicates that expression of HIF1A is controlled differently in chronic hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia and this effect can depend on the period of the intermittent hypoxic cycles. The 5 min/5 min cycles of intermittent hypoxia promoted the largest increase in HIF1A mRNA. To determine whether the increase in HIF-1α in intermittent hypoxia is dependent on the increase in HIF1A mRNA (Fig. 1C), HCT116 cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, followed by either chronic or intermittent hypoxia for 6 h. CHX blocks de novo protein synthesis, therefore HIF-1α levels would reflect protein stabilization and degradation processes. As shown in Figure 1E, CHX reduced HIF-1α protein levels in both chronic and intermittent hypoxia, indicating that HIF-1α accumulation is dependent on continuous protein synthesis in both forms of hypoxia. This also suggests that HIF-1α still undergoes some proteasomal degradation in the presence of either form of hypoxia, though the rate of degradation under individual conditions may vary. Based on Figure 1E, the increase in HIF-1α observed in the absence of CHX for both chronic and intermittent hypoxia was due, at least in part, to new protein synthesis. To further explore HIF-1α protein degradation in intermittent and chronic hypoxia, we treated HCT116 cells with MG262, a proteasome inhibitor followed by exposure to normoxia, chronic hypoxia, and intermittent hypoxia for 18 h. The proteasome is the primary degradation pathway for HIF-1α and by using MG262, we can observe how chronic and intermittent hypoxia affect HIF-1α protein expression without competing degradation processes affecting the final protein quantity. When normoxic HCT116 cells were treated with MG262 (Fig. 1F), HIF-1α accumulated due to blocked oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent proteasomal degradation (lane 2). In chronic hypoxia, HIF-1α was stabilized (lane 3) and the addition of MG262 slightly increased HIF-1α protein (lane 4), confirming that low levels of proteasomal degradation still occurs in chronic hypoxia. In intermittent hypoxia, there were lower levels of HIF-1α protein (lane 5) when compared to chronic hypoxia (lane 3) but still more than in normoxia (lane 1, see overexposed blot, Fig. 1F). However, when MG262 is added to cells under intermittent hypoxia (lane 6), HIF-1α accumulated well above the observed level in chronic hypoxia, so much so that it was difficult to capture all conditions within the dynamic range of chemiluminescent detection. This indicates that more proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α occurs in intermittent hypoxia than in chronic hypoxia, which explains the lower HIF-1α levels in intermittent hypoxia relative to chronic hypoxia. Taken together with the HIF1A mRNA (Fig. 1, C and D) and CHX (Fig. 1E) data, this result also suggests that the increase in HIF1A mRNA expression in intermittent hypoxia directly contributes to the levels of HIF-1α protein, and when competing degradation processes are inhibited, this leads to a greater increase in HIF-1α (Fig. 1F). These results led us to hypothesize that an increase in HIF1A mRNA synthesis in intermittent hypoxia (which does not occur in chronic hypoxia) enables a more robust HIF-1 response to a severe hypoxic event following intermittent hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we exposed MCF7 cells to 18 h of normoxia, chronic hypoxia, or intermittent hypoxia that was immediately followed by an additional acute period of chronic hypoxia (4 h of chronic hypoxia) (total of 22 h). As expected, 18 h of normoxia showed no HIF-1α (Fig. 1G, lane 1). The addition of 4 h of chronic hypoxia following 18 h of normoxia led to a substantial increase in HIF-1α (lane 2), similar to the amount of HIF-1α present after 18 h of chronic hypoxia (lane 3). Eighteen hours of intermittent hypoxia led to a moderate increase in HIF-1α (see overexposed blot lane 4, Fig. 1G). However, the largest increase of HIF-1α in any of the conditions occurred when cells were exposed to 18 h of intermittent hypoxia followed by 4 h of chronic hypoxia (lane 5). Similar to the MG262 data, this experiment demonstrates that the increased HIF1A mRNA in intermittent hypoxia is translated into higher levels of HIF-1α protein, though in intermittent hypoxia some of this is likely degraded via oxygen-dependent degradation. When oxygen-dependent degradation is halted following intermittent hypoxia exposure, via a brief exposure to more severe chronic hypoxia, there is potential for a more robust HIF-1α response due to the increased level of HIF1A expression and protein synthesis generated by the preceding intermittent hypoxia. We identified that intermittent hypoxia increases HIF1A mRNA expression, while chronic hypoxia dampens HIF1A mRNA expression, indicating differential regulation depending on the type of hypoxic exposure. Histone methylation patterns alter the expression of genes and chronic hypoxia is associated with histone hypermethylation (7Hancock R.L. Dunne K. Walport L.J. Flashman E. Kawamura A. Epigenetic regulation by histone demethylases in hypoxia.Epigenomics. 2015; 7: 791-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Batie M. Frost J. Frost M. Wilson J.W. Schofield P. Rocha S. Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin.Science. 2019; 363: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Chakraborty A.A. Laukka T. Myllykoski M. Ringel A.E.

Furthermore, the methylation status of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) has been previously linked to expression of the HIF1A gene (15Dobrynin G. McAllister T.E. Leszczynska K.B. Ramachandran S. Krieg A.J. Kawamura A. et al.KDM4A regulates HIF-1 levels through H3K9me3.Sci. Rep. 2017; 711094Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), therefore we measured H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) following exposure to normoxia, chronic hypoxia, and intermittent hypoxia. In agreement with previous studies (10Batie M. Frost J. Frost M. Wilson J.W. Schofield P. Rocha S. Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin.Science. 2019; 363: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Dobrynin G. McAllister T.E. Leszczynska K.B. Ramachandran S. Krieg A.J. Kawamura A. et al.KDM4A regulates HIF-1 levels through H3K9me3.Sci. Rep. 2017; 711094Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we found that H3K9me3 increases in MCF7, HCT116, and MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to chronic hypoxia relative to normoxia (Fig. 1H). Surprisingly, and in contrast to chronic hypoxia, we found that intermittent hypoxia decreased levels of H3K9me3 below the levels observed in normoxia (Fig. 1H). H3K9me3 is associated with heterochromatin and gene silencing; therefore a global decrease in H3K9me3 induced by intermittent hypoxia is likely resulting in an increase in expression of associated genes. To determine how the observed H3K9me3 changes affect other H3K9 methylation states, we measured monomethylation and dimethylation of H3K9 in MCF7 cells following exposure to the 5 min/5 min intermittent hypoxia protocol, which yielded the greatest fold increase in HIF1A mRNA. We found that global H3K9me2 levels slightly decreased following intermittent hypoxia (Fig. S4), while global H3K9me1 levels remained the same. To assess how varying periods of intermittent hypoxia affect H3K9me3, we measured trimethylation levels in MCF7 cells following varying lengths of alternating normoxia and hypoxia. We found that 5 min/5 min, 8 min/8 min, and 12 min/12 min intermittent hypoxia cycles all decreased global H3K9me3 as compared to chronic hypoxia (Fig. 1I). Interestingly, 3 min/3 min cycles did not decrease H3K9me3 (Fig. 1I) and this corresponds with no increase in HIF1A mRNA under the same conditions (Fig. 1D). H3K9me3 is a repressive marker for HIF1A gene expression in chronic hypoxia (15Dobrynin G. McAllister T.E. Leszczynska K.B. Ramachandran S. Krieg A.J. Kawamura A. et al.KDM4A regulates HIF-1 levels through H3K9me3.Sci. Rep. 2017; 711094Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether the decrease in H3K9me3 in intermittent hypoxia (Fig. 1H) was specifically occurring at the HIF1A gene locus, we carried out a chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay using MCF7 cells. Following exposure to normoxia, chronic hypoxia, and intermittent hypoxia, cells were lysed and H3K9me3 was immunoprecipitated. Coimmunoprecipitated DNA was purified and then subjected to qPCR using primers designed to detect HIF1A introns. For all regions measured, we found an increased quantity of the HIF1A gene in chronic hypoxia compared to normoxia (Fig. 1J). This indicates enrichment of H3K9me3 at the HIF1A gene in chronic hypoxia and supports previous work done in RKO cells (15Dobrynin G. McAllister T.E. Leszczynska K.B. Ramachandran S. Krieg A.J. Kawamura A. et al.KDM4A regulates HIF-1 levels through H3K9me3.Sci. Rep. 2017; 711094Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was a decrease in immunoprecipitated HIF1A in intermittent hypoxia compared to normoxia (Fig. 1J), indicating a loss of H3K9me3 at the HIF1A gene. Trimethyl (me3) (and dimethyl, me2) marks can be removed from H3K9 by the KDM4 demethylase subfamily, therefore we focused our attention on this group of enzymes. KDM4 enzymes require oxygen to function and belong to the same 2-OG-dependent family of oxygenases as the PHDs (7Hancock R.L. Dunne K. Walport L.J. Flashman E. Kawamura A. Epigenetic regulation by histone demethylases in hypoxia.Epigenomics. 2015; 7: 791-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C have a low affinity for oxygen with Km values measuring in a similar range as the PHD oxygen sensors (9Hancock R.L. Masson N. Dunne K. Flashman E. Kawamura A.

A. 2009; 106: 4260-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C would lose activity in chronic hypoxia (increasing H3K9me3), while retaining activity in intermittent hypoxia due to sufficient periodic oxygenation, enabling ongoing demethylation of H3K9 similar to normoxia. Furthermore, if intermittent hypoxia increases expression of the HIF-target genes, KDM4B and KDM4C, as was seen with other HIF-target genes in Fig. S1, then this could lead to further H3K9 demethylase activity, even beyond the levels seen in normoxia. To test this hypothesis, we exposed MCF7, HCT116, and MDA-MB-231 cells to normoxia, chronic hypoxia, and intermittent hypoxia and assessed the expression of KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C protein and mRNA. We found no changes in the protein levels of KDM4A in cells exposed to normoxia, chronic hypoxia, or intermittent hypoxia (Fig. 2A). In contrast, protein levels of KDM4B and KDM4C rose substantially in chronic hypoxia and to an intermediate level in intermittent hypoxia (Fig. 2A). KDM4A mRNA levels decreased in chronic hypoxia and did not change from normoxia in intermittent hypoxia, supporting previous data indicating that KDM4A is not a HIF-target gene or induced by hypoxia (7Hancock R.L. Dunne K. Walport L.J. Flashman E. Kawamura A. Epigenetic regulation by histone demethylases in hypoxia.Epigenomics. 2015; 7: 791-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Expression of KDM4B and KDM4C mRNA increased in a similar pattern to the results in Fig. S1, where the strongest increase in HIF-target gene expression occurred under chronic hypoxia and a moderate increase in HIF-target gene expression occurred under intermittent hypoxia (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that under chronic and intermittent hypoxia, there are increased protein levels of KDM4B and KDM4C enzymes, with stable levels of KDM4A. To confirm that the increase in KDM4B and KDM4C in intermittent hypoxia is HIF-dependent, like it has been shown in chronic hypoxia (17Beyer S. Kristensen M.M. Jensen K.S. Johansen J.V. Staller P.

Knockdown with HIF1A siRNA significantly decreased mRNA expression of HIF1A in chronic and intermittent hypoxia, which led to a significant reduction in KDM4B and KDM4C but not KDM4A mRNA levels (Fig. S5"
https://openalex.org/W4297399549,"Chloroplast FoF1-ATP synthase (CFoCF1) uses an electrochemical gradient of protons across the thylakoid membrane (ΔμH+) as an energy source in the ATP synthesis reaction. CFoCF1 activity is regulated by the redox state of a Cys pair on its central axis, that is, the γ subunit (CF1-γ). When the ΔμH+ is formed by the photosynthetic electron transfer chain under light conditions, CF1-γ is reduced by thioredoxin (Trx), and the entire CFoCF1 enzyme is activated. The redox regulation of CFoCF1 is a key mechanism underlying the control of ATP synthesis under light conditions. In contrast, the oxidative deactivation process involving CFoCF1 has not been clarified. In the present study, we analyzed the oxidation of CF1-γ by two physiological oxidants in the chloroplast, namely the proteins Trx-like 2 and atypical Cys-His-rich Trx. Using the thylakoid membrane containing the reduced form of CFoCF1, we were able to assess the CF1-γ oxidation ability of these Trx-like proteins. Our kinetic analysis indicated that these proteins oxidized CF1-γ with a higher efficiency than that achieved by a chemical oxidant and typical chloroplast Trxs. Additionally, the CF1-γ oxidation rate due to Trx-like proteins and the affinity between them were changed markedly when ΔμH+ formation across the thylakoid membrane was manipulated artificially. Collectively, these results indicate that the formation status of the ΔμH+ controls the redox regulation of CFoCF1 to prevent energetic disadvantages in plants."

What are the affected cellular pathways and are they dependent on the genetic background of the mouse model? Design Female Swiss (outbred) and C57BL/6N (B6, inbred) mice were fed either a control (10% fat) or HF/HS (60% fat, 20% fructose) diet. Body weight was measured weekly. Mice were sacrificed at 3 days (3d), 1 week (1w), 4w, 8w, 12w and 16w on the diet (n = 5 per treatment per time point). Total cholesterol concentrations and inflammatory cytokines were measured in serum. Oviductal epithelial cells (OECs) were used to study the expression of genes involved in (mitochondrial) oxidative stress (OS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation using qPCR. Results Body weight and blood cholesterol increased significantly in the HF/HS mice in both strains compared to controls. In Swiss mice, HF/HS diet acutely increased ER-stress and OS-related genes in the OECs already after 3d. Subsequently, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic antioxidants were upregulated and ER-stress was alleviated at 1w. After 4-8w (mid-phase), the expression of ER-stress and OS-related genes was increased again and persisted throughout the late-phase (12-16w). Serum inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory marker-gene expression in the OECs were increased only in the late-phase. Some of the OEC stress responses were stronger or earlier in the B6. Conclusions OECs are sensitive to an obesogenic diet and may exhibit acute stress responses already after a few days of feeding. This may impact the oviductal microenvironment and contribute to diet-induced subfertility."
https://openalex.org/W4297983652,"Coastal wetlands are ecosystems associated with intense carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) recycling, modulated by salinity and other environmental factors that influence the microbial community involved in greenhouse gases production and consumption. In this study, we evaluated the influence of environmental factors on GHG concentration and benthic microbial community composition in coastal wetlands along the coast of the semiarid region. Wetlands were situated in landscapes along a south-north gradient of higher aridity and lower anthropogenic impact. Our results indicate that wetlands have a latitudinal variability associated with higher organic matter content at the north, especially in summer, and higher nutrient concentration at the south, predominantly in winter. During our sampling, wetlands were characterized by positive CO2 μM and CH4 nM excess, and a shift of N2O nM excess from negative to positive values from the north to the south. Benthic microbial communities were taxonomically diverse with > 60 phyla, especially in low frequency taxa. Highly abundant bacterial phyla were classified into Gammaproteobacteria (Betaproteobacteria order), Alphaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, including key functional groups such as nitrifying and methanotrophic bacteria. Generalized additive model (GAM) indicated that conductivity accounted for the larger variability of CH4 and CO2, but the predictions of CH4 and CO2 concentration were improved when latitude and pH concentration were included. Nitrate and latitude were the best predictors to account for the changes in the dissolved N2O distribution. Structural equation modeling (SEM), illustrated how the environment significantly influences functional microbial groups (nitrifiers and methane oxidizers) and their resulting effect on GHG distribution. Our results highlight the combined role of salinity and substrates of key functional microbial groups with metabolisms associated with both carbon and nitrogen, influencing dissolved GHG and their potential exchange in natural and anthropogenically impacted coastal wetlands."
https://openalex.org/W4297983817,"Ticks are the most important vectors of zoonotic disease-causing pathogens in North America and Europe. Many tick species are expanding their geographic range. Although correlational evidence suggests that climate change is driving the range expansion of ticks, experimental evidence is necessary to develop a mechanistic understanding of ticks' response to a range of climatic conditions. Previous experiments used simulated microclimates, but these protocols require hazardous salts or expensive laboratory equipment to manipulate humidity. We developed a novel, safe, stable, convenient, and economical method to isolate individual ticks and manipulate their microclimates. The protocol involves placing individual ticks in plastic tubes, and placing six tubes along with a commercial two-way humidity control pack in an airtight container. We successfully used this method to investigate how humidity affects survival and host-seeking (questing) behavior of three tick species: the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), and black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis). We placed 72 adult females of each species individually into plastic tubes and separated them into three experimental relative humidity (RH) treatments representing distinct climates: 32% RH, 58% RH, and 84% RH. We assessed the survival and questing behavior of each tick for 30 days. In all three species, survivorship significantly declined in drier conditions. Questing height was negatively associated with RH in Amblyomma, positively associated with RH in Dermacentor, and not associated with RH in Ixodes. The frequency of questing behavior increased significantly with drier conditions for Dermacentor but not for Amblyomma or Ixodes. This report demonstrates an effective method for assessing the viability and host-seeking behavior of tick vectors of zoonotic diseases under different climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4297983826,"Most of currently available electroencephalographic (EEG)-based tools to assess depth of anaesthesia have not been studied or have been judged unreliable in pigs. Our primary aim was to investigate the dose-effect relationship between increasing propofol dose and variables generated by the EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitor Sedline in pigs. A secondary aim was to compare the anaesthetic doses with clinical outcomes commonly used to assess depth of anaesthesia in this species. Sixteen juvenile pigs were included. Propofol infusion was administered at 10 mg kg-1 h-1, increased by 10 mg kg-1 h-1 every 15 minutes, and stopped when an EEG Suppression ratio >80% was reached. Patient state index, suppression ratio, left and right spectral edge frequency 95%, and outcomes from commonly used clinical methods to assess depth of anaesthesia in pigs were recorded. The best pharmacodynamic model was assessed for Patient state index, suppression ratio, left and right spectral edge frequency 95% in response to propofol administration. The decrease of Patient state index best fitted to an inhibitory double-sigmoid model (including a plateau phase). The increase of suppression ratio fitted a typical sigmoid Emax model. No relevant relationship could be identified between spectral edge frequency 95% values and propofol administration. A large variability in clinical outcomes was observed among pigs, such that they did not provide a reliable evaluation of propofol dose. The relationship between propofol dose and Patient state index/suppression ratio described in the present study can be used for prediction in future investigations. The evaluation of depth of anaesthesia based on common clinical outcomes was not reliable."
https://openalex.org/W4297983853,"The ethical discourse surrounding patients' agential capacities, vis-à-vis their active participation in shared decision-making (SDM) in forensic psychiatric (FP) contexts, is an unexplored area of inquiry. The aim of this paper is to explore caregivers' perceptions of patient agential capacities and institutional pathways and barriers to person centered care (PCC) in the context of FP. Following an exploratory qualitative design, we conducted eight semi-structured interviews with hands-on caregivers at an in-patient FP facility in Sweden. A deductive framework method of analysis was employed, and four themes emerged: ""Fundamental Variability in Patient Capacity"", ""Patient Participation: Narration or Compliance?"", ""Antagonism Rooted in Power Struggles"", and ""System Structure Thwarts Patient Release"". While the results generally paint a bleak picture for the possibility of a person-centered FP care, we describe a constrained version of PCC with high-level SDM dynamics which promotes a certain degree of patient empowerment while allowing care strategies, within set restrictions, to promote patient adherence and treatment progress."
https://openalex.org/W4297984143,"Russeting is a cosmetic defect of some fruit skins. Russeting (botanically: induction of periderm formation) can result from various environmental factors including wounding and surface moisture. The objective was to compare periderms resulting from wounding with those from exposure to moisture in developing apple fruit. Wounding or moisture exposure both resulted in cuticular microcracking. Cross-sections revealed suberized hypodermal cell walls by 4 d, and the start of periderm formation by 8 d after wounding or moisture treatment. The expression of selected target genes was similar in wound and moisture induced periderms. Transcription factors involved in the regulation of suberin (MYB93) and lignin (MYB42) synthesis, genes involved in the synthesis (CYP86B1) and the transport (ABCG20) of suberin monomers and two uncharacterized transcription factors (NAC038 and NAC058) were all upregulated in induced periderm samples. Genes involved in cutin (GPAT6, SHN3) and wax synthesis (KCS10, WSD1, CER6) and transport of cutin monomers and wax components (ABCG11) were all downregulated. Levels of typical suberin monomers (ω-hydroxy-C20, -C22 and -C24 acids) and total suberin were high in the periderms, but low in the cuticle. Periderms were induced only when wounding occurred during early fruit development (32 and 66 days after full bloom (DAFB)) but not later (93 DAFB). Wound and moisture induced periderms are very similar morphologically, histologically, compositionally and molecularly."
https://openalex.org/W4297984229,"Introduction Maxillofacial trauma can be limited to superficial lacerations, abrasions, and facial bone fractures. The objective of this study was to determine the etiology, pattern, and predictors of soft tissue and bony injuries. Materials and methods This study was conducted in the department of maxillofacial surgery Lady Reading hospital Pakistan from Jan 2019 to June 2021. The nonprobability consecutive sampling technique was used for the selection of patients. All patients were assessed clinically and radiologically. The neurosensory examination was done for any altered sensation, anesthesia, or paresthesia. Motor nerve function was also assessed clinically. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26. The etiology and pattern of maxillofacial trauma were stratified among age and genders using the chi-square test to see effect modifiers. Tests for regression analysis were also applied. P≤0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 253 patients meeting inclusion criteria were included in this study. The majority of these patients were males, 223 (88.1%), while only 30 (11.9%) were females. The mean age for the group was 25.4 ± 12.6 years. RTAs were the most common causes of trauma (63.6%) followed by assault (15.0%), falls (11.5%), FAIs (5.9%), and sports (0.4%). The most vulnerable skeletal part was the mandible (22.9%) followed by Zygoma (7.1%), significantly predicted by RTAs. Soft tissue laceration analysis showed a high frequency of multiple lacerations (38%) significantly predicted by FAIs. The frequency of trigeminal nerve injury was 5.5% (14 patients) and that of the facial nerve was 1.6% (4 patients). The strongest association of nerve injury was with firearm injury (47%), followed by road traffic accidents and sports injuries. Conclusion Road traffic accident was the most common etiological factor and mandible fracture was commonly predicted by RTA. Trigeminal nerve injuries were common, frequency of nerve injuries was highly associated with mandible fracture and was predicted by FAI."
https://openalex.org/W4297990647,"Sugar plays a vital role in the structural and functional characteristics of cells. Hence, the interaction of NPs with cell membranes in the presence of sugar concentrations is important for medicinal and pharmacological innovations. This study integrated three tools: giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), anionic magnetite nanoparticles (NPs), and sugar concentrations, to understand a simplified mechanism for interactions between the vesicle membranes and NPs under various sugar concentrations. We focused on changing the sugar concentration in aqueous solution; more precisely, sucrose inside the GUVs and glucose outside with equal osmolarity. 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) (DOPG) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) were used to prepare the charged membranes of 40mole%DOPG/60mole%DOPC-GUVs, whereas only DOPC was used to prepare the neutral membranes. Phase contrast fluorescence microscopy shows that the adherence of 18 nm magnetite NPs with anionic charge depends on the sugar concentration. The alterations of GUVs induced by the NPs are characterized in terms of i) vesicle compactness, ii) deformation, and iii) membrane poration. The presence of sugar provides additional structural stability to the GUVs and reduces the effects of the NPs with respect to these parameters; more precisely, the higher the sugar concentration, the smaller the alteration induced by the NPs. The differences in NPs effects are explained by the change in the type of interaction between sugar molecules and lipid membranes, namely enthalpy and entropy-driven interaction, respectively. In addition, such alterations are influenced by the surface charge density of the lipid bilayer. The surface pressure of membranes due to the adsorption of NPs is responsible for inducing the poration in membranes. The differences in deformation and poration in charged and neutral GUVs under various sugar concentrations are discussed based on the structure of the head of lipid molecules."
https://openalex.org/W4297990653,"Study objectives To investigate inter-scorer agreement and scoring time differences associated with visual and computer-assisted analysis of polysomnographic (PSG) recordings. Methods A group of 12 expert scorers reviewed 5 PSGs that were independently selected in the context of each of the following tasks: (i) sleep staging, (ii) scoring of leg movements, (iii) detection of respiratory (apneic-related) events, and (iv) of electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals. All scorers independently reviewed the same recordings, hence resulting in 20 scoring exercises per scorer from an equal amount of different subjects. The procedure was repeated, separately, using the classical visual manual approach and a computer-assisted (semi-automatic) procedure. Resulting inter-scorer agreement and scoring times were examined and compared among the two methods. Results Computer-assisted sleep scoring showed a consistent and statistically relevant effect toward less time required for the completion of each of the PSG scoring tasks. Gain factors ranged from 1.26 (EEG arousals) to 2.41 (leg movements). Inter-scorer kappa agreement was also consistently increased with the use of supervised semi-automatic scoring. Specifically, agreement increased from Κ = 0.76 to K = 0.80 (sleep stages), Κ = 0.72 to K = 0.91 (leg movements), Κ = 0.55 to K = 0.66 (respiratory events), and Κ = 0.58 to Κ = 0.65 (EEG arousals). Inter-scorer agreement on the examined set of diagnostic indices did also show a trend toward higher Interclass Correlation Coefficient scores when using the semi-automatic scoring approach. Conclusions Computer-assisted analysis can improve inter-scorer agreement and scoring times associated with the review of PSG studies resulting in higher efficiency and overall quality in the diagnosis sleep disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4297990712,"Educational virtual environments (EVEs) are defined by their features of immersion (degree of sensory engagement) and fidelity (degree of realism). Increasingly, EVEs are being used for career development and training purposes, which we refer to as career-oriented EVEs. However, little research has examined the effects of immersion and fidelity on career-related outcomes, like self-efficacy and interests, and the learning dynamics that may influence these outcomes. We address these research needs across two studies using an inductive approach. Study 1 compares welding career exploration in EVEs to traditional career exploration and finds that individuals using EVEs report more positive career self-efficacy. Study 2 examines the influence of social learning dynamics, or how individuals learn from each other through behavioral modeling, on performance and career-related self-efficacy and interest. Groups were assigned to use either a high or low immersion and fidelity EVE. Findings indicate strong social learning dynamics in both EVEs, but the effects were stronger for groups using the higher immersion and fidelity EVE. Specifically, groups converged on two performance measures, and the performance of individuals who were situated as behavioral models significantly predicted the performance of other group members. Performance at the individual level, in turn, predicted career self-efficacy and interest for men but not women, and only for those using the higher immersion and fidelity EVE. Based on these findings, we conclude with practical recommendations for and implications of implementing career-oriented EVEs for career exploration and skills training."

For this purpose, eight datasets related to the human value scale were extracted from the European Social Survey; each corresponds to a single round conducted cross-sectionally every two years since 2001. Change detection algorithm was implemented to the cluster solutions of temporal datasets, and the evolution of important clusters was traced. Finding of the study reveals that Universalism and Benevolence values are on the rise in European societies in the last couple of decades. Most of the European inhabitants believe in the smooth group functioning and form the organismic needs of cooperation. The people prefer anxiety-free life, and love for nature, environment, humanity, and kindness to other beings in society are essential constructs for them. They avoid self-centred behaviour and prefer social physiognomies."

They can also function independently of GPCR activation upon acquiring mutations that prevent GTPase activity and result in constitutive signaling, as occurs with the αqQ209L mutation in uveal melanoma. YM-254890 (YM) can inhibit signaling by both GPCR-activated WT αq and GPCR-independent αqQ209L. Although YM inhibits WT αq by binding to αq-GDP and preventing GDP/GTP exchange, the mechanism of YM inhibition of cellular αqQ209L remains to be fully understood. Here, we show that YM promotes a subcellular redistribution of αqQ209L from the plasma membrane (PM) to the cytoplasm. To test if this loss of PM localization could contribute to the mechanism of inhibition of αqQ209L by YM, we developed and examined N-terminal mutants of αqQ209L, termed PM-restricted αqQ209L, in which the addition of membrane-binding motifs enhanced PM localization and prevented YM-promoted redistribution. Treatment of cells with YM failed to inhibit signaling by these PM-restricted αqQ209L. Additionally, pull-down experiments demonstrated that YM promotes similar conformational changes in both αqQ209L and PM-restricted αqQ209L, resulting in increased binding to βγ and decreased binding to regulator RGS2, and effectors p63RhoGEF-DH/PH and phospholipase C-β. GPCR-dependent signaling by PM-restricted WT αq is strongly inhibited by YM, demonstrating that resistance to YM inhibition by membrane-binding mutants is specific to constitutively active αqQ209L.

Heterotrimeric G proteins, comprised of an α, β, and γ subunit, act as molecular switches to regulate cell signaling pathways (1Milligan G. Kostenis E. Heterotrimeric G-proteins: a short history.Br.

Heterotrimeric G proteins couple to G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), which upon activation act as guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to induce conformational changes that promote GDP release from the α subunit in exchange for GTP (2Oldham W.M.

Receptor-mediated activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins: current structural insights.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Binding of GTP to the α subunit results in dissociation of the α subunit from the tightly associated βγ subunit and subsequent binding of α and βγ to effector proteins. α subunits are grouped into four families (αs, αi, αq, and α12/13) that mediate various pathways within the cell (4Offermanns S. G-proteins as transducers in transmembrane signalling.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The Gαq family, which is comprised of αq, α11, α14, and α15/16, classically activate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) (5Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I.

Active PLCβ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate resulting in production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG) (7Sternweis P.C. Smrcka A.V. Gutowski S.

The helical domain and GTPase domain form a crevice where the guanine nucleotide binds (11Sprang S.R. Invited review: activation of G proteins by GTP and the mechanism of Galpha-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis.Biopolymers. 2016; 105: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the GTPase domain contains three critical switch regions (Sw I, Sw II, and Sw III) that undergo conformational changes allowing for GTP binding. The switch regions are also important for intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity, which is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). αq/11 mutations in uveal melanoma most frequently involve a missense mutation at glutamine 209 to leucine or less commonly proline. The mutation at glutamine 209 located in Sw II greatly diminishes the ability of αq or α11 to hydrolyze GTP rendering them constitutively active (12Kleuss C. Raw A.S. Lee E. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by G-protein alpha subunits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The implications of αq mutations in disease warrants an urgent need to better understand the biology of αq under physiological and disease conditions. Two major signaling pathways that are activated by constitutively active αq to promote cell growth and proliferation are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the nuclear translocation of the transcription coactivators Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and paralog transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). MAPK pathway activation occurs via increased DAG production upon αq activation of the classical effector PLCβ. DAG then serves a dual role in membrane recruitment of the RasGEF RasGRP3 and protein kinase C isoforms δ/ε (PKCδ/ε), which phosphorylate and further activate RasGRP3 (13Chen X. Wu Q. Depeille P.

The resulting activation of Ras then stimulates the well-known MAPK cascade. On the other hand, activated αq initiates the YAP/TAZ pathway by directly binding to and activating the RhoGEF Trio (15Feng X. Degese M.S. Iglesias-Bartolome R. Vaque J.P. Molinolo A.A.

Thus, the mechanisms of how constitutively active αqQ209L is regulated in cells and how FR/YM inhibit αqQ209L remain to be fully understood. Importantly, membrane localization is critical for signaling by both WT and constitutively active αq. αq gains affinity for the plasma membrane (PM) through interaction with βγ (25Evanko D.S.

PM localization is particularly important for interaction with the GPCR and effector proteins such as PLCβ. Furthermore, mutational disruption of these membrane-targeting mechanisms of WT and constitutively active αq results in cytoplasmic localization and attenuation of signaling, demonstrating that PM localization is critical for αq signaling (25Evanko D.S.

Moreover, α subunits can traffic reversibly between the PM and intracellular organelles, highlighting the importance of subcellular localization for G protein signaling function (29Tsutsumi R.

Understanding further how localization regulates signaling by constitutively active αq is critical for gaining new insight into ways to inhibit dysregulated αq signaling. In our studies, we provide evidence that YM treatment results in the redistribution of αqQ209L from the PM to the cytoplasm. Additionally, we generated PM-restricted αqQ209L mutants that displayed resistance to inhibition of signaling by YM. These studies suggest the importance of YM-induced translocation of αqQ209L into the cytoplasm as an additional way in which YM inhibits constitutively active αq. While studying the effect of YM-254890 (YM) on αq-dependent signaling, we observed surprisingly that YM promoted a change in localization of αqQ209L and to a lesser extent αq WT. Immunofluorescence microscopy of HEK 293 cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible αqQ209L showed that treatment of cells with 1 μM YM for 1 h promoted a redistribution of αqQ209L from a PM localization to an intracellular localization (Fig. 1A). Scoring αqQ209L localization in individual cells as PM localized, PM and cytoplasmic, or cytoplasmic showed that in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle-treated cells, αqQ209L displayed a predominant PM localization in 63% of cells, colocalizing at the PM with GRK5, a protein shown to strongly localize at the PM when expressed in HEK 293 cells (31Xu H. Jiang X. Shen K. Fischer C.C. Wedegaertner P.B. The regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) regulates plasma membrane localization and function.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a distribution to both the PM and cytoplasm in 25% of cells (Fig. 1, A and B). However, after 1 h of YM treatment, only 5% of cells showed strong PM localization of αqQ209L; instead, αqQ209L was not detected at the PM and was localized in the cytoplasm in 84% of cells. Redistribution of αqQ209L was also observed after 24 h of YM treatment, but more PM localization remained compared to 1 h YM treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). Although αqQ209L displays a decrease in PM localization after YM treatment, GRK5 remains strongly localized at the PM, indicating that the observed redistribution of αqQ209L is not simply due to a general disruption in PM localization of peripheral membrane-bound proteins. In HEK 293 cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible αq WT, a small but consistent shift-off of the PM for αq WT was observed after YM treatment (Fig. 1, A and B), but only αqQ209L displayed a dramatic redistribution. Translocation of αqQ209L in response to YM was also observed in HeLa cells (Fig. S1). To begin to address whether the observed YM-promoted redistribution of αqQ209L is related to the ability of YM to inhibit constitutive signaling by αqQ209L, we examined a time course of YM inhibition. αqQ209L activates the MAPK pathway through its canonical signaling pathway mediated by PLCβ. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with a phospho-ERK (pERK)–specific antibody was used as a read out of MAPK signaling. In cells expressing αqQ209L, a significant decrease in pERK levels was detected after 1 h of YM treatment. pERK continued to decrease at 2 to 3 h and remained inhibited up to 16 h after YM treatment (Fig. 1C). These experiments together show that the YM-promoted redistribution of αqQ209L appears to precede YM-induced inhibition of signaling, raising the question of whether YM-promoted loss of PM localization of αqQ209L plays a role in the ability of YM to inhibit constitutive signaling by αqQ209L. If redistribution from the PM plays a role in YM inhibition of αqQ209L signaling, we reasoned that a mutant of αqQ209L that remains at the PM upon YM treatment would continue to signal in the presence of YM. To test this idea, we initially constructed mutants of αqQ209L in which additional PM-targeting motifs were added to the N terminus to augment the ability of reversible palmitoylation at cysteines 9 and 10 to maintain PM localization. Amino acids 1 to 16 of Src or amino acids 1 to 11 of Lyn were fused to the N terminus of αqQ209L to introduce a myristoylation plus polybasic motif and a myristoylation plus palmitoylation motif, respectively (Fig. 2A). The addition of a similar N-terminal sequence of Src has been shown to strongly localize αs at the PM and prevent activation-induced subcellular redistribution of αs (32Thiyagarajan M.M. Bigras E. Van Tol H.H. Hebert T.E. Evanko D.S. Wedegaertner P.B. Activation-induced subcellular redistribution of G alpha(s) is dependent upon its unique N-terminus.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9470-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that Src-αqQ209L or Lyn-αqQ209L displayed strong PM localization and colocalization with GRK5, when expressed in HEK 293 q/11 KO cells in which αq and α11 were knocked out using CRISPR (Fig. 2B). Importantly, Src-αqQ209L and Lyn-αqQ209L remained at the PM after YM treatment (Fig. 2B), thus demonstrating that the addition of the Src or Lyn motif is sufficient to prevent YM-promoted redistribution of αqQ209L. To determine if these PM-restricted αqQ209L mutants are sensitive to inhibition by YM, we assayed pERK levels −/+ YM treatment by immunoblot analysis. Expression of αqQ209L, Src-αqQ209L, or Lyn-αqQ209L in HEK 293 q/11 KO cells resulted in similar constitutive activation of pERK, approximately 5-fold higher than in vector transfected or αq WT expressing cells (Fig. 2C). While YM treatment abolished αqQ209L activation of pERK, Src-αqQ209L- and Lyn-αqQ209L-dependent activation of pERK was strongly resistant to inhibition by YM. These results provide the first evidence that signaling by PM-restricted forms of αqQ209L is not effectively inhibited by YM. To examine further this insensitivity to YM of PM-restricted αqQ209L, we utilized two transcriptional reporter assays. The serum response element (SRE) luciferase reporter assay detects αq-dependent signaling via both MAPK- and Rho-dependent pathways, and the TEAD luciferase reporter assay detects αq-dependent signaling via Rho-dependent translocation into the nucleus of the transcription coactivator YAP. Consistent with the pERK assay (Fig. 2C), expression of αqQ209L, Src-αqQ209L, or Lyn-αqQ209L in HEK 293 q/11 KO cells resulted in similar constitutive activation of SRE-luciferase and TEAD-luciferase signals (Fig. 2, D and E). However, and again consistent with the pERK assays, YM treatment resulted in little or no inhibition of signaling by Src-αqQ209L or Lyn-αqQ209L, even though αqQ209L signaling was abolished after YM treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the addition of N-terminal PM-targeting motifs to αqQ209L does not affect constitutive signaling but does confer resistance to YM. To further determine if signaling by PM-restricted αqQ209L fails to be inhibited by YM, we took advantage of a previously described N-terminal, membrane-binding mutant of αq. In this AG mutant, the first methionine codon is mutated so that αq utilizes the methionine codon at position 7 as the initiating ATG, and the alanine at position 8, now position 2 in the AG mutant, is changed to a glycine codon to introduce a new site for myristoylation (25Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Interaction with Gbetagamma is required for membrane targeting and palmitoylation of Galpha(s) and Galpha(q).J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, the αqAG-Q209L mutant is singly myristoylated and dually palmitoylated, in contrast to only dual palmitoylation for αqQ209L, thereby providing an additional lipid modification to increase PM localization (Fig. 3A). Consequently, immunofluorescence microscopy showed that αqAG-Q209L localized at the PM, colocalizing with GRK5 (Fig. 3B), and αqAG-Q209L remained at the PM after YM treatment (Fig. 3B). Thus, the simple introduction of a site for N-terminal myristoylation is sufficient to prevent YM-promoted redistribution of αqAG-Q209L, similar to that observed for the more complex Src-αqQ209L or Lyn-αqQ209L mutants (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine if αqAG-Q209L signaling, like Src-αqQ209L and Lyn-αqQ209L signaling, was also insensitive to YM inhibition, we first examined pERK levels stimulated by αqAG-Q209L and the effect of YM treatment. Expression of αqAG-Q209L in HEK 293 q/11 KO cells resulted in strong constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, as revealed by pERK immunoblotting, similar to αqQ209L (Fig. 3C). However, the constitutive pERK activation by αqAG-Q209L was resistant to YM treatment. Upon YM treatment, αqQ209L signaling to pERK was significantly reduced but αqAG-Q209L retained its pERK signaling. We also used SRE and TEAD luciferase reporter assays to further confirm αqAG-Q209L’s lack of inhibition of by YM (Fig. 3, D and E). Expression of either αqQ209L or αqAG-Q209L in HEK 293 q/11 KO cells resulted in strong constitutive activation in both luciferase transcriptional reporter assays. However, overnight YM treatment failed to inhibit SRE-dependent and TEAD-dependent luciferase activity in cells expressing αqAG-Q209L, even though YM treatment completely blocked signaling by αqQ209L. Collectively, our results demonstrate that enhanced membrane binding, displayed by three different PM-restricted αqQ209L mutants, prevents relocalization and inhibition by YM, supporting the idea that YM-induced subcellular redistribution of αqQ209L is important for inhibition of signaling by YM. To address concerns that the aforementioned demonstrations of resistance to YM are artefacts of high levels of αqAG-Q209L expression or inappropriate concentrations of YM, we performed key control experiments. First, we assessed TEAD-dependent transcription using decreasing amounts of expression of αqQ209L and αqAG-Q209L. αqQ209L displayed a strong and significant decrease in TEAD luciferase activity upon YM treatment at both high and low expression levels (Fig. 4A). However, αqAGQ209L signaling remained resistant to YM at all expression levels, indicating that lack of inhibition by YM observed for this PM-restricted mutant was not due to high levels of expression. Second, we analyzed YM concentration curve. Using concentrations from 10 nM to 5 μM, we observed the expected YM concentration-dependent inhibition of αqQ209L signaling with an approximate IC50 of 9 nM, as measured here by TEAD luciferase activity. However, αqAG-Q209L signaling remained resistant to YM inhibition at all concentrations, including 5 μM YM (Fig. 4B). Additionally, we performed TEAD luciferase assays in HEK 293 cells, rather than the HEK 293 q/11 KO cells that lack endogenous αq and α11 (Fig. 4C). Signaling by expressed αqAG-Q209L in HEK 293 cells remained resistant to YM inhibition, indicating that this failure to be inhibited by YM occurs for PM-restricted αqAG-Q209L regardless of the presence or absence of endogenous WT αq and α11. Taken together, these results demonstrate that insensitivity to YM of PM-restricted αqAGQ209L is maintained at various expression levels of αqAG-Q209L, various concentrations of YM, and in HEK 293 parental cells. We next tested whether YM was binding to the PM-restricted mutants by assaying the ability of added YM to affect the interaction of αqAG-Q209L with several binding partners. Previous work showed that addition of YM to cells expressing αqQ209L promoted increased interaction with Gβγ and decreased intera"

https://openalex.org/W4297983654,"Nigerian consumers have been found to view vegetables as healthy and health is a principal motivation for consumption; however, consumers also experience barriers related to preparation time and availability of vegetables. We therefore conducted a Veg-on-Wheels intervention, in which ready-to-cook, washed and pre-cut green leafy vegetables (GLV) were kept cool and sold for five weeks at convenient locations near workplaces and on the open market in Akure, Nigeria. Surveys were conducted prior to the intervention with 680 consumers and during the final week of the intervention with 596 consumers near workplaces and 204 consumers at the open market. Both buyers and non-buyers of the intervention were included; 49% buyers in the workplace sample and 47% in the open market sample. The Veg-on-Wheels intervention was successful, with high awareness, positive attitudes and high customer satisfaction. GLV intake was higher for Veg-on-Wheels buyers compared with non-buyers after the intervention, i.e., 10.8 vs. 8.0 portions per week, respectively. Also the intake of other vegetables was higher in the intervention group. The motives and barriers for buyers and non-buyers differed across the selling locations: main barriers were trust in the vendor and GLV source. These trust issues and vendor preferences were viewed as more important to respondents at the market than those near workplaces. This study is the first intervention study on the selling of ready-to-cook convenience vegetables in urban Nigeria. It shows that a market exists for convenience vegetables and that they have the potential to increase vegetable intake. Insights on both the food environment and consumers’ motives and behaviour was crucial for designing and evaluating the intervention."

The objectives of these trials were to evaluate yield and yield components of wild soybean: (1) across 11 diverse populations grown under favorable conditions to assess seed production potential, (2) under different planting densities (112, 208, 416, and 832 plants/m2) to assess intra-specific competition, and (3) across growing conditions (favorable, ruderal, and natural) to assess the impacts of environmental stress and inter-specific competition. Significant differences in yield and seed number observed among the evaluated wild soybean populations were predominantly due to environmental effects and genetic by environmental interaction. Seed production was impacted by both intra- and inter-specific competition. Wild soybean grown without plant competition had 51-fold and 247-fold higher yield compared to when grown in ruderal and natural environments, respectively. Under favorable growing conditions, wild soybean had substantial yield potential due to the ability to produce a high number of seeds. In nature, yield potential is severely limited because of plant competition and other environmental stressors. The results of this research are useful to inform environmental risk assessment when considering the potential impact of soybean biotechnology traits that increase or protect yield. If such traits were to be inadvertently transferred from imported soybean into wild soybean, this research indicates that the effects would likely have little overall impact on wild soybean seed production."

A structured validated close-ended questionnaire measuring BPCR knowledge and practices was used for the interviews. The results were analyzed by means of the Chi-square test, and a binary logistic regression model was used to determine the factors influencing BPCR.The overall response rate was 94.6%, with a low BPCR status. Out of 770 participants, only 163 (21.2%) were well prepared, while 607 (78.8%) were not prepared for safe childbirth and its complications. A small proportion of women knew about the serious warning signs of pregnancy, labour, childbirth and the postpartum period (16.2%), (15.3%) and (22.7%) respectively. Antenatal care (ANC) checkup (P < 0.001), cost of ANC checkup (p = 0.016), place of birth (p = 0.014), awareness of serious warning signs during pregnancy (p = 0.001) and awareness of serious warning signs during the postpartum period (p < 0.001) were found to be significant predictors of BPCR.The proportion of women who were well prepared for birth and its complications was low. It is recommended to organize community-based education campaigns and improve the quality of MNCH services at every level to increase BPCR among women in Sindh."

All doctors were involved in the care of patients for smoking cessation. The knowledge, attitude and practice of smoking cessation management were assessed using a 17-items validated questionnaire which covered the components of 5As (Ask, advise, assess, assist, arrange) and 5Rs (Relevance, risk, reward, roadblocks, repetition). The management of pre-contemplation phase included the components of ask, advise, assess and 5Rs. The management of the contemplation phase included the components of assist and arrange.The majority of the respondents had poor score of knowledge (62.4%); attitude (58%) and practice (pre-contemplation management:50.9%; contemplation management:75.7%). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the significant factors associated with the poor practice of smoking cessation management in the pre-contemplation phase were poor (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.11-4.12, p <0.01) or moderate knowledge (OR = 2.50, 95% CI 1.19-5.26, p<0.01), poor attitude (OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.39-3.37, p<0.01), lacks smoking cessation banners, brochures and leaflets in the clinic (OR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.26-3.19, p<0.01) and lack of nicotine replacement medications (OR = 2.27. 95%CI 1.27-4.06, p<0.01).

The PARADIES (Patient Activation foR Anxiety DIsordErS) intervention combined elements of cognitive behavioural therapy with case management and has demonstrated efficacy. Our aim was to explore patient characteristics, which may influence the course of anxiety symptoms over a 12 months period. Multiple linear regression was used to quantify associations of baseline characteristics (demographics, clinical parameters, medication use) with changes in anxiety symptoms as measured by the Beck anxiety inventory. Treatment modalities (e.g. adherence to appointment schedules) were considered as confounders. We examined univariate associations between dependent and independent variables before considering all independent variables in a multivariate final model. To find the best model to explain BAI score changes, we performed step-wise selection of independent variables based on Akaike information criteria. We tested for interaction terms between treatment allocation (intervention vs control) and independent variables using the multivariate model. We repeated these analyses in control vs intervention groups separately. From the original trial (N = 419), 236 patients (56.3%) were included. In the multivariate model, receiving the intervention (p&lt;0.001), higher anxiety symptom severity (p&lt;0.001) and longer illness duration at baseline (p = 0.033) were significantly associated with changes in anxiety symptom severity to the better while depression severity at baseline (p&lt;0.001) was significantly associated with changes in anxiety symptoms to the worse. In stratified analyses, the control group showed significant associations between depression symptom severity and illness duration with anxiety symptom changes while baseline severity of anxiety symptoms remained significantly associated with anxiety symptom changes in both groups. A brief primary-care-based exposure training combined with case management is effective in a broad range of patients with panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, including those with longer illness duration and co-existing symptoms of depression at baseline."

Few studies document the challenges and coping mechanisms among women living with obstetric fistula in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the challenges and coping mechanisms among women with obstetric fistula in Ethiopia.A phenomenological study was employed among purposively selected eleven women with obstetric fistula and three key informants at five fistula treatment centers in Ethiopia. An in-depth interview was conducted, audio-recorded, and transcribed into a Microsoft Word document. The transcripts were imported into Atlas. ti version 8.4 for thematic analyses.Painful social life, consequences of fistula, and coping mechanisms with fistula problems were the main themes in this study. Difficult social life, stigma, discrimination, impaired marital status; psychological, physical, sexual, and reproductive health problems were the major challenges for women with obstetric fistulas. Women with fistulas used coping mechanisms such as-going to spiritual sites and drinking alcohol to cope with their fistula disease; separating themselves from community participation and living alone in the forest to cope with a painful social life; restricting the amount of drinking water and wearing many clothes at a time to cope with wetness and odors, and allowing their husband to marry a new wife to cope with the impaired marital responsibilities.Women with obstetric fistulas encountered challenges such as a painful social life, impaired marital status, psychological, physical, sexual, and reproductive health problems; and used coping mechanisms with their fistula condition, difficult social life, and impaired marital responsibility that may have an added negative effect on their overall health. Therefore, policymakers need to prioritize the availability and early utilization of obstetric fistula surgery in all settings for all women living with obstetric fistulas to restore their holistic health."
https://openalex.org/W4297984167,"Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor uPAR promote cancer invasion and metastasis and are emerging therapeutic targets in both human and canine malignancies. While their clinical significance is well-characterized in multiple human tumor types, studies investigating their roles in osteosarcoma are lacking. The objectives of this study were to characterize serum and tissue uPA/uPAR expression in dogs with osteosarcoma and assess the prognostic significance. Serum samples and a tissue microarray of canine appendicular osteosarcoma were analyzed for uPA and uPAR expression by ELISA (n = 49) and immunohistochemistry (n = 38), respectively. Serum uPA activity was also measured by a chromogenic assay (n = 25). Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log rank test, and Cox regression analysis. Serum uPA level was significantly higher in dogs with osteosarcoma than clinically healthy control dogs (median 1905 vs 1440 pg/ml, p = 0.008). The majority of canine osteosarcoma tissues expressed uPA (75.9%) or uPAR (77.6%), with 70.7% dual-positivity, indicating autocrine/paracrine activation of the pathway. Survival analysis revealed shorter progression free survival (PFS) in dogs with high serum uPA level in a discovery cohort (n = 29; median PFS 94 vs 266 days, p = 0.003) but not in a validation cohort (n = 23; median PFS 167 vs 490 days, p = 0.16). The difference was significant when both cohorts were combined (n = 49; median PFS 128 vs 266 days, p = 0.003). Serum uPAR and tissue uPA/uPAR levels were not prognostic. In Cox multivariate analysis, high serum uPA level and activity were both associated with poor prognosis, independent of serum ALP, tumor location, and peripheral lymphocyte/monocyte counts. These results indicate high utilization of the uPA pathway and association with disease progression in canine osteosarcoma. Further study involving prospective evaluation to confirm the prognostic significance is warranted. The high prevalence of tissue uPA and uPAR expression suggests the uPA system as a potential therapeutic target in canine osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W4297990467,"We propose a deep learning-assisted overscan decision algorithm in chest low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) applicable to the lung cancer screening. The algorithm reflects the radiologists' subjective evaluation criteria according to the Korea institute for accreditation of medical imaging (KIAMI) guidelines, where it judges whether a scan range is beyond landmarks' criterion. The algorithm consists of three stages: deep learning-based landmark segmentation, rule-based logical operations, and overscan determination. A total of 210 cases from a single institution (internal data) and 50 cases from 47 institutions (external data) were utilized for performance evaluation. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's kappa were used as evaluation metrics. Fisher's exact test was performed to present statistical significance for the overscan detectability, and univariate logistic regression analyses were performed for validation. Furthermore, an excessive effective dose was estimated by employing the amount of overscan and the absorbed dose to effective dose conversion factor. The algorithm presented AUROC values of 0.976 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.925-0.987) and 0.997 (95% CI: 0.800-0.999) for internal and external dataset, respectively. All metrics showed average performance scores greater than 90% in each evaluation dataset. The AI-assisted overscan decision and the radiologist's manual evaluation showed a statistically significance showing a p-value less than 0.001 in Fisher's exact test. In the logistic regression analysis, demographics (age and sex), data source, CT vendor, and slice thickness showed no statistical significance on the algorithm (each p-value > 0.05). Furthermore, the estimated excessive effective doses were 0.02 ± 0.01 mSv and 0.03 ± 0.05 mSv for each dataset, not a concern within slight deviations from an acceptable scan range. We hope that our proposed overscan decision algorithm enables the retrospective scan range monitoring in LDCT for lung cancer screening program, and follows an as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle."
https://openalex.org/W4297990670,"To understand provider perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic on priorities of severe pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) care across hospitals in South America.Site principal investigators (PIs) from 17 hospitals in South America enrolled in the PEGASUS-Argentina randomized controlled trial completed questionnaires regarding order of tasks performed in the care of a typical pediatric patient with severe TBI before (2019) and during (2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. Acute care processes were examined by quintiles to identify early, mid, and late actions and were categorized and compared. Associations of hospital volume and subspecialty resource availability with prioritization of key process actions were examined.Site PIs from 15 and 16 hospitals completed the surveys in 2019 and 2021, respectively, including 14 who completed both. Action category order was stable between 2019 and 2021 and were ranked in priorities as: initial encounter, primary survey, interventions and invasive monitors, diagnostics, medications, staff communication, then disposition (in 2019) or nutrition (in 2021). There was variation in specific action order between hospitals at both timepoints, with only a few initial encounter and disposition actions limited to a single quintile. There was no reported association between hospital volume or subspecialty resource availability with prioritization of key process actions.Despite novel healthcare challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, providers in South America perceived maintaining standard severe pediatric TBI care consistent with BTF guidelines. There was large variability in specific action order between individual hospitals reported."

https://openalex.org/W4298055407,"To determine factors associated with in-hospital death among patients admitted to ICU and to evaluate the predictive values of single severely deranged vital signs and several severity scoring systems.A combined retrospective and prospective cohort study of patients admitted to the adult ICU in a tertiary hospital in Malawi was conducted between January 2017 and July 2019. Predefined potential risk factors for in-hospital death were studied with univariable and multivariable logistic regression models, and the performance of severity scores was assessed.The median age of the 822 participants was 31 years (IQR 21-43), and 50% were female. Several factors at admission were associated with in-hospital mortality: the presence of one or more severely deranged vital signs, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.9 (1.4-2.6); treatment with vasopressor aOR 2.3 (1.6-3.4); received cardiopulmonary resuscitation aOR 1.7 (1.2-2.6) and treatment with mechanical ventilation aOR 1.5 (1.1-2.1). Having had surgery had a negative association with in-hospital mortality aOR 0.5 (0.4-0.7). The predictive accuracy of the severity scoring systems had varying sensitivities and specificities, but none were sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful.In conclusion, the presence of one or more severely deranged vital sign in patients admitted to ICU may be useful as a simple marker of an increased risk of in-hospital death."
https://openalex.org/W4298087056,"Introduction There is growing scientific evidence of mental and well-being issues that doctoral research students face as a result of not finishing their program on time. This study aims to explore the factors associated with the timely completion of doctoral research studies in the clinical pharmacy speciality. Methods This was a mixed-method study that combined surveys with in-depth interviews. Current doctoral research students and pharmacists who have recently completed their doctoral research program participated in the study. A validated questionnaire and an interview topic guide developed from the literature and pretesting were used to collect data. Data for this study were collected between February 2021 and September 2021. Quantitative data were analysed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) V.25 while interview data were subjected to reflexive thematic analysis. Results 47 students who are currently pursuing their doctoral research program in clinical pharmacy participated in the survey, while 8 pharmacists who had recently completed their doctoral research program in clinical pharmacy participated in the in-depth interviews. Five themes were identified: factors contributing to delay in the program, factors contributing to the timely completion of the program, ways to improve the program, advice to current students and advice to prospective students. Having more than one supervisor, supervisors’ commitment to the research work and support from the department were identified as facilitators of timely completion of doctoral research programs in clinical pharmacy. Conclusion Our study provides an understanding of the barriers and facilitators of timely completion of doctoral research programs in the clinical pharmacy specialist, and how these can be used to improve the postgraduate study programs in Nigeria."
