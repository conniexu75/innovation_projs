Unit activity in hippocampus rapidly forms a temporal neuronal ""model"" of the behavioral response early in training. This hippocampal response does not develop in control animals given unpaired stimuli."

These subtle, typically covert, facial expression patterns differentiate depressed from nondepressed subjects. Facial electromyography can provide a sensitive, objective index of normal and clinical mood states."

Unlike sibling species of Drosophila, the Capitella species have virtually no alleles in common. Close examination has revealed only slight morphological differences between species, while life histories and reproductive modes are very distinct. The Capitella species are ideally suited for genetic and evolutionary studies."

Those maturing late were more lateralized for speech than those maturing early. Sex differences in mental abilities, it is argued, reflect differences in the organization of cortical function that are related to differential rates of physical maturation."

https://openalex.org/W1545912435,"The dissociation of nitric oxide from hemoglobin, from isolated subunits of hemoglobin, and from myoglobin has been studied using dithionite to remove free nitric oxide. The reduction of nitric oxide by dithionite has a rate of 1.4 X 10(3) M-1 S-1 at 20 degrees in 0.05 M phosphate, pH 7.0, which is small compared with the rate of recombination of hemoglobin with nitric oxide (25 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 (Cassoly, R., and Gibson, Q. H. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 91, 301-313). The rate of NO combination with chains and myoglobin was found to be 24 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 and 17 X 10(6) M-1 S-1, respectively. Hence, the observed progress curve of the dissociation of nitric oxide is dependent upon the dithionite concentration and the total heme concentration. Addition of excess carbon monoxide to the dissociation mixture reduces the free heme yielding a single exponential process for chains and for myoglobin which is dithionite and heme concentration independent over a wide range of concentrations. The rates of dissociation of nitric oxide from alpha chains, from beta chains, and from myoglobin are 4.6 X 10(-5) S-1, 2.2 X 10(-5) S-1, and 1.2 X 10(4) S-1, respectively, both in the presence and in the absence of carbon monoxide at 20 degrees in 0.05 M phosphate, pH 7.0. Analogous heme and dithionite concentration dependence is found for the dissociation of nitric oxide from tetrameric hemoglobin. The reaction is cooperative, the intrinsic rate constants for the dissociation of the 1st and 4th molecules of NO differing about 100-fold. With hemoglobin, replacement of NO by CO at neutral pH is biphasic in phosphate buffers. The rate of the slow phase is 1 X 10(-5) S-1 and is independent of pH. The amplitude of the fast phase increases with lowering of pH. By analogy with the treatment of the HbCO + NO reaction given by Salhany et al. (Salhany, J.M., Ogawa, S., and Shulman, R.G. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 2180-2190), the fast phase is attributed to the dissociation of NO from T state molecules and the slow phase to dissociation from R state molecules. Analysis of the data gives a pH-independent value of 0.01 for the allosteric constant c (c = Kr/Kt where Kr and Kt are the dissociation constants for NO from the R and T states, respectively) and pH-dependent values of L (2.5 X 10(7) at pH 7 in 0.05 M phosphate buffer). The value of c is considerably greater than that for O2 and CO. Studies of the difference spectrum induced in the Soret region by inositol hexaphosphate are also reported. This spectrum does not arise directly from the change of conformation between R and T states. The results show that if the equilibrium binding curve for NO could be determined experimentally, it would show cooperativity with Hill's n at 50% saturation of about 1.6."

https://openalex.org/W1589769895,"RNA prepared from rat anterior pituitaries or from prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors has been shown to direct the synthesis of a large form of prolactin in a cell-free system derived from wheat germ. Immunoprecipitation of cell-free reactions demonstrated the synthesis of a product which was recognized by a specific antiprolactin antisera. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate on sodium dodecyl sulfate containing polyacrylamide gels suggested that the cell-free product has a molecular weight of approximately 28,000 compared to 22,500 for prolactin. RNA prepared by completely different techniques from rat pituitary and a pituitary tumor resulted in identical large translation products. Translation of tumor RNA in a cell-free system from Krebs ascites cells also resulted in a similar large product. The identity of the cell-free product as prolactin was confirmed by comparing peptides derived from the cell-free product and prolactin. The results of these studies suggest that prolactin messenger RNA directs the cell-free synthesis of a product which contains the amino acid sequence of prolactin but which has an addition at one or both ends of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1514505265,"Mouse mammary gland has been shown to possess a transport system for spermidine, spermine, and putrescine. The uptake system for sperimidine, as studied in detail on mammary explants in culture is a time-dependent, energy-requiring process which can be stimulated by insulin and prolactin. The stimulatory effect of insulin involves both enhancement of Vmax for spermidine influx and prevention of efflux of the polyamine, whereas prolactin, in the presence of insulin, elicits a greater increase in Vmax for spermidine. Studies are also reported on the effects of temperature, concentration, and various inhibitors on this system. The accumulated spermidine exists virtually in an unchanged form with little metabolic conversion to either spermine or putrescine or to its conjugated form. In contrast, spermine and putrescine, both of which are also taken up by mammary explants, undergo metabolic conversion to spermidine."
https://openalex.org/W1607894031,"Polyadenylate-rich mRNA extracted from an established line of functional rat pituitary tumor cells (GH3) which respond to the addition of thyrotropin-releasing factor with the synthesis and secretion of prolactin directed cell-free synthesis using a cell-free protein-synthesizing system derived from wheat embryos. The products of translation, when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, did not include any protein co-migrating with rat prolactin. One prominent protein synthesized was precipitated using anti-prolactin antiserum. This protein was larger than the prolactin standard with an apparent molecular weight of 28,000 +/- 2,000. Addition of a GH3 cell extract to the translation system resulted in the appearance of a protein which co-migrated with rat prolactin and was immunoprecipitated with anti-rat prolactin antiserum. Addition of thyrotropin-releasing factor to spinner cultures of GH3 cells for 48 to 72 hours increased de novo prolactin biosynthesis. Levels of mRNA coding for prolactin determined by translation of total mRNA and quantitation of preprolactin synthesized were stimulated 3- to 6-fold relative to the levels in control cultures, suggesting that regulation of prolactin synthesis was accomplished, at least in part, at a transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1531214563,"A number of mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines resistant to the cytotoxic action of alpha-amanitin have been isolated. The alpha-amanitin sensitivity of the different mutant cell lines varied widely, but correlated well with the alpha-amanitin sensitivity of the RNA polymerase II activity in each of these mutant cell lines. In comparison with the RNA polymerase II of wild-type cells, three mutants, Ama39, Ama6, and Amal, required respectively 2- to 3-fold, 8- to 10-fold, and about 800-fold higher concentrations of alpha-amanitin for inhibition of their polymerase II activity. Determination of the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for complexes between 0-[3H]methyl-demethyl-gamma-amanitin and RNA polymearse II indicated that differences in alpha-amanitin sensitivity were reflected in differences in the ability of the enzymes to bind amanitin. Hybrids formed by fusion of mutants with cells of wild-type sensitivity contained both mutant and wild-type polymerase II activities. Thus, each of the different alpha-amanitin resistance mutations was expressed co-dominantly. A test for complementation between two of these mutations by measurement of both the alpha-amanitin sensitivity and the [3H]amanitin binding by RNA polymerase II in Ama6 X Amal hybrid cells did not reveal any wild-type RNA polymerase II activity. These data provide evidence that the mutation to alpha-amanitin resistance involves structural changes in the gene coding for the alpha-amanitin binding subunit of RNA polymerase II. These changes appear to account for the alpha-amanitin-resistant phenotypes of these mutant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588043332,"A fucosylceramide was isolated from a ceramide monohexoside fraction of human colon carcinomas by acetylation followed by preparative thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel G developed with butylacetate. It contained only fucose as the carbohydrate component and the ceramide moiety was characterized as N-palmitoyloctadecasphingenine as a predominant component. The structure of the compound was determined as alpha-L-fucopyranosylceramide by methylation analysis, mass spectrometry of permethylated and reduced glycolipid, and by enzymatic hydrolysis with alpha-L-fucosidase. The chemical concentration of this compound in colon tumor tissue depends on degree of malignancy: highly malignant metastatic deposits from colon cancers were 3 to 70 ng/mg of residue protein, whereas that of localized colon tumor was 0 to 2 ng/mg of protein residue. The present observation offers additional support for the occurrence of metabolic abnormality of fucolipids as membrane phenotype of malignancy as was suggested in previous studies (Yang, H-J., and Hakomori, S. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1192-1200; Steiner, S., Brennan, P.J., Melnick, J. L. (1973) Nature New Biol. 245, 19-21)."
https://openalex.org/W1495165160,"The metabolism of mevalonic acid by both sterol and non-sterol pathways has been evaluated in nine tissues of the rat. An in vitro estimation of the non-sterol, or shunt, pathway of mevalonate metabolism was made possible by determining the conversion of [2-14C]mevalonate or [5-14C]mevalonate to 14CO2 in tissue slices. In confirmation of our previous results, the kidney was found to play a major role in the metabolism of mevalonate to sterols and sterol precursors. The shunt pathway accounted for a significant percentage of the mevalonate metabolized in kidney, ileum, spleen, lung and testes, but was of minor importance or undetectable in liver, brain, skin, and adipose tissue. Kidney, however, proved to be by far the most active tissue site of mevalonate metabolism by the shunt mechanism in that, on an average, renal tissue metabolized (R)-[14C]mevalonate over the non-sterol pathway at a rate that was 21 times that of any other tissue examined. These results indicate that the kidneys are of major importance in the metabolism of mevalonate by each of the known pathways of metabolism of this sterol precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1487710777,"Mouse antisera against calf terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (terminal transferase) have been prepared. The sera have been used to characterize terminal transferase both by studying inhibition of enzyme activity and by developing a competition radioimmunoassay using highly purified 125I-labeled terminal transferase. By either assay, anti-terminal transferase serum did not cross-react significantly with calf DNA polymerases alpha and beta, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, or the reverse transcriptase of Moloney mouse leukemia virus. The calf terminal transferase did, however, share cross-reactive but not identical determinants with human and murine terminal transferase. The radioimmunoassay could detect as little as 2 ng of terminal transferase/mg of soluble protein in a tissue extract. Thymocytes were found to contain 280 ng of terminal transferase/mg of cell protein or about 1 X 10^(5) molecules/cell; bone marrow had about 1% of the level of enzyme found in thymus. Extracts of spleen, peripheral white blood cells, lymph nodes, liver, muscle, and kidney all lacked detectable antigenicity of terminal transferase. These data indicate that terminal transferase is a tissue-specific enzyme and is not related to other DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1549784164,"Protein synthesis in the leaves of green pea seedlings (Pisum sativum) is examined by short term labeling with [35S]methionine and autoradiography of the labeled proteins after fractionation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The two subunits of ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase and the chloroplast lamellar proteins are identified as the major proteins being synthesized. Three protein chlorophyll complexes are characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis; all three complexes are disrupted by heating to 100 degrees in sodium dodecyl sulfate solution. Studies with inhibitors of protein synthesis indicate that the large subunit of ribulos-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase is synthesized in the chloroplast, in contrast to the majority of the soluble proteins, including the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase, which is synthesized in the cytoplasm. PII protein, the major lamellar protein associated with photosystem II, is also synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. However, many of the lamellar proteins are synthesized within the chloroplast. Integration into the lamellar system of at least one of the chloroplast-synthesized proteins is shown to be dependent on cytoplasmic protein synthesis."

The resulting molecules were tested for complex formation with the lysine-rich histone f1. The results confirmed earlier experiments in demonstrating that f1 histone reacts preferentially with superhelical DNA compared to relaxed circular DNA. Furthermore, the extent of the reaction is demonstrated to depend on the superhelical density. At the relatively low ratios of histone to DNA used in these experiments, the product of the interaction of f1 histone with superhelical DNA does not precipitate. At higher ratios of histone to DNA, an insoluble aggregate is formed."
https://openalex.org/W1493833500,"Raman spectroscopy was used to study the anomalous decrease in the freezing temperature of water produced by an antifreeze glycoprotein obtained from the sera of an Antarctic fish. An active fraction of this glycoprotein has a molecular weight of approximately 18,000 by equilibrium sedimentation compared to an apparent weight of 20 by freezing temperature depression. The Raman spectra of water present in a 1% antifreeze glycoprotein solution and of ice frozen from this solution were indistinguishable from the spectra of pure water and ice, respectively. These results indicate that the bulk properties of water and ice are unaffected by the presence of the antifreeze glycoprotein. Raman measurements on ice grown slowly, using as seed an oriented single crystal of ice in contact with 1% glycoprotein solutions, showed that the active glycoprotein was not excluded from the ice phase. On the other hand, we found that a smaller, inactive glycoprotein was excluded. Comparison of the Raman spectra of active and inactive glycoprotein components as solids, in 5% solutions, and rapidly frozen 5% solutions, showed that the two components differ in conformation and possibly in the environment of their carbohydrate hydroxyls. These observations suggest that hydrogen bonding of the carbohydrate hydroxyls of the active glycoprotein at the ice-solution interface may physically prevent growth of the ice lattice."

https://openalex.org/W2030084781,"Oncogenic viruses, able to elicit tumour formation in animals, have been on the scientific scene for many years. After the early discovery of Ellerman and Bang at the beginning of this century, Peyton Rous opened up the field in its second decade and in prophetic words gave a good hint of things to come. However, these discoveries were soon forgotten and only after a long eclipse was interest in oncogenic viruses revived in the fifties. My involvement in this field began at that time when Rubin and Temin worked in my laboratory with the Rous Sarcoma Virus. When in 1958 polyoma virus, a new oncogenic virus with different properties, was isolated, I jumped at the new opportunity and started working with it. Within a short time polyoma virus became the main interest of my laboratory, to be joined, a few years later by SV40, another papovavirus. It became clear fairly soon that the molecular biology of these viruses could be worked out, and I set out to find the molecular basis of cancer induction. The results that I and a number of brilliant young collaborators have obtained during the following fifteen years have brought us close to that goal. I will review the most interesting steps of our work and will then ask some questions concerning the nature of cancer and about perspectives for prevention and treatment. I stress the relevance of my work for cancer research because I believe that science must be useful to man."
https://openalex.org/W1515108352,"Proline reductase of Clostridium sticklandii is a membrane-bound protein and is released by treatment with detergents. The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity and is estimated by gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation to have a molecular weight of 298,000 to 327,000. A minimum molecular weight of 30,000 to 31,000 was calculated on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid composition. Amino acid analysis showed a preponderance of acidic amino acids. No tryptophan was detected in the protein either spectrophotometrically or by amino acid analysis. A total of 20 sulfhydryl groups measured by titration of the reduced protein with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) is in agreement with 20 cystic acid residues determined in hydrolysates of performic acid-oxidized protein. No molybdenum, iron, or selenium was found in the pure protein. Although NADH is the physiological electron donor for the proline reductase complex, the purified 300,000 molecular weight reductase component is inactive in the presence of NADH in vitro. Dithiothreitol, in contrast, can serve as electron donor both for unpurified (putative proline reductase complex) and purified proline reductase in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1598325871,"Previous studies of serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13) and ornithine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13) adaptation in rat liver showed that in rats on a high protein diet, glucocorticoid administration increased serine dehydratase activity while simultaneously reducing the activity of ornithine aminotransferase. The present study examines the role of enzyme synthesis in the expression of these and other dissimilar adaptive characteristics of the two enzymes. Both enzymes were purified to crystallinity and used to prepare specific antibodies. Changes in the rate of synthesis of each enzyme during adaptation were then measured immunochemically. In rats fed ad libitum, the synthetic rates for both enzymes exhibited circadian rhythm, although enzyme levels remained relatively constant. The circadian cycle for ornithine aminotransferase synthesis was in phase with the cycles for body weight and relative liver weight (maxima at 9 a.m., minima at 9 p.m.) but was approximately 12 hours out of phase with the cycle for serine dehydratase synthesis. 9alpha-Fluoro-11beta, 21-dihydroxy-16alpha, 17alpha-isopted at 9 a.m., increased serine dehydratase synthesis and simultaneously decreased the synthesis of ornithine aminotransferase. When triamcinolone was injected at 9 p.m., however, serine dehydratase synthesis was not stimulated, although the reduction of ornithine aminotransferase synthesis was still produced. These results suggest that: (a) circadian cycling of synthesis may be a general phenomenon in enzyme regulation even though for enzymes with relatively long half-lives, such cycling may not be reflected as fluctuations in enzyme levels; (b) such circadian rhythmicity may also involve cyclic changes in the responsiveness of the enzyme-forming system to regulatory stimuli; (c) whereas the adaptive behavior of serine dehydratase typifies that of amino acid-catabolizing enzymes in general, the responses of ornithine aminotransferase denote a functional association of this enzyme with anabolic processes. On this basis, the possibility that ornithine aminotransferase plays a pivotal role in the regulation of urea cycle activity and nitrogen balance is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1522580389,"Chromatin and nuclear ribonucleoprotein (nRNP) have been prepared from a human carcinoma cell line. Following a 1-hour (3H)uridine pulse, 60 to 70% of the nuclear radioactivity, after removal of nucleoli, was found in the chromatin, the balance in nRNP. This was true whether the chromatin and nRNP were separated by velocity centrifugation or by isopycnic centrifugation on Metrizamide gradients. Radioactivity in chromatin and nRNP was found in high molecular weight RNA, with mean sedimentation coefficients of 20 S and 15 S, respectively, as determined on sodium dodecyl sulfate-sucrose gradients. Experiments on the kinetics of appearance of radioactivity in the RNA of the two fractions suggest that some of the chromatin-associated RNA is precursor to nRNP-RNA. The proteins of nRNP are complex as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The contamination by chromatin protein was estimated to be 5%. Experiments involving short pulses of (3H)tryptophan, and pulse-chase, suggested that the rapidly turning over proteins of nRNP were not complexed with RNA while still associated with chromatin. However, it was also shown that the radioactivity in nRNP following short pulses of (3H)tryptophan did not correspond to the major bands seen on stained sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. It is therefore concluded that the protein of nRNP consists of two classes: species present in large amounts, possibly common to all RNA in nRNP, which are relatively stable and may be complexed to RNA still associated with chromatin; and a large number of rapidly turning over species, each present in small amounts and associated with nRNP only after its release from chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2117434395,"The dramatic increase in bioluminescence observed during the later exponential growth of Beneckea harveyi is due to the induction of luciferase activity. The mechanism by which luciferase activity is induced and the possible existence of other induced proteins was investigated in a double-labelind experiment: [4,5-3H]leucine was incorporated into cellular proteins synthesized during the luminescence lag period in early growth; [14C]leucine was incorporated during the later period of luminescence induction. The protein of the cell-free extract were extensively fractionated and luciferase was purified to homogeneity. Analysis of the radioactivity incorporated into the alpha and beta subunits of luciferase showed a dramatic but equal decrease in the 3H/14C ratio for both subunits. This result proves that the synthesis of the alpha and beta chains of luciferase is subject to similar controls and that the regulatory mechanism is operative at the level of gene transcription, or translation at the time of bioluminescence induction, or both. Several additional polypeptides have been found which also show a marked decrease in their 3H/14C ratio indicating that their synthesis is induced during the same period as luciferase. In addition, one polypeptide that is synthesized specifically in the bioluminescence lag period was also detected. The function and role of these new polypeptides with respect to the bioluminescent system is presently under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1484075233,"Cytochrome P-450 appears to be a component of the steroid-coverting enzymes, 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which catalyze sequential steps in sex hormone synthesis. Further evidence indicates that the steroid substrates of these enzymes bind to cytochrome P-450 during catalysis. The present report deals with the problem of whether a single form of cytochrome P-450 mediates both enzyme reactions or whether two enzymes are involved. Both activities are competitively inhibited by a number of the same inhibitors. Because K1 values of competitive inhibitors are dissociated constants, and thus a property of the cytochrome, different magnitudes of K1, determined for the same inhibitor with each enzyme, are consistent with the participation of more than one form of cytochrome P-450. Differences in the K1 values were found to be statistically significant and varied from 3- to 10-fold. Two competitive inhibitors retarded velocities with one reaction but not the other. In addition, the enzyme activities were markedly different in their sensitivity to carbon monoxide inhibition. The conclusion based on these two lines of evidence is that separate enzymes and different forms of cytochrome P-450 are involved in each reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1652630039,"Escherichia coli Phage Qbeta RNA replicase, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is a tetramer composed of one phage-coded polypeptide and three host-supplied polypeptides which are known to function in the biosynthesis of proteins in the uninfected host. Two of these polypeptides, protein synthesis elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-Ts, are required for initiation of transcription by Qbeta replicase with all templates. Using a previously developed reconstitution system we have examined the effects of modification of EF-Tu on reconstituted replicase activity. The poly(G) polymerase activity of the enzyme can be recovered after pretreatment of the EF-Tu-GDP with either L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone or N-ethylmaleimide, both of which inhibit the aminoacyl-tRNA binding activity of EF-Tu. This suggests that the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site of EF-Tu is not required for Qbeta replicase activity. When Qbeta replicase is treated with kirromycin, an antibiotic which modifies EF-Tu activity by an unknown mechamism, the protein synthetic activity of the EF-Tu in the replicase complex is eliminated but the Qbeta RNA replication activity is only slightly affected. Treatment of pure EF-Tu with kirromycin, however, prevents it from functioning in the renaturation of Qbeta replicase. This antibiotic is not effective against the EF-Tu-Ts complex in the reconstitution assay. Kirromycin at the relatively high concentration used here is found to prevent the formation of the EF-Tu-Ts complex. GDP, which binds to EF-Tu and inhibits formation of the complex with EF-Ts, also inhibits renaturation of Qbeta replicase. It is suggested that the EF-Tu-Ts complex, rather than the individual polypeptides, functions in the renaturation of Qbeta replicase and that the kirromycin and GDP act by preventing formation of this complex."
https://openalex.org/W1581237857,"Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate labeled to the extent of 90% with 13C in the 4' (aldehyde) and 5' (methylene) positions has been synthesized. 13C NMR spectra of this material and of natural abundance pyridoxal 5'-phosphate are reported, as well as 13C NMR spectra of the Schiff base formed by reaction of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with n-butylamine, the secondary amine formed by reduction of this Schiff base, the thiazolidine formed by reaction of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with cysteine, the hexahydropyrimidine formed by reaction of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with 1,3-diaminobutane, and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. The range of chemical shifts for carbon 4' in these compounds is more than 100 ppm, and thus this chemical shift is expected to be a sensitive indicator of structure in enzyme-bound pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The chemical shift of carbon 5', on the other hand, is insensitive to these structure changes. 13C NMR spectra have been obtained at pH 7.8 and 9.4 for D-serine dehydratase (Mr = 46,000) containing natural abundance pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and containing 13C-enriched pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The enriched material contains two new resonances not present in the natural abundance material, one at 167.7 ppm with a linewidth of approximately 24 Hz, attributed to carbon 4' of the Schiff base in the bound coenzyme, and one at 62.7 Hz with a linewidth of approximately 48 Hz attributed to carbon 5' of the bound Schiff base. A large number of resonances due to individual amino acids are assigned. The NMR spectrum changes only slightly when the pH is raised to 9.4. The widths of the two enriched coenzyme resonances indicate that the coenzyme is rather rigidly bound to the enzyme but probably has limited motional freedom relative to the protein. 13C NMR spectra have been obtained for L-glutamate decarboxylase containing natural abundance pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and 13C-enriched pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Under conditions where the two enriched 13C resonances are clearly visible in D-serine dehydratase, no resonances are visible in enriched L-glutamate decarboxylase, presumably because the coenzyme is rigidly bound to the protein and the 300,000 molecular weight of this enzyme produces very short relaxation times for the bound coenzyme and thus very broad lines."
https://openalex.org/W1603402945,"Mitochondria from the muscle of Ascaris lumbricoides var. suis function anaerobically. NADH is generated in the intermembrane space as a consequence of the malic enzyme reaction. It has been suggested that this reducing equivalent in the form of hydride ion, would be translocated across the inner membrane in order to mediate ATP generation via the fumarate reductase reaction. In accord with this suggestion, intact Ascaris mitochondria showed appreciable NADH oxidase activity. Sonication resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in NADH oxidase activity, whereas malic enzyme, fumarase, and NADH:NAD+ transhydrogenase activities increased approximately 7- to 14-fold, respectively. Phosphorylation capabilities and permeability toward pyridine nucleotides also indicated the intactness of the mitochondria. Ascaris mitochondria incubated anaerobically in the presence of fumarate, and [14C]NADH catalyzed a rapid reduction of the fumarate to succinate with the concomitant formation of equivalent quantities of extramitochondrial NAD+. However, very little isotope was recovered from the washed mitochondria, indicating the possibility of hydride ion translocation in the absence of nucleotide translocation. NADH:NAD+ transhydrogenase has been isolated from the muscle mitochondria of the intestinal nematode, Ascaris lumbricoides var. suis. The enzyme seems to have been solubilized from the mitochondrial membrane fraction by treatment with sodium deoxycholate followed by dialysis and subsequent adsorption by and elution from alumina C gamma. No NADPH:NAD+ transhydrogenase activity was detectable, making the Ascaris system unique over others reported. Activity was protected by L-cysteine, reduced glutathione and dithioerythritol, but strongly inhibited by low concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzoate or silver nitrate. The thionicotinamide derivative of NAD+ (thioNAD+) was employed to accept hydride ions from NADH in order to assay spectrophotometrically at 398 nm. Apparent Km values for thioNAD+ and NADH were 1 X 10(-4) M and 8 X 10(-6) M, respectively. That the physiological nucleotide, could act as hydride ion acceptor from NADH was indicated by the findings that NAD+ competitively inhibited the reduction of thioNAD+ when assayed at 398 nm. The additional finding of a noncompetitive inhibition between NAD+ and NADH suggested at least two binding sites on the enzyme, one for NADH and another common site for NAD+ and thioNAD+. More conclusive evidence indicating the participation of NAD+ as acceptor was obtained by incubation of the enzyme with NADH and [14C]NAD+ and demonstrating a rapid formation of [14C]NADH. These findings, in conjunction with those discussed above, suggest a physiological function of this enzyme in hydride ion translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1504235743,"Inhibitors of the peptidase and esterase activities of carboxypeptidases A and B have been isolated from extracts of Ascaris lumbricoides var suis. These proteins were obtained by treatment of the aqueous extracts at low pH, precipitation with ammonium sulfate, molecular sieving on Bio-Gel P-4, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The inhibitors were resolved into three homogeneous peaks on CM-cellulose. These components, CM-A, CM-B, and CM-C, have constant specific activity and were recovered in a 41% yield. They moved as single bands when subjected to electrophoresis at high or low pH on polyacrylamide gels and they have similar amino acid compositions. Methionine, tyrosine, and cysteine are absent from each of the inhibitors. The 65 residues of CM-B suggest a minimum molecular weight of 7530, in close agreement to the value of 7600 +/- 200 determined on a Bio-Gel P-100 column. Each of the proteins has the same NH2-terminal residues, NH2-Asx-Glx-Val-Glx- and the same COOH-terminal residue, leucine. A plot of per cent acrylamide versus log relative mobility suggests that the three proteins are charge isomers. CM-B appears to be stable to high NaCl concentrations, extremes of pH, high temperatures, and digestion by intestinal proteases. Carboxypeptidase C, carboxypeptidase N, and yeast protease C are not inhibited by CM-B. However, the exopeptidase and esterase activities of human carboxypeptidase A are inhibited. The inhibitors appear to bind to bovine carboxypeptidase A with an atypical stoichiometry. Two moles of CM-B inhibitor bind to 1 mol of enzyme. The evidence is: (a) a demonstrated purity of bovine carboxypeptidase A, (b) minimal and maximal inhibitor molecular weights by different methods, of 7600 and 8300, and (c) a maximum specific activity of apparently homogeneous inhibitors which is 50% of that predicted for unit stoichiometry."

Reduced methyl viologen, NADH, and an endogenous electron donor each can serve as a reductant. Inhibition studies and gel filtration patterns reveal the presence of at least two hydrogenation systems, one of which is coupled through a flavin, possibly FMN. Although the enzymes comprising the biohydrogenation pathway, the fatty acid reductases and linoleic acid isomerase, are part of the bacterial membrane, they do not appear to be constituted as a multienzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1664453680,"The alkaline phosphatase from KB cells was purified, characterized, and compared to placental alkaline phosphatase, which it resembles immunologically. Two nonidentical nonomeric subunits of the KB phosphatase were found. The two subunits, which have apparent molecular weights of 64,000 and 72,000, can be separated on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The Mr = 64,000 KB subunit appears to be identical in protein structure to the monomer of placental alkaline phosphatase. The Mr = 72,000 KB subunit, while differing in the NH2-terminal amino acid, appears also to be very similar to the placental alkaline phosphatase monomer. Both KB phosphatase subunits bind (32P)phosphate, and bind to Sepharose-bound anti-placental alkaline phosphatase. Native KB phosphatase is identical to the placental isozyme in isoelectric point, pH optimum, and inhibition by amino acids, and has a very similar peptide map. The data presented support the hypothesis that the Mr = 64,000 KB phosphatase subunit may the the same gene product as the monomer of placental alkaline phosphatase. This paper strengthens the evidence that the gene for this fetal protein, normally repressed in all cells but placenta, is derepressed in the KB cell line. In addition, this paper presents the first structural evidence that there are two different subunit proteins comprising the placental-like alkaline phosphatase from a human tumor cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1591232813,"We present evidence that added thrombin stimulates release of endogenous arachidonic acid by suspensions of human platelets. We also show that added arachidonic acid causes a burst in O2 consumption that mimics one of the well described effects of thrombin on these cells. Further, added aspirin, a known inhibitor of the burst in O2 consumption caused by thrombin, also blunted the stimulatory effect of arachidonate on O2 consumption, and eicosatetraynoate, a known inhibitor of arachidonate oxygenation, blunted the burst in O2 consumption initiated by both thrombin and arachidonate. We conclude that rapid oxygenation of endogenously released arachidonic acid accounts for the thrombin-mediated burst in oxygen consumption by platelets."

https://openalex.org/W1495628520,"The interaction of a series of bifunctional reagents with skeletal muscle myosin has been studied. In the di-imido ester series dimethylmalonimidate failed to generate any cross-linked species, whereas the adipic and higher analogues gave dimers of myosin heavy chains. Analysis of free amino groups after reaction with these reagents and with the reducible species dimethyldithiobis(propionimidate) showed that no more than two to three cross-links per molecule were introduced. By contrast, the bifunctional reducible acylating agent, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), reacted with annihilation of about 10% of the amino groups under mild conditions that precluded the formation of intermolecularly linked species. Digestion of the intramolecularly cross-linked myosin with papain, followed by analysis of the fragments by gel electrophoresis, revealed extensive cross-linking between the globular heads of the myosin molecules. The subfragment 1 dimers regenerated subfragment 1 on reduction, as shown by the electrophoretic mobility and amino acid analysis. The extent of cross-linking, and therefore presumably the average relative orientation or freedom of the two heads, was unaffected by the addition of ADP and calcium ions. The internally cross-linked myosin retains practically its full calcium-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity, but in contrast to native myosin is soluble even at very low ionic strength. Circular dichroism measurements show that the alpha helical conformation is undisturbed in cross-linked myosin, but the sedimentation coefficient is considerably higher than that of the native protein, possibly due to freezing of the heads in a closed configuration. The light chaiins are not cross-linked to the heavy chains, except under extreme conditions that leads to intermolecular cross-linking and inactivation. The presence of calcium ions protects dithiobisnitrobenzoate light chains against degradation by papain."

Unit responses were recorded along cortical and thalamic trajectories. The late components of the poststimulus response of 29% of the cells examined showed statistically significant differences when data from different behavioral outcomes to the same neutral generalization stimulus were compared.
https://openalex.org/W1525915266,"Whole cells of Mycobacterium phlei were shown to actively accumulate proline, leucine, lysine, tryptophan, histidine, glutamine, and glutamic acid to different steady state levels. The transport of proline, in contrast to that of other amino acids, was found to be insensitive to various respiratory inhibitors, e.g. cyanide, arsenate, azide, and sulfhydryl reagents. However, oxygen was an obligatory requirement for the uptake of proline, as well as for the other amino acids. The results indicate that the energy requirements for proline uptake are different from those of other amino acids. In contrast to the system from Escherichia coli, the mode of energy transduction for the uptake of proline, glutamine, and glutamic acid is different even though these amino acids are shock resistant in the M. phlei system."
https://openalex.org/W1482042539,"Amidophosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.14) has been partially purified from pigeon liver, and ligand-induced alterations in molecular and kinetic properties have been studied. In Tris-HCl buffer the predominant form of the enzyme has an s20,w of 5.9 +/- 0.7, Stokes radium of 42 A, and estimated molecular weight of 102,000. Incubation with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) results in an increase in the s20,w to 7.9 +/- 0.6, Stokes radius to 53 A, and estimated molecular weight to 172,000. Incubation of this larger form with purine ribonucleotides leads to a decrease in the molecular weight of amidophosphoribosyltransferase that is proportional to the concentration of purine ribonucleotide. Purine ribonucleotides produce sigmoidal kinetics with respect to the substrate PP-ribose-P, with Hill coefficients of 1.4 to 1.6 and 1.8 to 2.0 in the presence of AMP and GMP, respectively. Incubation with 0.6 M KCl leads to sigmoidal kinetics. Hill coefficient of 1.8 and dissociation of the larger form of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. Inorganic phosphate has complex effects upon the enzyme. In 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer the enzyme aggregates to a large form with an s20,w of 8.3 +/- 0.2, Stokes radius of 53 A, and estimated molecular weight of 181,000. Inorganic phosphate and PP-ribose-P both stabilize the enzyme to storage in vitro at 4 degrees. However, inorganic phosphate is 4 times more effective than PP-ribose-P in preventing inactivation of the enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Inorganic phosphate produces sigmoidal kinetics with respect to PP-ribose-P, Hill coefficient of 1.5. The interaction coefficients for AMP and GMP are reduced from 1.8 to 1.2 and 2.2 to 1.4, respectively, in the presence of 25 mM potassium phosphate. It is concluded that pigeon liver amidophosphoribosyltransferase is a complex allosteric protein whose activity is regulated by a series of conformational changes induced by a number of ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1579493911,"The mechanism and sequence of side chain hydroxylation of cholesterol in bile acid synthesis was studied in the isolated perfused rabbit liver. A comparison was made between the importance of 26- and 25-hydroxylation in cholic acid biosynthesis in the rabbit. The formation of [G-3H]cholic acid was observed when the liver was perfused with 5beta-[G-3H]cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha-diol, 5beta-[G-3H]cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha-12alpha-triol, and 5beta-[G-3H]cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 26-triol. No [G-3H]chenodeoxycholic acid was detected in the bile. These findings indicate that potential precursors of chenodeoxycholic acid were hydroxylated at position 12alpha either subsequent to or before hydroxylation of the cholesterol side chain. In addition, no other intermediates (tetrahydroxy or pentahydroxy bile alcohols) were found in the bile when these compounds were perfused in the liver. Bile acid precursors were detected in bile when the rabbit liver was perfused with 5beta-[24-14C]cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 25-triol. The 5beta-[24-14C]cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 25-triol was hydroxylated in the liver at the 12alpha position to yield the corresponding 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 25-tetrol. The tetrol was further metabolized to a series of pentols (5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 22, 25-pentol; 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 23, 25-pentol; 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 24, 25-pentol; and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 25, 26-pentol). The major bile acid obtained from the perfusion of the 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 25-triol was cholic acid. The experiments indicated that in the rabbit liver 12alpha-hydroxylation can occur after hydroxylation of the cholesterol side chain at either C-25 (5 beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 25-triol) or C-26 (5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha-26-triol). Apparently, the rabbit can form cholic acid via the classical 26-hydroxylation pathway as well as via 25-hydroxylated intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1986098772,"Lymphoid cells are unable to lyse antibody-coated target cells in the presence of normal immunoglobulin G (IgG), presumably because their surface receptors for IgG are blocked. However, when target cells are sensitized with antibodies and complement, IgG receptors are unblocked and cytotoxicity occurs even in the presence of normal IgG. Thus, IgG receptors may function in vivo despite the relatively high concentrations of IgG in serum and interstitial fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2116761171,"A nuclease inhibitor found in the mycelia of Aspergillus oryzae has been purified 158,000-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on Sephadex G-75, DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and Bio-Gel p-60 columns, preparative disc electrophoresis on acrylamide gel, and electrofocusing in ampholite. The purified inhibitor is nearly homogeneous as judged by disc electrophoresis. It shows a typical ultraviolet absorption curve for protein, and the inhibitory activity is inactivated by chymotrypsin. The inhibitor and nuclease O (EC 3.1.4.9, a crystalline enzyme from the mycelia of the same organism) form a stable enzyme inhibitor complex. The molecular weights of nuclease O, the inhibitor and the enzyme inhibitor complex are estimated to be 46,000, 22,000 and 73,000 respectively, by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. The isoelectric points of the enzyme and the inhibitor are 10.0 and 4.09, respectively, as determined by electrofocusing in ampholite. The inhibition is noncompetitive, and the inhibitor constant (K1) is 3.2 X 10(-12) M, whereas the Michaelis constant (Km) for DNA is 2.2 X 10(-8) M. The inactive enzyme-inhibitor complex is reactivated by chymotrypsin through inactivation of the inhibitor. The reactivated enzyme can be inactivated again by the inhibitor, which shows that desensitization of the enzyme does not occur by the action of chymotrypsin."

https://openalex.org/W1570757548,"Rabbit lymph node cell populations cultured in vitro in the presence of fetal calf serum are induced to produce immunoglobulin M-secreting cells. The induction of such immunoglobulin production, measured by the capacity of the cell population to secrete immunoglobulins, was inhibited when cells were cultured with sera from a variety of species despite the presence of fetal calf serum. The addition of such inhibitory serum 36 hours after initiation of the cell culture or thereafter was without effect on the extent of induction of immunoglobulin production. On the other hand, the presence of inhibitory serum in culture during only the first 24 hours yielded the same inhibition as when serum was present throughout the 72-hour culture period. Inhibitory sera also suppressed the incorporation of thymidine into DNA. The induction of immunoglobulin production and the incorporation of thymidine into DNA were essentially equally inhibited by the same range of serum concentrations. Unlike conventional inhibitors of DNA synthesis, the inhibitory sera exhibited selective specificity with regard to the kind of cells that could be affected. Thus, such sera inhibited the DNA synthesis of lymph node cells cultured in the presence of fetal calf serum but did not inhibit concanavalin A-stimulated DNA synthesis of such cultured cells and, similarly, serum did not inhibit DNA synthesis of thymus cells cultured in the presence of fetal calf serum. The sera of all species examined were inhibitory except for fetal sera. As judged from a quantitative assay, bovine and porcine serum contained the highest titer of inhibitor, whereas sera from human, rat, mouse, and rabbit were clustered in a group exhibiting less inhibitor. Ascites fluid and lymph node extracellular fluids contained less inhibitor than found in the serum of the same animal and lysates of washed lymph node cells were devoid of inhibitor. Although fetal bovine serum and newborn bovine serum did not contain the inhibitor, it was detectable within 24 hours of parturition. The inhibitor is of relatively large apparent molecular weight (about 300,000) and has been purified about 70-fold."
