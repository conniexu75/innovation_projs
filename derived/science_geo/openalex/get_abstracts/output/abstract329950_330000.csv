https://openalex.org/W2043333517,"Deep Sea Drilling Project cores collected at site 362/362A suggest the time of initiation of the Benguela upwelling system off northern Namibia. Studies of sediment accumulation rates, diatom abundances, microfossil temperature preferences (for planktic foraminifers, calcareous nannoplankton, and silicoflagellates), productivity (expressed as the organic carbon content), and phosphorus incorporation in calcareous skeletons all suggest that major, sustained upwelling began in the early late Miocene. Upwelling brought cold, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, and the modern Benguela system dates from this time (about 10 million years before the present)."
https://openalex.org/W2014128567,"In situ radon-222 flux experiments conducted in benthic chambers in Cape Lookout Bight, a small marine basin on the North Carolina coast, reveal that enhanced chemical transport across the sediment-water interface during summer months is caused by abiogenic bubble tube structures. Transport rates for dissolved radon, methane, and ammonium more than three times greater than those predicted on the basis of molecular diffusion occur when open tubes are maintained by semi-diurnal low-tide bubbling."
https://openalex.org/W2077224636,"Preliminary results from solar radiation measurements from the earth radiation budget experiment on the Nimbus 7 satellite yield a mean value of 1376.0 watts per square meter for the ""solar constant"" from 16 November 1978 to 15 May 1979. The observed variability (root-mean-square deviation) is +/- 0.73 watt per square meter (+/- 0.05 percent) for the period."

https://openalex.org/W1982310683,"The oldest anatomically preserved and physiologically apparently independent gametophytes are described from the Lower Devonian of Scotland. These gametophytes have upright, leafless axes with terminally borne, bowl-shaped game-tangiophores. The antheridia are stalked and their walls are multicellular. The archegonia are clustered in groups on common bases."
