https://openalex.org/W2096327192,"During development, the formation of mature neural circuits requires the selective elimination of inappropriate synaptic connections. Here we show that C1q, the initiating protein in the classical complement cascade, is expressed by postnatal neurons in response to immature astrocytes and is localized to synapses throughout the postnatal CNS and retina. Mice deficient in complement protein C1q or the downstream complement protein C3 exhibit large sustained defects in CNS synapse elimination, as shown by the failure of anatomical refinement of retinogeniculate connections and the retention of excess retinal innervation by lateral geniculate neurons. Neuronal C1q is normally downregulated in the adult CNS; however, in a mouse model of glaucoma, C1q becomes upregulated and synaptically relocalized in the adult retina early in the disease. These findings support a model in which unwanted synapses are tagged by complement for elimination and suggest that complement-mediated synapse elimination may become aberrantly reactivated in neurodegenerative disease."

Here we used mouse genetic analyses to define the roles of autophagy in the aforementioned events. We report that the ubiquitin- and LC3-binding protein “p62” regulates the formation of protein aggregates and is removed by autophagy. Thus, genetic ablation of p62 suppressed the appearance of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates in hepatocytes and neurons, indicating that p62 plays an important role in inclusion body formation. Moreover, loss of p62 markedly attenuated liver injury caused by autophagy deficiency, whereas it had little effect on neuronal degeneration. Our findings highlight the unexpected role of homeostatic level of p62, which is regulated by autophagy, in controlling intracellular inclusion body formation, and indicate that the pathologic process associated with autophagic deficiency is cell-type specific.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a highly conserved bulk protein degradation pathway in eukaryotes. In the initial step of this process, the cytoplasmic portions and organelles are engulfed within a double-membrane vesicle called autophagosome, and then the autophagosome fuses with the lysosomes to degrade the sequestered materials by various lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes, followed by generation of amino acids that are recycled for macromolecular synthesis and energy production. Emerging evidence emphasizes the importance of autophagy in various biological and pathological processes, such as cellular remodeling, tumorigenesis, and developmental programs (Levine and Klionsky, 2004Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Development by self-digestion: molecular mechanisms and biological functions of autophagy.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that in mammalian cells, autophagy serves two physiological purposes. The first is to supply amino acids for cell survival under poor environmental conditions, which is universally known as “adaptive autophagy.” Indeed, this type of autophagy is rapidly induced under nutritional deprivation in yeast (Tsukada and Ohsumi, 1993Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. Isolation and characterization of autophagy-defective mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) and in newborn mice (Kuma et al., 2004Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. The role of autophagy during the early neonatal starvation period.Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar), serving as a basic survival strategy in all eukaryotes. The second is to degrade proteins in the cell through continuous operation at a low level irrespective of nutritional stress, known as “basal or constitutive autophagy.” In the latter pathway, autophagy is responsible for the turnover of long-lived proteins, disposal of excess (Iwata et al., 2006Iwata J. Ezaki J. Komatsu M. Yokota S. Ueno T. Tanida I. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Kominami E. Excess peroxisomes are degraded by autophagic machinery in mammals.J. Biol.

Recent genetic studies using mice have highlighted the importance of constitutive autophagy in nondividing cells, such as hepatocytes and neurons, in which loss of autophagy results in severe liver injury and neurodegeneration, respectively (Hara et al., 2006Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N.

Tanaka K. Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice.Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Unexpected findings in these studies were that loss of autophagy causes cytoplasmic accumulation of ubiquitin-positive proteinaceous inclusions, together with hepatocytic and neuronal death without expression of proteins with disease-associated mutations (Hara et al., 2006Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N.

However, the underlying mechanism of inclusion body formation in the aforementioned diseases is largely unknown at present. Using mouse genetics, we report the critical role of the multifunctional protein “p62/A170/SQSTM1” (also known as a signaling adaptor/scaffold protein) in the formation of intracellular ubiquitin-related protein aggregation caused by deficiency in autophagy. We show that autophagic degradation of the “p62” via direct interaction with LC3, a posttranslational modifier essential for autophagosome formation, prevents inclusion body formation. Importantly, our studies uncover the molecular mechanism linking autophagy, p62, and inclusion body formation, which is a cellular hallmark in various pathophysiological conditions, and reveal pathophysiological changes associated with loss of p62 and/or autophagy in hepatocytes and neurons. The microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) is a modifier protein conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), analogous to Atg8 in yeast (Ichimura et al., 2000Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. et al.A ubiquitin-like system mediates protein lipidation.Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). PE-conjugated LC3 (LC3-II) is localized in the inner and outer membranes of autophagosomes, and the population associated with the inner membrane is degraded after fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (Kabeya et al., 2000Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). To identify protein(s) that could interact with LC3, we employed the proteomic approach as described previously (Komatsu et al., 2004Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. A novel protein-conjugating system for Ufm1, a ubiquitin-fold modifier.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and then identified a unique protein p62 as one of LC3-interacting proteins, in addition to LC3-modifying enzymes (Ohsumi, 2001Ohsumi Y. Molecular dissection of autophagy: two ubiquitin-like systems.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) (Table S1). The p62 protein is conserved in metazoa and plants but not in yeasts and can bind a large number of proteins through its multiple protein-protein interaction motifs (Moscat et al., 2006Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Albert A. Campuzano S. Cell signaling and function organized by PB1 domain interactions.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Figure S1). This protein mediates diverse signaling pathways including cell stress, survival, and inflammation (Moscat et al., 2006Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Albert A. Campuzano S. Cell signaling and function organized by PB1 domain interactions.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Wooten et al., 2006Wooten M.W. Hu X. Babu J.R. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Paine M.G. Wooten M.C. Signaling, polyubiquitination, trafficking, and inclusions: Sequestosome 1/p62′s role in neurodegenerative disease.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2006; 2006: 62079Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To verify the interaction between LC3 and p62 in vivo, we first carried out immunoprecipitation assay with cultured hepatocytes isolated from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 transgenic (Tg) mice (GFP-LC3 tg) (Mizushima et al., 2004Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. In vivo analysis of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation using transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent autophagosome marker.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar) and confirmed the coimmunoprecipitation of p62 with GFP-LC3 under both nutrient-rich and -poor conditions (Figure 1A). We also confirmed the coimmunoprecipitation of p62 with endogenous LC3 in wild-type mouse liver (Figure 1B). In addition to the major band, the minor band detected by our p62 antibody was probably a p62 splicing variant product found in the mouse protein database or a partially cleaved product (see also Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Moreover, recombinant p62 was pulled down with recombinant GST-LC3 (Figure 1C), indicating direct physical interaction between p62 and LC3. Subsequent binding assays with a series of recombinant p62 mutants indicated that p62 interacts with LC3 through a linker region that connects the N-terminal Zinc finger and the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of p62 (Figure S1). Immunofluorescence microscopy using hepatocytes isolated from GFP-LC3 Tg mice showed colocalization of large numbers of punctate signal for GFP-LC3 (84.7% ± 10.9%, ± SD, n = 21) with that for p62 (Figure 1E). When autophagosome formation was induced by nutrient-deprivation, 34.9% ± 6.7% (n = 22) of ring-shaped GFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes contained p62 signal, some of which showed partial colocalization (Figure 1F). A similar colocalization pattern was also observed in liver sections of GFP-LC3 Tg starved for 1 day (Figure 1G). The p62-positive and GFP-LC3-negative particles might correspond to late endosomes or lysosomes, as reported previously (Sanchez et al., 1998Sanchez P. De Carcer G. Sandoval I.V. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Localization of atypical protein kinase C isoforms into lysosome-targeted endosomes through interaction with p62.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3069-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that some population of LC3-II is degraded in lysosomes (Kabeya et al., 2000Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar), treatment with lysosomal enzyme inhibitors, but not with a proteasomal inhibitor, resulted in the accumulation of LC3-II in primary hepatocytes (Figure 1D). Similarly, lysosomal inhibition resulted in marked accumulation of p62 (Figure 1D). When lysosomal inhibitors were added to cultured hepatocytes, the majority of p62 accumulated around the perinuclear region, where it colocalized with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker (Figure 1H), suggesting the turnover of p62 together with LC3II in lysosomes.Figure 2Formation of Ubiquitin- and p62-Positive Inclusions in Autophagy-Deficient HepatocytesShow full caption(A) Accumulation of p62 in Atg7-deficient hepatocytes.

If p62 is degraded by the autophagic-lysosome pathway, autophagy deficiency should result in the accumulation of p62 protein. To test this in vivo, we used the Atg7F/F:Mx1 mice, in which Atg7, a gene essential for autophagy, can be depleted in the liver by intraperitoneal injections of polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (pIpC) (Figure 2A, left panel) (Komatsu et al., 2005Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. et al.Impairment of starvation-induced and constitutive autophagy in Atg7-deficient mice.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). We observed specific accumulation of p62 protein in Atg7-deficient livers (Figures 2A and 2D) without marked induction of p62 mRNA (Figure 2E). Similar to Atg7 knockout liver, deficiency of Atg5, which is essential for autophagosome formation (Mizushima et al., 2001Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Dissection of autophagosome formation using Apg5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), was also associated with marked accumulation of p62 (Figure S2). These results indicate that p62 turnover is mediated by autophagy. Autophagic breakdown of p62 appears to occur irrespective of cell type, because a similar observation was recently reported in HeLa, HEK293T, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Bjorkoy et al., 2005Bjorkoy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J.

Interestingly, abundant amounts of p62 were noted in both detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions from Atg7-deficient livers (Figure 2A, right-middle panel), in parallel with accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in both fractions from Atg7-deficient but not from control livers (Figure 2A, right-top panel) (Komatsu et al., 2005Komatsu M.

Subsequently, to investigate the cellular localization of ubiquitin, p62, and LC3 in autophagy-deficient hepatocytes, we generated the Atg7F/F:Mx1:GFP-LC3 mice by crossing Atg7F/F:Mx1 with GFP-LC3 Tg mice. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the Atg7-deficient cultured hepatocytes contained abundant ubiquitin- (Figure 2B, top panels), or p62- (Figure 2B, bottom panels) positive inclusions in the cytoplasm, which were also positive for GFP-LC3.

https://openalex.org/W2149014007,"<h2>Summary</h2> The activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in dendritic cells (DCs) triggers a rapid inflammatory response to pathogens. However, this response must be tightly regulated because unrestrained TLR signaling generates a chronic inflammatory milieu that often leads to autoimmunity. We have found that the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases—Tyro3, Axl, and Mer—broadly inhibit both TLR and TLR-induced cytokine-receptor cascades. Remarkably, TAM inhibition of inflammation is transduced through an essential stimulator of inflammation—the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)—and its associated transcription factor STAT1. TLR induction of IFNAR-STAT1 signaling upregulates the TAM system, which in turn usurps the IFNAR-STAT1 cassette to induce the cytokine and TLR suppressors SOCS1 and SOCS3. These results illuminate a self-regulating cycle of inflammation, in which the obligatory, cytokine-dependent activation of TAM signaling hijacks a proinflammatory pathway to provide an intrinsic feedback inhibitor of both TLR- and cytokine-driven immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1982250275,"MicroRNAs are small endogenous noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation. During microRNA biogenesis, Drosha and Dicer process the primary transcript (pri-miRNA) through a precursor hairpin (pre-miRNA) to the mature miRNA. The miRNA is incorporated into the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) with Argonaute proteins, the effector molecules in RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we show that all Argonautes elevate mature miRNA expression posttranscriptionally, independent of RNase activity. Also, we identify a role for the RISC slicer Argonaute2 (Ago2) in cleaving the pre-miRNA to an additional processing intermediate, termed Ago2-cleaved precursor miRNA or ac-pre-miRNA. This endogenous, on-pathway intermediate results from cleavage of the pre-miRNA hairpin 12 nucleotides from its 3′-end. By analogy to siRNA processing, Ago2 cleavage may facilitate removal of the nicked passenger strand from RISC after maturation. The multiple roles of Argonautes in the RNAi effector phase and miRNA biogenesis and maturation suggest coordinate regulation of microRNA expression and function.

The microRNA (miRNA) class consists of small endogenous noncoding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides (nt) in length. The first isolated miRNAs were heterochronic genes from C. elegans (Lee et al., 1993Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V.

Processing of the pri-miRNA by the nuclear RNase Drosha as part of a microprocessor complex with DGCR8 (Pasha) produces the pre-miRNA hairpin precursor, which is exported into the cytoplasm by the Exportin-5/Ran-GTP complex (Denli et al., 2004Denli A.M.

Dicer cleaves the pre-miRNA hairpin into the mature miRNA, which enters the RISC and is capable of binding to partially complementary sequences within the 3′UTR of the target mRNA (Hutvagner et al., 2001Hutvagner G.

Ago2, also known as eIF2C2, is the only human Ago protein with intrinsic endonuclease activity, encoded by its PIWI domain, which structurally resembles an RNase H domain (Song et al., 2004Song J.J.

Ago2 has therefore been described as the RISC slicer, providing the RNase activity to cleave target mRNAs that are complementary to the guiding siRNA or miRNA, and it is the only protein component required for RISC activity (Liu et al., 2004Liu J.

Recently, Mello and colleagues analyzed deletional mutants of all 27 members of the large Argonaute family in the nematode C. elegans and found that functionally and structurally distinct Ago proteins act sequentially during siRNA-mediated gene silencing (Yigit et al., 2006Yigit E. Batista P.J. Bei Y. Pang K.M. Chen C.C. Tolia N.H. Joshua-Tor L. Mitani S. Simard M.J. Mello C.C.

Understanding the complex process by which miRNAs are generated from their endogenous transcripts offers important insight into potential regulatory mechanisms. While a single miRNA can have striking effects on expression of its target proteins, global patterns of miRNA expression have also been correlated with distinct stages of development and cancer (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7740) Google Scholar, Neilson et al., 2007Neilson J.R. Zheng G.X. Burge C.B. Sharp P.A. Dynamic regulation of miRNA expression in ordered stages of cellular development.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 578-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Posttranscriptional regulation of miRNA expression has been described previously (Obernosterer et al., 2006Obernosterer G. Leuschner P.J. Alenius M. Martinez J. Post-transcriptional regulation of microRNA expression.RNA. 2006; 12: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, Thomson et al., 2006Thomson J.M. Newman M. Parker J.S. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Wright T. Hammond S.M. Extensive post-transcriptional regulation of microRNAs and its implications for cancer.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), but the protein factors governing the abundance of mature miRNAs remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that steps within the microRNA biogenesis pathway might also have regulatory functions and sought to identify proteins factors that control the expression of the mature, functional microRNAs. Here, we demonstrate the ability of all Ago proteins to enhance the abundance of miRNAs through posttranscriptional mechanisms. We also identify a specific role of Ago2 in mediating cleavage of pre-miRNA to a novel intermediate in miRNA biogenesis. To identify protein factors that are limiting for mature miRNA expression, we recapitulated miRNA processing in a manipulable in vivo system. Since cell lines generally express low levels of miRNAs (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7740) Google Scholar), we cotransfected a CMV-driven let-7a-3 primary transcript into HEK293 (293) cells to saturate the miRNA processing machinery. We transiently cotransfected constructs encoding human proteins that have been previously linked either to RNA interference (RNAi) or miRNA biogenesis. Ectopic expression levels are documented in Figure S1 (in the Supplemental Data available online). Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of each member of the Argonaute protein family (Ago1–Ago4) gave rise to increased levels of mature let-7a expression (Figure 1A). Other proteins implicated in miRNA biogenesis, Drosha, DGCR8, Dicer, MOV10, TNRC6B (Figure 1A), as well as Gemin-4, Ran and Exportin-5 (data not shown) had no effect in this assay screening for rate-limiting factors in miRNA processing. In addition, combinations of processing factors known to act as a complex, Drosha with DGCR8 or Dicer with TRBP, did not alter mature miRNA expression (Figure S2A). The enhancement of mature miRNA expression by ectopically expressed Ago proteins was consistently observed with different transfected pri-miRNA constructs, miR-215, miR-17-5p, miR-23b, miR-92 in two different cell lines (293: Figure 1B; U2OS: Figure S2B). Of note, for miR-215 and miR-17-5p, the mature miRNA is derived from the 5′-arm of the hairpin precursor, whereas mature miR-23b and miR-92 are derived from the 3′-arm. Thus, this effect is independent of the arm of the pre-miRNA hairpin giving rise to the mature miRNA. Argonaute proteins have been described as effector molecules in the RNAi pathway, executing the inhibitory effects of mature siRNA or miRNA molecules (Pillai et al., 2005Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Artus C.G. Zoller T. Cougot N. Basyuk E. Bertrand E. Filipowicz W. Inhibition of translational initiation by Let-7 MicroRNA in human cells.Science. 2005; 309: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), but they have not been functionally linked to miRNA biogenesis. Given their effect in the ectopic expression screening assay, we tested whether expression of endogenous Argonaute proteins also has an impact on the expression levels of endogenous miRNAs. A knockout mouse for Ago2 has recently been reported (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J. Argonaute2 is the catalytic engine of mammalian RNAi.Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar), allowing us to analyze the effects of endogenous Ago2 on miRNA expression. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Ago2 knockout (KO) mice and measured expression of endogenous miRNAs whose mature form is detectable in matched wild-type (WT) MEFs. Remarkably, all five miRNAs tested, let-7a, let-7c, miR-17-5p, miR-92, and miR-21, showed strongly reduced expression in Ago2 null MEFs (Figure 2A). For reconstitution and compensation experiments, we stably expressed each Ago family member in the Ago2-deficient MEFs (Figure S3A) and analyzed its effects on expression of mature exogenous and endogenous miRNAs. Introduction of exogenous miRNA precursors demonstrated strongly increased expression of mature miRNAs in Ago2-reconstituted MEFs compared to Ago2-KO cells (Figure 2B, Figure S3B). Ectopic expression of Ago1 partially compensated for the Ago2 deficiency, but other Ago proteins had no or weak effects on mature miRNA expression in Ago2-KO cells. For members of the let-7 family, high ectopic expression in Ago2-deficient cells also resulted in accumulation of unprocessed precursors (Figure S4A), which was reduced following Ago2 reconstitution (Figure S4B) suggesting a potential processing defect in cells lacking Ago2. The effect of Ago2 reconstitution on baseline expression of endogenous miRNAs was consistent with the observations for exogenous precursors but less pronounced. In each case, densitometric quantitation of mature miRNA expression revealed increased mature miRNA expression following Ago2 reconstitution (Figure 2C, Figure S3C). On average, the mature miRNA expression in KO MEFs was reduced to 40% of their levels in WT MEFs and returned to 71% of wild-type levels following Ago2 expression. No such effect was seen with other Ago family members, Ago1, Ago3, and Ago4. The absence of knockout models precludes us from extending our miRNA expression studies for these Ago family members. However, the described phenotypes of Ago2 loss and reconstitution could reflect a role for Ago2 in miRNA maturation or indicate stabilization of the miRNA within the Ago2-containing RLC or RISC—or a combination of these effects. Since Ago proteins are primary effectors of miRNA-mediated silencing, their additional role in miRNA biogenesis raises the possibility of coordinated regulation, providing a potential feedback mechanism to titrate the expression of mature miRNAs with the availability of Ago proteins. Argonaute proteins—one RISC component—can elevate the expression of mature miRNAs—the other RISC component—and thus coordinate expression of both RISC components to form functional, stoichiometric RISCs. The design of the initial screening experiment, using overexpression of the let-7a miRNA and different processing factors, allowed us to detect the microRNA precursor hairpin (pre-miRNA) (Figure 3A) as well as the mature miRNA (Figure 1A). Ectopic expression of Argonaute proteins Ago1, Ago2, and Ago3, as well as TRBP, gave rise to increased levels of the known pre-miRNA precursor. Remarkably, Ago2, but none of the other Argonaute proteins, gave rise to a smaller precursor band. To further characterize this new precursor, we first verified its induction following Ago2 overexpression for additional let-7 family members in both 293 and U2OS cells by northern blotting (Figure 3B). To uncover the identity of the additional precursor, we undertook to isolate miRNA precursor populations from 293 cells that had been transfected with let-7a-3 pri-miRNA and Ago2 (Figures 3C and 3D). To clone the pre-miRNAs, we purified RNA enriched for small RNA species (<200 nt), ligated these to an RNA-cloning linker, and used RT-PCR with one miRNA-specific and one linker-specific primer, followed by high-efficiency cloning and sequencing analysis. About half of the cloned miRNA precursors corresponded to the previously described pre-miRNA hairpin. In addition, we identified a previously unknown species of miRNA precursors approximately eleven nucleotides shorter than the pre-miRNA population (Figure 3D: ac-pre hairpin). Sequencing analysis revealed that this smaller precursor species is derived from the pre-miRNA hairpin by endonucleolytic cleavage within the passenger 3′-arm of the hairpin. Ago2 is the only human Ago protein with an intrinsic endonuclease domain, providing the RNase activity to cleave mRNAs targeted by siRNA or miRNA (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J.

Teng G. Tuschl T. Human Argonaute2 mediates RNA cleavage targeted by miRNAs and siRNAs.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 185-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The unique endonucleolytic activity of Ago2 is of particular interest, since it is known to cleave its mRNA substrates approximately ten nucleotides downstream of the 5′-end of the guiding siRNA (Elbashir et al., 2001Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. RNA interference is mediated by 21- and 22-nucleotide RNAs.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). Given the 3′-overhang of one to two nucleotides at the 3′-end of the hairpin, this size difference matches the estimated cleavage site within the pre-miRNA to generate the hairpin identified here. The hairpin of this endogenous precursor corresponds in size to the shortened intermediate detected by northern blotting in Ago2-overexpressing cells. Thus, we call the additional product, which points to a previously unappreciated step in miRNA biosynthesis, “Ago2-cleaved precursor miRNA” or “ac-pre-miRNA.” For clarification, in cloning and northern blotting experiments, the ac-pre-miRNA is only detected in the form of the short hairpin due to denaturation during RNA isolation and PAGE. However, our further experiments (see below) indicate, that the functional ac-pre-miRNA, the Dicer substrate, consists of a complex of the shortened hairpin hybridized to the short 3′-fragment forming a nicked hairpin, which can also be reconstituted in vitro. Having identified the ac-pre-miRNA in cells overexpressing Ago2 and let-7a pri-miRNAs, we wanted to analyze whether this new precursor was also evident in cells only expressing endogenous Ago2 and endogenous miRNAs. The currently known miRNA biosynthesis pathway was initially defined in vitro, using synthetic precursors and isolating precursor miRNAs that had been processed in vitro (Han et al., 2004Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. The Drosha-DGCR8 complex in primary microRNA processing.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2003Lee Y.

Kim S. et al.The nuclear RNase III Drosha initiates microRNA processing.Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3710) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological prevalence of precursor miRNAs in vivo, we used untransfected, cultured human cell lines to directly clone the rare population of endogenous miRNA precursor species using the linker-mediated cloning method described above for ectopic miRNA precursors. Precursors of three members of the let-7 miRNA family (let-7a-1, let-7a-3, let-7f-1) and the miR-20a from the miR-17/-92 cluster were cloned (Figures 4A–4E). These miRNA species were selected for initial analysis based on their relative abundance in cultured cells and defined functional properties (He et al., 2005He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W.

The most frequently cloned miRNA precursor population corresponded to the previously described pre-miRNA hairpin, with an overhang of non-base-paired nucleotides at the 3′-end. Hairpins lacking one or two nucleotides at the 3′-end were also cloned, suggestive of either exonucleolytic trimming or a lack of accuracy of Drosha cleavage, as previously described for in vitro derived cleavage products (Han et al., 2004Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. The Drosha-DGCR8 complex in primary microRNA processing.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Endogenous ac-pre-miRNA species were identified, comprising 27% of all endogenous precursors isolated from these cells. As described for the ectopic miRNA precursors, endogenous ac-pre-miRNA hairpins were also eleven to twelve nucleotides smaller than the pre-miRNA population (Figure 4A: ac-pre hairpin). Of note, the abundance of the ac-pre-miRNA derived from nontransfected cells expressing endogenous miRNA and endogenous Ago2 was lower than that observed in cells expressing ectopic miRNA and ectopic Ago2 (Figure 3C) explaining why the endogenous precursors are not readily detectable by northern blotting. Endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-miRNA hairpin within the passenger 3′-arm hairpin arm presumably generates both the shortened hairpin and a small 3′-fragment forming a nicked hairpin (Figures 4B–4E). Individual cloning frequencies and the structures of the cloned hairpin sequences are detailed in Figure S5. For all four miRNAs studied, the new precursors comprised a distinct RNA population, clustered around a defined number of deleted nucleotides at the 3′-end, and consistent with a new endogenous intermediate in the biogenesis pathway of these miRNAs. Generation of the ac-pre-miRNA in a reconstituted system using transfected Ago2 and primary miRNA expression constructs allowed us to test required features of both the enzyme and the miRNA substrate. To test whether the RNase activity of Ago2 was necessary for the generation of the ac-pre-miRNA, we created a set of Ago2 constructs harboring mutations in residues implicated in its RNase activity and tested their effects on ac-pre-miRNA generation using northern blotting (Figures 5A, S6A, and S6B). The aspartate residues D597 and D669 are essential for the catalytic endonuclease activity of the Ago2 PIWI domain (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2102601355,"Autophagy is a catabolic process that is negatively regulated by growth and has been implicated in cell death. We find that autophagy is induced following growth arrest and precedes developmental autophagic cell death of Drosophila salivary glands. Maintaining growth by expression of either activated Ras or positive regulators of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibits autophagy and blocks salivary gland cell degradation. Developmental degradation of salivary glands is also inhibited in autophagy gene (atg) mutants. Caspases are active in PI3K-expressing and atg mutant salivary glands, and combined inhibition of both autophagy and caspases increases suppression of gland degradation. Further, induction of autophagy is sufficient to induce premature cell death in a caspase-independent manner. Our results provide in vivo evidence that growth arrest, autophagy, and atg genes are required for physiological autophagic cell death and that multiple degradation pathways cooperate in the efficient clearance of cells during development."
https://openalex.org/W2121908444,"Podocyte dysfunction, represented by foot process effacement and proteinuria, is often the starting point for progressive kidney disease. Therapies aimed at the cellular level of the disease are currently not available. Here we show that induction of urokinase receptor (uPAR) signaling in podocytes leads to foot process effacement and urinary protein loss via a mechanism that includes lipid-dependent activation of alphavbeta3 integrin. Mice lacking uPAR (Plaur-/-) are protected from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proteinuria but develop disease after expression of a constitutively active beta3 integrin. Gene transfer studies reveal a prerequisite for uPAR expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for the development of LPS-mediated proteinuria. Mechanistically, uPAR is required to activate alphavbeta3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility and activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1. Blockade of alphavbeta3 integrin reduces podocyte motility in vitro and lowers proteinuria in mice. Our findings show a physiological role for uPAR signaling in the regulation of kidney permeability."

We identified a functional SNP (itpkc_3) in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC) gene on chromosome 19q13.2 that is significantly associated with Kawasaki disease susceptibility and also with an increased risk of coronary artery lesions in both Japanese and US children. Transfection experiments showed that the C allele of itpkc_3 reduces splicing efficiency of the ITPKC mRNA. ITPKC acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation through the Ca2+/NFAT signaling pathway, and the C allele may contribute to immune hyper-reactivity in Kawasaki disease. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms of immune activation in Kawasaki disease and emphasizes the importance of activated T cells in the pathogenesis of this vasculitis."
https://openalex.org/W2113197207,"Defending body temperature against environmental thermal challenges is one of the most fundamental homeostatic functions that are governed by the nervous system. Here we describe a somatosensory pathway that essentially constitutes the afferent arm of the thermoregulatory reflex that is triggered by cutaneous sensation of environmental temperature changes. Using in vivo electrophysiological and anatomical approaches in the rat, we found that lateral parabrachial neurons are pivotal in this pathway by glutamatergically transmitting cutaneous thermosensory signals received from spinal somatosensory neurons directly to the thermoregulatory command center, the preoptic area. This feedforward pathway mediates not only sympathetic and shivering thermogenic responses but also metabolic and cardiac responses to skin cooling challenges. Notably, this 'thermoregulatory afferent' pathway exists in parallel with the spinothalamocortical somatosensory pathway that mediates temperature perception. These findings make an important contribution to our understanding of both the somatosensory system and thermal homeostasis -- two mechanisms that are fundamental to the nervous system and to our survival."
https://openalex.org/W1992993799,"Dramatic pigmentation changes have evolved within most vertebrate groups, including fish and humans. Here we use genetic crosses in sticklebacks to investigate the parallel origin of pigmentation changes in natural populations. High-resolution mapping and expression experiments show that light gills and light ventrums map to a divergent regulatory allele of the Kit ligand (Kitlg) gene. The divergent allele reduces expression in gill and skin tissue and is shared by multiple derived freshwater populations with reduced pigmentation. In humans, Europeans and East Asians also share derived alleles at the KITLG locus. Strong signatures of selection map to regulatory regions surrounding the gene, and admixture mapping shows that the KITLG genomic region has a significant effect on human skin color. These experiments suggest that regulatory changes in Kitlg contribute to natural variation in vertebrate pigmentation, and that similar genetic mechanisms may underlie rapid evolutionary change in fish and humans."

Phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is a major type (>90%) of dietary vitamin K, but its concentrations in animal tissues are remarkably low compared with those of the menaquinones, especially menaquinone-4 (vitamin K2), the major form (>90%) of vitamin K in tissues. Despite this great difference, the origin of tissue menaquinone-4 has yet to be exclusively defined. It is postulated that phylloquinone is converted into menaquinone-4 and accumulates in extrahepatic tissues. To clarify this, phylloquinone with a deuterium-labeled 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone ring was given orally to mice, and cerebra were collected for D NMR and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses. We identified the labeled menaquinone-4 that was converted from the given phylloquinone, and this conversion occurred following an oral or enteral administration, but not parenteral or intracerebroventricular administration. By the oral route, the phylloquinone with the deuterium-labeled side chain in addition to the labeled 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone was clearly converted into a labeled menaquinone-4 with a non-deuterium-labeled side chain, implying that phylloquinone was converted into menaquinone-4 via integral side-chain removal. The conversion also occurred in cerebral slice cultures and primary cultures. Deuterium-labeled menadione was consistently converted into the labeled menaquinone-4 with all of the administration routes and the culture conditions tested. Our results suggest that cerebral menaquinone-4 originates from phylloquinone intake and that there are two routes of accumulation, one is the release of menadione from phylloquinone in the intestine followed by the prenylation of menadione into menaquinone-4 in tissues, and another is cleavage and prenylation within the cerebrum.

Gla residues serve to form calcium-binding groups in proteins and are essential for their biologic activity. Gla-containing proteins are involved in blood coagulation (4Suttie J.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 191-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), bone metabolism (5Price P.A. Annu. Rev.

Vitamin K undergoes a cyclic interconversion, the vitamin K cycle, comprising reduction of the vitamin K quinone form into the hydroquinone, oxidation to 2,3-epoxide (vitamin K epoxide), and reduction to the quinone. The formation of Gla from glutamate is coupled with the conversion of the hydroquinone to the vitamin K epoxide. Both of these activities occur in GGCX. The warfarin-sensitive microsomal enzyme, vitamin K epoxide reductase, recycles the vitamin K epoxide back to the hydroquinone, thus completing the vitamin K cycle (9Stafford D.W. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 1873-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 10Carlisle T.L. Suttie J.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Bristol J.A. Ratcliffe J.V. Roth D.A. Jacobs M.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Natural vitamin K exists in two molecular forms, phylloquinone (PK) or vitamin K1 and the menaquinones (MKs). All forms of vitamin K have 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoqinone as a common ring structure, but individual forms differ in the length and degree of saturation of a variable aliphatic side chain attached to the 3-position. PK is a single compound and contains a mono-unsaturated side chain of four isoprenoid residues and is found primarily in plants in association with chlorophyll. MKs can be classified into 15 types based on the length of their unsaturated side chains. They are denominated as MK-n, where n denotes the number of isoprenyl residues in the side chain (12Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 399-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The MKs most commonly found in foods are menaquinone-4 (MK-4, vitamin K2), which is regarded as a short-chain menaquinone, and the long-chain menaquinones MK-7 through MK-10 exclusively synthesized by bacteria and gut microflora in mammals (13Seegers W.H. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1965; 14: 213-228PubMed Google Scholar). Menadione or vitamin K3 (K3) is a synthetic compound lacking a side chain but is believed to be biologically active by virtue of its conversion into MK-4 in the body before being active as a cofactor for GGCX (14Taggart W.V. Matschiner J.T. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PK is known to be selectively distributed in a number of hepatic and non-hepatic tissues. In rats fed a conventional laboratory chow diet, the heart contains as much PK as the liver, but the brain appears to have low concentrations. Interestingly, MK-4 is found in most tissues. In general, tissue concentrations of MK-4 exceed those of PK except for liver, where relatively low MK-4 levels are found. Exocrine organs, such as the pancreas and the salivary gland, contain large amounts of MK-4. The brain also contains high MK-4 concentrations. Similar patterns of the tissue-specific distribution of vitamin K are observed in animals and humans (15Thijssen H.H.W. Drittij-Reijnders M.J. Br. J. Nutr. 1994; 72: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Thijssen H.H.W. Drittij-Reijnders M.J. Br. J. Nutr. 1996; 75: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Will et al. (17Will B.H. Usui Y. Suttie J.W. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 2354-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that the livers of chicks fed PK as a sole source of vitamin K contained as much MK-4 as PK. Thijssen et al. (18Thijssen H.H.W. Drittij-Reijnders M.J. Fischer M.A.J.G. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported that extrahepatic tissues contained more MK-4 in rats fed a PK-rich diet than in rats fed an MK-4-rich diet. Because gut flora do not produce as much MK-4 as MKs with a long side chain (n = 6–9) and tissue MK-4 concentrations are not significantly different between normal rats and germ-free rats, and additionally, MK-4 is not abundantly present in normal food products, the MK-4 in rat and human tissues may originate from the conversion of PK in the body (19Davidson R.T. Foley A.L. Engelke J.A. Suttie J.W. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Roden J.E. Drittij-Reijnders M.J. Vermeer C. Thijssen H.H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1379: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, this speculation has yet to be demonstrated correct since the first report by Billeter and Martius in 1960 (21Billeter M. Martius C. Biochem. Z. 1960; 333: 430-439Google Scholar). If the speculation is correct, two possible routes for the conversion of PK to MK-4 can be taken into account; one is the desaturation of the phytyl side chain of phylloquinone to produce the geranylgeranyl group of MK-4, and removal of the phytyl side chain to release K3, followed by geranylgeranylation to form MK-4. In the latter, two possible pathways are postulated; one is that the side-chain removal occurs during intestinal absorption and then the released K3 is transferred to tissues via the bloodstream and thereafter is prenylated to form MK-4 (22Thijssen H.H.W. Vervoort L.M.T. Schurgers L.J. Shearer M.J. Br. J. Nutr. 2006; 95: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The alternative is that, after the transfer of PK into tissues, side-chain cleavage and geranylgeranylation occur simultaneously within tissues. In the present study, we examined which routes are responsible for the conversion of PK to MK-4. Stable isotope-labeled compounds are particularly useful for distinguishing the behavior of exogenous compounds from that of the corresponding endogenous compounds on the basis of structural assignments by NMR spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We synthesized deuterium (D)- or heavy oxygen (18O)-labeled forms of PK and MK-4 in our laboratory. Using these compounds, we were able to obtain unequivocal evidence of the origin of MK-4 in the cerebra of mice. In this report, we present evidence that cerebral MK-4 originates from not only systemic conversion comprising the release of menadione from PK in the intestine and the prenylation of menadione into MK-4 in the cerebra but also the in-cell conversion of PK into MK-4 in cerebra. Our findings suggest that MK-4, a transcriptional regulator of steroid and xenobiotic receptor-mediated signaling (23Ichikawa T. Horie-Inoue K. Ikeda K. Blumberg B. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16927-16934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) as well as a cofactor for GGCX, is not simply a dietary nutrient, but should be regarded as an active form of vitamin K that may contribute to neural functions in mammals.

Organic solvents of HPLC grade were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Animals and Diets—Male and Female C57BL/6 mice at the age of 7 weeks were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan and were fed a commercially available normal laboratory chow diet (F-2 diet, Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 1 week. They were housed 5 per cage with a 12-h light-dark cycle under controlled environmental conditions (temperature: 20 ± 2 °C, humidity: 50 ± 5%). All animals were allowed free access to diet and deionized water for a period of 1 week. The protocols for the experiments were approved by the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Kobe Pharmaceutical University. Measurements of PK, MK-4, and Their Respective Epoxides in Tissues and Plasma of Mice—At 8 weeks of age, blood was withdrawn by heart puncture under light diethyl ether anesthesia, and plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Immediately after death, tissues were excised, immersed and rinsed in ice-cold saline, and stored at –80 °C until the assays. Tissue concentrations of PK, MK-4, and their respective epoxides were assayed as previously described (24Suhara Y. Murakami A. Nakagawa K. Mizuguchi Y. Okano T. Bioorg. Med.

Because vitamin K is sensitive to light, all procedures were performed under a dark light. Briefly, tissues (wet weight, 1–2 g) were pulverized thoroughly with anhydrous sodium sulfate (1:10, w/v) and transferred into a brown-colored glass tube with a Teflon-lined screw cap. The homogenates were added to 0.1 ml of ethanol containing PK-18O and MK-4-18O as internal standards, 0.9 ml of ethanol, and 9 ml of acetone, then mixed thoroughly with a Voltex mixer for 3 min, and allowed to stand for 5 min. This procedure was repeated three times. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the upper layer was transferred into a small brown-glass tube and evaporated dry under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 2 ml of water and 6 ml of hexane, mixed thoroughly, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The upper layer was loaded onto a Sep Pak Vac Silica cartridge column (Waters). The column was eluted with 5 ml of hexane to remove concomitants, and thereafter the vitamin K-containing fraction was eluted with 5 ml of hexane and diethyl ether (97:3) solution. The eluate was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in 60 μl of methanol. An aliquot of this solution was subjected to APCI3000 LC-MS/MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The HPLC analyses were conducted with a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of a binary pump (LC-10AD liquid chromatography), automatic solvent degasser (DGU-14A degasser), and autosampler (SIL-10AD autoinjector). Separations were carried out using a reversed-phase C18 column (Capcell PAK C18 UG120, 5 μm; 4.6 mm inner diameter × 250 mm, Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) with a solvent system consisting of an isocratic solvent A (25 min) and then a linear gradient from 0 to 50% ethanol (50 min). Solvent A contained methanol/0.1% acetic acid aqueous (95:5, v/v) and was delivered at 1.0 ml/min. This mobile phase was passed through the column at 1.0 ml/min. The column was maintained at 35 °C with a column oven (CTO-10AC column oven). All MS data were collected in the positive ion mode with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). The following settings were used: corona discharge needle voltage, 5.5 kV; vaporizer temperature, 400 °C; sheath gas (high purity nitrogen) pressure, 50 p.s.i.; and transfer capillary temperature, 220 °C. The electron multiplier voltage was set at 850 eV. Identification and quantification were based on MS/MS using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The range for the parent scan was 400–500 atomic mass units. MRM transitions (precursor ion and product ion, m/z) and retention time (min) for each analyte were as follows: MK-4: precursor ion, 445.4; product ion, 187.2; retention time, 20.8; MK-4-epoxide: precursor ion, 461.3; product ion, 161.0; retention time, 14.6; MK-4-18O: precursor ion, 449.3; product ion, 191.2; retention time, 20.8; PK: precursor ion, 451.3; product ion, 187.1; retention time, 41.3; PK epoxide: precursor ion, 467.4; product ion, 161.2; retention time, 27.2; and PK-18O: precursor ion, 455.4; product ion, 191.3; retention time, 41.3. Calibration, using internal standardization, was done by linear regression with five different concentrations, 12.5, 50, 200, 800, and 1600 ng/ml. Isolation and Identification of MK-4-d7 in Cerebra of Mice Orally Given PK-d7—At 8 weeks of age, 200 female mice were orally given PK-d7 as a single dose of 10 μmol/kg body weight, and their cerebra were collected at 24 h post-administration and stored at –80 °C for analysis. The cerebra (total wet weight, 60 g) were divided into 40 portions (each ∼1.5 g) for the purification of MK-4-d7. MK-4-d7 in each cerebral sample was extracted and purified with the same procedures as described in the measurement of MK-4-d7 in tissues. Subsequently, the sample solution dissolved in 100 μl of methanol was subjected to purification using a Shimadzu HPLC system consisting of a C-R4A Chromatopac, SPD-6A UV spectrophotometric detector, and LC-6A liquid chromatograph. Separations were carried out using a reversed-phase C18 column (COSMOSIL 5C18 ARII, 10 mm inner diameter × 250 mm, Nakalai Tesque) with a mobile phase containing methanol/ethanol (95/5). This mobile phase was passed through the column at 4.0 ml/min. Samples with a peak corresponding to authentic MK-4 were collected and evaporated dry, then re-dissolved in the mobile phase. After further purification of the combined samples with the same HPLC system, the sample was pure enough for 1H NMR, D NMR, and LC-MS/MS analyses. The 500-MHz H NMR and D NMR spectra of the putative MK-4 and MK-4-d7 were measured on a Varian VNS-500 (H: 500 MHz, D: 77 MHz). The sample was first dissolved in 40 μl of CDCl3 in a nanoprobe for 1H NMR spectrometry, and then after evaporation with a stream of nitrogen gas, the residue was dissolved in CHCl3 for D NMR spectrometry. The LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out with the same method as described above. Comparison of MK-4-d7 Accumulation in Cerebra of Mice Administered PK-d7 or K3-d8 via Four Routes—At 8 weeks of age, 5 female mice in each group were given orally, intravenously, or enterally, either PK-d7 or K3-d8 as a single dose of 10 μmol/kg body weight or intracerebroventricularly either PK-d7 or K3-d7 as a single dose of 0.1 μmol/kg body weight. To examine whether the conversion of PK-d7 or K3-d8 into MK-4-d7 occurs in a dose-dependent manner, 5 female mice in each group were given orally either PK-d7 or K3-d8 as a single dose of 0.1, 1.0, or 10 μmol/kg body weight. After 24 h, the mice were killed, and cerebra were removed and stored at –80 °C for analysis. The measurements of MK-4-d7 and MK-4 epoxide-d7 in cerebra were carried out with the same LC-APCI-MS/MS method as described above. Comparison of the Conversion of PK-d7 or K3-d8 to MK-4-d7 in Mouse Cerebral Slice Culture and Embryonic Primary Culture—At 8 weeks of age, female mice were sacrificed by aortic exsanguination under light diethyl ether anesthesia. Cerebra were excised and cut into 1-mm-thick slices. Two slices were placed on a stainless steel mesh in a culture dish (60-mm inner diameter) and cultured in 6 ml of medium containing minimum essential medium (MEM): Hepes buffered-saline solution (2:1) with 25% horse serum (Invitrogen) in the presence or absence (vehicle; ethanol) of PK-d7 or K3-d8 (10–5 m) at 37°C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 24 h. The slices were washed with cold Ca,Mg-free phosphate-buffered saline 2 times and homogenized using a Dounce-type homogenizer with 1 ml of MilliQ water. The homogenates (20 μl) were used to determine protein concentrations with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Using other homogenates, the measurements of MK-4-d7 and MK-4 epoxide-d7 were carried out with the same LC-APCI-MS/MS method as described above. Primary cultures of mouse cerebral hemispheres on embryonic day (E) 14 were prepared as described previously with minor modifications (26Fabre M. Langley O.K. Bologa L. Delaunoy J.P. Lowenthal A. FerretSena V. Vincendon G. Sarlieve L.L. Dev. Neurosci. 1985; 7: 323-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fetuses (E14) were removed from pregnant C57BL/6J mice. Embryonic cerebral hemispheres were collected and incubated in the L-15 dissociation medium (Sigma) containing trypsin (0.25 mg/ml) and DNase I (0.1 mg/ml). After treatment, cells were dispersed by repeated trituration and suspended in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (L-DMEM) with 10% FCS. The suspended cells were plated at a density of 8 × 106 cells/well on polyethyleneimine (Sigma)-coated 6-well tissue culture plates. The cells were cultured in L-DMEM with 10% FCS at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 2 days. Then, the cells were incubated with or without PK-d7 or K3-d8 (10–6 m) in the L-DMEM at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 24 h. The amounts of MK-4-d7 and MK-4 epoxide-d7 generated from PK-d7 or K3-d8 by the cells were measured by the LC-APCI-MS/MS method described above. Embryonic cerebral cells were cultured in L-DMEM with 10% FCS for 2 days and thereafter divided into two sub-culture groups, one for neurons and another for astrocytes (27Mains R.E. Patterson P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 329-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 28Mary E. Hatten M.E. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For the neurons, the primary cerebral cells were cultured in L-DMEM containing 10% FCS along with 50 μm 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine for 2 days. For the astrocytes, the primary cells were dissociated by incubation in 0.1% trypsin-EDTA solution and cultured in L-DMEM medium containing 10% FCS for 2 days. The cells were suspended in L-DMEM containing 10% FCS, plated at a density of 107 cells/plate (60 mm), and cultured for 2 days. The cells that reached confluency were dissociated by incubation in 0.1% trypsin-EDTA solution. The cells were suspended in L-DMEM containing 10% FCS and plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 106 cells/well for 2 days to reach confluency. Both cells were treated with the culture medium containing PK-d7 or K3-d (10–6 m) for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were collected and washed with cold Ca,Mg-free phosphate-buffered saline 3 times and then refrigerated at –30 °C. After being warmed to room temperature, cells were lysed in 1 ml of Ca,Mg-free phosphate-buffered saline. With this procedure, 20 μl of cell lysate was analyzed for protein determination. To the cell lysate in a brown screw-capped tube were added PK-18O and MK-4-18O as internal standards. The measurements of MK-4-d7 and MK-4 epoxide-d7 in cerebra were carried out with the same LC-APCI-MS/MS method as described above. Concentrations of PK, MK-4, and Their Epoxides in Plasma and Tissues of Mice—As shown in Table 1, four species of K-vitamins were found in all tissues examined, although their levels varied greatly while only PK and MK-4 were detected, and at low levels, in plasma. Basically, tissue-distribution patterns of K-vitamins did not differ between male and female mice, although the levels of MK-4 and MK-4 epoxide were relatively higher in the females. Concentrations of MK-4 and its epoxide were much higher than those of PK and its epoxide in all tissues examined. Relatively high PK levels were found in thyroid gland, aorta, heart, and adrenal gland, but most other tissues contained <50 pmol/g tissue. In contrast, relatively high MK-4 levels were found in almost all the tissues except for heart, lung, liver, muscle, and bowel content in male mice, and liver and bowel content in female mice, where concentrations were <50 pmol/g tissue. There was no consistent correlation between the tissue levels of PK and MK-4 or PK epoxide and MK-4 epoxide in male or female mice. The laboratory chow given to the mice was assayed for PK and MK-4 by LC-APCI-MS/MS. PK and MK-4 concentrations were 212.2 ± 0.9 and 2.2 ± 0.5 pmol/g diet, respectively. Thus, it is not conceivable that the high concentrations of MK-4 and its epoxide in tissues of mice originated from the intake of laboratory chow.TABLE 1Tissue distribution of vitamin K in mice fed a normal dietPKPK epoxideMK-4MK-4 epoxideMaleFemaleMaleFemaleMaleFemaleMaleFemalepmol/g or mlCerebrum1.4 ± 0.71.1 ± 0.40.1 ± 0.00.1 ± 0.1106.0 ± 8.2252.5 ± 10.313.4 ± 1.028.9 ± 1.7Cerebellum4.8 ± 1.826.2 ± 21.50.1 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.2200.5 ± 17.5487.7 ± 28.236.3 ± 3.081.5 ± 4.1Medulla oblongata7.6 ± 2.822.4 ± 15.50.1 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.1116.2 ± 8.3253.3 ± 5.522.4 ± 1.639.4 ± 1.9Eye10.3 ± 3.815.3 ± 5.20.2 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.558.0 ± 4.4103.3 ± 6.122.0 ± 4.131.7 ± 3.1Thyroid gland134.9 ± 45.5274.8 ± 140.313.9 ± 6.260.8 ± 34.6247.3 ± 30.4370.3 ± 64.0188.2 ± 53.7256.0 ± 26.1Aorta62.2 ± 32.6109.2 ± 45.21.2 ± 0.713.4 ± 10.4124.0 ± 13.7220.0 ± 8.832.5 ± 4.952.3 ± 2.5Heart4.9 ± 2.380.4 ± 76.30.5 ± 0.37.7 ± 4.646.4 ± 4.2107.7 ± 10.05.6 ± 0.811.7 ± 1.9Thymus7.5 ± 1.29.0 ± 3.90.1 ± 0.13.9 ± 3.5131.2 ± 5.5232.5 ± 12.056.2 ± 3.9104.4 ± 11.9Lung2.1 ± 0.45.5 ± 2.90.1 ± 0.00.1 ± 0.038.1 ± 4.267.1 ± 5.413.3 ± 1.934.8 ± 3.4Liver1.2 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.20.1 ± 0.00.1 ± 0.018.2 ± 2.735.0 ± 2.21.8 ± 0.44.4 ± 0.4Pancreas3.0 ± 0.63.2 ± 0.40.1 ± 0.00.2 ± 0.0520.1 ± 47.4829.4 ± 56.7184.5 ± 15.5355.3 ± 35.0Spleen4.6 ± 0.93.9 ± 0.30.1 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.150.9 ± 5.0100.6 ± 9.025.0 ± 3.651.3 ± 4.8Kidney1.1 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.166.1 ± 4.9212.7 ± 20.87.6 ± 1.030.6 ± 3.2Adrenal gland50.7 ± 10.950.7 ± 10.61.2 ± 1.21.0 ± 0.5148.6 ± 14.7417.5 ± 139.615.1 ± 7.277.6 ± 11.1Stomach7.8 ± 1.27.7 ± 1.10.3 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.190.4 ± 6.1171.7 ± 14.426.5 ± 5.470.7 ± 10.6Duodenum13.2 ± 8.85.0 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.90.2 ± 0.182.7 ± 6.0172.8 ± 11.533.6 ± 3.178.1 ± 11.9Small intestine3.1 ± 0.619.7 ± 16.70.3 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.157.8 ± 7.893.6 ± 6.817.1 ± 1.730.4 ± 3.7Large intestine5.5 ± 2.13.1 ± 0.70.1 ± 0.00.1 ± 0.060.1 ± 5.4106.1 ± 13.123.3 ± 4.356.8 ± 4.7Bone3.2 ± 1.42.2 ± 0.50.1 ± 0.00.1 ± 0.069.8 ± 9.2122.7 ± 10.232.7 ± 3.859.9 ± 3.5Skin12.7 ± 6.26.1 ± 1.30.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.150.2 ± 7.5128.2 ± 26.216.1 ± 1.421.3 ± 2.6Muscle2.2 ± 0.81.4 ± 0.2NDaND, not detected.ND19.1 ± 1.556.3 ± 7.54.1 ± 0.612.6 ± 1.2Fat17.4 ± 7.510.3 ± 2.1NDND155.2 ± 37.2423.0 ± 60.13.3 ± 2.022.3 ± 2.9Bowel content24.9 ± 2.927.8 ± 2.12.4 ± 0.24.0 ± 1.113.6 ± 3.724.6 ± 4.70.6 ± 0.30.3 ± 0.1Testis5.5 ± 2.50.1 ± 0.0185.3 ± 3.374.3 ± 4.4Seminal vesicle2.2 ± 0.60.1 ± 0.0184.2 ± 9.1109.5 ± 9.1Ovary16.2 ± 3.40.5 ± 0.2363.4 ± 35.670.5 ± 7.2Uterus4.9 ± 1.20.2 ± 0.1219.6 ± 31.891.5 ± 12.6Plasma0.6 ± 0.00.6 ± 0.0NDND0.7 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1NDNDa ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Isolation and Identification of MK-4-d7 in Cerebra of Mice Orally Given PK-d7—We next examined whether orally given PK-d7 accumulates in cerebra as a converted form of MK-4-d7 in mice. 200 female mice were orally given PK-d7 at a single dose of 10 μmol/kg body weight, and cerebra were collected at 24 h post-administration. We subjected an aliquot of the lipid extract from the cerebra to LC-APCI-MS/MS and confirmed that the peaks correspond to MK-4 epoxide, MK-4, PK epoxide, and PK on the MRM chromatogram (Fig. 1). If PK-d7 was converted into MK-4-d7 in the body, then the MK-4 peak shown in Fig. 1B should include both MK-4 and MK-4-d7, because they gave the same retention time on the MRM chromatogram, and therefore, we decided to isolate and purify the peak. After purification by HPLC as noted under “Experimental Procedures,” we finally obtained the MK-4 fraction containing MK-4 and MK-4-d7 in amounts of 3.8 and 2.0 μg, respectively. Because tissue MK-4 has not yet been identified on the basis of structural assignments in animals and humans, and no information was available about whether the purified MK-4-d7 in the presence of endogenous MK-4 can be identified by D NMR, we first analyzed the MK-4 fraction by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of authentic MK-4 and the MK-4 fraction are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. Consequently, the values of resonance derived from the 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone ring and the geranylgeranyl side chain of the MK-4 fraction entirely coincided with those of authentic MK-4. The D NMR spectra of authentic MK-4-d7 and the"

https://openalex.org/W2143061420,"Motor axons approach muscles that are regionally prespecialized, as acetylcholine receptors are clustered in the central region of muscle before and independently of innervation. This muscle prepattern requires MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is essential for synapse formation. It is not known how muscle prepatterning is established, and whether motor axons recognize this prepattern. Here we show that expression of Musk is prepatterned in muscle and that early Musk expression in developing myotubes is sufficient to establish muscle prepatterning. We further show that ectopic Musk expression promotes ectopic synapse formation, indicating that muscle prepatterning normally has an instructive role in directing where synapses will form. In addition, ectopic Musk expression stimulates synapse formation in the absence of Agrin and rescues the lethality of Agrn mutant mice, demonstrating that the postsynaptic cell, and MuSK in particular, has a potent role in regulating the formation of synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2093643893,"Lateral inhibition is a circuit motif found throughout the nervous system that often generates contrast enhancement and center-surround receptive fields. We investigated the functional properties of the circuits mediating lateral inhibition between olfactory bulb principal neurons (mitral cells) in vitro. We found that the lateral inhibition received by mitral cells is gated by postsynaptic firing, such that a minimum threshold of postsynaptic activity is required before effective lateral inhibition is recruited. This dynamic regulation allows the strength of lateral inhibition to be enhanced between cells with correlated activity. Simulations show that this regulation of lateral inhibition causes decorrelation of mitral cell activity that is evoked by similar stimuli, even when stimuli have no clear spatial structure. These results show that this previously unknown mechanism for specifying lateral inhibitory connections allows functional inhibitory connectivity to be dynamically remapped to relevant populations of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2165767770,"On- and off-center geniculate afferents form two major channels of visual processing that are thought to converge in the primary visual cortex. However, humans with severely reduced on responses can have normal visual acuity when tested in a white background, which indicates that off channels can function relatively independently from on channels under certain conditions. Consistent with this functional independence of channels, we demonstrate here that on- and off-center geniculate afferents segregate in different domains of the cat primary visual cortex and that off responses dominate the cortical representation of the area centralis. On average, 70% of the geniculate afferents converging at the same cortical domain had receptive fields of the same contrast polarity. Moreover, off-center afferents dominated the representation of the area centralis in the cortex, but not in the thalamus, indicating that on- and off-center afferents are balanced in number, but not in the amount of cortical territory that they cover."
https://openalex.org/W2050839067,"Molecules labeled in green and blue play positive and negative roles in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, respectively. Molecules that are labeled in both colors have dual roles.(Top left) Wnt biogenesis. A lipid modification is added to Wnt ligands by Porc in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Wnt ligands are glycosylated in the ER and Golgi and require Wls (also known as Evi) to traffic through the Golgi to the plasma membrane. The retromer complex is also important for Wnt secretion, particularly for long-range signaling. Mature Wnt ligands may interact with lipoprotein particles. Proteoglycans Dally and Kny/Glypican may also facilitate Wnt distribution.(Bottom right) Wnt receptor biogenesis. In cells that respond to Wnt the ER protein MESD is required for folding and trafficking of the Wnt receptor LRP5/6 to the plasma membrane, and the ER protein Shisa prevents folding and trafficking of the Fz protein to the plasma membrane.(Right) Wnt/β-catenin signaling OFF. sFRP and WIF1 directly bind Wnt ligands and prevent Wnts from binding to receptors. SOST/WISE, CTGF/Cyr61 bind to LRP6 (CTGF may also bind to Fz) to prevent the formation of the Wnt-Fz-LRP5/6 receptor complex. DKK binds to and inhibits LRP5/6 in cooperation with the KRM receptor. In the absence of Wnt signaling, the scaffolding protein Axin and tumor suppressor APC form a β-catenin destruction complex that binds cytosolic β-catenin and facilitates sequential phos-phorylation of β-catenin by CK1 (at S45) and GSK3 (at S33/S37/T41). The tumor suppressor WTX may also reside in this complex. Phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by β-Trcp and ubiquitinated for degradation by the proteasome. In the nucleus, TCF assembles a transcriptional repressor complex to silence Wnt target genes via recruiting Gro, CtBP, and HDACs. Residual β-catenin is exported from the nucleus by RanBP3 and APC or bound by CBY or ICAT that prevents β-catenin association with TCF/LEF.(Left) Wnt/β-catenin signaling ON. The Wnt ligand binds to Fz and LRP5/6 receptors to form a Fz-LRP5/6 complex. Dally and Kny can also bind Wnt and enrich Wnt concentration locally or help Wnt gradient distribution. Rspo proteins and Norrin are secreted agonists that bind to LRP5/6 and/or Fz to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Formation of the Fz-LRP6 complex via Dvl promotes LRP6 phosphorylation by GSK3 and CK1γ and other CK1. Fz binds Dvl and phosphorylated LRP6 recruits Axin to the plasma membrane, resulting in inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation/degradation by an as yet unknown mechanism. Fz-LRP6-Dvl aggregation may be involved. LRP6 association with caveolin may promote its endocytosis and signaling. Translocation of Axin is facilitated by MACF1. Trimeric G proteins may act between Fz and Dvl, and β-arrestin may associate with Dvl and Axin. Stabilized β-catenin is translocated to the nucleus where it binds TCF/LEF and recruits coactivators such as the Lgs/Pygo complex, CBP/p300, Brahma, MED12/Mediator, and the PAF1/Hyrax complex to initiate RNA transcription and elongation. TCF/β-catenin controls the expression of many genes that affect cell proliferation (i.e.,"
https://openalex.org/W2083594471,"Common fragile sites (CFSs) are regions of the genome prone to breakage by replication inhibitors (extrinsic replication stress). Recently, we and others observed that oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) induces DNA damage from the earliest stages of cancer. Our aim was to perform a genome-wide analysis in precancerous and cancerous experimental models to examine whether allelic imbalance occurs within CFSs. Subsequently, CFSs sequence characteristics were assessed. We used a growth-factor-induced human skin hyperplasia and a H-ras-induced mouse hyperplastic urothelium as preneoplastic models, along with an inducible U2OS-CDT1Tet-ON cancer cell line model, all bearing established oncogene-induced RS stimuli. Human DNA was analysed with Affymetrix SNP microarrays, while mouse DNA was analysed with Nimblegen array CGH. We studied 56 aphidicolin-type CFSs and 1914 regions of control, nonfragile DNA. Our theoretical in silico analysis spanned 2.16 billion nonoverlapping bases on human chromosomes 1–22. Our results provide direct experimental evidence indicating that genomic alterations were more common within CFSs in epidermal and urothelial preneoplastic lesions as well as in cancer. CFSs were on average less flexible than nonfragile regions, contained more guanine–cytosine (GC) and Alu sequences. Importantly, regions with loss-of-heterozygosity were also less flexible and had a higher Alu percentage."

Mutations affecting the receptor activator of NF-κB signaling axis can result in human skeletal disorders, including those identified in the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of p62 in patients with Paget disease of bone. These observations suggest that the disease may involve a common mechanism related to alterations in the ubiquitin-binding properties of p62. The structural basis for ubiquitin recognition by the UBA domain of p62 has been investigated using NMR and reveals a novel binding mechanism involving a slow exchange structural reorganization of the UBA domain to a “bound” non-canonical UBA conformation that is not significantly populated in the absence of ubiquitin. The repacking of the three-helix bundle generates a binding surface localized around the conserved Xaa-Gly-Phe-Xaa loop that appears to optimize both hydrophobic and electrostatic surface complementarity with ubiquitin. NMR titration analysis shows that the p62-UBA binds to Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin with ∼4-fold lower affinity than to mono-ubiquitin, suggesting preferential binding of the p62-UBA to single ubiquitin units, consistent with the apparent in vivo preference of the p62 protein for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains (which adopt a more open and extended structure).

The p62 protein has a domain structure consistent with its participation in multiple signaling complexes, although p62 also appears to be multifunctional, not least in controlling protein recruitment to endosomes (3Geetha T.

In addition, a ZZ motif is evident, a binding site for the RING finger protein TRAF6, and two PEST sequences that lie adjacent to the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (Fig. 1), a motif that occurs in enzymes of the ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation pathway and in regulatory proteins involved in Ub-dependent proteolysis (12Hofmann K.

All of the PDB mutations identified to date cluster within or close to the UBA domain of the p62 protein, suggesting that the disease may involve a common mechanism related to alterations in the Ub-binding properties of p62 (17Hocking L.J.

To rationalize the structural basis for mUb/polyUb chain recognition by p62, we report NMR structural and binding studies of a recombinant polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal UBA domain of the human protein (Fig. 1). The isolated 50-residue polypeptide sequence forms a compact three-helix bundle with a structure analogous to the UBA domains of hHR23A and the related CUE domain of the yeast Cue2 protein, but with differences in the loop regions connecting the helices (20Ciani B.

We describe NMR complexation studies with the 15N-labeled p62-UBA domain and have mapped the interaction surface of the p62-UBA domain with both mUb and Lys48-linked diUb. The UBA domain in complex with mUb undergoes global chemical shift perturbations on binding, which we show results from the p62-UBA polypeptide undergoing a novel structural reorganization and repacking of the three-helix bundle. The structural rearrangement results in a large activation barrier to complexation that leads to atypical slow exchange kinetics between free and bound forms on the NMR chemical shift time scale, followed by a secondary fast Ub binding step that enables the identification of the binding surface on the rearranged UBA domain. Upon extending our NMR investigations to study the interaction of the UBA domain with Lys48-linked diUb, we find no evidence for linkage-dependent binding specificity, suggesting preferential binding to single Ub units, which may rationalize the apparent in vivo preference of p62 for the more open and extended Lys63-linked polyUb chains (11Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNA encoding the UBA domain of human p62 was amplified from the IMAGE clone 2906264 by PCR and cloned between the BamHI and XhoI sites of plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). All mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) and the constructs verified by sequencing. The GST-UBA fusions were expressed by growing transformed BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells in LB at 30 °C until the absorbance at 550 nm reached 0.7 and then inducing with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 300 μm for 20 h. The pelleted cells were stored at –20 °C until required. The cells from 2 liters of growth were resuspended in 8 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and sonicated (MSE Soniprep 150). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min) before the supernatant was applied to a 1-ml gravity column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was tumbled at 4 °C for 2 h before the supernatant was allowed to flow through. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer and 5 column volumes of cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.4). 5 units of thrombin (Sigma) were added in 1 ml of cleavage buffer, and the column was tumbled at 4 °C overnight. The column was eluted and washed with a further 2 aliquots of 0.5 ml of cleavage buffer. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. The cDNA of yeast Ub was cloned into pKK233-3 between EcoR1 and HindIII sites. mUb was expressed by growing transformed BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells in M9 minimal media at 30 °C, as described above. The cells from 4 liters of growth were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (250 mm acetic acid, 10 mm EDTA, pH 4) and sonicated (MSE Soniprep 150). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min) before the supernatant was diluted 1 in 4 and loaded onto a SP-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm acetic acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 4. A gradient was run to 2 m NaCl with mUb eluting at 40%. The mUb-containing fractions were concentrated by lyophilization. All samples were subject to a final gel filtration step with a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 30 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7. The fractions containing the pure protein of interest, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, were concentrated by lyophilization and buffer exchanged into water using a desalt column (Amersham Biosciences) before lyophilization. Uniformly 15N-labeled UBA and mUb were obtained by growing the bacteria in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter of 15N-labeled ammonium chloride (Isotec) and purified as described above. Doubly 13C/15N-labeled UBA domain was prepared similarly with [13C]glucose as the sole source of carbon in the same minimal medium containing 2 g/liters of [13C]glucose (Isotec). Preparation of Di-ubiquitin, [K48([K48C]-ubiquitinyl), D77]Ubiquitin—Ub mutants [K48C] and [D77] (plasmids kindly provided by the late Prof. Cecile Pickart, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore) were expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli (Novagen) by growing transformed cells at 37 °C until A600 = 0.6, followed by induction with 400 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation for a further 4 h. Proteins were purified from soluble cell lysates by precipitation with 1% (v/v) of 70% perchloric acid, SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), and concentration using centrifugal filtration (Millipore UF-4 devices). Presence of purified Ub mutants was confirmed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and protein concentration was estimated by absorbance at 280 nm. Lys48-linked diUb was synthesized by linking [K48C]Ub and [D77]Ub (1 mm) in the presence of 20 μm Ub-conjugating enzyme E2-25K (UbcH1) and 0.1 μm human Ub-activating enzyme in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 buffer, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.6 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 0.6 units/ml creatine kinase, 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (31Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 4 h, and the diUb was purified by Q-Sepharose (removal of Ub-activating/Ub-conjugating enzymes) and SP-Sepharose (separation of differing length Ub chains) ion exchange chromatography. Presence of purified diUb was confirmed by 10% SDS-PAGE and protein concentration estimated by absorbance at 280 nm. NMR Experiments—The NMR assignment of the unbound UBA domain of p62 was achieved using a 1 mm 13C/15N-labeled protein sample in NMR buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10% D2O, 0.04% sodium azide, pH 7.0) at 298 K and subsequently in the complexed form in the presence of 6 mm Ub. For the free and bound states of the UBA domain 15N-HSQC, 13C-HSQC, HNCO, HN(CO)CA, CBCANH, CBCA-(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, 13C-HSQC-NOESY (mixing time 100 ms), 15N-HSQC-TOCSY, and 15N-HSQC-NOESY (mixing time 150 ms) two- and three-dimensional spectra were collected and the spectra processed using XWINNMR version 2.5 (Bruker) and NMRPipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). The assignment was carried out in CCPNMR using standard methodologies (33Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). Backbone 1DNH residual dipolar couplings were obtained from the difference in 1J scalar couplings measured from 1H-15N IPAP-HSQC spectra (34Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The solutions were soaked into predried 6-mm 5% polyacrylamide gels (35Tycko R. Blanco F.J. Ishii Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9340-9341Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 36Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which were then compressed into a 5-mm NMR tube (Worldwide Glass Resource Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Two-dimensional spectra were collected with 64 scans and a resolution of 2048 by 1024 data points on a 1 mm 15N-UBA sample with or without 6 eq of ubiquitin. The spectra for the free UBA domain gave RDC values in the range –8.3 to 12.2 Hz. Spectra for the complex, collected using the same alignment conditions, showed a narrower range of values (–7.7 to 4.6 Hz), which appears to correlate with small changes in the apparent size or intrinsic flexibility of the UBA domain in the bound state that affects the degree of alignment (37Ishii Y. Markus M.A. Tycko R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with analytical gel filtration results (not shown), which also suggest changes in the average molecular dimensions of the UBA domain between the free and bound conformations. Structure Determination from NMR Restraints—The structure determination was based upon NOE distance restraints and dihedral restraints, the former derived from the 13C-HSQC-NOESY and 15N-HSQC-NOESY spectra. The NOEs were classified based upon their intensity into very strong (1.8–2.5 Å), strong (1.8–2.8 Å), medium (1.8–4 Å), weak (1.8–5 Å), and very weak (1.8–6 Å). In addition, 45 backbone 1DNH RDC parameters from the 47 HSQC cross-peaks in spectra of both the free and bound UBA domain were used as restraints using the ISAC method (38Sass H.J. Musco G. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Grzesiek S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and visualized using MODULE (39Dosset P. Hus J.C. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol.

Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar) dihedral restraints with ±30° limits were also used in the calculations. An initial 100 structures were produced using the standard three-step XPLOR-NIH 2.14 protocol (40Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). In the first stage, high temperature Cartesian dynamics was performed at 1000 K with a time step of 0.005 ps, for 20,000 steps, using the Verlet integrator. During the second cooling phase of the protocol, the temperature was reduced from 1000 to 100 K in steps of 50 K, with a time step of 5 fs, over 40,000 steps during which the relative weighting of nonbonded energy terms was increased from 10% of their default values to their force field default (41Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 42Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brunger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). These initial structures were then refined with another 10,000 cooling steps. The structures were selected based upon NOE violations <0.5 Å and dihedral violations <2°. As a further cross-validation step, we attempted to refine the structure of the bound UBA domain with RDC restraints derived from the free UBA domain. This led to significant distortions in the relative orientations of the helices and structures with much higher energies. All structures were displayed using MOLMOL (43Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). The structural statistics are presented in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab UBA/Ub Binding Studies by NMR—A 1 mm sample of 15N p62-UBA in NMR buffer was titrated in 20 increments with ratios of mUb to UBA in the range 0.1–6.0 and 15N-HSQC spectra collected at each step. A second “reverse” titration was performed by titrating unlabeled p62-UBA into a 1.0 mm 15N-labeled sample of mUb in NMR buffer at the following ratios of UBA to mUb 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 4, 6. All data were collected at 298 K, and changes in chemical shift and cross-peak intensity were monitored by acquisition of 15N-HSQC spectra. The 15N-HSQC spectra were acquired with a resolution of 2048 complex points and 112 t1 increments over a spectral width of 9000 Hz by 2400 Hz in the direct (1H) and indirect dimensions (15N) with 8 scans per t1 increment. The spectra were processed using a sine-squared apodization function shifted by π /2 in both dimensions and zero-filled to 2048 by 1024 real points (F2 by F1). Ub Binding Assays—WT-UBA domain (residues 387–436) and UBA mutants were assayed for Lys48-linked and Lys63-linked polyUb binding as described previously (11Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T.

After washing, bound proteins were detected by Western blotting (anti-Ub). All experiments were repeated on at least three independent occasions and representative examples of blots are presented. Structure of the UBA Domain of p62—The NMR structure of the C-terminal UBA domain of p62 (residues 387–436 in full-length p62) has been determined previously by NMR (20Ciani B. Layfield R. Cavey J.R.

The RDC data led to an improvement in secondary structure definition and a more precise relative alignment of the three helices (44Bax A. Grishaev A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The structure has an overall topology similar to other UBA and CUE domains. The structure is well defined between Pro392 and Ile431 (with an average backbone r.m.s. deviation to the mean structure of 0.75 Å). NMR relaxation measurements (R1, R2, and 1H-15N NOE), and calculated order parameters, suggest that the helical secondary structure forms a compact fold with rapid dynamics confined to the few disordered residues at the N and C termini and in the first loop (48Evans C-L.

The three helical segments are defined by residues Pro392–Met404, Leu413–Lys420 and Ile424–Ile431. The domain is compact with a well defined hydrophobic core composed primarily of the buried side chains of Met401, Leu417, Ala427, and Ile431 (Fig. 1E), which is further consolidated by Leu398, Phe406"
https://openalex.org/W2000504729,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into multiple cell lineages, including osteoblasts and adipocytes. We reported previously that glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-2 (Pparγ2) expression and blocks adipocyte differentiation. Here we show that overexpression of GILZ in mouse MSCs, but not MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, increases alkaline phosphatase activity and enhances mineralized bone nodule formation, whereas knockdown of Gilz reduces MSC osteogenic differentiation capacity. Consistent with these observations, real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that both basal and differentiation-induced transcripts of the lineage commitment gene Runx2/Cbfa1, as well as osteoblast differentiation marker genes including alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, and osteocalcin, were all increased in GILZ-expressing cells. In contrast, the mRNA levels of adipogenic Pparγ2 and C/ebpα were significantly reduced in GILZ-expressing cells under both osteogenic and adipogenic conditions. Together, our results demonstrate that GILZ functions as a modulator of MSCs and that overexpression of GILZ shifts the balance between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs toward the osteogenic pathway. These data suggest that GILZ may have therapeutic value for stem cell-based therapies of metabolic bone diseases, such as fracture repair.

Increasing evidence has shown that adipocytes and osteoblasts are two major pathways and that the relationship between these two is reciprocal, i.e. when the adipogenic pathway is blocked, the MSCs enter the osteogenic pathway, and vice versa (5Ahdjoudj S.

Thus, balanced MSC osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation is critical for the maintenance of healthy bone and lean body composition, and understanding of the mechanisms by which this balance is modulated will have significant medical implications in stem cell-based therapies. We reported previously that a glucocorticoid (GC)-inducible protein, called GC-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) (10D'Adamio F. Zollo O. Moraca R. Ayroldi E. Bruscoli S. Bartoli A. Cannarile L. Migliorati G. Riccardi C.

Shi W. Li Q. Song B. Wan M. Bai S. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Gilz is a new member of the leucine zipper protein family and belongs to the transforming growth factor β-stimulated clone-22 (Tsc-22) family of transcription factors (12Ayroldi E. Zollo O.

Members of this family contain three distinct domains: an N terminus TSC box, a middle leucine zipper domain, and a C terminus proline-rich domain. GILZ has been shown to interact with and inhibit the activities of the key inflammatory signaling mediators NF-κB and AP-1 (14Ayroldi E. Migliorati G. Bruscoli S. Marchetti C. Zollo O. Cannarile L.

GILZ can also interact with the mitogen-activated protein kinase family member, Raf1, resulting in inhibition of Raf-1 phosphorylation and, subsequently, inhibition of MEK/ERK-1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) phosphorylation and AP-1-dependent transcription (12Ayroldi E.

We have reported recently that GILZ can mediate the anti-inflammatory effect of GC and inhibit inflammatory cytokine-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression in mouse MSCs (16Yang, N., Zhang, W., and Shi, X.

Isolation and Characterization of Mouse Bone Marrow MSCs–The bone marrow MSCs used in this study were isolated from 18-month-old male C57BL/6 mice (NIA, National Institutes of Health). All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Committee for Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Medical College of Georgia. In brief, the MSCs were isolated from long bones of 6 mice as a mixture population using a protocol modified from Gimble et al. (17Gimble J.M. Robinson C.E. Wu X. Kelly K.A. Rodriguez B.R.

These MSCs, which are negative for CD-11b, CD-11c, CD45R/B220, PDCA-1, and positive for Sca-1, are capable of undergoing osteogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic differentiation. 4W. Zhang, G. Ou, M.

MC3T3-E1 cells (subclone number 14) (ATCC) were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Production of Recombinant Retrovirus and Infection–The retroviral vectors expressing GILZ or GFP were constructed in a replication defective ΔU3nlsLacZ vector (20Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). In brief, the LacZ sequence in the parental ΔU3nlsLacZ vector was excised by XbaI and BamHI and replaced with the full-length coding region of Gilz or Gfp cDNA. XbaI and BamHI restriction sites were incorporated into the 5′- and 3′-end of the PCR products, respectively, when Gilz and Gfp cDNA were amplified by PCR. The retroviral particles (Ret-GILZ and Ret-GFP) were produced by transfecting ΔU3-GILZ or ΔU3-GFP plasmid DNA into the retroviral packaging cell line 293GPG as described by Ory et al. (20Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). For infection, 2 ml of viruses prepared as described above were added to the cells (seeded in a 60-mm dish the previous day at ∼70% confluence) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. The viruses were then removed and fresh media added to the cells. Production of Lentivirus and Infection–GILZ knockdown constructs expressing small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting endogenous GILZ (shGILZ) were generated in a lentivirus-based shRNA vector pLL3.7. Details of DNA construction, virus production, cell infection, and the knockdown efficiency of dexamethasone-induced endogenous GILZ were shown in our recent publication (16Yang, N., Zhang, W., and Shi, X. M. (2007) J. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Immunofluorescence Labeling and Fluorescence Microscopy–Cells were grown in chamber slides and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (for 100 ml: 10 ml of 10× PBS, 33.4 ml of 11.1% formaldehyde (freshly prepared from its parapolymer), 0.6 ml of 30% Triton X-100, 56 ml of distilled water) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with polyclonal anti-GILZ antibody (11Shi X. Shi W. Li Q. Song B. Wan M. Bai S. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) at 1:200 dilution for at least 1 h at room temperature. After several washes, the slides were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:600 dilution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The slides were washed three times in PBS for 5 min each and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (300 nm) to visualize the nucleus. Finally, the slides were washed, mounted with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories), and analyzed using a Nikon TE2000 fluorescence microscope equipped with COOLSNAP Monochrome Camera. Images were acquired and processed with Metamorph Imaging System. Western Blotting–Whole cell lysates of MSC-GILZ and MSC-GFP or MC3T3-GFP and MC3T3-GILZ cells, as well as parental MSCs treated with dexamethasone (100 nm), were collected, and equal amounts of total protein were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Expression of GILZ was detected using rabbit anti-GILZ antibody as described previously (16Yang, N., Zhang, W., and Shi, X. M. (2007) J. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Osteogenic Differentiation–Cells were plated in 96-well plates in triplicate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 the previous day and then treated with osteogenic supplements (OS) consisting of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μm l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, or cultured in DMEM with 2% FBS, as a control. For alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 0.05% Triton X-100 through three cycles of freezing and thawing. An aliquot of the lysate was incubated with phosphate substrate at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 1 n NaOH, and the absorbance was taken at 405 nm on a multifunctional reader (VICTOR3TM V, PerkinElmer). ALP activity was given in σ units normalized to protein content, where 1 σ unit is equivalent to the enzyme activity required to release 1 mol of p-nitrophenol/h. The protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent. For ALP staining, cells were rinsed three times with calcium and phosphate-free saline solution, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with double-distilled H2O, and stained with One-Step™ NBT/BCIP solution (Pierce) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed again with double-distilled H2O and the plates were scanned using a CanoScan LiDE 80 flat-bed scanner (Canon USA Inc.). Alizarin Red S staining and calcium mineral content quantitation were performed as described by Stanford et al. (21Stanford C.M. Jacobson P.A. Eanes E.D. Lembke L.A. Midura R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9420-9428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were rinsed with calcium and phosphate-free saline solution, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. After a brief wash with water, the cells were stained for 10 min with 40 mm Alizarin Red S solution (pH 4.2) at room temperature. The cells were rinsed five times with water followed by a 15-min wash with PBS (with rotation) to reduce nonspecific Alizarin Red S stain. Stained cultures were scanned followed by a quantitative distaining procedure using 10% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), for 15 min at room temperature, and the Alizarin Red S concentrations were determined by absorbance measurement at 570 nm on Victor3TM V (PerkinElmer) using an Alizarin Red S standard curve in the same solution. The values were normalized to DNA contents. Adipogenic Differentiation–For adipogenic induction, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2. After the cells reach confluence, they were treated with adipogenic induction medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1 μm dexamethasone, 60 μm indomethacin, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) for 3 days and then switched to adipogenic maintenance medium (growth medium plus 10 μg/ml insulin) with media replaced every other day. The formation of adipocytes was monitored by the appearance of lipid droplets under a microscope. RNA Extraction and Real-time RT-PCR–The RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and PCR analysis were performed as described previously (11Shi X. Shi W. Li Q. Song B. Wan M. Bai S. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In brief, total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corp.), 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems), and the mRNA levels of the indicated genes were analyzed in triplicate using SYBR Green master mixture (Applied Biosystems) and a Chromo-4 realtime RT-PCR instrument (MJ Research). The mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin (internal control) and gene expression was presented as -fold changes (ΔΔCt method) (22Tichopad A. Dilger M. Schwarz G. Pfaffl M.W.

One plate was used at each time point using a Cell Growth Determination kit (catalog number CGD-1, Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis–All experiments, except real-time RT-PCR analysis and proliferation assay, which were performed two times, were performed at least three times in triplicate. Unpaired Student's t test (2-tailed) were used to determine the significance (p < 0.05) of the data from all experiments. -Fold differences are indicated and are presented as mean ± S.E. Infection of MSCs and MC3T3-E1 Cells with GFP- and GILZ-expressing Retroviruses–MSCs, which are CD11b– CD11c– CD45R/B220– PDCA-1– Sca-1+, and are capable of undergoing osteogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic differentiation,4 were infected with retroviruses expressing GILZ (Ret-GILZ) or GFP (Ret-GFP), as control. The infection efficiency of cells by GFP-expressing virus was monitored directly by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A, left panel). The infection efficiency of cells by GILZ-expressing virus and the expression of GILZ protein were confirmed by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1A, right panel) and Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates using anti-GILZ polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1B). These infected MSCs express GFP or GILZ protein after extensive passages as monitored by GFP expression and immunofluorescence labeling or Western blot using GILZ antibody. Dynamic changes of endogenous GILZ in response to dexamethasone stimulation (100 nm) in parental MSCs were also examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). These results show that the MSCs can be infected efficiently (>95%) by retroviruses, and these cells express GILZ in response to dexamethasone stimulation. Similarly, the MC3T3-E1 cells were infected and the expression of GFP and GILZ confirmed by GFP expression, immunofluorescence labeling, and Western blotting (Fig. 1, D and E). These cells, referred hereafter as MSC-GFP and MSC-GILZ, or MC3T3-GFP and MC3T3-GILZ, were used in the studies described below. Overexpression of GILZ Enhances Osteogenic Differentiation of MSCs, but Not Committed MC3T3-E1 Cells–Our previous studies showed that overexpression of GILZ inhibits adipocyte differentiation (11Shi X. Shi W. Li Q. Song B. Wan M. Bai S. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the questions we asked in this study were whether and how GILZ enhances osteoblast differentiation. To address these questions, we first examined ALP, an early stage osteoblast differentiation marker. The retrovirally transduced cells, MSC-GFP and MSC-GILZ, were cultured in OS induction media and harvested at the indicated time points for measurement of ALP activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, ALP activity increased in a time-dependent manner in both MSC-GFP and MSC-GILZ cells as the differentiation program proceeded. Interestingly, the MSC-GILZ cells showed a significantly higher ALP activity than MSC-GFP control cells at all time points examined. ALP activity decreased in both MSC-GFP and MSC-GILZ as the cells mature (day 15), which fits the well established pattern of osteoblast differentiation. To confirm this result, we also performed an ALP staining experiment and assessed surface ALP-positive cell populations. Consistent with the activity assays, the ALP staining results also showed a significant increase of ALP-positive MSC-GILZ cells after 5 days of OS treatment (Fig. 2B). To further examine the effect of GILZ on osteoblast maturation, we performed Alizarin Red S staining experiments. MSC-GFP and MSC-GILZ cells were treated for 21 days in osteogenic induction media as for ALP studies and stained with Alizarin Red S solution to visually detect the presence of mineralization. Again, the results showed a significantly higher degree of mineralization in MSC-GILZ cells than in MSC-GFP control cells (Fig. 2C). The cells cultured in regular growth media (DMEM) showed no mineralized nodule formation. A quantitative analysis of Alizarin Red S staining, by extraction of the calcified mineral from the stained monolayer at low pH, is also shown (Fig. 2D). Because the relationship between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs is reciprocal, it is not possible to determine whether the observed increase in osteogenic differentiation by GILZ overexpression was due to the reciprocal effect alone or due to a combination of this and a promotion of osteogenesis. To address this question, we tested the effect of GILZ overexpression on osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells (subclone number 14), a well characterized preosteoblast cell line. The retrovirally transduced MC3T3-GFP and MC3T3-GILZ cells (see Fig. 1, D and E), were subjected to osteogenic differentiation and the effects of GILZ on ALP activity and mineralization were examined by ALP and Alizarin Red S staining experiments. Interestingly, the results show that overexpression of GILZ had no effects on either the mineralization (Fig. 2E) or the ALP activity of MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 2G), indicating that GILZ enhances osteogenic differentiation of MSCs (cells that possess multilineage differentiation capacity), but not MC3T3-E1 cells (committed osteoblasts). A quantitative analysis of results from panel E is shown as a bar graph (Fig. 2F). To further confirm our findings and, in an effort to reveal the relationship between GILZ, glucocorticoids, and osteogenic differentiation, we performed GILZ loss-of-function studies using a lentivirus-mediated shRNA approach. Details of lentivirus production and the efficiencies of infection and knockdown of dexamethasone-induced GILZ expression in MSCs were reported in our recent publication (16Yang, N., Zhang, W., and Shi, X. M. (2007) J. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). In brief, the infection efficiency of MSCs by these lentiviruses reached a level similar to that seen with the retrovirus (Fig. 1A) as assessed by monitoring the number of cells positive for GFP, a cassette contained in the lentiviral vector pLL3.7 and is driven by cytomegalovirus promoter (24Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). The reduction of dexamethasone-induced endogenous GILZ by shGILZ-1, one of the shRNA sequence targeting GILZ, reached 80–85% as assessed by densitometry analysis of band intensity of Western blot results, as well as immunolabeling of infected cells with GILZ antibody and detection with the IgG-Cy3 conjugate. shGILZ-2, another lentivirus that expresses a different shRNA sequence, showed no effect in reduction of dexamethasone-induced GILZ, and a control virus that contained an empty lentiviral vector pLL3.7, were used as controls in the study. These lentivirus-transduced cells were subjected to osteogenic differentiation, and again, the effects of GILZ knockdown on mineralization and ALP activity were determined by Alizarin Red S and ALP staining experiments. Results show that knockdown of GILZ had no effect on mineralization of MSCs (Fig. 3A, second row). We realized that, to emphasize the effect of GILZ in MSC osteogenic differentiation, the dexamethasone was excluded from the induction media in our studies. We thought that the inability of GILZ knockdown to influence MSC osteogenic differentiation observed was due to the low levels of basal GILZ expression in these cells as GILZ is GC-inducible and its expression is barely detectable (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, we added dexamethasone (10 nm) back to the induction media in the initial differentiation stages. Interestingly, when dexamethasone was supplemented in the OS media for the first several days (2–4 days) during differentiation, the ability of mineralization decreased significantly in MSCs infected with shGILZ-1 lentiviruses (Fig. 3A, third row), a shRNA sequence that significantly reduced dexamethasone-induced endogenous GILZ expression (16Yang, N., Zhang, W., and Shi, X. M. (2007) J. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). In contrast, mineralization was observed normal in MSCs infected with lentiviruses expressing shGILZ-2, a shRNA sequence that had no effect on dexamethasone-induced GILZ, or pLL3.7, a control lentivirus that contained an empty viral vector. Knockdown of GILZ in MSCs seems to have no significant effect on ALP activity in the presence or absence of dexamethasone treatment as measured by ALP staining and activity assays (Fig. 3, B and C). Together, these gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that overexpression of GILZ enhances, and knockdown reduces MSC osteogenic differentiation capacity. These results suggest that GILZ could be a key factor linking glucocorticoids and bone marrow stromal cell osteogenic differentiation. Next, we examined the effect of GILZ on the expression of osteoblast lineage-associated genes. Equal amounts of total RNA isolated from MSC-GILZ and MSC-GFP cells cultured for 5 days in osteogenic induction media were reverse transcribed and the mRNA levels of the indicated genes were analyzed using SYBR Green master mixture and the primers listed in Table 1 on a Chromo-4 real-time PCR instrument. Results show that the mRNA levels of the osteogenic commitment gene Runx2/Cbfa1, as well as other differentiation markers, including Alp, type I collagen (Col1a1), and osteocalcin (Ocn), were all increased significantly in MSC-GILZ cells compared with that in MSC-GFP control cells (Fig. 4). These results demonstrated that overexpression of GILZ enhances osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by increasing the expression of the osteogenic associated genes. GILZ Enhances Osteogenesis through Inhibition of Adipogenesis–Because the relationship between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs is reciprocal, and GILZ inhibits adipocyte differentiation (11Shi X.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we then asked whether the observed enhancement of osteoblast differentiation was due to the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. To address this question, we treated MSC-GILZ and MSC-GFP cells with either osteogenic (OS) or adipogenic (MID) induction media and examined the mRNA expression of Pparγ2 and C/ebpα by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Results show that the mRNA levels of Pparγ2 (Fig. 5A) and C/ebpα (Fig. 5B) were inhibited significantly in MSC-GILZ cells, compared with that in MSC-GFP control cells, under both osteogenic and adipogenic induction conditions. Consistent with the mRNA profiles, the MSC-GILZ cells also failed to accumulate intracellular lipid vacuoles, whereas the MSC-GFP cells differentiated normally into adipocytes filled with lipid droplets (Fig. 5C). These results support our hypothesis that the enhancement of MSC osteoblast differentiation by GILZ is achieved through inhibition of PPARγ2 expression. This conclusion is in agreement with and supported by the evidence that PPARγ2 inhibits Runx2/Cbfa1 expression and terminal osteoblast differentiation (9Lecka-Czernik B. Gubrij I. Moerman E.J. Kajkenova O. Lipschitz D.A. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). GILZ Does Not Affect MSC Proliferation–Osteoblast differentiation is a sequential event that initially supports cell proliferation. To determine whether the enhancement of osteogenic differentiation by GILZ overexpression was due to an increase in the rate of cell growth, we performed proliferation assays. MSC-GILZ and MSC-GFP cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/cm2), and cell proliferation was assayed every day for 11 consecutive days using a Cell Growth Determination kit (Sigma). As shown in Fig. 6, both MSC-GILZ and MSC-GFP cells proliferated over time but no significant difference was seen between the two cell lines. This result confirms that the enhancement of osteogenic differentiation by GILZ overexpression was not caused by an increase in cell proliferation. MSCs are pluripotent and can differentiate into multiple cell lineages (3Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18027) Google Scholar). This feature lays the foundation for their use in stem cell therapies. However, the question of how a MSC decides to which pathway it goes is largely unknown. Using GILZ gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we provide evidence in this report that a GC-inducible protein, GILZ, plays an important role modulating the balance of MSC osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation. GCs regulate a spectrum of cell functions, including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (25Reichardt H.M. Tuckermann J.P. Bauer A. Schutz G. Z. Rheumatol. 2000; 59: II/1-II/5Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Barnes P.J. Immunol. Allergy Clin. N. Am. 2005; 25: 451-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GCs are also among the best known anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive agents and are widely used for treating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (27Harris Jr., E.D. Hosp. Pract. (Off.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which GCs transduce their anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive actions are not well understood. Importantly, long term GC treatment causes, among other adverse effects, accelerated bone loss resulting in osteoporosis (29Kirwan J.R. Z.

GC in excess causes bone loss in vivo, possibly by inducing the death of osteoblasts and osteocytes (42Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, GCs stimulate osteogenesis of primary bone marrow stromal cells in vitro (43Beresford J.N. Joyner C.J. Devlin C. Triffitt J.T. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Cheng S.L. Yang J.W. Rifas L. Zhang S.F. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is clinically relevant to understand the role of GILZ in osteogenesis and its relationship with the GCs. Because GILZ is a GC-inducible protein and its basal level is low, it is difficult to determine the role of endogenous GILZ without overexpression. To avoid the complexity of GCs and underscore the role of GILZ in osteogenic differentiation, we excluded dexamethasone from osteogenic induction media (OS), except in knockdown experiments where dexamethasone is necessary for generating endogenous GILZ. We found that the mouse MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts without adding dexamethasone (Fig. 2). However, knockdown of GILZ significantly reduced dexamethasone enhancement of MSC osteogenic differentiation capacity (Fig. 3), suggesting that the reported positive effect of GCs on in vitro marrow stromal cell cultures (43Beresford J.N. Joyner C.J. Devlin C. Triffitt J.T. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Cheng S.L. Yang J.W. Rifas L. Zhang S.F. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) may have a connection with GILZ. Further studies regarding the underlying mechanisms regulating GILZ stability, as well as the effect of knockdown of overexpressed GILZ (e.g. introduction of shGILZ-1 into MSC-GILZ cells) on MSC proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis may shed new light on GC-induced bone loss. PPARγ2 and Runx2/Cbfa1 are two key transcription factors that drive MSCs to undergo adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation, respectively. Because MSC adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation has a reciprocal relationship, and our previous studies have shown that GILZ inhibits Pparγ2 transcription (11Shi X. Shi W. Li Q. Song B. Wan M. Bai S. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we conclude here that the enhancement of MSC osteogenic differentiation by GILZ occurs through the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation. This role of GILZ is similar to what has been shown with TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif), a transcriptional modulator that fine-tunes the balance of MSC osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation (45Hong J.H. Hwang E.S. McManus M.T. Amsterdam A. Tian Y. Kalmukova R. Mueller E. Benjamin T. Spiegelman B.M. Sharp P.A. Hopkins N. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2005; 309: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Any potential GILZ and TAZ interactions remain to be defined. GILZ is a relatively new transcription factor originally identified from dexamethasone-treated thymocytes (10D'Adamio F. Zollo O. Moraca R. Ayroldi E. Bruscoli S. Bartoli A. Cannarile L. Migliorati G. Riccardi C. Immunity. 1997; 7: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). GILZ is also reported to be induced by estrogen (46Tynan S.H. Lundeen S.G. Allan G.F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 91: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is important for bone homeostasis, and by sonic hedgehog (Shh) (47Ingram W.J. Wicking C.A. Grimmond S.M. Forrest A.R. Wainwright B.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8196-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a morphogen that plays a critical role in embryogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that GILZ regulates MSC adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation. It is worth noting that the induction of GILZ in MSCs in response to dexamethasone treatment seems transient (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the lack or low levels of GILZ expression in MSCs could be a key point linking long term GC therapy and GC-induced osteoporosis. We thank Dr. Rhea-Beth Markowitz for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2051833743,"Ewing family tumors (EFT), classically Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, share a common class of tumor-specific fusion genes thought to be key mediators of tumor biology. Here we demonstrate that the most common Ewing's fusion, EWS/FLI1, produces transcriptional upregulation of GLI1 and its direct transcriptional target PATCHED1 in a model transformation system. This deregulation of GLI1 is common to other EWS/ets chimera and depends on the functional transcriptional regulatory domains. Inhibition of GLI1 via RNAi or via overexpression of endogenous inhibitors results in a reduction of EWS/FLI1 transformation activity. Activation of GLI1 appears to occur in a Hedgehog-independent fashion as blockade of Hedgehog signaling has only a modest effect on EFT cells. We present evidence that EWS/FLI1 upregulation of cMYC may play a role in the upregulation of GLI1 in EWS/FLI1-transformed NIH3T3 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that observations made in a model transformation system translate to an Ewing cellular background. EFT cell lines express GLI1 and PATCHED and this expression is EWS/FLI1 dependent. Inhibition of GLI1 expression via RNAi results in reduced anchorage-independent growth in an EFT cell line. GLI1 appears to be a transcriptionally deregulated target of EWS/FLI1 that mediates a portion of its tumorigenic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1996093930,"The LysM domain probably binds peptidoglycans, but how it does so has yet to be described. For this report, we measured the thermal stabilities of recombinant LysM domains derived from Pteris ryukyuensis chitinase-A (PrChi-A) and monitored their binding to N-acetylglucosamine oligomers ((GlcNAc)n) using differential scanning calorimetry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and NMR spectroscopy. We thereby characterized certain of the domains' functional and structural features. We observed that the domains are very resistant to thermal denaturation and that this resistance depends on the presence of disulfide bonds. We also show that the stoichiometry of (GlcNAc)n/LysM domain binding is 1:1. (GlcNAc)5 titration experiments, monitored by NMR spectroscopy, allowed us to identify the domain residues that are critical for (GlcNAc)5 binding. The binding site is a shallow groove formed by the N-terminal part of helix 1, the loop between strand 1 and helix 1, the C-terminal part of helix 2, and the loop between helix 2 and strand 2. Furthermore, mutagenesis experiments reiterate the critical involvement of Tyr72 in (GlcNAc)n/LysM domain binding. Ours is the first report describing the physical structure of a LysM oligosaccharide-binding site based on experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W1984937904,"Death ligands such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and certain forms of CD95L are attractive therapeutic options for metastatic melanoma. Since knowledge about the regulation of death receptor sensitivity in melanoma is sparse, we have analysed these signaling pathways in detail. The loss of CD95 or TRAIL-R1, but not of TRAIL-R2, surface expression correlated with apoptosis sensitivity in a panel of melanoma cell lines. In contrast, the expression of proteins of the apical apoptosis signaling cascade (FADD, initiator caspases-8 and cFLIP) did not predict apoptosis sensitivity. Since both TRAIL-R1 and -R2 transmit apoptotic signals, we asked whether cFLIP, highly expressed in several of the cell lines tested, is sufficient to maintain resistance to TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis. Downregulation of cFLIP in TRAIL-R2-positive, TRAIL-resistant IGR cells dramatically increased TRAIL sensitivity. Conversely ectopic expression of cFLIP in TRAIL-sensitive, TRAIL-R2-expressing RPM-EP melanoma cells inhibited TRAIL- and CD95L-mediated cell death. Thus, modulation of cFLIP is sufficient to sensitize TRAIL-R2-expressing cells for TRAIL. Taken together, albeit expressing all proteins necessary for death receptor-mediated apoptosis, TRAIL-R1 negative melanoma cells cannot undergo TRAIL- or CD95L-induced apoptosis due to expression of cFLIP. Hence, cFLIP represents an attractive therapeutic target for melanoma treatment, especially in combination with TRAIL receptor agonists."

Using a reversible transgenic mouse model of RNA toxicity in DM1, we provide evidence that DM1 is associated with induced NKX2-5 expression. Transgene expression resulted in cardiac conduction defects, increased expression of the cardiac-specific transcription factor NKX2-5 and profound disturbances in connexin 40 and connexin 43. Notably, overexpression of the DMPK 3' UTR mRNA in mouse skeletal muscle also induced transcriptional activation of Nkx2-5 and its targets. In human muscles, these changes were specific to DM1 and were not present in other muscular dystrophies. The effects on NKX2-5 and its downstream targets were reversed by silencing toxic RNA expression. Furthermore, using Nkx2-5+/- mice, we show that NKX2-5 is the first genetic modifier of DM1-associated RNA toxicity in the heart."

Transcripts originating from seven different promoters throughout the gene have been described, whereas, in addition, extensive differential splicing of these transcripts has been acknowledged (details can be found on the Leiden Muscular Dystrophy Web pages). The Dp427m transcript is most prominent in skeletal and cardiac muscle. This transcript gives rise to the production of the 427-kDa muscle isoform of the dystrophin protein (4Hoffman E.P. Brown Jr., R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3588) Google Scholar). In muscle, dystrophin is localized on the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma (5Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Together with the dystroglycan transmembrane protein complex, it forms the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, which links the cytoskeletal actin filaments and the extracellular matrix and is essential for the force transduction in the muscle fiber (6Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The dystrophin protein consists of an N-terminal domain that interacts with actin, a central rod and cysteine-rich domain, and a C-terminal domain that binds to β-dystroglycan. More recently, dystrophin has been implicated in signal transduction, probably via interactions with syntrophin, calmodulin, and nitric-oxide synthase (7Rando T.A. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 1575-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The dystrophin protein is highly conserved in vertebrates. Mouse dystrophin has 91% amino acid identity with its human counterpart. Utrophin is a homologue of dystrophin that is mainly functional at the neuromuscular junction (8Tinsley J.M. Blake D.J.

It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and premature death from cardiac or respiratory failure. Inframe deletions are responsible for the milder Becker muscular dystrophy. The mdx mouse is a genetically homologous mouse model for DMD with a mutation in exon 23 of the Dmd gene. Although genotypically similar, major phenotypic differences exist between the mdx mouse model and human DMD patients. Mdx mice show very effective muscle regeneration, leading to an almost complete recovery from the muscle wasting in early life (12Coulton G.R. Morgan J.E. Partridge T.A. Sloper J.C. Neuropathol.

From the resulting chimeric offspring, mice with highest levels of ES cell contribution were selected and crossed to C57BL/6J females. Germ line transmission of the hDMD allele was determined by DNA genotyping following PCR using human-specific DMD primers. Through further breeding, hemizygous and homozygous transgenic hDMD mice were obtained that were analyzed for proper expression of the human dystrophin gene. The construction of these mice was authorized by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture and described in Project VVA/BD01.284 (E21). Mice—hDMD mice that were back-crossed with C57Bl/6J (Charles River Laboratories (Maastricht, The Netherlands)) for three generations were used for all experiments except for the gene expression profiling, where hDMD mice from earlier crossings with a more heterogeneous C57BL/6 × DBA2 × 129OLA background were used. C57BL/10ScSn-DMDmdx/J mdx mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Utrn-/- and Utrn-/- × mdx mice were described earlier (14Deconinck A.E. Rafael J.A. Skinner J.A. Brown S.C. Potter A.C. Metzinger L. Watt D.J. Dickson J.G. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In gene expression profiling experiments, male mice with a mixed C57BL/10 × DBA2 × 129OLA background, aged 7 weeks, were used as wild-type controls to match the genetic background of the mdx and hDMD mice as closely as possible. Mice were housed under standard conditions and were fed regular chow. Combined Binary Ratio (COBRA) Analysis—COBRA-FISH analysis was performed on metaphase chromosomes of tail skin fibroblasts from hDMDTg/Tg mice. The detailed protocol is described in Ref. 27Szuhai K. Tanke H.J. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 1: 264-275Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar. Briefly, probe sets were prepared by labeling of degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR-amplified individual chromosomes, isolated by flow sorting, with a specific combination of 1-4 fluorescent dyes (diethyl aminomethyl coumarin, Cy3, Cy5, and rhodamine green) (27Szuhai K. Tanke H.J. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 1: 264-275Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The color combinations enable unequivocal identification of the chromosome identity. Probes used for detection of the hDMD gene were derived from cosmids MA2B4 (L. Blonden) and RP5-1174H9 (Sanger) encompassing exons 3-7 and exons 65-72, respectively. MA2B4 was labeled with biotin, which was detected by incubation with streptavidin LaserPro IR 790 (1:200; Molecular Probes, Inc.), followed by biotin-labeled goat anti-streptavidin (1:500; Vector Laboratories), followed by streptavidin LaserPro IR 790 (1:500; Molecular Probes). RP5-1174H9 was labeled with digitonin, which was detected by incubation with mouse anti-digitonin (1:500; Sigma), followed by rabbit anti-mouse (1:100; Sigma) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa430 (1:500; Molecular Probes). Pyrosequencing—DNA was isolated from mouse tail segments by overnight incubation at 55 °C with 245 μl of lysis solution (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.9, including 0.45% IGEPAL and 100 μg of proteinase K). After proteinase K inactivation for 10 min at 95 °C, 1 μl of the solution was used for PCR amplification (32 cycles of 30 s of 94 °C denaturation, 30 s of 54 °C annealing, and 1 min of 72 °C extension) with unmodified exon 75 forward primer (GAATCTGCAAGCAGAATATG) and 5′-biotinylated exon 75 reverse primer (GACTCCAGCTGTTTATTGTG). The biotinylated PCR product (2.5-5 pmol) was incubated with 10 μl of streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (10 mg/ml; Dynal, Oslo, Norway) in BW buffer (5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20) for 15 min at 65 °C. The immobilized PCR product was further processed with the SNP reagent kit (Pyrosequencing, Uppsala, Sweden). In brief, the beads were transferred to a Luc96 plate containing 50 μl of 0.5 m NaOH per well and agitated for 1 min to allow for strand separation. Then the beads were transferred to a plate containing 100 μl of annealing buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, 5 mm magnesium acetate) per well and washed for 1 min by releasing and capturing the beads. Subsequently, the beads were transferred to a plate containing 40 μl of annealing buffer and 20 pmol of sequencing primer (TGCTGAGCTCATTGCTG) per well. Samples were denatured for 1 min at 95 °C, cooled to room temperature, and put into the holder of the apparatus. The reagent cassette was filled, and the sequencing reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—RNA isolations and RT-PCRs were performed as described earlier (24Bremmer-Bout M. Aartsma-Rus A. de Meijer E.J. Kaman W.E. Janson A.A.

Quantitative PCR assays were run on the Lightcycler480 using SYBR-green as the detection method. To determine PCR efficiencies, a calibration curve was constructed by serial dilution of a cDNA pool from all of the samples. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin were used as housekeeping genes. For quantification of the different dystrophin transcripts, human- and mouse-specific primers were designed in homologous regions, where the forward primer was chosen in the promoter specific for the studied transcript and the reverse primer in a downstream exon. Primer sequences are given in the supplemental materials. To correct for differences in input between hDMD and wild-type samples, Ct values were corrected per tissue for the differences in housekeeping gene expression. Then the abundance was calculated relative to the expression of the murine transcript in a reference tissue (see the legend to Fig. 4) in the wild-type mice, using the formula, E = (1 + efficiency)Ct - Ct,ref. Western Blotting—Western blotting on muscular protein extracts was done as described previously (17Aartsma-Rus A. Janson A.A. Kaman W.E. Bremmer-Bout M. den Dunnen J.T. Baas F. van Ommen G.J. van Deutekom J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The MANDYS106 and NCL-DYS2 antibodies were obtained from Dr. G. Morris (North East Wales Institute) and Novacastra Laboratories (Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom), respectively. Hematoxilin-eosin Staining and Immunohistochemistry—Serial transverse sections (10 μm) from frozen gastrocnemius muscle were made with a cryotome (Thermo Shandon). Hematoxilin-eosin and antibody stainings of these sections were performed as described earlier (24Bremmer-Bout M. Aartsma-Rus A. de Meijer E.J. Kaman W.E. Janson A.A.

To demonstrate restoration of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, we incubated with mouse anti-α-sarcoglycan and anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies (both from Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom). For detection, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and the 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Amresco, Solon, OH) chromogenic substrate were used. To monitor fibrosis, the sections were sequentially stained with the LF67 anti-collagen type I (Col1A1) primary antibody (diluted 1:500) (29Fisher L.W. Stubbs J.T. II I Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), detected with an Alexa594 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Fiber Typing—Fiber typing was done by actomyosin ATPase staining of 10-μm transverse cryosections of the complete lower hind limb, with acid preincubation, according to previously published protocols (30Guth L. Samaha F.J. Exp. Neurol. 1969; 25: 138-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this staining, type I fibers stain dark, whereas type II fibers remain light. Analysis of Creatine Kinase (CK) Levels—Blood, drawn from the tail vein from 21-day-old mice, was collected in Mini Collect tubes coated with lithium heparin (Greiner Bio-One). Plasma was isolated by spinning for 4 min at full speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge. CK activity was measured by application of 30 μl of plasma on a Reflotron® CK strip and detection in the Reflotron® instrument (Roche Applied Science). Gene Expression Profiling—For expression profiling, 15-20 μg of total RNA (integrity checked with the Agilent Lab-on-a-Chip total RNA nanobiosizing assay) was used to generate a biotinylated cRNA target. 15 μg of cRNA was hybridized on Affymetrix U74v2 gene chips, as described previously (28Boer J.M. de Meijer E.J. Mank E.M. van Ommen G.B. den Dunnen J.T. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2002; 12: S118-S124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Resulting CEL files were loaded into Rosetta Resolver version 4.0 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, WA) and processed with the standard error model for Affymetrix U74 chips. An error-weighted one-way analysis of variance (cut-off, p < 1 × 10-4) was used to find differentially expressed genes between male dystrophic (mdx and Utrn-/- × mdx) and nondystrophic mice (wild type, hDMD, hDMD × mdx, hDMD × Utrn-/- × mdx). Similarity searches in gene expression patterns were facilitated by the Trend match tool. Pearson correlation was used as a similarity measure. Microarray data were submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI) and have accession number GSE6790. In this paper, only samples GSM156809-GSM156816 were used in the analysis. Genetic Engineering of Transgenic hDMD Mice—After spheroplast fusion of yeast cells carrying a YAC of 2.7 Mb that contains the full-length 2.3-Mb human dystrophin gene (25den Dunnen J.T. Grootscholten P.M. Dauwerse J.G. Walker A.P. Monaco A.P. Butler R. Anand R. Coffey A.J. Bentley D.R. Steensma H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 19-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with murine ES cells and confirmation of stable single copy integration, the ES cells were injected into blastocysts. These were subsequently implanted in pseudopregnant females. From the resulting chimeric offspring, mice with the highest levels of ES cell contribution were selected, tested for germ line transmission, and back-crossed with C57BL/6J mice to obtain hemi- and homozygous hDMDTg/0 and hDMDTg/Tg mice. Assessment of Chromosomal Integration Site and Copy Number—COBRA-FISH analysis on metaphase chromosomes from cultured skin fibroblasts with two different cosmid probes encompassing exons 3-7 and 65-72 of the hDMD gene demonstrated single copy integration of the hDMD gene into mouse chromosome 5 (Fig. 1). Due to the presence of the highly homologous murine DMD gene, genotyping of the hDMD mice was complicated. A quantitative pyrosequencing-based methodology was developed to discriminate between hDMD0/0, hDMDTg/0, and hDMDTg/Tg mice. In this assay, the signal is derived from the degree of extension of a sequence primer, adding one nucleotide at a time. A CC/CT dinucleotide variation between the mouse and human isoform in a conserved region in exon 75 of the dystrophin gene results in incorporation of two C nucleotides in case of a human allele and one C and one T in case of a mouse allele (Fig. 2a). The mice can then be genotyped based on the C/T ratios (Fig. 2b). The observed C/T ratios were always slightly higher than expected (Fig. 2c). This is probably attributable to the higher incorporation efficiency of cytosine over thymidine nucleotides. However, the difference between the observed and expected C/T ratios was highly consistent, as demonstrated by low S.D. values and female hDMDTg/Tg (expected ratio 6:2) and male hDMDTg/0 mice (expected ratio 3:1) having nearly identical C/T ratios. The quantitative pyrosequencing assay produced more robust results than a concurrently developed species-specific quantitative PCR assay (data not shown). Phenotyping and Evaluation of Full-length mRNA and Protein Expression—Transgenic hDMD mice are born at the expected Mendelian frequencies. They have no obvious functional deficits and have a normal fertility and life span. RT-PCR analysis with human-specific primers, chosen in various regions of the mRNA, ranging from the 5′ to the 3′ part, revealed the expression of full-length human dystrophin mRNA in the muscle of hDMD mice. An example of such an RT-PCR assay, demonstrating the simultaneous presence of human and mouse dystrophin mRNAs, is given in Fig. 3a. Analysis of protein extracts and sections from the muscle of hDMD mice by Western blotting and staining with the human-specific MANDYS106 antibody demonstrated the presence of a full-length 427-kDa human dystrophin protein at the sarcolemma (Fig. 3, b and c). The added levels of human and mouse dystrophin protein (assessed by staining with the cross-reactive Dys2 antibody) (Fig. 3b) were similar to the levels of the murine protein in wild-type mice. We investigated whether the tissue-specific expression patterns of other transcripts originating from the DMD gene were maintained in mice. Results of the quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the murine and human Dp427p, Dp427c, Dp427m, Dp260, and Dp71 transcripts in the different tissues of hDMD and wild-type mice are displayed in Fig. 4. Our sets of PCR primers appeared to be entirely species-specific. All hDMD gene-derived transcripts were expressed in the same tissues as their endogenous counterparts, the Dp427-Purkinje and Dp260 isoforms being most prominent in the eye, the Dp427-cortical in the brain, and the Dp427-muscle in the muscle and heart. By designing primers in homologous regions and carefully controlling PCR efficiencies, we made a quantitative comparison of the expression of the human and mouse transcripts in hDMDTg/Tg and wild-type mice. Although qualitatively similar, we observed considerable quantitative differences in expression. In hDMDTg/Tg mice, we observed 2-fold higher expression of the human Dp427p and Dp427m transcripts, but lower expression of the human Dp427c and Dp260 transcripts (2- and 4-fold, respectively), when compared with their murine counterparts (Figs. 4 and 5). In general, the expression level of the endogenous mouse transcript is lower in the hDMDTg/Tg than in the wild-type mice (Fig. 4), indicative of a negative feedback of the human protein on the transcription of the murine gene. Restoration of Dystrophic Phenotype by hDMD Expression—To demonstrate the functionality of the hDMD transgene, we crossed the hDMD mice with dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. hDMDTg/0 × mdx mice do not show any signs of muscular dystrophy or ongoing regenerative processes (Fig. 6). Together with the dystrophin protein, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was restored at the sarcolemmal membrane, as shown by staining for α-sarcoglycan and β-dystroglycan (Supplemental Fig. 2). In contrast, 8-week-old mdx mice display high numbers of centrally nucleated fibers in hematoxilin-eosin-stained sections and substantial fibrosis, as monitored by immunohistochemical staining with an antibody against collagen type I (29Fisher L.W. Stubbs J.T. II I Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). We have not observed significant differences in fiber type composition between rescued and wild-type mice. Representative stainings are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. In both strains, the gastrocnemius muscle contained nearly 100% type II fast fibers. The soleus muscle of wild-type mice consisted of 23 ± 17% (n = 4 mice) type I slow fibers, whereas 37 ± 15% type I fibers were found in the soleus muscle of hDMDTg/0 × mdx mice (n = 6; difference not significant with a p value of 0.4). The CK levels, which are elevated in dystrophic mice due to loss of sarcolemmal integrity, were normal in hDMDTg/0 × mdx mice (239 ± 129 units/liter). The combined observations indicate that a single copy of the hDMD gene completely rescues the mdx phenotype. A more dramatic rescue is seen in utrophin/dystrophin double mutant (Utrn-/- × mdx) mice, which are extremely weak and die between 8 and 20 weeks after birth. In contrast, the incidence of premature death observed in the hDMDTg/0 × Utrn-/- × mdx mice was not different from that in wild-type mice, and the oldest rescued mouse in our data base lived without health problems up to the age of 16 months, after which it was euthanized. The mice have normal muscle strength and do not shows signs of scoliosis. Furthermore, histological examination of muscles of these mice does not show any signs of muscular dystrophy (Fig. 6). Centrally nucleated fibers were absent, fiber size was normal, and fibrosis was not apparent. In addition, CK levels were completely normalized in the rescued animals; in the Utrn-/- × mdx mice, CK levels amounted to 2,705 ± 635 units/liter, whereas levels in hDMDTg/0 × Utrn-/- × mdx and hDMDTg/Tg × Utrn-/- × mdx were 142 ± 66 and 198 ± 130 units/liter, respectively. To assess if expression the hDMD transgene could not only reverse the apparent structural characteristics of dystrophic muscles but also restore wild-type gene expression patterns in dystrophic animals, we performed quantita"

PLD isozymes are significantly co-overexpressed with cancer marker genes in colorectal carcinoma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment, as a mitogenic signal in colon cancer cells, selectively increases PLD1 expression in transcription and post-transcription. Moreover, experiments using intraperitoneal injection of PMA into mice showed selective PLD1 induction in the intestine and lung tissues, which suggests its physiological relevance in vivo. Therefore, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the effects of PMA on the promoter activity of PLD genes. Protein kinase C inhibitors, but not a protein kinase A inhibitor, were found to suppress the up-regulation of PLD1 but not PLD2. Dominant-negative mutants of Ras, Raf, and MEK suppressed the induction and activity of PLD1. Moreover, depletion of the supposedly involved proteins reduced the endogenous PLD1 protein level. An important role for NFκB as a downstream target of ERK in PMA-induced PLD1 induction was also demonstrated using the inhibitor, small interfering RNA, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and site-specific mutagenesis. Furthermore, inhibitors of these signaling proteins and depletion of PLD1 suppressed PMA-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion and PLD1 induction. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that induction of PLD1 through a protein kinase C/Ras/ERK/NFκB-dependent pathway is involved in the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in colorectal cancer cells.

Dysregulation of proliferation and apoptosis frequently occurs in the development of various human cancers. The unraveling of growth-regulatory pathways and the process of tumorigenesis has revealed new diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Phospholipase D (PLD) has emerged as a critical regulator of cell proliferation and survival (2Foster D.A. Xu L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 789-800PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormalities in PLD expression and activity have been observed in many human cancers (2Foster D.A. Xu L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 789-800PubMed Google Scholar). PLD hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine, the predominant membrane phospholipid, and produces phosphatidic acid and free choline. Two mammalian isozymes of phosphatidylcholine-specific PLD (PLD1 and PLD2) have been identified and are differentially regulated. PLD1 is activated by protein kinase C (PKC) and small G proteins of the Rho and ADP-ribosylation factor families, whereas PLD2 is not directly activated by these regulators (3Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We have reported that overexpression of the PLD isozymes causes anchorage-independent growth and neoplastic transformation of mouse fibroblasts (4Min D.S. Kwon T.K. Park W.S. Chang J.S. Park S.K.

PLD1 has been reported as a critical downstream mediator of H-Ras-induced transformation (5Buchanan F.G. McReynold M. Couvillon A. Kam Y. Holla V.R. DuBois R.N. Exton J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar) and can lead to the deregulated activation of PLD and important downstream signaling pathways, including Raf/MEK/ERK (7Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H.

Moreover, PLD has been shown to be involved in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (9Chen Y. Zheng Y. Foster D.A.

Despite gathering evidence regarding the regulation of PLD activity in cell function, little is known about the functional role and regulatory mechanisms of PLD expression. Phorbol esters, such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), can substitute for diacylglycerol (DAG; the endogenous PKC activator) and function as tumor promoters. Phorbol esters have been reported to modulate diverse cellular responses, such as gene transcription, mitogenesis, and differentiation, tumor promotion, and apoptosis, through the PKC signaling pathway (11Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannum Y.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Meng X.W. Heldebrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PMA protects cells from stimuli-induced apoptosis through a mechanism that is dependent on the activation of PKC (13Herrant M. Luciano F. Loubat A. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4957-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways involved in PMA-induced PLD expression have not been defined. HCT116 human colon cancer cells contain the most common K-ras mutation type found in colorectal cancers, the glycine to aspartate mutation at codon 12 (14Moerkerk P. Arends J.W. Van-Driel M. De-Bruine A. De-Goeij A. Ten-Kate J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3376-3378PubMed Google Scholar). Because many growth factors utilize Ras-dependent signaling pathways, this cell line serves as a model system for studying alterations in gene expression that occur during the progression of CRC. Secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from cancer cells is an important stage of metastatic spread. MMPs hydrolyze components of the extracellular matrix and allow the invasion of cancer cells from their primary site to the circulation and secondary sites (15Liotta L.A. Tryggvason K. Garbisa S.

HCT116, DLD1, SNU-C5, and MCF7 were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum with penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). LS174T, RKO, CaCO2, and SK-BR3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Animals and Treatments–ICR female mice (6 weeks of age, weighing ∼18–21 g) were obtained from Oriental Laboratories (Seoul, Republic of Korea). During this study, the mice received standard rodent chow and acidified tap water ad libitum. After acclimatization for 1 week, female mice were injected intraperitoneally with PMA three times at doses of 0.015 or 0.15 mg/kg over the course of 1 week (n = 5 samples). Controls received an equal volume of corn oil in the same manner. Preparation of Human CRCs Samples and Immunohistochemistry–Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples were obtained from surgical resections of 122 colorectal cancers. The tumor stage was classified according to Dukes' criteria (21Astler V.B. Coller F.A. Ann. Surg. 1954; 139: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). There were 12, 47, 55, and eight cases with stage A, B, C, and D, respectively. Two pathologists screened histological sections and selected areas of the representative tumor cells. Three tissue cores (0.6 mm in diameter) were taken from each tumor sample and placed in a new recipient paraffin block using a commercially available microarray instrument (Beecher Instruments, Micro-Array Technologies, Silver Spring, MD) according to established methods (22Kononen J. Bubendorf L. Kallioniemi A. Barlund M. Schraml P. Leighton S. Torhorst J. Mihatsch M.J. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (3558) Google Scholar). One cylinder of normal colonic mucosa adjacent to each tumor was also transferred to the recipient block. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed as described previously (23Park W.S. Oh R.R. Park J.Y. Lee J.H. Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee H.K. Kim Y.S. Kim S.Y. Lee S.H. Yoo N.J. Lee J.Y. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 691-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Promoter Regions of Human PLD1 and PLD2–Approximately 1.9- and 2.6-kb genomic DNA fragments covering the 5′ upstream regulatory sequences of human PLD1 or PLD2, respectively, were amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned into a pGL4.14b luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) and were then used for promoter analysis. For further detail, seesupplemental data. Transient Transfection, Luciferase Assays–Cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and grown to 50–60% confluence. Transfection and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (12Meng X.W. Heldebrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)–Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Sigma). First strand cDNA was synthesized using 5 μg of total RNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The reaction was incubated at 80 °C for 5 min and 42 °C for 90 min, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. The synthesized cDNA was amplified using PLD1, PLD2, and GAPDH primers with an Eppendorf thermocycler (Eppendorf Scientific, Westbury, NY). PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. For PCR conditions and primer sequences, seesupplemental data. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting–The cells or tissues were analyzed by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation as described previously (24Ahn B.H. Kim S.Y. Kim E.H. Choi K.S. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.H. Chang J.S. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Min D.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3103-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ECL was used to detect the signal. The following antibodies were used: anti-β-tubulin (Sigma); anti-NFκB (p65) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-PKCα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling Inc., Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-PLD antibody that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2 was generated as described previously (4Min D.S. Kwon T.K. Park W.S. Chang J.S. Park S.K. Ahn B.H. Ryoo Z.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee Y.S. Rhie D.J. Yoon S.H. Hahn S.J. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay–ChIP experiments were essentially performed as described previously (25Caretti G. Salsi V. Vecchi V. Imbriano C. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30435-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. For further details, seesupplemental data. PLD Activity Assay–PLD activity was assessed by measuring the formation of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol, the product of PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation, in the presence of 1-butanol as described previously (24Ahn B.H. Kim S.Y. Kim E.H. Choi K.S. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.H. Chang J.S. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Min D.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3103-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Zymography–HCT116 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/ml and were washed and refreshed with serumfree Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. The conditioned media of the cells were determined by 0.1% casein zymography. Zones of caseinolytic activity were detected as clear bands against a blue background. Measurement of Cell Viability and Apoptosis–For the cell viability assay, a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed. Absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer at 540 nm, and viability was expressed relative to the control. Cell apoptosis was measured using an Annexin V binding assay (Molecular Probes), which was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Annexin V-positive cells were quantitated. More than 200 cells were counted for each variable per experiment using fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200M, Zwiss, Germany). Statistics–The results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the number of determinations indicated. Statistical significance of differences was determined by analysis of variance. The correlation between PLD expression and various clinicopathologic parameters and Ki-67, β-catenin, and phospho-Akt expression were assessed using the χ2 and Bartholomew tests. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. PLD Isozymes Are Significantly Co-overexpressed with Cancer Marker Genes in Human Colorectal Cancer–The expression and activity of PLD isozymes have been reported to be highly up-regulated in many cancer tissues (2Foster D.A. Xu L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 789-800PubMed Google Scholar), but the number of cases in each study was small. Thus, using a tissue microarray containing 122 CRCs obtained from surgery, we attempted to investigate the expression of PLD isozymes and their association with clinicopathological parameters involving tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and other cancer marker genes, which are important factors in prognosis. The expression level of PLD isozymes was assessed by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1A, using the antibody to PLD that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2, PLD expression was detected as faint or negative in normal colonic mucosa. Occasional weak staining of PLD was observed in inflammatory cells in lamina propria. No immunoreactivity was observed in connective tissues; thus, these tissues served as internal negative controls. Immunopositivity for PLD protein was clearly marked in colorectal tumor cells (Fig. 1B). The tumors were interpreted as negative when immunostaining was weak, as in the corresponding normal colonic mucosa, or when immunopositive cells represented <5% of the cancer cells. Table 1 summarizes the relationship between clinicopathological features and PLD expression in colorectal carcinoma. Overexpression of PLD isozymes was detected in 74 (60.1%) of 122 colorectal cancers (Table 1). However, no significant association was found between the PLD expression level and tumor stage or lymph node metastasis (Table 1). Additionally, to determine the proliferative capacity in CRCs with overexpression of PLD, we also examined the correlation between the expression of PLD and the expression of Ki-67, β-catenin, or p-AKT in cancer samples. We compared the expression pattern of the proteins in tumor cells and corresponding normal cells and interpreted results as being positive or showing overexpression when immunostaining was stronger than that of corresponding normal cells. In immunohistochemical analyses, corresponding normal colonic mucosa showed negative or weak staining for β-catenin, Ki-67, and p-Akt (Fig. 1, C, E, and G). PLD isozymes were significantly co-overexpressed with early stage cancer marker genes, such as Ki-67, β-catenin, or p-Akt in colorectal carcinoma (Fig. 1, B, D, F, and H, and Table 1). These findings suggest that PLD plays an important role in the progression of early stages of development of colon carcinogenesis.TABLE 1Relationship of PLD expression detected by immunohistochemistry and clinicpathological parameter in colorectal carcimoma The correlation between PLD overexpression and clinicopathologic parameters involving tumor stage and lymph node metastasis was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray containing 122 human colorectal carcinomas. In addition, the correlation between PLD expression and the expression of Ki-67, β-catenin, or p-AKT in these cancer samples was also analyzed for examination of proliferative capacity in CRCs with overexpression of PLD. A positive or negative sign means strong immunostained tissues and faint or negative immunostained tissues, respectively.

Treatment with PMA markedly increased PLD1 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In contrast, PLD2 isozyme was not significantly affected by PMA. In addition, the induction of PLD1 mRNA levels by PMA resulted in the corresponding induction of PLD1 protein (Fig. 2B). Moreover, DAG increased the expression of PLD1 protein, but not PLD2, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). To assess the physiological relevance in vivo, we examined the PLD expression after intraperitoneal injection of PMA into five different mice. Strikingly, PMA treatment significantly induced the expression of PLD1 in the intestine and lung tissues, compared with vehicle (Fig. 2D). However, PLD2 expression in these tissues was not detected by anti-PLD antibody, which recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PMA, which is known to activate PKC and then PLD, selectively up-regulates the expression of PLD1 in HCT116 cells as well as mice. Cloning of the Promoter Region of Human PLD1 and PLD2 Genes–To determine how PMA is able to regulate PLD gene expression and what its transcriptional mechanism might be, we have cloned the promoter regions of human PLD1 (pGL4-PLD1; 1.9 kb) transcribed from exon 2 among two alternate transcripts of PLD1 to be transcribed at two different transcription sites (exons 1 and 2) and human PLD2 (pGL4-PLD2; 2.6 kb) transcribed from exon 1, on the basis of human genome data from the NCBI data base. supplemental Fig. S1 shows the schematic diagrams of genomic DNA structure and the promoter regions of the human PLD1 and PLD2 genes. PMA Increases the Transcriptional Activity of PLD1 Promoter–To investigate whether PMA increases the transcriptional activities of PLD genes, HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with PLD-luc and treated with PMA. PMA increased the promoter activity of PLD1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner but did not increase the promoter activity of PLD2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The PLD2 promoter showed higher basal activity compared with that of PLD1. These results demonstrate that PMA selectively up-regulates the transcriptional activity of PLD1 but not that of PLD2. PMA-stimulated PLD1 Induction Is Mediated via the PKC Pathway–Therefore, to examine the signaling pathways leading to PMA-mediated PLD1 induction, HCT116 cells were pretreated with various PKC inhibitors (GF109203x, Go6976, Ro-31-8220, Rottlerin) and PI3K inhibitor (LY294001) or a protein kinase A inhibitor (H89) prior to the addition of PMA. As shown in Fig. 4A, PMA-induced PLD1 mRNA expression was blocked by all of the PKC inhibitors, inhibitors of PI3K, and Src tyrosine kinase but not by a protein kinase A inhibitor. Furthermore, the effects of these inhibitors on mRNA expression of PLD1 were correlated with the results obtained from the PLD1 promoter assay, which suggests that the effects are mediated through an increase in transcription (Fig. 4A). To further confirm this observation, the cells were transfected with various constructs with PLD1-luc. Wild-type PKC-α, -βII, -δ, or -ζ stimulated PLD1 promoter activity, but its dominant negative mutants suppressed both basal and PMA-stimulated promoter activities (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, dominant negative PI3K (p85) and Src, but not protein kinase A, inhibited PMA-stimulated PLD1 promoter activity (Fig. 4C). However, dominant active PI3K (p110) and Src enhanced its activity. Taken together, these results, which utilized complementary approaches, demonstrate a contributory role for these PKCs, PI3K, or Src in PMA-mediated PLD1 induction. PMA-induced PLD1 Expression Occurs in Other Human Cancer Cell Lines–To examine whether PMA-induced expression of PLD1 is specific to the HCT116 cells or also occurs in other human cancer cells, the colon cancer cells (HCT116, CaCo2, LS174T, RKO, DLD1, and SNU-C5) and breast cancer cells (SK-BR3, MCF7) were treated with PMA, and PLD1 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). The induction of PLD1 mRNA and protein was observed in the HCT116, CaCo2, SNU-C5, SK-BR3, and MCF7 cancer cells and was blocked by Ro31–8220. In contrast, PMA-induced PLD1 expression was not detected in LS174T, RKO, and DLD1 cells. Using antibody to pan-phospho-PKC, we found that the cells that were responsive to PMA (except for MCF7 cells) showed relatively low basal PKC activation compared with that of the cells that were unresponsive to PMA (Fig. 5B). For DLD1 cells, the PKC inhibitor did not greatly affect PLD1 expression. Although responsiveness to PMA may be partly related to the extent of basal PKC activation in different cancer cells, it is possible that these cell-specific differences in PMA-induced PLD1 expression might be related to differences in the genetic profiles of these tumors. Ras/Raf/ERK Pathways Are Required for the Induction of PLD1 by PMA–We next investigated whether Ras, a downstream target of PKC (26Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), is also involved in the signaling cascade. As shown in Fig. 6A, expression of Ras-N17 (inactive mutant) significantly suppressed both basal and PMA-stimulated PLD1 promoter activity. Conversely, expression with Ras-V12 (active mutant) significantly stimulated its promoter activity. Ras activates multiple parallel pathways that involve Raf, MEK, and ERK kinases (26Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Like Ras, Raf enhanced PLD1 promoter activity in a similar pattern (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that Ras and Raf are involved in PMA-induced PLD1 up-regulation. Moreover, we investigated the role of MEK/ERK, acting downstream of Ras, in the regulation of PLD1 expression. Pretreatment with MEK inhibitors (PD98059, U0126) and overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of MEK2, but not p38 inhibitor (SB203580), significantly blocked PMA-mediated PLD1 expression, as measured by RT-PCR and a promoter assay (Fig. 6B). The JNK inhibitor had no effect on the induction of PLD1 (data not shown). PKC βII-stimulated PLD1 induction was suppressed by the expression of dominant negative mutants of Ras, Raf, MEK2, and ERK2 (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, we examined the relationship between enhanced PLD1 expression and PLD activity. As shown in Fig. 6D, transfection of PKC-βII, Ras-V12, catalytically active Raf, and MEK, but not its dominant negative mutant, enhanced PLD activity, which suggests that PKC and these proteins are responsible for an increase in PLD activity in the colon cancer cells. In addition, PMA increased the phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, and Src kinase in a time-dependent manner (data not shown). Moreover, we investigated whether depletion of the supposedly involved protein affects PLD1 expression. Using siRNA, the depletion of PKCα, Ras, and ERK2 reduced the endogenous PLD1 protein level (Fig. 6E). Taken together, these results suggest that PMA stimulated the induction of PLD1, and thus, the activity might be mediated via PKC/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways in HCT116 colon cancer cells. NFκB Induces PMA-mediated PLD1 Expression, but Not PLD2 Expression, and Increases PLD Activity–PMA is known to activate NFκB, which has been shown to be a downstream target gene of MEK/ERK (27Kurland J.F. Voehringer D.W. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32465-32470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether NFκB plays a role in PMA-stimulated PLD1 induction. As shown in Fig. 7A, pretreatment with PDTC, an NFκB inhibitor, and overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of IκBα (S32A/S36A) significantly blocked PMA-mediated PLD1 transcriptional expression. However, ectopic expression of NFκB (p65) enhanced the promoter activity, protein expression, and enzymatic activity of PLD1 in a dose-dependent manner but did not significantly affect those of PLD2 (Fig. 7, B–D). Furthermore, transfection of siRNA for NFκB (p65) decreased PMA-stimulated PLD1 protein expression (Fig. 7E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that NFκB is required for the PMA-induced expression and activation of PLD1. Identification of NFκB-binding Sites Responsible for PMA-induced PLD1 Expression–Next, we attempted to examine the regions that are responsible for PMA-induced PLD1 expression. Treatment with PMA and ectopic expression of NFκB enhanced the promoter activity of PLD1 in all of the deletion constructs (Fig. 8A). We found four putative NFκB-binding sites in the PLD1 promoter using bioinformatics (Fig. 8B). To determine if NFκB (p65) could directly bind to the PLD1 promoter in vivo and to further define the NFκB response elements to the promoter, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was carried out after treatment with PMA. PCR was performed using primers designed to amplify the four putative NFκB-binding regions, as shown in Fig. 8B. PMA enhanced the binding of p65 to the two NFκB-binding sites of the PLD1 promoter (NFκB-1 and NFκB-4), showing especially strong binding of NFκBto the NFκB-1 site. These results are comparable with those of the deletion promoter assay. As a positive control, the binding of NFκBtothe promoter of c-IAP2 was enhanced by PMA (28Wang Q. Wang X. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51091-51099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These data suggest that NFκB may play a role as an activator of the transcription of PLD1. Furthermore, mutagenesis of NFκB-1 and NFκB-4 sites attenuated PMA-induced PLD1 promoter activity (Fig. 8C). These findings demonstrate the functional importance of NFκB in the PMA-induced induction of PLD1 in HCT116 cells. PMA-induced PLD1 Induction Is Involved in the Secretion of MMP-9 via Ras/ERK/NFκB in Colon Cancer Cells–MMPs are well known to be involved in the invasion of tumor cells. PLD has been shown to be essential for the induction of MMP-9 expression by several stimuli (29Wakelam M.J. Martin A. Hodgkin M.N. Brown F. Pettitt T.R. Cross M.J. De Takats P.G. Reynolds J.L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Williger B.T. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 735-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Kato Y. Lambert C.A. Colige A.C. Mineur P. Noël A. Frankenne F. Foidart J.M. Baba M. Hata R. Miyazaki K. Tsukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10938-10944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether PMA-induced PLD1 induction is involved in the secretion of MMP-9 in HCT116 colon cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 9A, inhibitors that were specific for Ras (L744832), ERK (U0126), and NFκB (PDTC), which are involved in the induction of PLD1 by PMA, suppressed PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion and PLD1 induction. Moreover, depletion of PLD1 inhibited PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion, as analyzed by zymography. Taken together, these results suggest that PMA-induced expression of PLD1 via a Ras/ERK/NFκB pathway might mediate invasiveness associated with the secretion of MMP-9 in HCT116 cells. Depletion of PLD Decreases Cell Viability and Increases Apoptosis–Furthermore, we attempted to investigate the effect of the depletion of PLD isozyme on cell viability and apoptosis in cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 10, the depletion of PLD1 or PLD2 using siRNA decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis compared with those of control siRNA, as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and Annexin V binding assay. Depletion of both PLD1 and PLD2 significantly suppressed cell viability and enhanced apoptosis compared with that of either PLD isozyme. Taken together, these results suggest that PLD might play some roles in the cell survival and antiapoptotic functions in cancer cells. Abnormalities in the expression and activity of PLD have been reported in various human cancers using small numbers of tumor samples, but its clinicopathological significance remains unclear. In this study, using 122 colorectal carcinomas obtained from surgery, we found that PLD overexpression was detected in 74 (60.1%) of 122 colorectal cancers. However, no significant association was found between the PLD expression level and tumor stage or lymph node metastasis. Our observations indicated that PLD isozymes are significantly co-overexpressed in human CRCs with Ki-67, β-catenin, or p-Akt, which are involved in the early stages of the development of colon cancer. Thus, it is suggested that PLD may contribute to the progression of colorectal carcinoma in the clinical setting. Despite extensive information regarding the regulation of PLD activity in cell function, the signaling mechanisms that regulate PLD expression in cancer remain undefined. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that activation of PKC by PMA enhances the expression of PLD1, but not that of PLD2, via an NFκB-dependent pathway in colon cancer cells and suppresses apoptosis. Selective induction of PLD1 by PMA was also confirmed in the tissues of mice injected with PMA, thus suggesting its physiological relevance. Moreover, PMA-induced expression of PLD1 was not noted in all of the cancer cell lines examined. The specificity of PLD1 induction in certain cancer cells might be partly associated with endogenous PKC activation states, depending on cell types, but there are the other possible explanations for this phenomenon, including different genetic profiles of cancer cells or the sensitivity of the assays. In this study, we found for the first time that PMA selectively up-regulates the induction of PLD1, but not PLD2, via a Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/NFκB signaling pathway in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Elevated expression of these induced proteins also enhanced PLD activity. Moreover, depletion of these supposedly involved proteins reduced the PLD1 protein level. Recently, Kikuchi et al. (32Kikuchi R. Murakami M. Sobue S. Iwasaki T. Hagiwara K. Takagi A. Kojima T. Asano H. Suzuki M. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Murate T. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that Ewing's sarcoma fusion protein induces the expression of the PLD2 gene but not that of the PLD1 gene. NFκB has been reported to regulate transcription of a number of target genes related to tumorigenesis and cell survival, including TRAF1, TRAF2, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and FLIP (28Wang Q. Wang X. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51091-51099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33Wang Q. Wang X. Zhou Y. Evers B.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Wang X. Wang Q. Hu W. Evers B.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analysis of the PLD1 promoter shows the presence of two functional NFκB sites; the binding of these sites to the PLD1 promoter is enhanced by PMA, and the mutation of these sites suppresses PMA-induced PLD1 expression. NFκB plays a role in the enhanced survival of colon cancer cells, and inhibition of NFκB sensitizes colon cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (35Thomas R.P. Farrow B.J. Kim S. May M.J. Hellmich M.R. Evers B.M. Surgery. 2002; 132: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NFκB activation is a critical step in the tumor-promoting effect of PMA. Despite these important findings, the signaling pathways involved in PMA regulation of genes that are directly involved in cell death or death resistance remain largely unknown. Our current study shows that expression of PLD1 is regulated through the PKC-stimulated activation of NFκB. The secretion of MMP-9 from cancer cells (36Mackay A.R. Ballin M. Pelina M.D. Farina A.R. Nason A.M. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Invasion Metastasis. 1992; 12: 168-184PubMed Google Scholar, 37Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) leads to hydrolysis of the extracellular matrix, thus enabling cells to break out of their primary site into the circulation and from there to secondary sites. MMP-9 secretion is induced by various agonists that differ among cell lines (36Mackay A.R. Ballin M. Pelina M.D. Farina A.R. Nason A.M. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Invasion Metastasis. 1992; 12: 168-184PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-9 is secreted in response to PMA. PLD is known to be essential for the induction of MMP-9 secretion by several stimuli, including PMA. We found that inhibition of the proteins (Ras/ERK/NFκB) involved in the PMA-stimulated induction of PLD1 suppresses PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion and PLD1 protein level. Reduced expression of PLD1 using siRNA also inhibited PMA-stimulated secretion of MMP-9. Furthermore, depletion of PLD decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis, thus suggesting the involvement of PLD in survival and anti-apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate selective induction of PLD1 in human colon cancer cells and mice by PMA. Taken together, our current study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that the induction of PLD1 through a PKC/Ras/ERK/NFκB pathway is involved in the secretion of MMP-9 associated with invasiveness in colon cancer cells. In addition, our finding identifies PLD1 as a novel downstream target molecule of NFκB, which contributes to tumorigenesis. Since PLD has emerged as a critical regulator of cell proliferation and invasion, the selective modulation of PLD expression levels in certain cancers might be useful in sensitizing resistant cancers to the effects of anti-cancer drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2082848670,"Chromosome translocations in the common epithelial cancers are abundant, yet little is known about them. They have been thought to be almost all unbalanced and therefore dismissed as mostly mediating tumour suppressor loss. We present a comprehensive analysis by array painting of the chromosome translocations of breast cancer cell lines HCC1806, HCC1187 and ZR-75-30. In array painting, chromosomes are isolated by flow cytometry, amplified and hybridized to DNA microarrays. A total of 200 breakpoints were identified and all were mapped to 1 Mb resolution on bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) arrays, then 40 selected breakpoints, including all balanced breakpoints, were further mapped on tiling-path BAC arrays or to around 2 kb resolution using oligonucleotide arrays. Many more of the translocations were balanced at 1 Mb resolution than expected, either reciprocal (eight in total) or balanced for at least one participating chromosome (19 paired breakpoints). Second, many of the breakpoints were at genes that are plausible targets of oncogenic translocation, including balanced breaks at CTCF, EP300/p300 and FOXP4. Two gene fusions were demonstrated, TAX1BP1–AHCY and RIF1–PKD1L1. Our results support the idea that chromosome rearrangements may play an important role in common epithelial cancers such as breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2045433754,"S100A3 is a unique member of the Ca2+-binding S100 protein family with the highest cysteine content and affinity for Zn2+. This protein is highly expressed in the differentiating cuticular cells within the hair follicle and organized into mature hair cuticles. Previous studies suggest a close association of S100A3 with epithelial differentiation, leading to hair shaft formation, but its molecular function is still unknown. By two-dimensional PAGE-Western blot analyses using a modified citrulline antibody, we discovered that more than half of the arginine residues of native S100A3 are progressively converted to citrullines by Ca2+-dependent peptidylarginine deiminases. Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy showed that the cytoplasmic S100A3 within the cuticular layer is mostly co-localized with the type III isoform of peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD3) but not with PAD1. Recombinant PAD1 and PAD2 are capable of converting all 4 arginines in recombinant S100A3, whereas PAD3 specifically converts only Arg-51 into citrulline. Gel filtration analyses showed that either enzymatic conversion of Arg-51 in S100A3 to citrulline or its mutational substitution with alanine (R51A) promotes a homotetramer assembly. Fluorescent titration of R51A suggested that its potential Ca2+ binding property increased during tetramerization. A prototype structural model of the globular Ca2+-bound S100A3 tetramer with citrulline residues is presented. High concentrations of S100A3 homotetramer might provide the millimolar level of Ca2+ required for hair cuticular barrier formation.

Several EF-hand type Ca2+-binding proteins are involved in a multitude of Ca2+-dependent cellular processes. The S100 protein family is the largest subgroup of more than 20 members characterized by two highly conserved Ca2+-binding domains: a classical C-terminal EF-hand with a canonical Ca2+-binding loop and a S100 specific N-terminal EF-hand motif (1Marenholz I.

Extensive studies have revealed diverse functional roles of several S100 proteins in variety of cellular processes, such as cell growth and differentiation, cell cycle regulation, transcription, and signal transduction receptor activities. They are also associated with human diseases, including inflammation, brain disorders, cancer, diabetes, heart failure, and pathological conditions of the skin and hair follicle. The basic structural and functional unit of most S100 proteins was previously thought to be a noncovalently associated antiparallel dimer; however, there is increasing evidence that some members assemble into higher order oligomers, thereby conferring their biological function (3Novitskaya V.

Although this biochemical process is believed to be precisely regulated by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, there remains controversy regarding the mechanism by which PAD and transglutaminase could be activated in vivo, since both require a nearly millimolar level of Ca2+ to exhibit their full activities in vitro (12Eckert R.L.

The present investigation has revealed that specific arginine conversion catalyzed by a Ca2+-dependent PAD enzyme promotes S100A3 tetramerization and thereby confers its potential Ca2+-binding property.

Extraction and Purification of S100A3 from Hair Follicles and Cuticles–About 200 beard follicles were plucked from a Japanese male using hair tweezers. In a mortar, nonkeratinized parts of follicles were crushed in 2 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.1 m DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, supernatants were stored at -70 °C. The combined follicle extract of 20 preparations (i.e. 4000 follicles) and the extract of hair cuticles (200 mg) using 10 ml of the above extraction buffer at 37 °C for 16 h were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.6) containing 10 mm DTT and then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose™ (GE Healthcare) column (1 ml) preequilibrated with the same buffer. Bound S100A3 was eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 0.6 m NaCl. Fractions containing S100A3 were combined, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 1.5 m and then loaded onto a Macro-Prep® t-butyl hydrophobic interaction (Bio-Rad) column (1 ml). Bound S100A3 was eluted by a linear gradient from 1.5 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4. Resultant crude S100A3 fractions were centrifugally desalted and condensed to 100 μl using Microcon® YM-3 filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Samples preheated under reducing conditions in NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) were loaded into 4 of 10 wells of 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (7.8 × 6.3 × 0.15 cm; Invitrogen) and then electrophoresed using MES-SDS buffer at 200 V for 35 min. After staining with Rapidstain™ reagent (Calbiochem), each S100A3 band was excised and transferred to a D-tube™ 3.5 kDa cut-off dialyzer (Calbiochem). The tubes were submerged with 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine (pH 8.6) in an AE6100 electrophoretic apparatus (Atto, Tokyo, Japan). S100A3 was eluted from a gel slice at 100 V for 45 min, followed by 1 min of reversed electric current. Purified S100A3 aliquots were combined and condensed after supplementation of DTT to 5 mm and then subjected to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric analyses (see supplemental method). Citrulline Contents in S100A3–Peptidylcitrullines in S100A3 were detected by Western blot analyses of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels using an antibody to citrulline residues (34Senshu T. Akiyama K. Kan S. Asaga H. Ishigami A. Manabe M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded onto immobilized pH gradient strips with pH range 3-5 (Sigma) by in-gel rehydration. Isoelectric focusing was performed at 200 V for 20 min, 450 V for 15 min, 750 V for 15 min, and 2000 V for 30 min. The second dimension was performed with precast NuPAGE® 4-12% Bis-Tris Zoom gel (7.8 × 6.3 × 0.1 cm; Invitrogen) using MES-SDS buffer at 200 V for 35 min. Citrulline residues were chemically modified to form a ureido group adduct in 0.0125% FeCl3, 2.3 m H2SO4, 1.5 m H3PO4, 0.25% 2,3-butanedione monoxime, 0.125% antipyrine, and 0.25% acetic acid on the protein-transferred polyvinylidene difluoride membrane prefixed with 1% glutaraldehyde at 37 °C for 16 h. An anti-citrulline (modified) detection kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was employed according to the supplier's manual. The pI of each S100A3 spot reflects the exact number of peptidylcitrulline residues. Relative intensities of silver-stained S100A3 spots were measured using image-analyzing software (Scion). The background of a nonspot area was subtracted from each signal intensity (I) value. The conversion rate was calculated via the equation for the acetylated native form (conversion (%) = (N0 × IpI 4.5/Itotal + N1 × IpI 4.3/Itotal + N2 × IpI 4.1/Itotal + N3 × IpI 3.9/Itotal + N4 × IpI 3.8/Itotal)/4 × 100 (where N0, N1, N2, N3, and N4 represent the forms with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 converted arginines, respectively)) and for the recombinant modified by PAD enzymes (conversion (%) = (N0 × IpI 4.7/Itotal + N1 × IpI 4.5/Itotal + N2 × IpI 4.3/Itotal + N3 × IpI 4.1/Itotal + N4 × IpI 4.0/Itotal)/4 × 100). Confocal Immunofluorescent Microscopy–Plucked beard follicles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 16 h and embedded in paraffin. Sections with 6-μm thickness were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and then antigens were retrieved by heating to 95 °C in a modified citrate buffer (S1700; Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised by us against the multiple antigen peptides of PAD3 (a partial sequence, 233DKVSYEVPRLHGDEER248) and a commercially available antibody to PAD1 from Covalab (Lyon, France), both purified by their own antigen-bound affinity columns, were employed. Commercially available rabbit antibody immunized with recombinant PAD2 from Shima Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan) was used after preabsorption with recombinant PAD1 and PAD3. The pretreated sections were reacted with diluted primary rabbit antibody to human PAD1 (5 μg/ml), PAD2 (15 μg/ml), or PAD3 (5 μg/ml). All reaction steps were performed for 45 min at room temperature, followed by three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were then incubated with 10 μg/ml of Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Subsequently, biotinylated antibody to human S100A3 (5 μg/ml), prepared using an EZ-link® NHS-PEO solid phase biotinylation kit (Pierce) (26Kizawa K. Toyoda M. Ito M. Morohashi M. Br. J. Dermatol. 2005; 152: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), was applied to detect the second target antigen. Finally, sections were incubated with 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor® 594-streptavidin conjugate (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired and processed using an LSM510 fluorescent confocal microscope and its accompanying software (Carl Zeiss AG, Göttingen, Germany). In Vitro Modification of S100A3–Active recombinant human PAD1, PAD2, and PAD3 enzymes were prepared according to the previously reported procedures (18Méchin M.C. Enji M. Nachat R. Chavanas S.

Conventionally, 1 μg of recombinant S100A3 was reacted with 25 milliunits of PAD enzymes in 20 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm DTT at 37 °C.

Peptide Mapping–After purification on a Superdex 75 column to remove the enzymes, recombinant S100A3 modified by three recombinant PAD enzymes (25 milliunits/μg S100A3) at 37 °C for 24 h and native S100A3 purified from the hair follicle were reduced and alkylated with a half-volume of 1 m iodoacetamide dissolved in 3 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.4) for 15 min. After blocking unreacted reagent with DTT, the reaction mixture was passed through a NAP™ 5 column preequilibrated with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Concentrated modified S100A3 was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Applied Science) in 25 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) at 37 °C overnight. 6 μl of the Lys-C digest were loaded on a reversed-phase capillary HPLC column (PepMap C18, 0.3 × 150 mm; LC Packings). The peptides were separated with the following HPLC program: (i) isocratic flow at 5% B (v/v) for 5 min; (ii) linear gradient from 5 to 20% B in 5 min; (iii) linear gradient from 20 to 60% B in 20 min; (iv) linear gradient from 60 to 100% B in 5 min; (v) isocratic flow at 100% B for 10 min. Solvents A and B were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% CH3CN in 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid, respectively. The flow rate was 4 μl/min, and peptides were detected at 220 nm. Peptides eluting from the HPLC column were collected onto a 600-μm AnchorChip™ target (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany), using a Probot micro-fraction collector (LC Packings). Fractions were collected in 20-s intervals. 1.3 μl of matrix solution was added to each fraction. A 1:5 dilution of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in ethanol/acetone (2:1) was used as matrix solution. Mass mapping was performed with an Autoflex® MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Peptides were analyzed in the positive ion mode with delayed extraction (70 ns) and the following voltages: source, 19 kV; extraction, 16.55 kV; lens, 8.35 kV; reflector, 20 kV. Mutated S100A3 Production–The point mutation for Arg/Ala substitution in human S100A3 was introduced by PCR using the QuikChange® II mutagenesis system (Stratagene) with pMal-c2-S100A3 (20Föhr U.G.

Briefly, the mutagenic primer sets used were as listed below, with modified bases shown underlined: for R3A, 5′-GAGTGAGGATGGCCGCGCCTCTGGAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTCCAGAGGCGCGGCCATCCTCACTC-3′; for R22A, 5′-CCAGGAATACGCAGGGGCCTGTGGGGACAAATAC-3′ and 5′-GTATTTGTCCCCACAGGCCCCTGCGTATTCCTGG-3′; for R51A, 5′-ACCTGGACCCCGACTGAGTTTGCGGAATGTGACT-3′ and 5′-AGTCACATTCCGCAAACTCAGTCGGGGTCCAGGT-3′; and for R77A, 5′-CTTTGTGGAGTATGTGGCCTCACTTGCCTGCCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGGCAGGCAAGTGAGGCCACATACTCCACAAAG-3′. The resulting mutated plasmids containing staggered nicks were processed for transformation after the template plasmid digestion by DpnI. S100A3 and its mutated proteins were expressed as maltose-binding fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified under anaerobic conditions, as previously described (21Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Apparent Molecular Mass Analyses–The native apparent molecular mass of S100A3 in solution was determined by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex™ 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and various concentrations of CaCl2 or EGTA (pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was standardized with the low molecular mass calibration proteins (GE Healthcare). Titration of Ca2+-induced Conformational Change–Fluorescent titration of the single Trp residue of recombinant S100A3 and its mutated proteins (2 μm) was carried out in 50 mm Tris buffer containing 150 mm KCl and 1 mm DTT (pH 7.5), as previously described (20Föhr U.G.

Emission fluorescent intensities at 340 nm (5-nm slit) excited at 295 nm (10-nm slit) after cumulative additions of CaCl2 were recorded using an RF5000 spectrofluorophotometer (Shimazu, Kyoto, Japan). Citrullinated S100A3 Derived from Hair Follicles and Cuticles–We purified the native form of S100A3 protein derived from beard follicles and matured hair cuticles (Fig. 1 and Table 1). It was difficult to estimate S100A3 content in the matured cuticles, since only a small percentage of the cuticular proteins were extracted. Total soluble protein in the nonkeratinized cells of plucked follicles was estimated to be 10% of the wet mass, and S100A3 content was found to be about 3% of this. This tissue expression level is highest among known abundant S100 proteins (e.g. S100B represents about 0.5% of total cellular brain protein). Given that S100A3 is found almost only in differentiating cuticular cells, which account for less than 10% of the follicular tissue, this indicates that in the condensed (dehydrated) cuticular cells, it could reach high, even millimolar, concentrations.TABLE 1Purification of human S100A3 from beard follicle and hair cuticlePurification stepFrom 4000 beard folliclesFrom 200 mg of hair cuticlesbSeparated from about 20 g of hair fiber.AmountaMeasured densitometrically with recombinant S100A3 as a standard.YieldAmountYieldμg%μg%Crude extract307294Anion exchange chromatography2247317359Hydrophobic interaction chromatography1685410636Electric elution6621238a Measured densitometrically with recombinant S100A3 as a standard.b Separated from about 20 g of hair fiber.

Although several spots are found in follicle and cuticle derivatives, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry revealed a single peak with mass 11,624 Da for the S100A3 purified from hair follicle and two peaks (11,624 and 11,640 Da) for the mature cuticle derivative, consistent with the calculated mass of t"
https://openalex.org/W1996238852,"Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is a putative tumour suppressor gene, which is downregulated in many solid tumours. In neuroblastoma, loss of CADM1 expression has recently been found in disseminated tumours with adverse outcome, prompting us to investigate its role in neuroblastoma tumour progression. Oligonucleotide-microarray analysis of 251 neuroblastoma specimens demonstrated that CADM1 downregulation is associated with unfavourable prognostic markers like disseminated stage 4, age >18 months, MYCN amplification and chromosome 11q alterations (P<0.001 each). Furthermore, low CADM1 expression was significantly correlated with unfavourable gene expression-based classification (P<0.001) and adverse patient outcome (P<0.001). Bisulphite sequencing and genetic analysis of 18 primary neuroblastomas suggested that neither haploinsufficiency nor hypermethylation is regularly involved in CADM1 gene silencing in neuroblastoma, which is in contrast to results obtained in other malignancies. In addition, no mutations disrupting the CADM1 reading frame were found in 25 primary neuroblastomas. Over-expression of CADM1 in neuroblastoma cells resulted in significant reduction of proliferation, viability and colony formation in soft agar. Collectively, our results suggest that downregulation of CADM1 tumour suppressor gene expression is a critical event in neuroblastoma pathogenesis resulting in tumour progression and unfavourable patient outcome."

Transition of DLC1 between dimer and monomer forms might play a crucial role in its function. However, the molecular mechanism(s) that control the transition remain unknown. DLC1 phosphorylation on Ser88 by p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), a signaling nodule, promotes mammalian cell survival by regulating its interaction with Bim and the stability of Bim. Here we discovered that phosphorylation of Ser88, which juxtapose each other at the interface of the DLC dimer, disrupts DLC1 dimer formation and consequently impairs its interaction with Bim. Overexpression of a Ser88 phosphorylation-inactive DLC1 mutant in mammary epithelium cells and in a transgenic animal model caused apoptosis and accelerated mammary gland involution, respectively, with increased Bim levels. Structural and biophysical studies suggested that phosphorylation-mimicking mutation leads to dissociation of the DLC1 dimer to a pure folded monomer. The phosphorylation-induced DLC1 monomer is incapable of binding to its substrate Bim. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of DLC1 in which the Ser88 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch for the transition of DLC1 from dimer to monomer, thereby modulating its interaction with substrates and consequently regulating the functions of DLC1.

Dyneins are massive minus-to-plus end microtubules motor complexes. Dyneins are categorized into axonemal dyneins and cytoplasmic dyneins on the basis of structural and functional features (1Oiwa K.

Although DLC1 has been shown to bind to many partners, its physiological roles and the upstream regulators of DLC1 remain poorly understood. DLC1 is presumed to have essential cell functions because of its extraordinary sequence conservation across species and ubiquitous expression. Genetic studies in Aspergillus suggested that DLC1 is important for activities of dynein, because a DLC1 temperature-sensitive mutation led to multiple dynein-mediated defects (22Beckwith S.M. Roghi C.H. Liu B. Ronald M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several studies suggested that DLC1 might be critical for cell survival. Partial loss-of-function DLC1 alleles in Drosophila led to pleiotropic morphogenetic defects during development (23Dick T. Ray K. Salz H.K. Chia W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1966-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Phillis R. Statton D. Caruccio P. Murphey R.K. Development. 1996; 122: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complete deletion of DLC1 caused Drosophila embryonic lethality with excessive apoptosis. Studies from human cells and in vitro model systems have indicated a role of DLC1 in the cell survival pathways. For example, DLC1 prevented PC12 cells from undergoing apoptosis upon withdrawal of the neuronal growth factor by interaction and inactivation of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (25Chang Y.W. Jakobi R. McGinty A. Foschi M. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DLC1 also regulates apoptotic activities of Bim by sequestering it to the microtubule in certain cells. Upon apoptotic stimuli, Bim translocates jointly with DLC1 to the mitochondria and sequesters Bcl-2 from binding and inactivating Bak/Bax, thus allowing Bak/Bax to form an oligomer and initiate apoptosis (12Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Because of its protein structure and interaction with many apparently unrelated molecules, DLC1 has been thought to function as an adapter that links cargo proteins to the dynein motor (26Fan J. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, it may also function independently of dynein, as most of the DLC1 in the brain lysate does not bind to dynein (27King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman J.F. II I Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition to its potential role as a cargo adaptor of dynein, DLC1 was thought to have a role in promoting structure assembly and stabilization of complexes, such as IC74 and other dynein-unrelated complexes (28Nyarko A. Hare M. Hays T.S. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15595-15603Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Wang L. Hare M. Hays T.S. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4611-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DLC1 binds to its target proteins by recognizing two different consensus peptide motifs: (K/R)XTQT and G(I/V)QVD (20Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Rodriguez-Crespo I. Yelamos B. Roncal F. Albar J.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Gavilanes F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction and solution NMR structural studies have shown that DLC1 exists as a tight dimer consisting of two identical peptide-binding channels located at the opposite sides of the dimer interface (26Fan J. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The structural properties of the DLC1 dimmer indicated that DLC1 might link dynein with target proteins to be transported by the motor. In addition, dimerization facilitates the interaction of DLC1 with its binding partners (26Fan J. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a change in pH drives the dimer-monomer transition due to protonation of His55 buried in the dimer interface, and His55 protonation occurs at pH 4.5 or below (33Nyarko A. Cochrun L. Norwood S. Pursifull N. Voth A. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14248-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the dimmer to monomer transition might play a regulatory role in the function of DLC1 (33Nyarko A. Cochrun L. Norwood S. Pursifull N. Voth A. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14248-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification that regulates many aspects of the cellular signaling pathways. Previous studies showed that DLC1 is phosphorylated on Ser88 by p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), a major signaling nodule in mammalian cells (34Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). DLC1 phosphorylation by Pak1 promotes the survival and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, DLC1-Ser88 phosphorylation by Pak1 also regulates the interaction of DLC1 with Bim, and such events are accompanied by the release of Bim from the DLC1-Bim complex and degradation of Bim. Pak1 phosphorylation of DLC1 at Ser88 also controls DLC1-trigged macropino-cytosis (35Yang Z. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 654-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All these studies indicate that Ser88 phosphorylation of DLC1 represents an important convergence point for upstream signals. In the present study, we explored the potential modulating effect of Ser88 phosphorylation upon DLC1 and its effect on the function of DLC1. Model Preparation–The initial coordinates were taken from the solution structure of DLC1 from the Brookhaven Protein Data bank (PDB code 1F3C). The wild-type models of various dimer combinations of DLC1 were generated by keeping the initial backbone coordinates of the point mutations, and the side chain coordinates were then generated using the CHARMM program. The missing hydrogen coordinates were built with the HBUILD algorithm. To get a suitable conformation of the modeled parts, we first put each protein model into the pre-generated octahedral water box; then, depending on the charging status, counterions were added to neutralize the system. After that, we performed a total of 700 steps of steepest descent energy minimization with PMEwald and periodical boundary conditions, gradually releasing the system every 100 steps by reducing the harmonic anchor from 100.0 to zero for proteins, modeled side chains, and the rest. Graphic Illustration–After the minimizations, the models were in more suitable conformations. We used MOLSCRIPT to make cartoons for models and controls. The electrostatic surface of each model was prepared by GRASP. Expression Vectors and Cloning–pcDNA3.1 vectors (Invitrogen) containing human DLC1, DLC1-S88A, or DLC1-S88E cDNA were previously reported (34Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the original cloning from the mammary gland cDNA library, the DLC1 cDNA contained the coding region as well as 48 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region; thus translation of this expression vector resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa. However, this region had no effect on the functions and activities of DLC1. Subsequently generated DLC1-S88A or DLC1-S88E cDNA lacked this untranslated region, and each had an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa. To demonstrate a lack of any effect of this 48-bp region in the original cloning, we generated a new T7-DLC1 construct with only DLC1 cDNA (T7-DLC1-new) and tested whether this construct behaved the same as T7-DLC1, using the immunoprecipitation assay. The result showed that T7-DLC1-new had the same ability to interact with endogenous DLC1, and this excluded the possibility of the interference of extra untranslated region in T7-DLC1 (supplementary Fig. S1). Cell Culture and Plasmid Transfection–Transient transfections were performed using a FuGENE-6 kit (Roche Applies Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. HC11 mammary epithelial cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Cell Signaling) containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 10 ng/ml mouse epidermal growth factor (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum. HC11 cells stably expressing DLC1 were generated by transfecting pcDNA3.1, pcDNA-T7-DLC1, or pcDNA-T7-DLC1-S88A plasmids using electroporation. To obtain apoptotic cells, cells were allowed to attach for 24 h in medium without insulin or epidermal growth factor, reaching about 80% confluence. Then, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium without insulin and epidermal growth factor for the times indicated under “Results.” Pak1 Kinase Assay–For stimulation of Pak1 kinase activity by spingosine, 8 h after transfection with T7-DLC1 cDNA plasmids, the 293T cells were serum starved for 36 h and then treated with sphingosine (100 μm) for 15 and 30 min. Part of the whole cellular lysate was used for the Pak1 kinase assay as described previously (34Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We analyzed the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The same blot was then used for examining the immunoprecipitation result by Western blotting for Pak1. Annexin V and TUNEL Assays–The Annexin V assay was conducted with an Annexin V-fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (Sigma). Cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by withdrawal of serum and other survival factors from the medium for 24 h, and the assay was then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The TUNEL assay was performed by using the fluorescein In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One thousand cells from five random fields per section were documented by photomicroscopy, and the TUNEL-positive epithelial cells were counted. Generation of MMTV-DLC1 and MMTV-DLC1-S88A Transgenic Mice and DNA Analysis–To express the transgenes in the mouse mammary glands, the cDNAs encoding human DLC1 and DLC1-S88A with the T7 tag were subcloned from the pcDNA3.1 vector into the MMTV-SV40-BssK vector using sites HindIII-XbaI (blunted) into HindIII-EcoRI (blunted). The transgenes were excised from plasmid DNA by restriction enzymes SalI and SpeI, and the resulting linear fragments contained promoter sequences, DLC1 or DLC1-S88A coding regions, and 3′-untranslated regions and SV40 polyadenylation signals. The linear DNA fragments were microinjected into the pronuclei of the B6D2F1/J hybrid mouse eggs. Genotyping was performed by using the polymerase chain reaction assay. The primers used were forward primer to the T7-epitope encoding region (5′-CAGCAAATGGGTCGGGATC) and reverse primer (5′-CTACCGAAGTTCCTCCCCAC) corresponding to DLC1 cDNA. Genotyping was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of mouse tail genomic DNA digested with HindIII and SpeI restriction enzymes. The probe used was full-length DLC1 cDNA, which was digested out from a plasmid named RFP-PINS88A containing cDNA of DLC1 (previously generated in the laboratory) by restriction enzyme EcoRI plus XhoI. Mouse Husbandry and Analysis Strategies–The mice were maintained on a mixed C57/BL6:DBA background. For analysis of the mouse mammary gland development, mammary tissues from involution days 1 to 5 (first pregnancy with forced involution after day 10 of lactation) were analyzed. Age-matched wild-type mice served as controls in these studies. RT-PCR Analysis–The RNAs were treated with DNase I to eliminate potential DNA contamination using the DNA-free kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the Access Quick RT-PCR system (Promega). Primers for DLC1 and DLC1-S88A were the same as for PCR of DNA. Mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as internal control with primers forward, 5′-CCATCTTCCAGGAGCGAGATC, and reverse, 5′-CGTTCAGCTCAGGGATGACC. Primers for mouse Bim total were forward, 5′-CTGTTGGATCCACCATGGCCAAGCAACCT, and reverse, 5′-TGCATGTGCGGCCGCTCAATGCCTTCTC. Mouse β-actin primers were forward 5′-TTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTCC, and reverse, 5′-TCTACGAGGGCTATGCTCTCC. Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Analysis–About 50 μg of total protein extract from cultured cells or mammary glands was used in the immunoblot assays. The lysates to immunoprecipitate T7-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C using 50 μl of T7-agarose beads per milligram of protein. The antibodies used and the dilutions were as follows: mouse T7 tag (1:5000, Novagen), rabbit polyclonal BCL-X(L) (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal Bim (1:500; Stressgen), rabbit polyclonal Stat3 serine 705 phosphorylation (1:1000; Cell Signaling), mouse monoclonal total Stat3 (1:500; Cell Signaling), and mouse monoclonal β-actin (1:1000; Sigma). Immunohistochemical Analysis–The sections were incubated with polyclonal rat Bim antibody (1:50; Chemicon) at 4 °C overnight and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (1:200). Immunostained sections were lightly counterstained in hematoxylin with submerging into hematoxylin. Immunostaining for T7 was performed as reported previously (34Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis and Quantification–Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis of the data were performed using Student's t test. Blots were quantified with ImageQuant software. NMR Studies–Preparation of the wild-type DLC1 and its S88A and S88E mutants followed the procedure described in our earlier work (26Fan J. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled DLC1 and its S88A and S88E mutants were acquired on a Varian Inova 750-MHz spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient shielded triple resonance probe. All NMR spectra were recorded at 30 °C, with a protein concentration of ∼0.3 mm dissolved in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.0 or 6.0. Gel Filtration Chromatography–Analytical gel filtration chromatography was performed on an AKTA FPLC system using a Superose 12 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein samples were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with the low molecular mass column calibration kit from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescence Assays–The 9-residue peptide (MSCDKSTQT) corresponding to Met48 to Ser56 of Bim was commercially synthesized (GenScript) and was >95% pure. The fluorescence polarization assays were performed on a PerkinElmer LS-55 fluorimeter equipped with an automated polarizer at 20 °C. The peptide was conjugated with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (Invitrogen) on its N-terminal amine. Fluorescence titration was performed with an increasing amount of unlabeled DLC1 proteins and a constant amount of fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-labeled peptide (1 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl. The titration curves were fitted with the MicroCal Origin software package. DLC1-Ser88 Phosphorylation Mutants Modulate Its Interaction with Endogenous DLC1 and Dimerization–Although a previous in vitro study (34Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) using recombinant proteins demonstrated that phosphorylated DLC1 or DLC1-S88E mutant (phosphorylation mimicking mutation) abolished the interaction of DLC1 with Bim, whereas there was no effect of the DLC1-S88A mutant (phosphorylation inactive mutation) on its in vitro binding to Bim, the nature of such interactions in a cellular in vivo setting remains to be verified. In addition, in vivo phosphorylation of DLC1 on Ser88 has been shown to be accompanied by degradation of Bim (34Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To gain a deeper understanding of the potential effect of DLC1-Ser88 phosphorylation on the structure of DLC1, we first constructed the three-dimensional models in silico. Using the coordinates from the solution structure of the DLC1 dimer (PDB code 1F3C), we modeled the following DLC1 dimers: DLC1 homodimer (supplementary Fig. S2A), DLC1 homodimer with phosphorylated Ser88 (supplementary Fig. S2B), DLC1-S88E homodimer (supplementary Fig. S2C), DLC1-S88A homodimer (supplementary Fig. S2D), and DLC1 heterodimer with DLC1-S88A mutant (supplementary Fig. S2E). The calculations of electrostatic surface potential for each model showed that the introduction of phosphorylation or glutamic acid on Ser88 dramatically intensified the negative electrostatic charges around the edge of the dimer interface; in contrast, a comparatively low surface negative charge was shown in dimers consisting of DLC1-S88A or DLC1/DLC1-S88A. Because Ser88 from the two subunits juxtapose each other at the interface of the DLC dimer, the introduction of the negative charges in the proximity of Ser88 is expected to reduce the stability of the DLC8 dimer. To test the prediction that Ser88 phosphorylation may impair the interaction between the two subunits in the DLC1 dimer, we examined the ability of transiently transfected T7-DLC1 or its S88A or S88E mutant to interact with the endogenous DLC1 or its substrate Bim in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-T7-agarose beads revealed the inability of T7-DLC1-S88E to pull-down the endogenous DLC1 or Bim, compared with the efficient interactions of T7-DLC1 or T7-DLC1-S88A with DLC1 or Bim (Fig. 1A and supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggested that DLC1-Ser88 phosphorylation mimicking active mutant inhibits its interaction with the endogenous DLC1 as well as with Bim. To validate these results, we next examined the effect of DLC1-Ser88 phosphorylation on its binding to DLC1 and Bim by a physiologic signal sphingosine, a known Pak1 activator (36Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). 293T cells transfected with T7-DLC1 were stimulated by sphingosine to activate Pak1, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-T7-monoclonal antibody and blotted with anti-DLC1 and Bim antibodies. Upon Pak1 activation by sphingosine (supplementary Fig. S4), there was a significant reduction in the ability of T7-DLC1 to interact with endogenous DLC1 or Bim-EL/Bim-L (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate the existence of DLC1 dimer and examine the effect of Ser88 phosphorylation on DLC1 dimerization, 293T cells transfected with T7-DLC1 or its Ser88 phosphorylation mutants were chemically cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate, and the cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-T7-monoclonal antibody. In addition to the monomer forms of T7-DLC1 proteins, which migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa, the immunoblot analysis indicated the existence of a 30-kDa T7-DLC1 dimer as expected (Fig. 1C). The immunoblot analysis also showed a clear decrease of the T7-S88E dimer-to-monomer ratio (0.9-fold) compared with the dimer-to-monomer ratio (4.3-fold) of T7-DLC1 or T7-S88A (5.6-fold) (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these findings suggested that Ser88 phosphorylation diminishes the ability of DLC1 to form a dimer. DLC1-Ser88 Phosphorylation-inactive Mutant Enhances Apoptosis in a Cellular Model–DLC1 has been shown to exert a survival function in Drosophila embryonic development (23Dick T. Ray K. Salz H.K.

Baik M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 97-104Google Scholar), implying a putative role of DLC1 in supporting cell survival. To better understand the functional significance of Ser88 phosphorylation on the function of DLC1, we examined the effect of the phosphorylation-inactive DLC1-S88A mutant on the survival of HC11 cells. We generated HC11 clones stably expressing T7-DLC1, DLC1-S88A, and control vector as assessed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) and Western blotting (Fig. 2B). To examine the potential effect of DLC1-S88A on cell survival, HC11 clones were subjected to serum deprivation for 24 h, and the status of cellular apoptosis was assayed using the Annexin V staining assay. Under normal culturing conditions, no apoptotic cells could be detected in any of the clones. However, upon serum starvation, about 50% of the HC"

The molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. The BKCa channel plays a central role in the behavioral response to ethanol in Caenorhabditis elegans (Davies, A. G., Pierce-Shimomura, J. T., Kim, H., VanHoven, M. K., Thiele, T. R., Bonci, A., Bargmann, C. I., and McIntire, S. L. (2003) Cell 115, 655-666) and Drosophila (Cowmeadow, R. B., Krishnan, H. R., and Atkinson, N. S. (2005) Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 29, 1777-1786). In neurons, ethanol tolerance in BKCa channels has two components: a reduced number of membrane channels and decreased potentiation of the remaining channels (Pietrzykowski, A. Z., Martin, G. E., Puig, S. I., Knott, T. K., Lemos, J. R., and Treistman, S. N. (2004) J. Neurosci. 24, 8322-8332). Here, heterologous expression coupled with planar bilayer techniques examines two additional aspects of tolerance in human BKCa channels. 1) Is acute tolerance observed in a single channel protein complex within a lipid environment reduced to only two lipids? 2) Does lipid bilayer composition affect the appearance of acute tolerance? We found that tolerance was observable in BKCa channels in membrane patches pulled from HEK cells and when they are placed into reconstituted 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine membranes. Furthermore, altering bilayer thickness by incorporating the channel into lipid mixtures of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine with phosphatidylcholines of increasing chain length, or with sphingomyelin, strongly affected the sensitivity of the channel, as well as the time course of the acute response. Ethanol sensitivity changed from a strong potentiation in thin bilayers to inhibition in thick sphingomyelin/1,2-dioleoyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers. Thus, tolerance can be an intrinsic property of the channel protein-lipid complex, and bilayer thickness plays an important role in shaping the pattern of response to ethanol. As a consequence of these findings the protein-lipid complex should be treated as a unit when studying ethanol action.

Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), in which the actions of ethanol on neuronal membranes was thought to be explicable mainly in terms of actions on membrane lipids, secondarily affecting proteins, has largely been replaced by the protein hypothesis. This latter is predicated on findings that alcohol can interact directly with membrane proteins to affect function (5Kruse S.W. Zhao R. Smith D.P. Jones D.N. Nat. Struct.

Of course, the focus on alcohol-protein interaction does not preclude a role for membrane lipids in modulating this interaction. Indeed, recent studies have made it clear that alterations in lipid environments can alter the response of signaling proteins such as membrane ion channels (12Andersen O.S. Koeppe Ii R.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 107-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) to alcohol (13Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol.

Behaviorally, tolerance to the continued presence of ethanol and other drugs of abuse plays an important role in the development of dependence and addiction. In fact, the strength of acute behavioral tolerance in naïve humans is one of the better known predictors of the development of alcohol addiction (15Schuckit M.A. Alcohol Alcohol. Suppl. 1993; 2: 91-94PubMed Google Scholar). The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance and other forms of drug-related neuroadaptation is an important goal of current research in the addiction field. Large conductance Ca2+ and voltage-gated K+ (BKCa) channels (16Latorre R. Brauchi S. Biol.

Although the focus of the actions of ethanol is now on proteins, membrane lipids play an important role in ethanol modulation of ion channel function. Of particular interest, in the case of BKCa channels, are findings that BKCa channels as well as other voltage-gated K+ channels are preferentially targeted to certain lipid domains (lipid rafts) that are enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol (33Martens J.R.

The activity of these BKCa channels is influenced by the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio (36Bolotina V. Omelyanenko V. Heyes B. Ryan U. Bregestovski P. Pflugers Arch. 1989; 415: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and lipid composition in the surrounding lipid bilayer (37Chang H.M. Reitstetter R. Mason R.P. Gruener R. J. Membr.

Here, we use a combination of molecular biology and planar bilayer single channel recording techniques to address a previously unexplored aspect of alcohol tolerance, asking whether a single channel protein complex (BKCa) incorporated into a simple bilayer can exhibit tolerance (i.e. is tolerance intrinsic to the protein complex?). We follow the affirmative answer to this question, obtained in a POPE 2The abbreviations used are: POPE1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolaminePOPS1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserineDOPE1,2-dioleoyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamineHEDTAN-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acidPoopen probabilityPCphosphatidylcholineSPMsphingomyelin. /POPS bilayer, with a study of the influence of a range of lipid bilayer compositions that manipulate bilayer thickness, on the initial and sustained response to ethanol.

O'Connell R.J. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Treistman S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7276-7286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that BKCa channels reconstituted into thick SPM membranes showed a different response to acute ethanol exposure when compared with the same channel reconstituted into thin bilayers. This indicates that lipid environment surrounding the protein plays an important role in modulating ethanol action on the protein. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine 1,2-dioleoyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid open probability phosphatidylcholine sphingomyelin. In each of these experiments we always have at least two major components, the protein and the lipid bilayer. Because there are a wide variety of lipid compositions in which the BKCa protein responds similarly to alcohol application (21Brodie M.S. Scholz A. Weiger T.M. Dopico A.M. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2007; 31: 1625-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) we tend to favor the notion that interaction with the protein is the most likely site of action. Although the alternate interpretation, in which the lipid component is the primary site of action, cannot be ruled out, we assume that the lipid composition modulates the response of the protein. DOPE, brain SPM, and PCs (from C14:1, to C24:1) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). They were used without further purification. Decane and salts were from Aldrich. Ethanol (100%, anhydrous) was purchased from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). All aqueous solutions were prepared with 18.3 mΩ/cm Milli-Q water (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The cDNA encoding hSlo, kindly provided by Dr. P. Ahring, NeuroSearch A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark), was overexpressed in HEK-293 cells. Stably transfected HEK-293 cells were grown in artificial medium (42Ahring P.K. Strobaek D. Christophersen P. Olesen S.P. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and membrane fragments were prepared using a protocol developed for COS cells with some slight modifications as described elsewhere (13Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HEK-293 Cell Recordings–HEK-293 cells stably expressing hSlo α channels were cultured in 35-mm culture dishes until 45-60% confluence was reached. Cells were washed for 30 min in high calcium (2.2 μm) bath solution followed by a 10-min wash in intracellular recording solution (1 μm calcium) prior to recording. Single-channel recordings were performed in excised inside-out membrane patches using standard patch clamp techniques (43Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). All recordings were made under symmetric K+ conditions where the potassium concentration was the same in the bath and recording solutions. Electrodes were fabricated from glass pipettes (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA), pulled using a Model P-97 Brown/Flaming micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA), and coated with sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) to reduce capacitance and noise. The tips were fire polished using a microforge (Narishige, Kyoto, Japan) to yield electrodes with resistances between 7 and 15 mΩ when filled with high K+ extracellular recording solution. An agar bridge containing an Ag/AgCl pellet and 3% agar in buffer solution was used as a ground. Single-channel currents were recorded using an EPC-9 (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) patch clamp amplifier at a bandwidth of 3 kHz and were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter (model 902LPF, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and sampled at 5 kHz using PULSE software (44Gillis K.D. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Data were acquired and stored using an A/D converter and a Dell computer. Single-channel conductances were obtained from I/V plots. Each patch was recorded at a given voltage from -80 to +60 for 5 s. Solutions–The high-calcium bath solution contained (in mm) 135 Na+ gluconate, 5 K+ gluconate, 2.2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 15 HEPES. The high-K+ extracellular recording solution contained (in mm) 140 K+ gluconate, 2.2 CaCl2, 4 EGTA, 4 HEDTA, 1 MgCl2, and 15 HEPES. The 1 μm calcium intracellular recording solution contained (in mm) 140 K+ gluconate, 5 Na+ gluconate, 0.43 CaCl2, 2 HEDTA, 1 MgCl2, and 15 HEPES. Solutions were brought to pH 7.35 with KOH or NaOH as needed. These conditions were optimized for seal formation and patch stability. Planar Bilayer Recording–Single channel recordings were carried out with standard planar bilayer technology (45Alvarez O. Miller C. Ion Channel Reconstitution. Plenum Press, New York1986: 115-130Google Scholar). Binary lipid mixtures of DOPE with PCs (1:1, molar ratio) or SPM (3/2, molar ratio) were initially dissolved in chloroform. The solvent was removed by evaporation with a N2 stream and then the dried lipid film was resuspended in decane to form a final total lipid concentration of 25 mg/ml. The bilayer was formed by painting the lipid solution across a 250-μm aperture in a Delrin bilayer chamber (model CD-P250 from Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Bilayer capacitance was monitored by noting the current across the bilayer in response to a triangle wave (10 mV/25 ms). Membrane suspensions containing crude membrane fragments (0.2-0.5 μl) were directed to the bilayer in the cis chamber with a micropipette. The cytoplasmic cis solution contained: 300 mm KCl, 1.03 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm HEDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The free Ca2+ was measured with a Ca2+ electrode to be about 20 μm. Ca2+ standard solutions were from World Precision Instruments (Sarasota, FL). Additional drops of 0.1 m HEDTA were added to the cis chamber to lower free Ca2+ concentration so that a low nPo could be achieved. This allowed us to study ethanol potentiation of BKCa channels in lipid bilayers of POPE/POPS and SPM/DOPE. The recording solutions were modified from those used in the patch experiments to obtain stable bilayer recordings and the free Ca2+ concentrations were chosen to get a modest channel open probability (Po). Alcohol was added as pure ethanol to the cis buffer in amounts necessary to reach the desired 50 mm concentration. Vigorous mixing of the buffer solutions was achieved by continuous stirring of both chambers with a stir bar at its full power (Sun Stir3 from Warner Instruments). The extracellular (trans) solution in the inner chamber contained: 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm HEDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Single channel currents were recorded with a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-9, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) (44Gillis K.D. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The trans chamber was connected to ground and all voltages in the cis chamber was expressed relative to ground. The holding potential was usually at 20 mV unless stated otherwise. At least 1 min of recording was taken as a control after insertion to ensure stable channel activity before application of ethanol. Continuous recordings were taken after the application of ethanol to obtain the time course of the ethanol response. All experiments were done at room temperature (22 °C). To evaluate potential changes in ethanol concentration during the recordings, 100-μl aliquots of buffer were removed at 1, 4, 7, and 10 min after application. Ethanol concentration was determined with the alcohol dehydrogenase assay following the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma). Briefly, NAD-alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma) was re-suspended in 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer (Sigma) and aliquoted. Samples of recording buffer solution, along with ethanol standard dilutions, were added to the buffer, incubated for 30 min in room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 340-nm. Calculation of ethanol concentrations was performed according to the manufacturer's formula using the dilution curve of known ethanol concentrations. nPo was calculated as an index of steady-state channel activity from the all points histogram and the number of channels (n) in the recording and the open channel probability (Po) as described elsewhere (24Dopico A.M. Lemos J.R. Treistman S.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 40-48PubMed Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. All analyses were done with TAC and TAC-fit programs (Bruxton Corp., Seattle, WA). Recordings of BKCa channel activity were obtained in both membrane patches pulled from transfected HEK cells, and after their extraction and incorporation into an artificial bilayer. Fig. 1 illustrates the experimental paradigm. BKCa Channels Expressed in HEK Cells Develop Acute Tolerance to Ethanol–The identity of stably expressed BKCa channels was confirmed by examining the single channel currents recorded in inside-out membrane patches, using symmetric 140 mm K+ solutions (Fig. 2). First, the single channel current observed was voltage dependent at a fixed internal free-Ca2+ concentration (1 μm). Channel activity increased with depolarization (Fig. 2A). Second, I-V plots of single channel current versus membrane holding potential yield a large average unitary conductance of 267 ± 14 pS (n = 10) (Fig. 2B). And finally, at a given holding potential, the nPo increases as the internal free-Ca2+ concentration is increased (data not shown). These properties are all consistent with the presence of the expressed BKCa channel. Our experimental design provides the ability to monitor the BKCa channel response to alcohol in an native excised membrane patch and again, after being reconstituted in an artificial bilayer (46Ewald D.A. Williams A. Levitan I.B. Nature. 1985; 315: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The responses to ethanol in an excised inside-out patch from a transfected HEK cell are shown in Fig. 3. These patches are thought to retain a relatively complex membrane composition and architecture, as well as any associated cytoskeletal and sub-bilayer structures. Patches were first exposed to the intracellular recording buffer solution ([Ca2+]free = 1 μm) without ethanol for 3 min to determine a stable control value for steady-state channel activity nPo (preethanol). Then the patch was exposed to the buffer solution with 50 mm ethanol for 15 min. On average, acute exposure of the cytosolic side of I/O patches to 50 mm ethanol increased channel activity (nPo) to a maximum potentiation of ∼300% in 2 to 3 min after ethanol exposure. This activation gradually relaxed and channel activity returned to pre-ethanol levels within 15 min (Fig. 3B) in the continued presence of the drug (closed symbols). In control recordings (open symbols), channel activity remained relatively constant indicating that the time course of activation and tolerance seen with the drug is a function of the response of the protein complex to alcohol. BKCa Channels Reconstituted in POPE/POPS Bilayers Exhibit Acute Tolerance–To examine whether the BKCa channel displays acute tolerance in artificial membranes, BKCa channels extracted from transfected HEK cells were reconstituted into POPE/POPS bilayers. POPE/POPS forms a negatively charged lipid bilayer and has been used in previous studies (13Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Chu B. Dopico A.M. Lemos J.R. Treistman S.N. Mol.

The extracted channel protein has been shown to shed native lipids, and to be dominated by the composition of the artificial bilayer lipids into which it is incorporated (13Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Chu B. Dopico A.M. Lemos J.R. Treistman S.N. Mol.

The BKCa channels recorded in POPE/POPS bilayers showed an average conductance (γ) of 335 ± 4pS (n = 6) and an average single channel Po of 0.637 ± 0.078 (n = 6), in recordings with asymmetric KCl concentrations (300/150 mm, cis/trans); 20 μm Ca2+free, and a holding potential of +20 mV. To observe activation by ethanol, and to avoid a potential ceiling effect, the initial channel activity was reduced by decreasing the free Ca2+ to a final concentration of 5-8 μm by the addition of 0.1 mm HEDTA (40Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The addition of ethanol (to a final concentration of 50 mm) quickly increased the channel steady-state activity (nPo) in POPE/POPS bilayers (see Fig. 4A), as was seen earlier (13Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The time course of the ethanol response showed, on average, a peak in 2 to 3 min after exposure to ethanol. The nPo ratio (peak ethanol/control response) indicated about 300% potentiation (see Fig. 4B, closed symbols). Channel activity then rapidly diminished to only a 30-40% potentiation after 10 min of continuous exposure. Control experiments without the addition of ethanol indicated that fluctuations in channel activity were well below 30% of baseline activity over this duration (Fig. 4B, open symbols). Ethanol is a volatile agent and can pass through lipid bilayers within seconds (47Ly H.V. Longo M.L. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1013-1033Abstract Full Text Full T"
https://openalex.org/W1983954282,"Caspase-9 plays a critical role in the initiation of apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. Activation of caspase-9 is inhibited by phosphorylation at Thr125 by ERK1/2 MAPKs in response to growth factors. Here, we show that phosphorylation of this site is specific for these classical MAPKs and is not strongly induced when JNK and p38α/β MAPKs are activated by anisomycin. By deletion and mutagenic analysis, we identify domains in caspase-9 and ERK2 that mediate their interaction. Binding of ERK2 to caspase-9 and subsequent phosphorylation of caspase-9 requires a basic docking domain (D domain) in the N-terminal prodomain of the caspase. Mutational analysis of ERK2 reveals a 157TTCD160 motif required for recognition of caspase-9 that acts independently of the putative common docking domain. Molecular modeling supports the conclusion that Arg10 in the D domain of caspase-9 interacts with Asp160 in the TTCD motif of ERK2. Differences in the TTCD motif in other MAPK family members could account for the selective recognition of caspase-9 by ERK1/2. This selectivity may be important for the antiapoptotic role of classical MAPKs in contrast to the proapoptotic roles of stress-activated MAPKs.

This selectivity may be important for the antiapoptotic role of classical MAPKs in contrast to the proapoptotic roles of stress-activated MAPKs. Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of cell death that plays a fundamental role in development and tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar). Caspases, a family of cysteine aspartyl proteases, play a central role in the implementation of apoptosis (2Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens (procaspases) that are activated by oligomerization and/or proteolytic processing to form active enzymes in response to apoptotic stimuli (2Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stress or damage signals, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol, where it binds to Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) and induces its oligomerization (3Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6217) Google Scholar, 4Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). This leads to the recruitment of procaspase-9, promoting its dimerization, activation, and autocatalytic processing (5Pop C. Timmer J. Sperandio S. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 269-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 6Yin Q. Park H.H. Chung J.Y. Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. da Graca L.S. Jiang X. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 then initiates a proteolytic cascade, cleaving and activating downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7. These effector caspases further promote cytochrome c release in a positive feedback mechanism and directly catalyze the cleavage of key structural and regulatory proteins that results in the morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptotic cell death (7Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). Signal transduction pathways activated by extracellular and intracellular stimuli can impinge on the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and control cell fate. Abnormal or constitutive activation of cell signaling pathways may lead to tumorigenesis through inappropriate suppression of cell death (8Lowe S.W. Cepero E. Evan G. Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 9Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). One important control point of apoptosis targeted by cell signaling pathways downstream of cytochrome c release is at the level of the apoptosome (10Schafer Z.T. Kornbluth S. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Several signal transduction pathways modulate apoptosome function through phosphorylation of caspase-9 or Apaf-1 (11Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E.

ERK1/2 are classical MAPKs that are activated mainly by growth factors or mitogenic stimuli. They form part of the larger MAPK family that also includes the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 kinases, which are activated by a variety of cellular stresses as well as extracellular stimuli (15Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Individual MAPKs have different biological functions that are determined not only by their selective activation in response to different stimuli but also by their distinct substrates (16Pramanik R. Qi X. Borowicz S. Choubey D. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4831-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All MAPKs preferentially catalyze the phosphorylation of substrates containing the minimal consensus sequence Ser/Thr-Pro, which is recognized by the active site of the kinase (17Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional interactions are mediated by docking motifs in substrates, often located distant from the site of phosphorylation, which provide high affinity and selective recognition by particular MAPKs (18Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In general, activation of ERK MAPKs is associated with suppression of apoptosis, whereas JNK and p38 MAPKs are involved in the induction of apoptosis (20Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5031) Google Scholar). Although these roles may depend on cell type and stimulus and are likely to be integrated with the control of cell growth and the cell division cycle, which may even have antagonistic effects on cell survival, this suggests that distinct MAPKs are likely to have different effects on proteins involved in the control of apoptosis, such as caspase-9. Here, we have investigated the recognition of caspase-9 by MAPKs. We show that Thr125 in caspase-9 is selectively phosphorylated by ERK1/2 but not JNK or p38α/β. We identify a basic docking motif (D domain) in the prodomain of caspase-9 that regulates the binding and phosphorylation of caspase-9 by ERK1/2. We also demonstrate a requirement for a TTCD motif in ERK2, which is not conserved in p38 or JNK, for mediating efficient phosphorylation of caspase-9. Molecular modeling indicates that there is a direct interaction between the D domain of caspase-9 and the TTCD motif in ERK2. These findings uncover the molecular basis for the selective phosphorylation and regulation of caspase-9 by ERK1/2, providing a mechanism by which ERK1/2 may selectively suppress apoptosis in contrast to JNK and p38α/β MAPKs. Plasmid Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis–Human caspase-9 was amplified from U2OS cells and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To replace serine residues in caspase-9 with alanine residues, we used the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) as indicated by the manufacturers. The mutations were verified by sequence analysis. For expression of recombinant proteins, cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of recombinant proteins was induced in Escherichia coli BLR (DE3) at 30 °C for 2 h by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins were affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) before elution in buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg ml–1 each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) containing 100 mm glutathione. Glutathione was removed by filtration through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Constructs for HA-tagged rat ERK (HA-ERK2 wild type, HA-D319N-ERK2) and GST-RSK-D2 were provided by Dr. J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Additional HA-ERK2 constructs were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Antibodies and Reagents–The following antibodies were used for Western blotting according to standard protocols: caspase-9 (Pharmigen, San Diego, CA); phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-p38 and p38, phospho-c-Jun, phospho-MAPKAPK-2 Thr222 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); ERK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); and GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). A sheep polyclonal antibody was generated against His-tagged caspase-9 C287A protein and affinity-purified on a GST-caspase-9 C287A column. A rabbit polyclonal phosphospecific antibody, p-Casp-9 (Thr125), was raised and purified as described previously (12Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies for Western blots were goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) or donkey anti-sheep IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins, an anti-HA-agarose conjugate was purchased from Sigma. Other Chemicals–Okadaic acid, epidermal growth factor, UO126, and G418 sulfate were purchased from Calbiochem. SB 203580 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Ponasterone A was obtained from AXXORA (Nottingham, UK). Zeocin was purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). PD184352 and active GST-ERK2 were gifts from Prof. D. Alessi (University of Dundee). Active His-ERK2 was a gift from Prof. S. Keyse (University of Dundee). Cell Extracts–HeLa cell cytosolic (S100) extracts were purchased from Cilbiotech (Mons, Belgium) and were supplied in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at a protein concentration of 8–12 mg ml–1. Phosphorylation of Recombinant GST-Caspase-9–0.5 μg of GST-caspase-9, inactivated by mutation of the catalytic cysteine (C287A), including proteins with additional residues changed in the N-terminal region, was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with active His-ERK2 in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 6 × 106 cpm nmol–1). The reaction was terminated by the addition of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Peptide Competition Assay–Recombinant GST-caspase-9 (0.5 μg) was incubated with purified active His-ERK2 and [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C in 15 μl of kinase buffer with the indicated concentrations of wild type peptide (ADRRLLRRCRLRLV), the R10A peptide (ADRRLLARCRLRLV), the R10A/R11A peptide (ADRRLLAACRLRLV), and an unrelated control peptide R-DIS (CPKSKKVKVSHRSHST). Caspase-9 phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Gels were analyzed by staining with Coomassie Blue for visualization of caspase-9 to verify equal amounts in the reaction. For quantification of phosphorylation, protein bands were excised and analyzed by scintillation counting. Experiments were conducted three times, and a representative data set is shown. GST Pull-down Assay–0.5 μg of GST-caspase-9 C287A, including proteins with additional residues changed in the N-terminal region, was incubated in HeLa cytosolic S100 extract with 1 μm okadaic acid for 60 min. GST proteins were recovered on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm, NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate) before boiling in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to ERK1/2, phospho-Thr125 caspase-9 or GST as indicated. Inducible Expression of Caspase-9 in Cells–cDNAs of human caspase-9 (wild type or alanine-mutated at arginine 10) were subcloned into the pIND expression plasmid before cotransfection of recombinant pIND and pVgRXR into U2OS cells, in which we have previously characterized the regulation of caspase-9 by ERK1/2 (12Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg ml–1 penicillin/streptomycin together with 500 μg ml–1 zeocin and 800 ng ml–1 G418 sulfate. Transcriptional expression of exogenous caspase-9 was induced with the indicated concentrations of ponasterone A (AXXORA, Nottingham, UK). ERK2 Kinase Assay–Transfections of HEK293 cells were performed using 10 μg of CsCl-purified HA-ERK2 plasmid DNA and 60 μl of Superfect according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). After 3 h, culture medium was replaced with medium containing 10% serum. 20 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight before being stimulated with 50 ng ml–1 EGF for 5 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μg ml–1 leupeptin, 1 μg ml–1 aprotinin, 1 μg ml–1 pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μm okadaic acid) and HA-ERK2 immunoprecipitated with 40 μl of anti-HA agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in lysis buffer. The washed beads were mixed with substrates in a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6 × 106 cpm nmol–1) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For quantification of phosphorylation, protein bands were excised and analyzed by scintillation counting. To ensure that differences in phosphorylation of caspase-9 and RSK by mutagenesis of ERK2 were not due to differences in kinase activity caused by mutation, quantification of phosphorylation was calculated taking into account any differences in activity toward myelin basic protein (MBP). Molecular Modeling–Two Protein Data Bank structures, the caspase-9 prodomain (21Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.

Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), a fully automatic docking software program that first docked the proteins based only on the shape complementarity (no electrostatics) and retained the top 20,000 structures. The complexes generated from the docking step were then rapidly screened, and the desolvation and electrostatic energies were calculated. The top 1500 electrostatic conformations and the top 500 desolvation conformations were kept for further analysis. For each of the 2000 conformations retained in the filtering stage, the best 10 were determined using a clustering algorithm that scores them based on free energy landscape calculations. PyMOL software (DeLano Scientific) was used to render models. Caspase-9 Is Phosphorylated at Thr125 in Cells by ERK1/2 but Not by JNK or p38 MAPKs–We have previously established that ERK1/2 directly phosphorylate and inhibit caspase-9 at a single major site, Thr125 (12Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We were interested to determine if other members of the MAPK family might also phosphorylate caspase-9 in cells. We transfected HEK293 cells with caspase-9 and stimulated them for 60 min with anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor that activates the JNK pathway (25Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) and all isoforms of p38 MAPK (26Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although anisomycin stimulated the phosphorylation of both JNK at sites associated with its activation and its downstream target c-Jun, showing that the JNK pathway was indeed activated, no increase in phosphorylation of caspase-9 at Thr125 was detected (Fig. 1A). By contrast, stimulation by the phorbol ester TPA resulted in ERK1/2 activation and subsequent phosphorylation of caspase-9 at Thr125, as expected. TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and caspase-9 were blocked by co-incubation with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352, which had no effect on the JNK pathway and specifically blocks the activation of ERK1/2 at this concentration (27Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Anisomycin also activated the p38/SAP2K pathway in transfected HEK293 cells, resulting in phosphorylation of both p38 and the downstream substrate MAPKAP kinase-2. As expected, phosphorylation of MAPKAP kinase-2 was completely inhibited by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38α and p38β. SB203580 also partially inhibited phosphorylation of p38 itself, as previously described for the β-isoform (28Kuma Y. Campbell D.G. Cuenda A. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Kuma Y. Sabio G. Bain J. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Cuenda A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19472-19479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, no significant phosphorylation of caspase-9 at Thr125 occurred when p38 was stimulated (Fig. 1B). TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of caspase-9 at Thr125 was completely inhibited by PD184352 but not by SB203580. Together these results show that caspase-9 is selectively phosphorylated in cells by ERK1/2 but not by JNK or p38α/β MAPKs. A Putative ERK Docking Site in the N-terminal Domain of Caspase-9–We wished to elucidate the mechanism by which ERK1/2 specifically recognize and phosphorylate caspase-9. A clue was uncovered with the observation that phosphorylation of caspase-9 by recombinant ERK2 was substantially reduced upon removal of the first 79 amino acids of the prodomain region of caspase-9 (Fig. 2A). We therefore examined the sequence of caspase-9 in this region for potential ERK1/2 docking motifs that might promote recognition of the substrate. We identified amino acids 6–16 of caspase-9 as a putative MAPK docking motif known as a D domain or kinase interaction motif (KIM), which is characterized as a cluster of basic residues often situated N-terminal to a hydrophobic motif containing Leu, Ile, or Val separated by one amino acid, denoted ϕA-X-ϕB (where ϕ is a small hydrophobic amino acid) (30Yang S.H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 31Liu S. Sun J.P. Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5326-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Related sequences are found in a number of classical MAPK-interacting proteins, including substrates, regulators, and scaffolding proteins (Fig. 2B). This motif lies within the prodomain of caspase-9, which also contains a CARD region that is involved in interactions with Apaf-1 (Fig. 2C). Requirement of the D Domain of Caspase-9 for Binding and Phosphorylation by Endogenous ERK1/2–To determine if this motif forms part of an ERK1/2 docking site (D domain), we mutated to alanine three residues in the basic cluster (arginines 7, 10, and 11) or two hydrophobic residues (leucines 14 and 16) that might form the ϕA-X-ϕB motif and tested the effect on phosphorylation by purified ERK2 of recombinant caspase-9 expressed as fusions with GST (Fig. 3A). In an in vitro kinase assay under conditions where phosphorylation was linear with respect to time, wild type caspase-9 was phosphorylated by ERK2, and this phosphorylation was dependent on Thr125, the site of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the triple arginine mutant (R7A/R10A/R11A) at Thr125 was strongly reduced compared with the wild type protein, whereas the double leucine mutation (L14A/L16A) only slightly reduced phosphorylation. This indicates that the one or more basic amino acids within this region of caspase-9 are important for recognition by ERK2. To examine whether the D domain of caspase-9 is required for the binding and phosphorylation by endogenous ERK1/2 under nearly physiological conditions, we tested the phosphorylation of recombinant caspase-9 in cell extracts that reproduce the regulation of caspase-9 in vitro (12Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that incubation of such extracts with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A phosphatases, induces activation of endogenous ERK1/2 and phosphorylation of caspase-9 at Thr125 (12Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that GST-caspase-9 (WT) recovered from cell extracts was phosphorylated on Thr125 in response to treatment with OA (Fig. 3B). Coprecipitation of ERK1/2 with caspase-9 was also stimulated by OA. Interestingly, mutation of the Thr125 phosphorylation site to the nonphosphorylatable amino acid alanine resulted in an increase in ERK1/2 binding. These results suggest that the interaction of ERK1/2 with caspase-9 is likely to be promoted by the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2, whereas subsequent phosphorylation of the substrate destabilizes the interaction. Phosphorylation of caspase-9 at Thr125 was strongly reduced by mutation of basic residues of the D domain to Ala (R7A/R10A/R11A), and this decrease in phosphorylation correlated with loss of ERK1/2 binding to caspase-9 containing Thr125 and a substantial decrease in binding to the T125A mutant, demonstrating that the basic residues in the D domain play an important role in the binding and phosphorylation of caspase-9 by ERK1/2 in cell extracts. To investigate the sequence requirements of the D domain in more detail, residues were individually mutated to Ala, and recombinant proteins were purified for use as substrates (Fig. 4). Mutation of Arg-10 had a strong inhibitory effect, with Leu9 and Arg11 substantially reducing phosphorylation, indicating that these residues are particularly important for the recognition of caspase-9 by ERK2. Mutation of the hydrophobic residues Leu14 and Leu16 also partially inhibited caspase-9 phosphorylation but not as strongly as mutations of the basic residues Arg10 and Arg11. Peptides Mimicking the Docking Site Specifically Inhibit Phosphorylation of Caspase-9 by ERK2–As an additional test of the putative docking site in caspase-9, we tested the ability of peptides mimicking the motif to interfere with the phosphorylation of caspase-9 by ERK2. Three peptides were derived from the sequence of amino acid residues 4–17 in caspase-9. WT peptide contained Arg10 and Arg11, apparently key residues in the docking domain of caspase-9, whereas one or both of these sites were mutated to Ala in peptides R10A and R10A/R11A, respectively. An unrelated peptide (R-DIS) was used as an additional control (Fig. 5A). Increasing concentrations of WT peptide were found to inhibit phosphorylation of caspase-9 by ERK2, whereas peptide R10A inhibited to a lesser extent (Fig. 5B). Peptide R10A/R11A produced very poor inhibition of phosphorylation, confirming the importance of these residues in the interaction of caspase-9 with ERK2. Together with mutational analysis of caspase-9, these results confirm the role of the D domain in caspase-9 for its recognition and phosphorylation by ERK2 in vitro. The D Domain of Caspase-9 Is Essential for Mediating Phosphorylation by ERK1/2 in Cells–We extended this work on the role of docking interactions for regulating caspase-9 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 to studies on intact cells. In initial experiments, we failed to observe any necessity for the docking site for the phosphorylation of caspase-9 at Thr125 in cell lines transiently expressing caspase-9 (data not shown). However, since docking domains are thought to work by increasing the efficiency and specificity of phosphorylation by kinases, we were concerned that strong overexpression of caspase-9 and therefore a greatly increased substrate concentration may have swamped this level of regulation. We therefore opted for an inducible system that permitted expression of wild type caspase-9 and docking site mutants in cells at levels resembling that of the endogenous protein. Selective antibiotics were used to isolate human U2OS cell lines stably expressing the construct for either WT caspase-9 or docking site mutant caspase-9 (R10A). Expression of exogenous proteins was stimulated with increasing concentrations of the inducing agent ponasterone A (Pon A) (Fig. 6A). The exogenous caspase-9 proteins were HA-tagged to discriminate from endogenous caspase-9 and to allow their specific retrieval by immunoprecipitation. A concentration of 2.5 μm ponasterone A for 24 h was chosen, since this induced caspase-9 to levels comparable with those of the endoge"

We identified a novel fusion between NUP98 and IQ motif containing G (IQCG) gene from a de novo acute T-lymphoid/myeloid leukemia harboring t(3;11)(q29q13;p15)del(3)(q29). IQCG has two putative coiled-coil domains and one IQ domain. The FG repeat from NUP98 and the coiled-coil domain from IQCG were retained in the fusion protein. We demonstrated that NUP98-IQCG could form homodimer, heterodimerize with NUP98 or IQCG, bind co-activators and/or co-repressors, and show transcriptional activity in vitro. Expression of NUP98-IQCG inhibited 32Dcl3 cell apoptosis induced by Ara-C, and partially blocked granulocyte differentiation induced by G-CSF. Colony-forming assay and serial replating assays indicated that NUP98-IQCG was able to stimulate proliferation, partially block differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells but was unable to confer transformation alone. Taken together, our data indicate that newly identified NUP98-IQCG fusion protein may play an essential role in leukemogenesis, but by itself may not be sufficient to induce leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2001887062,"Eicosanoid production by macrophages is an early response to microbial infection that promotes acute inflammation. The intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes stimulates arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid production from resident mouse peritoneal macrophages through activation of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2alpha). The ability of wild type L. monocytogenes (WTLM) to stimulate arachidonic acid release is partially dependent on the virulence factor listeriolysin O; however, WTLM and L. monocytogenes lacking listeriolysin O (DeltahlyLM) induce similar levels of cyclooxygenase 2. Arachidonic acid release requires activation of MAPKs by WTLM and DeltahlyLM. The attenuated release of arachidonic acid that is observed in TLR2-/- and MyD88-/- macrophages infected with WTLM and DeltahlyLM correlates with diminished MAPK activation. WTLM but not DeltahlyLM increases intracellular calcium, which is implicated in regulation of cPLA2alpha. Prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin I2, and leukotriene C4 are produced by cPLA2alpha+/+ but not cPLA2alpha-/- macrophages in response to WTLM and DeltahlyLM. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production is significantly lower in cPLA2alpha+/+ than in cPLA2alpha-/- macrophages infected with WTLM and DeltahlyLM. Treatment of infected cPLA2alpha+/+ macrophages with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin increases TNFalpha production to the level produced by cPLA2alpha-/- macrophages implicating prostaglandins in TNFalpha down-regulation. Therefore activation of cPLA2alpha in macrophages may impact immune responses to L. monocytogenes."

https://openalex.org/W2039060736,"Many cancer cells display down-regulated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen (MHC-I), which seems to enable them to evade immune surveillance, whereas the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that ligand (CXCL12) stimulation of CXCR4, a major chemokine receptor expressed in many malignant cancer cells, induced MHC-I heavy chain down-regulation from the cell surface of the human epithelioid carcinoma HeLa cells, the human U251 and U87 glioblastoma cells, the human MDA-MD 231 breast cancer cells, and the human SK-N-BE (2) neuroblastoma cells. Activation of CXCR4 also induced MHC-I down-regulation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The internalized MHC-I heavy chain molecules were partially co-localized with Rab7, a later endosomal marker. Activation of CXCR4 induced ubiquitination of MHC-I heavy chain, and mutation of the C-terminal two lysine residues (Lys-332, Lys-337) on one of the MHC-I alleles, HLA.B7, blocked CXCR4-evoked ubiquitination and down-regulation of HLA.B7. Moreover, purified GST-conjugated CXCR4 C terminus directly associated with the purified His-tagged β2-microglobulin (β2M), and MHC-I heavy chain was co-immunoprecipitated with CXCR4 in a β2M-dependent manner. This interaction appears to be critical for CXCR4-evoked down-regulation of MHC-I heavy chain as evidenced by the data that MHC-I heavy chain down-regulation was inhibited by either truncation of the CXCR4 C terminus or knockdown of β2M. All together, these findings shed new light on the role of CXCR4 in tumor evasion of immune surveillance via inducing MHC-I down-regulation from the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2031651146,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and homeostasis of the prostate and in prostate cancer. The transcriptional activity of AR is mediated by interaction with multiple co-activators, which serve in chromatin modification or remodeling, or provide a link between specific and general transcription factors. We have identified zipper interacting protein (ZIP) kinase as a novel transcriptional co-activator of the AR. ZIP kinase enhanced expression of AR-responsive promotor/luciferase reporter constructs in a hormone- and kinase-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained for glucocorticoid receptor but not for progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor. Following hormone treatment, AR and ZIP kinase formed physical complexes and associated with the promoter and enhancer of the prostate-specific antigen gene, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Strikingly, depletion of ZIP kinase by siRNA led to significant reduction of AR-mediated transactivation. The interaction of ZIP kinase with AR seems to be mediated in part by apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor and in part by direct binding. Interestingly, AR was not phosphorylated by ZIP kinase in vitro, suggesting that it phosphorylates other co-activators or chromatin proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2037176049,"When administrated by isolated limb perfusion, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is an efficient antitumor agent that improves drug penetration and destroys angiogenic vessels. Moreover, the pronounced potentiation of TNFα-induced apoptosis by NF-κB inhibitors suggest that these compounds could enhance TNFα antitumor efficacy through direct induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Therefore, attempts at amplifying signaling pathways that mediate TNFα antitumor effects could help to design combination therapies improving its efficiency. We report that nanomolar concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) amplify TNFα-induced apoptosis in APL cells expressing a specific repressor of NF-κB activation. This effect is abolished by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk and by caspase-8 and -9 inhibitors. Cell death is accompanied by a drop of mitochondrial potential and by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation. Using specific PARP-1 inhibitors and siRNAs, we show that PARP-1 is essential for the synergistic apoptotic effect and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activation triggered by the ATRA/TNFα combination. JNK1 siRNAs reduce ATRA/TNFα-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and caspase-9 activation. Altogether, these results identify a novel mechanism of PARP-1-induced apoptosis, in which JNK1 provides a link between PARP-1 activation and mitochondrial pathway of caspase-9 activation. This study also suggests that inclusion of nanomolar doses of ATRA could be clinically beneficial in amplifying TNFα-induced antitumor signals."

https://openalex.org/W2084588783,"Colicin D import into Escherichia coli requires an interaction via its TonB box with the energy transducer TonB. Colicin D cytotoxicity is inhibited by specific tonB mutations, but it is restored by suppressor mutations in the TonB box. Here we report that there is a second site of interaction between TonB and colicin D, which is dependent upon a 45-amino acid region, within the uncharacterized central domain of colicin D. In addition, the 8th amino acids of colicin D (a glycine) and colicin B (a valine), adjacent to their TonB boxes, are also required for TonB recognition, suggesting that high affinity complex formation involves multiple interactions between these colicins and TonB. The central domain also contributes to the formation of the immunity complex, as well as being essential for uptake and thus killing. Colicin D is normally secreted in association with the immunity protein, and this complex involves the following two interactions: a major interaction with the C-terminal tRNase domain and a second interaction involving the central domain of colicin D and, most probably, the α4 helix of ImmD, which is on the opposite side of ImmD compared with the major interface. In contrast, formation of the immunity complex with the processed cytotoxic domain, the form expected to be found in the cytoplasm after colicin D uptake, requires only the major interaction. Klebicin D has, like colicin D, a ribonuclease activity toward tRNAArg and a central domain, which can form a complex with ImmD but which does not function in TonB-mediated transport. Colicin D import into Escherichia coli requires an interaction via its TonB box with the energy transducer TonB.

Klebicin D has, like colicin D, a ribonuclease activity toward tRNAArg and a central domain, which can form a complex with ImmD but which does not function in TonB-mediated transport. Colicins are plasmid-encoded cytotoxins released by Escherichia coli under conditions of stress, which kill competing bacteria that are not immune to their effect. Colicinogenic strains are resistant to both exogenous and endogenous colicin molecules because of the constitutive production of an immunity protein (Imm) (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Sci. 1984; 1: 168-175PubMed Google Scholar). Most colicins have a similar organization of functional domains as follows: an N-terminal part required for translocation across the outer membrane, a central region necessary for binding to the target cell surface receptor and a C-terminal domain encoding the killing function (2Braun V. Pilsl H. Gross P. Arch. Microbiol. 1994; 161: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of many natural chimeric colicins and the possibility of obtaining hybrid colicins by recombination suggest that colicin evolution is in part based on the exchange and mixing of similar domains from heterologous colicins or bacteriophages (2Braun V.

The major killing functions are either a nuclease activity (RNase or DNase), which functions in the cytoplasm, or a lethal pore-forming function that affects the inner membrane. Colicin B is an ionophoric toxin. Colicin D is an RNase, which cleaves specifically each of the four arginine isoaccepting tRNAs, thereby preventing protein synthesis (7Tomita K. Ogawa T. Uozumi T. Watanabe K. Masaki H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8278-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the heterodimer complex formed between the colicin D cytotoxic domain and its cognate immunity protein showed that ImmD mimics the tRNA substrate backbone, thereby protecting colicin-producer cells against colicin molecules (8Graille M. Mora L. Buckingham R.H. Van Tilbeurgh H. de Zamaroczy M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1474-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although they have different lethal activities, colicins B and D are 96% identical in their 313-residue-long N-terminal domains, which are required for entry into target cells (7Tomita K. Ogawa T.

Both colicins parasitize the same outer membrane, high affinity iron-siderophore receptor FepA and use the energy-transducing TonB/ExbB-D pathway to enter the cell. Thus, they make use of natural functions of the target cell before killing it (11Pugsley A.P. Reeves P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Braun V. Patzer S.I. Hantke K. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Devanathan S. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The concept of a combined N-terminal domain, required for receptor binding and translocation, is supported by the crystal structure of colicin B (55 kDa), in which a single 74-Å-long helix separates the N-terminal domain and C-terminal killing domain (14Hilsenbeck J.L. Park H. Chen G. Youn B. Postle K. Kang C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, in comparison with colicin B, the 75-kDa colicin D possesses an additional specific central domain (CD) 2The abbreviations used are: CDcentral domainMISmajor interaction surfaceSISsecondary interaction surface. 2The abbreviations used are: CDcentral domainMISmajor interaction surfaceSISsecondary interaction surface. of 280 amino acids of unknown function (10de Zamaroczy M. Buckingham R.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The recently reported phage-associated klebicin D, produced by Klebsiella oxytoca, was suggested to be a member of the family of tRNase bacteriocins on the basis of the similarity of its killing domain with that of the tRNase colicin D. Interestingly, the similarity includes its central region, which is reminiscent of the CD of colicin D (4Chavan M. Rafi H. Wertz J. Goldstone C. Riley M.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 60: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The complex TonB-ExbB-D transduces conformationally stored potential energy, derived from the proton motive force of the inner membrane, to the outer membrane receptor FepA, which is responsible for the uptake of an iron-chelator complex, the ferric-enterobactin (15Faraldo-Gomez J.D.

Active transport is driven by the TonB protein interacting with the “TonB box” sequence, located near the N terminus of the FepA cork domain (19Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3350-3357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For several TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors, like BtuB, FhuA, and FecA, substrate binding enhances their interaction with TonB (21Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1870-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A conformational change was shown to occur in the region of the TonB box, when the receptors were liganded with their substrates, probably as a result of exposing the TonB box to the periplasmic space (24Ferguson A.D.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of FepA is compatible with a putative release of the flexible TonB box sequence toward the periplasm, upon the binding of ferric enterobactin, thus promoting the interaction with TonB (29Buchanan S.K. Smith B.S. Venkatramani L. Xia D. Esser L. Palnitkar M. Chakraborty R. van der Helm D. Deisenhofer J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Deletions of the TonB box in FhuA receptor were shown to abolish all TonB-dependent transport functions, including the sensitivity to colicin M, a toxin inhibiting murein biosynthesis (30Endriss F. Braun M. Killmann H. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4683-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).“TonB box-like” consensus sequences have been described at the N terminus of TonB-dependent colicins (12Braun V. Patzer S.I.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Certain mutations affecting the five-amino acid TonB box of colicins B or M completely abolished their toxicity. Suppressor mutations were found at or around residue 160 in TonB, which partially restored the toxicity to some colicin B or M derivatives, carrying a TonB-uncoupling mutation in the TonB box (32Bell P.E. Nau C.D. Brown J.T. Konisky J. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3826-3829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mende J. Braun V. Mol.

Genet. 1993; 240: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Spontaneous tonB mutations, R158S or P161L (mutant strains D1 and K19, respectively), completely abolished colicin D toxicity but not that of colicin B (31Mora L. Diaz N. Buckingham R.H. de Zamaroczy M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) nor FepA-dependent siderophore uptake. These same amino acids have recently been shown to be required for the interaction with the TonB box of the outer membrane receptor FhuA or BtuB (35Pawelek P.D. Croteau N. Ng-Thow-Hing C.

Science. 2006; 312: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The sensitivity to colicin D of these tonB mutants was fully restored by specific suppressor mutations in the TonB box (HTMVV or HSIVV), thus demonstrating that the TonB box is the functional interaction site with TonB (31Mora L. Diaz N. Buckingham R.H. de Zamaroczy M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Here we present a functional study of the CD of colicin D, as it affects the TonB-dependent import mechanism, and with regard to the formation of the colicin D-ImmD immunity complex. We show that both the in vivo toxicity and the inhibition of the catalytic activity tested in vitro are specifically dependent on the CD of colicin D. We present evidence that the CD may be required both for the recognition of the energy transducer TonB, together with the N-terminal part of the molecule, and for formation of the complex with ImmD, together with the C-terminal catalytic domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Growth, and Recombinant DNA Manipulations–E. coli strains D10 (37Pfennig P.L. Flower A.M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and XAC were used as wild-type strains. Strains D1 and K19 carry spontaneous tonB mutations (R158S and P161L, respectively), which abolish colicin D toxicity, but do not affect either the sensitivity to colicin B or the FepA-dependent siderophore uptake (31Mora L. Diaz N. Buckingham R.H. de Zamaroczy M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The medium used was Luria broth (LB) with ampicillin added, if necessary at 100 μg/ml. Standard procedures for recombinant DNA techniques and PAGE were performed as described by Miller (38Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar).Construction of Chimeric or Internally Deleted Colicin Variants–Derivatives carrying internal deletions within colicin D were created by three-step PCR amplifications, employing plasmid pColD, a derivative of pUC18 carrying the whole colicin D operon (cda, cdi, and cdl) (31Mora L. Diaz N. Buckingham R.H. de Zamaroczy M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as template. For example to create the deletion derivative, eliminating the central domain (Arg318-Met590), the first PCR used an upstream 113-mer oligonucleotide (containing the tac promoter and the cda ribosomal binding site, followed by 30 nucleotides of the cda coding sequence starting from the fMet codon) and a downstream oligonucleotide, complementary to cda and starting just before the beginning (Ala317) of the internal deletion. The second PCR amplification used an upstream oligonucleotide that is in part complementary to the downstream oligonucleotide used in the first PCR and is in-frame with the codon at the end of the deletion in cda (Leu591), together with a downstream oligonucleotide, complementary to the stop codon of cdi (encoding ImmD). A denaturation/renaturation step of the mixed first two PCR products led to an annealing between complementary strands of the common amplified central part, bridging the internal deletion. The third PCR amplification using the upstream oligo (1st PCR) and the downstream oligo (2nd PCR) led to the amplification of a linear double-stranded DNA, carrying the internal deletion, which was used as template for protein synthesis. The same three-step PCR amplification technique was used to create hybrids between colicin D/colicin B or colicin D/klebicin D, by employing the plasmid pColB (pUCB19), carrying the whole colicin B operon (cba and cbi) (31Mora L. Diaz N. Buckingham R.H. de Zamaroczy M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), or the plasmid pBS-KlebD, carrying the kdp kda and kdi genes of klebicin D operon (4Chavan M. Rafi H. Wertz J. Goldstone C. Riley M.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 60: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as templates. When necessary, plasmids carrying mutations in the TonB box of colicins D or B were used during the first PCR amplification. This allowed us to test in different N-terminal backgrounds the suppressor effect of mutations HTMVV or HSIVV in the TonB box motif, against the colicin D resistance of tonB mutants D1 (R158S) and K19 (P161L) (12Braun V. Patzer S.I. Hantke K. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Mora L. Diaz N. Buckingham R.H. de Zamaroczy M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) when associated with other mutations (or modifications) in the colicin. The colicin D constructions were expressed in vitro, in a coupled transcription-translation, Zubay-S30 system from E. coli, optimized for linear DNA templates (Promega) at 37 °C for 60 min. The presence of ImmD was verified, and the yield of the wild-type or modified colicins was estimated as comparable (data not shown) in a similar transcription-translation assay performed in the presence of [35S]Met, followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimagery (GE Healthcare) (data not shown). The tRNA hydrolyzing activity of colicin D derivatives was directly measured in the S30 expression samples, by separating the intact and cleaved forms of the tRNAArg on PAGE (10% in the presence of 7 m urea), followed by Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled DNA probe specific for tRNAArg(CCG). In parallel, the same in vitro synthesized colicin D derivatives or hybrid colicin D-ImmD complexes were directly tested for their in vivo cytotoxic activity.Construction of Colicins D and B Molecules Mutated around the TonB Box–Using as template the plasmids pColD(pUC18) or pColB(pUCB19), point mutations switching 1 to 4 amino acids within the N-terminal domain of the colicins were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) in the cda (encoding colicin D) or cba gene (encoding colicin B), in positions 4, 8, 27, and 29, flanking the TonB box, as well as in position 172 of the two colicin N-terminal domains. Two oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation were used, each complementary to opposite strands of the plasmid, to generate the mutant derivatives. The mutated DNAs were subsequently transformed into XL1-Blue super-competent cells, prepared in the presence of 10 mm RbCl. The mutated colicins were produced and then exported into the medium after induction with mitomycin C (200 μg/liter) of C600 strains. The supernatants of the induced cultures were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-4 10K NMWL; Millipore).Construction of Colicins D Molecules Mutated in the Central Domain–Single or double point mutations were introduced into the central domain of colicin D by two-step PCR amplification as described previously (8Graille M. Mora L. Buckingham R.H. Van Tilbeurgh H. de Zamaroczy M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1474-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and they were expressed in vitro (Zubay-S30).Killing Activity Test–The cytotoxicity of wild-type, hybrid, or internally deleted colicins D, as well as colicin D molecules carrying point mutations in the central domain, synthesized in vitro (Zubay-S30), was quantified in vivo by growth inhibition (halo) assay. Undiluted colicins and corresponding 4-fold serial dilutions (5 μl) were spotted onto a lawn of both sensitive wild-type D10 (or XAC) and tonB mutant cells (D1 and K19) on LB plates and then incubated overnight. (Mutated colicins, when produced in vivo (see above), are quantified through 10-fold serial dilutions.) To optimize the binding of colicin derivatives to FepA, the in vivo test was repeated in the presence of the iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl (200 μm), which increases FepA expression. Data were collected in triplicate and averaged.In Vitro Analysis of Internal Cleavage of the Mutated Colicin D-ImmD Complexes by the Leader Peptidase–Mutations were introduced at residues of ImmD helix α4, by two-step PCR amplification as described previously (8Graille M. Mora L. Buckingham R.H. Van Tilbeurgh H. de Zamaroczy M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1474-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The in vitro (Zubay-S30) synthesized [35S]Met-labeled, wild-type or mutated colicin D-ImmD complexes (3 μg) were incubated in a concentrated crude cell extract of E. coli XAC wild-type strain enriched with added purified LepB (0.025 μg) for 1 h at 37 °C, as described previously by de Zamaroczy et al. (39de Zamaroczy M. Mora L. Lecuyer A. Geli V. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Full-sized and cleaved colicin D forms were precipitated with acetone and separated by (8%) SDS-PAGE, and the labeled proteins were detected and quantified by phosphorimagery (GE Healthcare).RESULTSConstruction of Internally Deleted or Hybrid Colicins–The analysis of various chimeric colicins that retain toxicity shows that it is possible to construct colicins by assembly of different functional domains. However, the synthesis of certain colicin hybrids in E. coli was found to produce aggregates in the cytoplasm, or in some cases the colicin derivatives were shown to be more susceptible to degradation when their release into the extracellular medium was impaired (40Frenette M. Benedetti H. Bernadac A. Baty D. Lazdunski C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study we have avoided these problems by the use of hybrid or internally deleted colicins expressed in vitro, which we have then directly tested for both toxicity (in vivo) and catalytic activity (in vitro). Moreover, the in vitro synthesis allows us to test colicin derivatives that are no longer neutralized by the presence of ImmD, and which could not have been expressed in vivo. Hybrid colicin derivatives or molecules carrying internal deletions in cda (the colicin encoding structural gene) were obtained by three-step PCR amplifications, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”The Central Domain of Colicin D Is Required for Toxicity–In a first set of experiments, deletions of the CD of colicin D (amino acids 314-606) were constructed with wild-type or mutated TonB box motifs within the N-terminal domain, as depicted in Fig. 1A. The deletion of the CD of colicin D produced a stable protein Δ1(Arg318-Met590), which had lost all in vivo toxicity, but which retained full tRNase activity in vitro even though the ImmD protein was still synthesized. These results imply that the CD is required for the killing function of colicin D and, moreover, for both the import step and immunity. Deletions within the N-terminal half of the CD, Δ2(Arg318-Met444) and Δ4(Arg318-Glu421), exhibited a decreased level of toxicity on the wild-type strain. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal half of the CD, Δ3(Leu445-Met590), had a severe negative effect on colicin D toxicity, suggesting it is the C-terminal part of the CD that is more required for the import of colicin D into wild-type cells. Although deletions Δ2 and Δ4 are still permissive for colicin D toxicity on wild-type bacteria (Fig. 1A), they are unable to kill the tonB mutant D1 and K19, even in the presence of the suppressor-type TonB box, HTMVV (31Mora L. Diaz N. Buckingham R.H. de Zamaroczy M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as shown for Δ4 (Fig. 1A). The K19 strain, however, has a weak sensitivity to Δ4, carrying the suppressor-type TonB box HSIVV. Two smaller deletions in the CD were also examined. Both Δ5(Arg318-Val376) and Δ6(Trp377-Glu421) are almost fully active on wild-type bacteria. In the presence of the TonB box HSIVV Δ5 restored the toxicity on tonB mutant K19, like the wild-type colicin D molecule. But in the presence of a TonB box HTMVV the toxicity on tonB mutants D1 and K19 was weaker than with the wild-type colicin D molecule. In contrast, Δ6, even carrying a suppressor-type TonB box, is unable to kill the tonB mutants (Fig. 1A). The comparison of deletions carried by Δ4, Δ5, and Δ6 implies that the restoration of colicin D toxicity to mutants D1 and K19 required precisely the presence of region Trp377-Glu421 within the CD, in addition to a suppressor-type TonB box. To validate the involvement of CD in colicin D uptake, 18 residues, located between positions 377 and 421, were mutated to alanine. However, none of them exhibited a toxicity defect on tonB mutants D1 or K19 in the presence of a suppressor-type TonB box (data not shown). This was not really surprising because changes to alanine at the main interaction site of colicin B with TonB (namely affecting the residues of or around the TonB box) did not reduce the toxicity (33Mende J. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consequently, we decided to introduce more dramatic changes. For example, pairs of hydrophobic residues were mutated to charged amino acids and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 2, we identified three couples of mutations F390C/F391Y, S404R/P405D, and E420R/E421R, which almost completely abolished the toxicity on D1 and K19 despite the presence of a TonB box HTMVV. Two different couples of mutations R409E/I410D and W416E/F417D reduced the toxicity by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude on K19 in the presence of a TonB box HSIVV. In contrast, their toxicity on the wild-type strain is comparable with that of the wild-type colicin D, seeming to confirm that this region becomes important for the interaction with mutated TonB proteins.FIGURE 2Site-directed mutagenesis of the Trp377-Glu421 peptide region belonging to the N-terminal part of the central domain of colicin D. The positions of the different couples of double point mutations are indicated. Wild-type (WT) TonB box motif of colicin D is underlined. Suppressor-type TonB box sequences, HTMVV or HSIVV, present in the doubly mutated colicins D are given. The cytotoxicity of the in vitro produced mutant colicins was determined by halo test, as in Fig. 1, and quantified by spotting undiluted colicins and 4-fold serial dilution aliquots directly onto a lawn of sensitive wild-type (WT) or tonB-mutant cells, D1 and K19.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Comparison of the Conserved Central Domains of Klebicin D and Colicin D–Protein sequence comparisons suggested that the recently identified klebicin D belonged to the tRNase family of bacteriocins and showed that it carries a CD similar to that present in colicin D (4Chavan M. Rafi H. Wertz J. Goldstone C. Riley M.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 60: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 3A, the immunity proteins and the C-terminal toxic domains are conserved between klebicin D and colicin D, carrying 63.6 and 84.6% identical residues, respectively. The conservation is particularly high around the endoproteolytic cleavage site, located in vitro at position 607, just upstream of the catalytic domain of colicin D (39de Zamaroczy M. Mora L. Lecuyer A. Geli V. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting the klebicin D is processed similarly to colicin D (Fig. 3A). There is no significant similarity in the N-terminal domains of colicin D and klebicin D (4Chavan M. Rafi H. Wertz J. Goldstone C. Riley M.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 60: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and there is no obvious TonB box sequence in the N-terminal domain of klebicin D, suggesting that it does not appropriate TonB for its translocation into Klebsiella. The in vitro expressed klebicin D, with or without its cognate immunity protein (Fig. 3B), had no toxicity on E. coli wild-type and tonB mutant strains suggesting the need for a Klebsiella-specific receptor prior to translocation. In contrast, when the whole N-terminal domain of klebicin D was replaced by that of colicin D, to give Chi3A and Chi3B (including or not ImmK) (Fig. 3B), the toxicity was fully restored on the wild-type E. coli strain, implying that in these chimeras entry does occur via the FepA/TonB import system. However, the D/K/K chimera is more active in complex with the ImmK protein (Chi3B) than in its absence (Chi3A). This is in agreement with the empirical observation that the naturally secreted form of the nuclease type colicin-Imm complexes is more toxic than colicin molecules freed in vitro of their Imm proteins (41De Graaf F.K. Klaasen-Boor P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 42Oudega B. Klaasen-Boor P. Sneeuwloper G. De Graaf F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 19"
