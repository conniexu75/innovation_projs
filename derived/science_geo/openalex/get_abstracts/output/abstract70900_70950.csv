https://openalex.org/W1979027062,"COBRA venom has been used as a source of phospholipase A activity1–3, and Braganca and Sambray showed that there are multiple forms of phospholipase A in cobra venom4. In the course of a study of the toxic components of the venom of the Indian cobra, Naja naja, we discovered that a very potent central nervous system toxin (corticotoxin I) is associated with a high phospholipase A activity. This component was isolated by ammonium sulphate fractionation and chromatography on carboxymethyl ‘Sephadex G-25’ and finally crystallized. A photograph of the crystalline product is shown in Fig. 1. The specific phospholipase activity of the crystals, assayed in ether suspension by a modification of the technique described by Long and Penny5, was 150 U/mg. (A phospholipase unit is the amount of activity which results in the liberation of 1 µmole of fatty acid per min at 20° C.) There was no detectable myoneural toxic activity, as determined by the procedure described by Vick et al.6, using anaesthetized dogs. The crystals can be separated into two major components either by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips or by chromatography on DEAE cellulose. The specific phospholipase activity of both components was similar in the conditions of our assay. The amino-acid composition of the acid hydrolysates of the two components was nearly identical, as shown in Table 1. Amide content has not been determined so far, and there may be a difference in the number of free carboxyl groups. Work is now in progress to compare the substrate specificities, kinetic parameters and physicochemical properties of the two components."

https://openalex.org/W1994256208,"A GENETICALLY determined heterogeneity (doubling) of the human complement component C′3, which can be detected by agar gel electrophoresis, has been described in two unrelated families of Flemish stock in Belgium1,2. The frequency of this anomaly seems to be extremely low and no clear relationship with a diseased state has been detected. A similar anomaly which does not seem to be genetically determined has also been described3–5. The frequency of this anomaly is somewhat greater than the other and its occurrence has been correlated with the presence of neoplastic disease6."

https://openalex.org/W2036975243,"THE correlation between whether or not people buy one brand of a non-durable consumer good and whether or not they buy another brand in the same product-field is extremely low, usually between +0.2 and −0.1. These small correlations are, however, highly systematic and reflect a relationship of the form where bX and bY are the proportions of the population buying brands X and Y respectively in the given time-period, bXY is the proportion buying both brands, and D is a constant. For observed duplication values ranging up to about bXY = 20 per cent, this relationship holds to within an average of ±1.5 percentage points."

https://openalex.org/W2012033223,"SINCE the end of 1963, the concentration of various radionuclides in ground-level air has been measured here (52° 18′ N, 10° 28′ E) (ref. 1). Routinely, 7Be, 54Mn, 106Ru/Rh, 125Sb, 137Cs and 144Ce are analysed and the results are published quarterly2. The sampling device is fixed 1.5 m above the ground. At present a continuous duty turboblower is used operating with flow rates of 100 to 200 m3/h in connexion with a calibrated rotary gasmeter. The filters consist of ‘Microsorban’ (Delbag, Berlin) and are nearly 100 per cent efficient. Those which contain the dust are ashed at 450° C and then radiochemically analysed."

https://openalex.org/W2069387931,"THE immigrant barnacle Elminius modestus, spreading from the Channel, has been known for several years in the North Sea, being reported from the Thames before 1948 (refs. 1 and 2), from the Humber in 1951 (ref. 2) and from near the Tees in 1958 (ref. 3). There its northwards progress along the east coast was arrested; however, a separate settlement, doubtless introduced by shipboard agency, nourishes in the Forth4, extending as far south as Dunbar. The intervening coast has remained uncolonized until recently, despite a considerable seaborne traffic between the Thames and the principal rivers of Northumberland and Durham. Apart from those found on ships' bottoms, a specimen settled on a mussel in the River Blyth in 1950 and two specimens settled on a mussel in the River Tyne in 1961 constitute the only records from these counties until this year."
