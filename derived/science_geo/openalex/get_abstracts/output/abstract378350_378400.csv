https://openalex.org/W2071754162,"Background Stable isotope analysis is increasingly being utilised across broad areas of ecology and biology. Key to much of this work is the use of mixing models to estimate the proportion of sources contributing to a mixture such as in diet estimation. Methodology By accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of Bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. Conclusions We outline a framework that builds on recently published Bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source R package, SIAR. The formulation in R will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research."

Here, we show that application of molecular trafficking principles can expand the optogenetic repertoire along several long-sought dimensions. Subcellular and transcellular trafficking strategies now permit (1) optical regulation at the far-red/infrared border and extension of optogenetic control across the entire visible spectrum, (2) increased potency of optical inhibition without increased light power requirement (nanoampere-scale chloride-mediated photocurrents that maintain the light sensitivity and reversible, step-like kinetic stability of earlier tools), and (3) generalizable strategies for targeting cells based not only on genetic identity, but also on morphology and tissue topology, to allow versatile targeting when promoters are not known or in genetically intractable organisms. Together, these results illustrate use of cell-biological principles to enable expansion of the versatile fast optogenetic technologies suitable for intact-systems biology and behavior.

Molecular trafficking techniques open up new dimensions in mammalian optogenetics Manyfold-enhanced halorhodopsin eNpHR3.0 enables optical control with far-red light Trafficking-enhanced tools identified from genome mining expand spectral coverage Transcellular trafficking enables promoter-independent optical targeting by topology A fundamental goal in biology is fast control of defined cells within functioning tissues. Temporal precision of control is important since cells may carry out fundamentally different computations and deliver different outputs depending on the timing and context of input signals. For example, it is almost meaningless to ask the causal role of “activation” or “inhibition” of a neuron type in the brain, since changes in context (Fleischmann et al., 2008Fleischmann A. Shykind B.M. Sosulski D.L. Franks K.M. Glinka M.E. Mei D.F. Sun Y. Kirkland J. Mendelsohn M. Albers M.W. Axel R.

Synaptic dynamics control the timing of neuronal excitation in the activated neocortical microcircuit.J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) can change the magnitude or flip the sign of neuronal action on the circuit. Similarly, pancreatic β cells execute synchronized oscillations in membrane potential resulting in pulsatile insulin secretion with precise timing across the population of β cells that may be important for the action of insulin on target tissues (Tengholm and Gylfe, 2009Tengholm A. Gylfe E. Oscillatory control of insulin secretion.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2009; 297: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Traditional genetics delivers cell type-specific control if adequate targeting strategies exist, but genetic approaches lack the temporal precision needed to control events with behaviorally or environmentally relevant triggering and timing; moreover, pharmacological control strategies lack cell type-specificity, temporal precision, or both. The general need to study molecular and cellular events not only in reduced systems, but also within intact biological systems, has driven recent awareness of the opportunities of fast control. To enable temporally precise control of specific cell types within behaving animals, fast “optogenetic” (Deisseroth et al., 2006Deisseroth K. Feng G. Majewska A.K. Miesenböck G. Ting A. Schnitzer M.J. Next-generation optical technologies for illuminating genetically targeted brain circuits.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10380-10386Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) technologies have been developed involving single-component light-responsive proteins that transduce brief pulses of light into well-defined action potential trains and effector functions in vivo (Boyden et al., 2005Boyden E.S.

Adamantidis A. de Lecea L. Deisseroth K. Circuit-breakers: optical technologies for probing neural signals and systems.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Through the use of optogenetics, precisely timed gain-of-function or loss-of-function of specified events can be achieved in targeted cells of freely moving mammals and other animals (Adamantidis et al., 2007Adamantidis A.R.

Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons.Nature. 2007; 450: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). For example, we have found that direct light-triggered excitation of cellular electrical activity (depolarization and precisely timed action potentials) can be achieved via expression of the microbial opsin genes encoding Chlamydomonas channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (Boyden et al., 2005Boyden E.S. Zhang F. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Deisseroth K. Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar) or Volvox channelrhodopsin-1 (VChR1) (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang F. Prigge M. Beyrière F. Tsunoda S.P. Mattis J. Yizhar O. Hegemann P. Deisseroth K. Red-shifted optogenetic excitation: a tool for fast neural control derived from Volvox carteri.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). On the other hand, direct light-triggered inhibition of electrical activity (precisely timed hyperpolarization) can be achieved via expression of the Natronomonas halorhodopsin (NpHR) in vivo (Zhang et al., 2007aZhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K.

Thompson K.R. Deisseroth K. eNpHR: a Natronomonas halorhodopsin enhanced for optogenetic applications.Brain Cell Biol. 2008; 36: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar); this halorhodopsin was selected for its step-like and highly stable photocurrents compared with other microbial generators of inhibitory current (Zhang et al., 2007aZhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K. Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.Nature. 2007; 446: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The halorhodopsin achieves inhibition by pumping into neurons an ion (chloride) that constitutes part of the natural mechanism of neuronal inhibition, and neurons are therefore well designed to process chloride influx (Zhang et al., 2007aZhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K. Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.Nature. 2007; 446: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar); microbial proton pumps additionally can be used to achieve outward currents (Chow et al., 2010Chow B.Y. Han X. Dobry A.S. Qian X. Chuong A.S. Li M. Henninger M.A. Belfort G.M. Lin Y. Monahan P.E. Boyden E.S. High-performance genetically targetable optical neural silencing by light-driven proton pumps.Nature. 2010; 463: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Finally, more subtle (but still temporally precise) optical modulatory strategies are also possible, including changes in the input-output relationships of targeted cells via expression of engineered step function opsins, or “SFOs,” that alter excitability (Berndt et al., 2009Berndt A. Yizhar O. Gunaydin L.A. Hegemann P. Deisseroth K. Bi-stable neural state switches.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and fast selective control of modulatory Gs or Gq signaling using synthetic rhodopsin/G protein-coupled receptor chimeras (optoXRs) (Airan et al., 2009Airan R.D. Thompson K.R. Fenno L.E. Bernstein H. Deisseroth K. Temporally precise in vivo control of intracellular signalling.Nature. 2009; 458: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). This collection of tools, along with the development of versatile devices to deliver light in vivo (Aravanis et al., 2007Aravanis A.M. Wang L.P. Zhang F. Meltzer L.A. Mogri M.Z. Schneider M.B.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14231-14238Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), has enabled widespread application of optogenetics. To further expand the optogenetic toolbox, we have previously carried out genomic screening strategies to successfully identify and validate novel classes of opsins for optogenetic control (Zhang et al., 2007aZhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and carried out rationally designed mutagenesis to achieve new classes of opsin functionality (Berndt et al., 2009Berndt A. Yizhar O. Gunaydin L.A. Hegemann P. Deisseroth K. Bi-stable neural state switches.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, Gunaydin et al., 2010Gunaydin L.A. Yizhar O. Berndt A. Sohal V.S. Deisseroth K. Hegemann P. Ultrafast optogenetic control.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Here, we apply a third type of intervention, namely application of molecular trafficking strategies, to derive a panel of tools that both quantitatively and qualitatively enhance the power of optogenetics and open distinct avenues of investigation. In particular, tools are developed that allow targeting of cells solely by virtue of their topological relationships within tissue and that extend the reach of optical control to the infrared border, with effector function enhanced beyond the other known tools and covering the entire visible spectrum. Deriving optogenetic tools from multiple classes of microbes promises substantial diversity of triggering and effector functions (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang F. Prigge M. Beyrière F. Tsunoda S.P. Mattis J. Yizhar O. Hegemann P. Deisseroth K. Red-shifted optogenetic excitation: a tool for fast neural control derived from Volvox carteri.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), given the ecological diversity of microbial organisms occupying niches with a broad array of environmental signals of informational or energetic value (Yooseph et al., 2007Yooseph S. Sutton G. Rusch D.B. Halpern A.L. Williamson S.J. Remington K. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg K.B. Manning G. Li W. et al.The Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling expedition: expanding the universe of protein families.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Moreover, as a necessary adaptation to small cell volume and genome size, microbes carry out sensation, transduction, and action via highly compact mechanisms, often all encompassed within a single open genetic reading frame (as with the microbial opsins, in which both photon sensation and ion flux effector function are implemented within a single compact protein) (Kalaidzidis et al., 1998Kalaidzidis I.V.

In contrast, metazoan or vertebrate cells may transduce energy or information with more complex multicomponent signaling cascades that afford greater opportunities for modulation but are much less portable (as with the vertebrate opsins). Optogenetic tools from simpler organisms therefore present clear opportunities, but may not express or be tolerated well by more complex cells. Indeed, archaeal halorhodopsin (the light-activated electrogenic chloride pump that can be used for optogenetic inhibition in metazoans) displays impaired subcellular localization when expressed at high levels in mammalian neurons (Gradinaru et al., 2008Gradinaru V.

Improved expression of halorhodopsin for light-induced silencing of neuronal activity.Brain Cell Biol. 2008; 36: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An early trafficking step, export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), was found to be impaired for this first-generation NpHR, leading to intracellular accumulations that colocalized with the ER marker KDEL (Figure 1A ; Figure 1B, left). Fusion of the FCYENEV ER export motif from a vertebrate inward rectifier potassium channel to the NpHR C terminus prevented aggregate formation (Figure 1B, center) and greatly enhanced tolerability at high expression levels. This second-generation enhanced tool (eNpHR, now eNpHR2.0) has been successfully employed in vivo and in intact tissue in a number of studies (Gradinaru et al., 2009Gradinaru V. Mogri M.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 17968-17973Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); expression was well tolerated, and additionally Thy1::eNpHR2.0 mice have been generated with well-tolerated long-term expression of eNpHR2.0 at high functional levels throughout the brain (G. Feng, G. Augustine, and K.D., unpublished data). As with many kinds of native inhibition, optogenetic inhibition could be overcome by strong excitatory activity (Sohal et al., 2009Sohal V.S. Zhang F. Yizhar O. Deisseroth K. Parvalbumin neurons and gamma rhythms enhance cortical circuit performance.Nature. 2009; 459: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Potential additional molecular modifications for enhancing photocurrents from known and emerging opsin gene family members would include signal peptides, additional ER export motifs, Golgi trafficking signals, transport signals, and other motifs involved in transport of membrane proteins along the secretory pathway to the cell surface (Simon and Blobel, 1993Simon S.M. Blobel G. Mechanisms of translocation of proteins across membranes.Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 21: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to apply combinatorial membrane trafficking strategies that could be generally applicable in a systematic, principled fashion to candidate microbial membrane proteins for translation to metazoan applications. Examination of eNpHR2.0-expressing hippocampal neurons revealed the absence of globular ER accumulations, as previously reported, but nevertheless persistent intracellular labeling and poor membrane localization (Figure 1B, center), suggesting that additional modifications subsequent to the ER export step would indeed be important. Examination of primary-sequence differences between two forms of an inward rectifier potassium channel with differential membrane localization (Kir2.1 and Kir2.4) revealed differences not only in C-terminal ER export motifs but also in N-terminal Golgi export signals and in C-terminal trafficking signals (Hofherr et al., 2005Hofherr A. Fakler B. Klöcker N. Selective Golgi export of Kir2.1 controls the stoichiometry of functional Kir2.x channel heteromers.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that provision of the Golgi export signal did not significantly affect surface expression (data not shown), but that addition of the trafficking signal from Kir2.1 either between eNpHR and the EYFP fusion, or at the C terminus of the fusion protein, dramatically reduced intracellular labeling and increased apparent surface membrane expression (Figure 1B, right) and also improved labeling of cellular processes (Figure 1B, right). Indeed, high-resolution confocal imaging (Figure 1C) revealed marked localization in processes, with identifiable labeled membranes spanning intracellular regions apparently devoid of the opsin-EYFP fusion protein, in a pattern never previously observed with NpHR or its derivatives. If improved membrane targeting were indeed achieved with this modification, increased photocurrents would be anticipated to result. We therefore examined photocurrents, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings to quantify bona fide functional plasma membrane localization of halorhodopsin pump molecules. Photocurrents were indeed profoundly increased (to a level ∼20-fold larger than the initially described NpHR currents; mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], photocurrent 747.2 ± 93.9 pA in lentivirally transduced hippocampal pyramidal neurons under the human synapsin I promoter; n = 10; Figure 1D). At action spectrum peak described below, nanoampere-scale mean outward currents were readily observed with 3.5 mW/mm2 yellow light, an order of magnitude lower intensity than required by proton pumps to attain this level of photocurrent (maintaining low light intensities becomes an important issue only for in vivo experiments, wherein safe control of significant tissue volumes is paramount) (Aravanis et al., 2007Aravanis A.M.

In virally transduced neurons, light-induced hyperpolarizations by >100 mV were routinely achievable, at the same modest light power levels (mean hyperpolarization 101.0 ± 24.7 mV; n = 10; Figure 1E). Membrane potential changes of this new magnitude represent a functionally distinct advance in optogenetic inhibition, and we accordingly designate this third-generation NpHR as eNpHR3.0 (the Natronomonas halorhodopsin was named NpHR in 2005 [Sato et al., 2005Sato M. Kubo M. Aizawa T. Kamo N. Kikukawa T. Nitta K. Demura M.

Thompson K.R. Deisseroth K. eNpHR: a Natronomonas halorhodopsin enhanced for optogenetic applications.Brain Cell Biol. 2008; 36: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar is now referred to as eNpHR2.0). As expected from prior work (Zhang et al., 2007aZhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K. Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.Nature. 2007; 446: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) showing that NpHR photocurrents were step-like and exhibited little inactivation over more than 10 min of continuous illumination (indeed, NpHR was selected for this reason, as described in Zhang et al. [2007a]), the eNpHR3.0 photocurrents were also step-like, resistant to inactivation, and highly stable over multiple light pulses and long (behaviorally relevant) timescales (Figure 1D; Figure S1 available online) (Zhang et al., 2007aZhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K. Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.Nature. 2007; 446: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). We asked whether the robust improved expression were preserved in the mammalian brain in vivo. We injected lentiviral vectors delivering the novel opsin gene under control of the CaMKIIα promoter to the CA1 region of the hippocampal formation in adult mice and examined distribution of the expressed EYFP fusion. As in cultured cells, strong expression was observed not only in dendrites but also in axons in vivo with both eNpHR3.0 and eNpHR3.1 (a shorter version of eNpHR3.0 with equivalent functionality but the N-terminal signal peptide removed) (Figure 2A ). A major in vivo opportunity for systems neurobiology would be controlling not just a projection from region A to region B, but a cell type itself that has (among its connections) a projection from A to B. This fundamentally distinct result requires multiplexing of optical control with other targeting methods (Figure 2B). Such control would be of great value in systems neurobiology; for example, cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons form a genetically and anatomically defined class of cell, but within this class are cells that each project to multiple different areas of the brain (e.g., thalamus, spinal cord, striatum, and other cortical areas) and therefore have fundamentally distinct roles (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S.

Dantzker J.L. Callaway E.M. Excitatory cortical neurons form fine-scale functional networks.Nature. 2005; 433: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that genetic tools will advance far enough to separate all of these different cell classes, pointing to the need to inhibit or excite cell types defined also by connection topology (Figure 2B). One way to achieve this goal would be to capitalize on transcellular trafficking: to introduce into the local cell-body location a Cre-dependent virus conditionally expressing the microbial opsin gene of choice (e.g., Tsai et al., 2009Tsai H.C. Zhang F. Adamantidis A. Stuber G.D. Bonci A. de Lecea L. Deisseroth K. Phasic firing in dopaminergic neurons is sufficient for behavioral conditioning.Science. 2009; 324: 1080-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), and rather than additionally employing a Cre-driver mouse line, to instead introduce into a distant target structure (chosen to define the cells of interest by anatomical connectivity) a virus expressing Cre recombinase fused to a transcellular tracer protein, e.g., wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (Figure 2B) or tetanus toxin- fragment C (TTC) (Kissa et al., 2002Kissa K.

We assessed whether obesity is a risk factor for hospitalization and death due to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), independent of chronic medical conditions considered by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to increase the risk of influenza-related complications.We used a case-cohort design to compare cases of hospitalizations and deaths from 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) influenza occurring between April-July, 2009, with a cohort of the U.S. population estimated from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); pregnant women and children <2 years old were excluded. For hospitalizations, we defined categories of relative weight by body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)); for deaths, obesity or morbid obesity was recorded on medical charts, and death certificates. Odds ratio (OR) of being in each BMI category was determined; normal weight was the reference category. Overall, 361 hospitalizations and 233 deaths included information to determine BMI category and presence of ACIP-recognized medical conditions. Among >or=20 year olds, hospitalization was associated with being morbidly obese (BMI>or=40) for individuals with ACIP-recognized chronic conditions (OR = 4.9, 95% CI 2.4-9.9) and without ACIP-recognized chronic conditions (OR = 4.7, 95%CI 1.3-17.2). Among 2-19 year olds, hospitalization was associated with being underweight (BMI<or=5(th) percentile) among those with (OR = 12.5, 95%CI 3.4-45.5) and without (OR = 5.5, 95%CI 1.3-22.5) ACIP-recognized chronic conditions. Death was not associated with BMI category among individuals 2-19 years old. Among individuals aged >or=20 years without ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions death was associated with obesity (OR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.5-6.6) and morbid obesity (OR = 7.6, 95%CI 2.1-27.9).Our findings support observations that morbid obesity may be associated with hospitalization and possibly death due to 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection. These complications could be prevented by early antiviral therapy and vaccination."

Escherichia coli and related species harness a chemosensory and signal transduction machinery that governs the direction of flagellar rotation and allows them to navigate in chemical gradients. Here, we show that Escherichia coli can also fine-tune its swimming speed with the help of a molecular brake (YcgR) that, upon binding of the nucleotide second messenger cyclic di-GMP, interacts with the motor protein MotA to curb flagellar motor output. Swimming velocity is controlled by the synergistic action of at least five signaling proteins that adjust the cellular concentration of cyclic di-GMP. Activation of this network and the resulting deceleration coincide with nutrient depletion and might represent an adaptation to starvation. These experiments demonstrate that bacteria can modulate flagellar motor output and thus swimming velocity in response to environmental cues.

Milne L. Hawkins P. Moving towards a better understanding of chemotaxis.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: R485-R494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Information about the environment can be translated into changing motor speed and/or directionality. Escherichia coli and related bacteria move by swimming through liquid environments with the help of six to eight rotating flagella that are anchored via basal bodies at randomly distributed positions in the cell envelope. When all flagellar motors simultaneously rotate in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction, the individual flagellar filaments are combined into a bundle and the cell is propelled forward in a straight run. These runs are interrupted by tumbles, short episodes of clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation, leading to bundle dispersal and a random reorientation of the cell. Tumbles are suppressed when cells happen to swim into a favorable direction. In the presence of a chemical gradient, this behavior transmits into a biased random walk that directs net migration and thus allows the bacterial cell to perform chemotaxis. Tumble events are initiated by binding of the phosphorylated form of CheY to the flagellar switch complex. The phosphorylation status of CheY and thus tumble frequency is controlled by a well-understood signal processing machinery that is able to sense, respond, and adapt to chemical gradients (Hazelbauer et al., 2008Hazelbauer G.L. Falke J.J. Parkinson J.S. Bacterial chemoreceptors: high-performance signaling in networked arrays.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Flagellar rotation is powered by proton flux across inner membrane channels composed of a heterohexameric complex of the motor proteins MotA and MotB (stoichiometry MotA4MotB2) (Kojima and Blair, 2004Kojima S. Blair D.F. Solubilization and purification of the MotA/MotB complex of Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Eleven such stator complexes align the outside of the flagellar C ring, the cytoplasmic part of the flagellar rotor, which consists of multiple copies of the FliG, FliM and FliN proteins (Reid et al., 2006Reid S.W. Leake M.C. Chandler J.H. Lo C.J. Armitage J.P. Berry R.M. The maximum number of torque-generating units in the flagellar motor of Escherichia coli is at least 11.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 8066-8071Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transformation of chemical energy from proton influx into torque is believed to involve direct electrostatic interactions between MotA and FliG, while switching from CCW to CW rotation requires interaction of phosphorylated CheY with FliM (Berg, 2003Berg H.C. The rotary motor of bacterial flagella.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 19-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, Sowa and Berry, 2008Sowa Y. Berry R.M. Bacterial flagellar motor.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 41: 103-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The stator complexes function independently of each other with a single active stator complex being sufficient to spin a flagellar filament. However, under conditions of high load (that is when high viscous drag is exerted on the filament), submaximal numbers of active stator complexes lead to intermediate rotation frequencies (Blair and Berg, 1988Blair D.F. Berg H.C. Restoration of torque in defective flagellar motors.Science. 1988; 242: 1678-1681Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). When grown in batch culture, E. coli modulates its swimming speed, which peaks in late exponential phase and declines upon entry into stationary phase despite full flagellation (Amsler et al., 1993Amsler C.D. Cho M. Matsumura P. Multiple factors underlying the maximum motility of Escherichia coli as cultures enter post-exponential growth.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6238-6244Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because it is known that motor speed is proportional to proton motive force (Gabel and Berg, 2003Gabel C.V. Berg H.C. The speed of the flagellar rotary motor of Escherichia coli varies linearly with protonmotive force.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8748-8751Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Meister et al., 1987Meister M. Lowe G. Berg H.C. The proton flux through the bacterial flagellar motor.Cell. 1987; 49: 643-650Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it was speculated that speed variation is based on changes in proton motive force. Although different bacteria are able to swim at different maximal speeds, it is not known whether bacterial motor output is a hardwired trait or whether bacteria can modulate their velocity deliberately in response to environmental cues. Recent reports suggested that the second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) inhibits motility in bacteria (Ryjenkov et al., 2006Ryjenkov D.A. Simm R. Römling U. Gomelsky M. The PilZ domain is a receptor for the second messenger c-di-GMP: the PilZ domain protein YcgR controls motility in enterobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30310-30314Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, Wolfe and Visick, 2008Wolfe A.J. Visick K.L. Get the message out: cyclic-Di-GMP regulates multiple levels of flagellum-based motility.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 463-475Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This compound is produced by a family of enzymes called diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and is degraded by specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs). DGCs typically harbor a C-terminal GGDEF output domain that catalyzes c-di-GMP production and an N-terminal signal input domain that regulates the activity of the catalytic domain. PDEs harbor a catalytic C-terminal EAL domain and an N-terminal signal input domain (Hengge, 2009Hengge R. Principles of c-di-GMP signalling in bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, Jenal and Malone, 2006Jenal U. Malone J. Mechanisms of cyclic-di-GMP signaling in bacteria.Annu. Rev.

Microbiol. 2009; 7: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Whereas the catalytic mechanisms of DGCs and PDEs are relatively well understood, the nature of the signals controlling their activity is only known in a few cases. GGDEF and EAL domain proteins are found in most bacteria, and in most cases a single bacterial genome encodes many different members of these protein families (Galperin, 2005Galperin M.Y. A census of membrane-bound and intracellular signal transduction proteins in bacteria: bacterial IQ, extroverts and introverts.BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The response to fluctuating cellular levels of c-di-GMP is mediated by a variety of specific effector proteins or RNAs that control specific cellular processes (Schirmer and Jenal, 2009Schirmer T. Jenal U. Structural and mechanistic determinants of c-di-GMP signalling.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The most prevalent example of such effectors are c-di-GMP-binding proteins harboring a PilZ domain (Amikam and Galperin, 2006Amikam D. Galperin M.Y. PilZ domain is part of the bacterial c-di-GMP binding protein.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3-6Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). YcgR, a PilZ domain protein from E. coli, was shown to bind c-di-GMP in vitro and to somehow interfere with E. coli motility upon genetic inactivation of the PDE YhjH (Ko and Park, 2000Ko M. Park C. Two novel flagellar components and H-NS are involved in the motor function of Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 371-382Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Ryjenkov et al., 2006Ryjenkov D.A. Simm R. Römling U. Gomelsky M. The PilZ domain is a receptor for the second messenger c-di-GMP: the PilZ domain protein YcgR controls motility in enterobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30310-30314Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Interestingly, yhjH and ycgR are coregulated with the flagellar and chemotaxis genes (Frye et al., 2006Frye J. Karlinsey J.E. Felise H.R. Marzolf B. Dowidar N. McClelland M. Hughes K.T. Identification of new flagellar genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.J.

Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 371-382Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Together, these observations led to a simple model in which YhjH limits the cellular c-di-GMP concentration, thereby preventing YcgR activation by c-di-GMP, and consequently allowing for unrestricted motility. Although some DGCs were genetically linked to YcgR-mediated motility control (Girgis et al., 2007Girgis H.S. Liu Y. Ryu W.S. Tavazoie S. A comprehensive genetic characterization of bacterial motility.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 1644-1660Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Pesavento et al., 2008Pesavento C. Becker G. Sommerfeldt N.

Inverse regulatory coordination of motility and curli-mediated adhesion in Escherichia coli.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2434-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the full network of DGCs and PDEs responsible for this behavior remained unclear. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of how c-di-GMP and YcgR interfere with cell motility is still elusive. While some authors proposed that YcgR regulates motility as such (Ko and Park, 2000Ko M. Park C. Two novel flagellar components and H-NS are involved in the motor function of Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 371-382Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Ryjenkov et al., 2006Ryjenkov D.A. Simm R. Römling U. Gomelsky M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 30310-30314Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), others proposed that ΔyhjH mutants have a chemotaxis or motor assembly defect (Girgis et al., 2007Girgis H.S. Liu Y. Ryu W.S. Tavazoie S. A comprehensive genetic characterization of bacterial motility.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 1644-1660Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Wolfe and Visick, 2008Wolfe A.J. Visick K.L. Get the message out: cyclic-Di-GMP regulates multiple levels of flagellum-based motility.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 463-475Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the absence of strong experimental evidence for any of these mechanisms, it even remained possible that the effect on motility is indirect, e.g., through the production of cell surface exposed adhesive factors that might slow down bacteria passively. Here, we unravel the molecular mechanism underlying c-di-GMP mediated motility control. We show that YcgR directly interacts with the flagellar motor protein MotA in response to c-di-GMP binding. We present evidence that YcgR gradually reduces flagellar motor function by inactivating individual stator units in a brake-like fashion. We suggest that the YcgR brake mechanism involves electrostatic interactions between MotA and the rotor protein FliG. Furthermore, we identify a network of five c-di-GMP signaling proteins that work synergistically to adjust the concentration of c-di-GMP in E. coli cells and thereby fine-tunes bacterial velocity. We propose that one physiological role of this network is to adapt bacterial swimming speed upon nutrient limitation. To test which c-di-GMP signaling components contribute to motility control in E. coli, we tested 29 mutants, representing all E. coli proteins harboring a GGDEF and/or EAL domain, for their swimming behavior in soft agar plates (0.3% agar). Bacteria in these plates generate a chemical gradient by depletion of nutrients at the site of inoculation. Motile and chemotactic cells can follow this gradient and migrate away from the center, thereby forming a concentric “swarm” colony. The size of these swarms is determined by swimming velocity and chemotactic performance. A mutant lacking the YhjH PDE showed a severe phenotype in this assay (Frye et al., 2006Frye J. Karlinsey J.E. Felise H.R. Marzolf B. Dowidar N. McClelland M. Hughes K.T. Identification of new flagellar genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2233-2243Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, Ko and Park, 2000Ko M. Park C. Two novel flagellar components and H-NS are involved in the motor function of Escherichia coli.J.

The PilZ domain is a receptor for the second messenger c-di-GMP: the PilZ domain protein YcgR controls motility in enterobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30310-30314Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). In addition, mutational inactivation of YliE, another EAL domain protein, led to a weak motility defect (approximately 90% swarm size compared to the wild-type [WT]), while inactivation of none of the other GGDEF/EAL domain proteins had any effect (data not shown). We focused on YhjH and asked which DGC(s) are involved in blocking motility in the ΔyhjH mutant. To this end, the ΔyhjH mutation was individually combined with mutations inactivating all 19 proteins harboring a GGDEF domain. Deletion of the yedQ, yfiN, yddV, or yegE genes led to partial restoration of motility in the yhjH mutant background. Accumulation of deletions of all four genes restored motility of the ΔyhjH mutant strain in an additive manner. This suggested that all four proteins are DGCs that synergistically adjust the cellular c-di-GMP concentration for motility control (Figure 1). Furthermore, a yhjH+ strain lacking the four DGCs showed a similar swarm size to the WT, the ΔycgR mutant, or the ΔyhjH ΔycgR double mutant. In summary, these data suggest that the four DGCs, YfiN, YegE, YedQ, and YddV, together with the PDE YhjH (and possibly YliE) form a network that regulates cell motility in E. coli by modulating cellular levels of c-di-GMP. Although experiments with motility plates facilitate the analysis of many different mutants, this assay is not well suited to determine whether a mutant has a motility defect or is unable to follow chemical gradients. To distinguish between chemotaxis and velocity defects, we recorded trajectories of individual motile bacteria with the help of dark-field video microscopy. Under the experimental conditions used for these tracking experiments, no chemical gradients exist and cells tumble very rarely (Movie S1 available online; see also the Experimental Procedures). Determination of the swimming velocity of the ΔyhjH mutant revealed that this strain swims slowly, with the majority of cells displaying speeds of 12–17 μm/s (median 14.7 μm/s), compared to the WT at 20–31 μm/s (median 24.9 μm/s) or the ΔyhjH ΔycgR mutant at 20–29 μm/s (median 25.9 μm/s) (Figure 1, Movie S1). Statistical analysis revealed that this reduction in speed is significant (Table S1). Moreover, as observed macroscopically on swarm plates, the successive deletion of diguanylate cyclases led to intermediate swimming speeds ranging between velocities for the WT and the ΔyhjH mutant. Simultaneous removal of all four DGCs or the deletion of ycgR led to swimming speeds that are slightly higher than that of the WT (median velocities of 26.5 μm/s and 26.2 μm/s, respectively). Similarly, a yhjH+ strain lacking all four DGCs showed slightly increased motility compared to that of the WT (median velocity = 27.4 μm/s). Determination of the cellular levels of c-di-GMP in several of these strains revealed an inverse correlation between the observed swimming speed and internal c-di-GMP (Figure 1). Whereas c-di-GMP concentrations were below the detection limit in WT cells and in cells lacking all four DGCs, c-di-GMP concentrations varied in the other strains within a concentration range that corresponds well with the in vitro affinity of YcgR for its ligand (KD in the low μM range) (Ryjenkov et al., 2006Ryjenkov D.A. Simm R. Römling U. Gomelsky M. The PilZ domain is a receptor for the second messenger c-di-GMP: the PilZ domain protein YcgR controls motility in enterobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30310-30314Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of six additional potential PDE coding genes (“Δ6pde”) led to a further increase of the c-di-GMP concentration and concomitant reduction of swimming velocity and swarm size compared to a ΔyhjH single mutant (Figure 1). This indicated that additional components of the E. coli c-di-GMP network are involved in swimming speed control. Comparison of the data obtained with motility plates and with single cell analysis revealed a remarkable congruence of the macroscopic and microscopic measurements, indicating that (1) the c-di-GMP specific PDE YhjH limits a pool of c-di-GMP that is replenished by the synergistic action of the four DGCs, YegE, YfiN, YedQ, and YddV; and that (2) YcgR gradually decreases swimming velocity in dependence of increasing concentrations of c-di-GMP. Although these experiments strongly suggested that c-di-GMP and YcgR control swimming speed, we wanted to test an additional effect of these components on chemotaxis. For this, we used in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements to quantitatively probe the interaction between CheY-YFP and the switch complex protein CFP-FliM under steady state and stimulatory conditions. No relevant difference between the WT and the ΔyhjH mutant was found (Figure S1), providing additional support for the idea that c-di-GMP governs cell motility primarily by modulating swimming velocity. To expose how YcgR controls motility, we isolated spontaneous motile suppressors of the ΔyhjH mutant. This approach is based on the idea that specific mutations in the direct molecular target of YcgR could disrupt this interaction and thereby render the target blind for high levels of c-di-GMP. Four different suppressor mutations altering two specific residues of the stator protein MotA were isolated several times independently (Extended Experimental Procedures). Three suppressors had exchanged glycine 93 to glutamate, valine, or arginine, respectively, while one suppressor had replaced serine 96 to leucine (Figure 2A ). G93 and S96 are in the immediate vicinity of two highly conserved residues of MotA (R90 and E98) that are involved in electrostatic interactions with conserved residues (D289, D288, and R281) of the rotor protein FliG (Figure 2A) (Zhou et al., 1998Zhou J. Lloyd S.A. Blair D.F. Electrostatic interactions between rotor and stator in the bacterial flagellar motor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 6436-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This MotA-FliG interaction is believed to be crucial for torque generation of the flagellar motor. All four motA mutations caused strong suppression of the ΔyhjH motility defect in motility test plates, with swarm sizes ranging from 68% to 82% of the WT swarm sizes (ΔyhjH shows swarm sizes below 40% of the WT; Figure S2A ). When the swimming speeds of individual cells of these four suppressor mutants were analyzed with the help of video tracking, differences between the mutants became apparent. The motA(G93E) mutant displayed WT speed, the motA(G93R) mutant intermediate speed, and the motA(G93V) and motA(S96L) mutants ΔyhjH-like swimming velocities (Figure 2B). Since all four suppressors performed well in motility plates, we speculated that motA(G93V) and motA(S96L) might only display their enhanced swimming capability at increased viscosity, conditions that more closely mimic the situation on motility plates. Indeed, when medium viscosity was increased by the addition of Ficoll (10%), all suppressor mutants showed higher swimming speeds than the yhjH mutant, albeit not reaching the values of WT cells under these conditions (Figure 2B). Thus, the differences in swimming velocity between the ΔyhjH mutant and the motile suppressors are more pronounced under conditions of increased viscosity.Figure S2Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Suppressor mutants perform well in motility test plates.

The G93 and S96 residues are conserved in MotA proteins (Figure 2A), even among species that do not possess a copy of YcgR. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges identified in this study do not occur in any native MotA sequences in the databases (470 sequences were checked). This indicates that G93 and S96 might play a role in motility that goes beyond the genetic interaction with ycgR. Indeed, we found that two of the suppressor mutants harbor partially defective motors that outperform WT motors only under conditions of elevated c-di-GMP—e.g., in a ΔyhjH background—but display inferior motility in a yhjH+ background (Figure S2B). Nevertheless, on the basis of the above observations, it appeared plausible that YcgR directly interacts with MotA in a c-di-GMP-dependent fashion. To test this idea, we first sought to analyze the subcellular localization of YcgR with the help of a yfp-ycgR fusion expressed from a plasmid. As a marker for the localization of flagellar basal bodies, we coexpressed a cfp-fliM fusion (Sourjik and Berg, 2002Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Binding of the Escherichia coli response regulator CheY to its target measured in vivo by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12669-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). When expressed in the ΔyhjH mutant, both fusion proteins localized to randomly distributed foci in the cell envelope. The majority of ΔyhjH mutant cells showed at least two distinct YFP-YcgR foci, while some cells displayed up to eight foci (Figure 3A , Movie S2, part A). Whereas in the ΔyhjH mutant most of the YcgR foci colocalized with CFP-FliM foci, strains that either harbor a WT copy of yhjH (yhjH+) or a deletion of motA (ΔyhjH ΔmotA) displayed irregular, patchy YFP-YcgR fluorescence that was not cell envelope associated and did not colocalize with CFP-FliM (Figure 3A, Movie S2, parts B and E). Thus, YcgR (but not FliM) focus formation was only observed at elevated c-di-GMP (in the presence of ΔyhjH) and in the presence of MotA (Figure 3A). When WT motA was replaced by the motA suppressor alleles, the number of YcgR foci was strongly reduced in the absence of YhjH. The few YcgR foci still visible in the motA suppressor strains generally colocalized with FliM (Figure 3A; Movie S2, parts C and D; and data not shown). Together, these findings suggested that YcgR, upon binding of c-di-GMP, localizes to the flagellar motors, where it interacts with WT MotA, but less efficiently with MotA, harboring exchanges of G93 or S96. To provide evidence for a direct interaction of YcgR and MotA in vivo, we measured FRET between MotA-CFP and YFP-YcgR fusion proteins coexpressed from plasmids. FRET was determined via acceptor photobleaching (Kentner and Sourjik, 2009Kentner D. Sourjik V. Dynamic map of protein interactions in the Escherichia coli chemotaxis pathway.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 238Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (for a typical FRET measurement, see Figure S3). Consistent with the delocalized pattern of YcgR in WT cells, no FRET signal was observed in the presence of the PDE YhjH. In contrast, the ΔyhjH mutant showed a pronounced FRET signal that was further increased in a strain lacking additional PDEs and thus displaying an even higher cellular level of c-di-GMP (Figure 3B). Importantly, FRET signals between YcgR and MotA variants harboring exchanges of G93 or S96 were strongly reduced or completely abolished (Figure 3B). Taken together, these experiments suggested that YcgR directly interacts with MotA complexes assembled at flagellar basal bodies and that the efficiency of this interaction correlates with the cellular level of c-di-GMP. MotA variants that fail to interact with YcgR and facilitate flagellar function at high c-di-GMP levels harbor exchanges in or close to the FliG-MotA interface, suggesting that YcgR binding might interfere with motor function by modulating the stator-rotor interaction. Next, we asked how YcgR controls flagellar-driven cell velocity. In principle it could—in analogy to a clutch—uncouple the stator units fr"

The similarities of these responses with mucosal responses to parasitic intestinal worms may reveal pathways relevant to the perplexing rise of these chronic inflammatory disorders. Studies of the initiation and maintenance of asthma and allergic inflammation implicate dysregulated interactions between mucosal epithelia and innate immune cells as the underlying cause of these disorders. The similarities of these responses with mucosal responses to parasitic intestinal worms may reveal pathways relevant to the perplexing rise of these chronic inflammatory disorders. Asthma is a syndrome characterized by intermittent attacks, often nocturnal, of breathlessness, wheezing, and cough. Onset of the disease is most common during childhood, when it can usually be controlled with inhaled medications. Asthma runs a variable natural history, and as many as one in four patients may continue to have symptoms that persist or recur in adulthood. The childhood disease is often associated with other allergic disorders, such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) and seasonal rhinitis (hayfever). The latter manifestations can precede the recognition of full-blown asthma, a processive sequence denoted the “atopic march.” Patients with persistent disease into adulthood, or those who have onset in adulthood, are more likely to include subgroups with more frequent and severe episodes that require intensification of therapy. In general, however, the severity of the disease is usually established at or near the time of onset. A breakthrough in the understanding of asthma pathogenesis was made with the recognition that chronic inflammation of the conducting airways characterizes the disease, even during asymptomatic periods. Inflammation includes the presence of CD4 T helper 2 (Th2) cells and Th2-associated cytokines, as well as eosinophils, a finding that has greatly informed experimental animal studies seeking to understand the initiation and maintenance of allergic immunity (Robinson et al., 1992Robinson D.S. Hamid Q. Ying S. Tsicopoulos A. Barkans J. Bentley A.M. Corrigan C. Durham S.R. Kay A.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). More recent findings have suggested that IL-17-associated neutrophil inflammation of the airways and even “pauci-granulocytic” subtypes with minimal inflammatory cell infiltrates can occur (Wenzel, 2006Wenzel S.E. Lancet. 2006; 368: 804-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Whether alternative forms of inflammation represent distinct subtypes of the disease or heterogeneity in the response to currently available therapeutics, or both, is unknown. Persistent inflammation, possibly fueled by immune responses to repeated inhalations of environmental allergens, such as pollens, grasses, animal danders, molds, and excreta from urban-dwelling insects (particularly dust mites and cockroaches), results in compensatory structural airway alterations. These include epithelial mucus metaplasia, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and enhanced deposition of subepithelial matrix glycoproteins. These changes, collectively termed “airway remodeling,” are thought to lead to the persistent, poorly reversible airflow limitations and airway hyper-responsiveness found in some patients with chronic asthma. Airway hyper-responsiveness is revealed by aerosolized agonist drugs, such as methacholine, that induce smooth muscle contraction, by respiratory irritants, including pollutants (e.g., sulfur dioxide, diesel fuel particles), or by recurrent respiratory virus infections, such as those caused by rhinoviruses or respiratory syncytial viruses. Despite many advances, it is clear that no animal model completely simulates the human disease. More access to human tissues will be required to gain a deeper understanding of the natural history, breadth, and pathogenesis of asthma. Asthma and allergic inflammation, including food allergies, have increased over the past 50 years to become the most prevalent chronic illnesses of childhood in developed countries. The estimated worldwide prevalence of asthma is 300 million persons. In the United States, childhood asthma prevalence more than doubled between 1980 and the mid-1990s, with 2007 estimates projecting 16.2 million adults and 6.7 million children with the disease, over 8% of the population (Moorman et al., 2007Moorman J.E. Rudd R.A. Johnson C.A. King M. Minor P. Bailey C. Scalia M.R. Akinbami L.J. MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2007; 56: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). Although mortality is infrequent, asthma patients drive extensive use of the health care system, accounting for approximately 10 million office visits, 400,000 hospitalizations, and 200,000 emergency room visits; in some communities, one in four emergency room patients are seen for asthma. Annual economic costs approach $20 billion in the United States alone. Over half of patients with asthma have additional allergic diseases, including food allergies. The latter has reached awareness levels such that peanut butter has been essentially banned from grade schools in many metropolitan areas of the United States. The increase in allergic diseases over relatively short time periods implicates environmental factors as overwhelming determinants of disease risk. Genetic predisposition to asthma is clear, however, with family and twin studies suggesting hereditary contributions approaching 60%. Genome-wide studies of asthma in carefully phenotyped populations remain few and, similar to other chronic complex human diseases, suggest relatively small contributions by many loci, few of which have been rigorously quantified (Rogers et al., 2009Rogers A.J. Raby B.A. Lasky-Su J.A. Murphy A. Lazarus R. Klanderman B.J. Sylvia J.S. Ziniti J.P. Lange C. Celedon J.C. et al.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2009; 179: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Posited genome-environment interactions, as proposed for most complex human diseases, are only vaguely defined. Genetic disparities that drive ethnic differences in asthma risk, severity, or drug responsiveness also obscure analysis (Burchard et al., 2003Burchard E.G. Ziv E. Coyle N. Gomez S.L. Tang H. Karter A.J. Mountain J.L. Perez-Stable E.J. Sheppard D. Risch N. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Replication against larger cohorts of well-defined populations will be needed. Intriguing links with genes involved in the pathway for the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes into barrier cells secreting the protein-lipid matrix that regulates skin permeability have suggested a connection with epithelial barrier dysfunction. Common loss-of-function mutations in filaggrin, a cytoskeletal structural protein in keratinocytes, present in up to 10% of Western Europeans and their descendants have been associated with severe atopic dermatitis and, in some studies, with risk for asthma (Muller et al., 2009Muller S. Marenholz I. Lee Y.A. Sengler C. Zitnik S.E. Griffioen R.W. Meglio P. Wahn U. Nickel R. Pediatr. Allergy Immunol. 2009; 20: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Loss of barrier function may establish breaches for allergen entry and priming (Fallon et al., 2009Fallon P.G. Sasaki T. Sandilands A. Campbell L.E. Saunders S.P. Mangan N.E. Callanan J.J. Kawasaki H. Shiohama A. Kubo A. et al.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and/or lead to changes in the commensal microbial flora that alter the homeostatic regulation of immunity in ways that predispose to allergy, perhaps mediated by elaboration of the epithelial cell cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP; Demehri et al., 2009Demehri S. Morimoto M. Holtzman M.J. Kopan R. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000067Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Epidemiologic studies have repeatedly identified more severe viral upper respiratory infections, most commonly rhinoviruses, early in life as a major risk, particularly in families with a history of atopy. An urbanized lifestyle in early life also increases risk, suggesting that post-natal exposure to indoor antigens or urban pollutants affects the quality of subsequent mucosal immunity. Alternatively, loss of exposure to microbes associated with rural environments may shape the infant immune system. Whatever underlies the rising prevalence of asthma, it is recognized that some patients, although the exact proportion is unknown, progress to irreversible lung changes characterized by the increased subepithelial fibrosis and structural hyperplasia of airway remodeling. When severe, these patients can overlap the pathologic spectrum of patients with chronic bronchitis. The impact of primary and secondary smoking exposure has complicated analysis, although cases can occur in nonsmokers. Animal models have been very informative in increasing understanding of asthma, but these are imperfect, and lack of access to patient tissues has hampered the ability to delineate fully the natural history and full spectrum of human disease. Asthma and food allergies are initiated at mucosal surfaces where environmental allergens contact epithelia. The physical properties that endow environmentally widespread entities with allergenic properties are of much interest but, in asthma, at least minimally involve the capacity to be sustained in aerosolized forms that reach conducting airways and evade mucociliary clearance. Allergens may share properties such as stability, protease activity, or molecular mimicry, which endows them with the capacity to penetrate mucus and epithelial barriers and induce cytokine release by engaging innate pattern recognition receptors on epithelia and resident lung myeloid cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells. Natural allergens are typically complex biological mixtures of constituents that share many individual attributes, a feature infrequently addressed in experimental models. Airway inflammation is sustained from these initial encounters through the interactions between epithelia of the airways and recruited antigen-processing cells, likely monocyte-derived dendritic cells, although recent studies suggest that basophils may subserve this function in allergic inflammation in some situations. In this way, adaptive immunity is engaged through the development of antigen-specific memory T cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells, thus establishing the potential for chronicity upon repeated exposures to allergens. The subsequent pathways are based on an amalgamation of mouse studies, often in the setting of overexpression or deletion of various genes, and human studies based largely on in situ analysis and studies of isolated cells and cell lines. Differences in cells, receptors, and anatomy of the airways between the species suggest caveats in creating a unifying hypothesis of current understanding. Of necessity oversimplified, the reader is referred to recent reviews (Barrett and Austen, 2009Barrett N.A. Austen F. Immunity. 2009; 31: 425-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, Lambrecht and Hammad, 2009Lambrecht B.N. Hammad H. Immunity. 2009; 31: 412-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, Saenz et al., 2008Saenz S.A. Taylor B.C. Artis D. Immunol. Rev. 2008; 226: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Briefly, current models envision the release of epithelial cytokines, particularly IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, and CC family chemokines as proximal events important in initiating allergic inflammation (Figure 1). Although few studies are available, IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP can be elicited from epithelia when activated by allergenic stimuli or by helminth parasitic worms and can induce IL-13-dependent allergic inflammation when administered individually to mice or when overexpressed as transgenes. In the lung, TSLP may be released from other sources as well, as epithelial production at this site is lower than in skin and bowel. These cytokines also target resident hematopoietic cells to induce the influx of inflammatory cells from the circulation and the activation and mobilization of dendritic cells. Although all of these cytokines can target multiple cell types, IL-33 potently activates mast cells to secrete vasoactive amines, lipid mediators, chemokines, and cytokines and as such may contribute to anaphylaxis (Pushparaj et al., 2009Pushparaj P.N. Tay H.K. H'ng S.C. Pitman N. Xu D. McKenzie A. Liew F.Y. Melendez A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Basophils, initially fewer in number in parenchymal tissues, are also activated by IL-33 to secrete cytokines, particularly IL-4. IL-25 and IL-33 potently activate IL-25R+ lymphoid cells in tissues that remain incompletely characterized (Fort et al., 2001Fort M.M. Cheung J. Yen D. Li J. Zurawski S.M. Lo S. Menon S. Clifford T. Hunte B. Lesley B. et al.Immunity. 2001; 15: 985-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, Moro et al., 2009Moro K. Yamada T. Tanabe M. Takeuchi T. Ikawa T. Kawamoto H. Furusawa J. Ohtani M. Fujii H. Koyasu S. Nature. 2009; 463: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). When activated, these lymphoid cells respond by producing the key cytokines IL-5 and IL-13. IL-5 mediates the survival of eosinophils, whereas IL-13 mediates the induction of chemokines, the differentiation of mucus-secreting goblet cells, a pro-fibrogenic stromal environment, alternative macrophage activation, and smooth muscle alterations that contribute to enhanced airway hyper-responsiveness. IL-4, which shares use of the type II IL-4 receptor with IL-13, contributes to these functions of IL-13, making this shared receptor an attractive pharmaceutical target. TSLP targets dendritic cells and mediates mobilization, activation, and induction of the TNF superfamily member OX40L. In both mouse and human studies, OX40L-positive dendritic cells activate naive CD4 T cells to an IL-4-competent state, consistent with an important priming step in Th2 cell differentiation. Once activated, IL-4-competent T cells in lymph nodes migrate to B cell zones and differentiate into T follicular helper (TFH) cells or exit into the draining lymph and thence the circulation to complete maturation as Th2 cells (Figure 1). IL-4-secreting TFH cells in parafollicular B cell areas mediate IgE switching and conjugate with B cells to drive IgG1 (and possibly IgG4 in human) switching and affinity maturation within germinal centers in lymph nodes (Reinhardt et al., 2009Reinhardt R.L. Liang H.-E. Locksley R.M. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The understanding of TFH cells has been confusing due to the inability to distinguish these cells by surface phenotype, which is shared among most activated T cells in the lymph node. Most lymph node IL-4-secreting cells during allergic immunity are actually TFH cells that mediate B cell help and not Th2 cells, which exit the lymph node and go to peripheral sites of inflammation. In tissues, effector Th2 cells augment the survival of eosinophils and basophils by secretion of IL-5 and IL-3, respectively, facilitate mast cell survival via IL-9, and contribute antigen-specific elaboration of IL-4 and IL-13 required for epithelial and smooth muscle manifestations of the disease. Eosinophils, when sustained, mediate tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Macrophages assume an alternatively activated state in the setting of IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation and secrete proteases and enzymes involved in matrix remodeling; these cells also participate in restraining tissue inflammation. Many manifestations of the response resemble wound healing and likely target resolution of the mucosal irritation. Over time, allergen-specific IgE (and, in the mouse, IgG1) antibodies occupy the high-affinity IgE Fc immunoglobulin receptor, FcɛRI, expressed on mast cells and basophils (and, in the mouse, the respective IgG1-binding FcγRIII on these cells as well) to provide alternative mechanisms for cell activation by antibody crosslinking. With repeated allergen exposure, FcɛRI activation leads to the rapid production of vasoactive amines and lipid mediators that underlie the acute fall in respiratory function after allergen challenge, while also driving the elaboration of cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators that regulate the delayed phase of the inflammatory process amplified by recruited cells. A common emergent theme is the role of adaptive immunity in providing cytokines and growth factors that sustain the recruitment, retention, and extended life span of a select group of myeloid cells, including eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells, in involved tissues. Occupancy of FcɛRI by IgE can itself enhance the survival of mast cells and basophils, and serum IgE levels in humans correlate with FcɛRI expression levels on dendritic cells, where, unlike in the mouse, components of the FcɛRI are constitutively present on additional types of hematopoietic cells (Kraft and Kinet, 2007Kraft S. Kinet J.-P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Even relatively rare cell types, such as basophils, are increased in tissues from cases of fatal asthma (Kepley et al., 2001Kepley C.L. McFeeley P.J. Oliver J.M. Lipscomb M.F. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Control of inflammation by regulatory T cells (Treg) may also be compromised in asthma, although the precise pathways remain unclear. TGF-β and IL-10 have been implicated in the resolution of allergic inflammation by Treg, but dysregulated expression of these cytokines has been connected with progressive fibrosis and with a diminished capacity to restrain respiratory viruses, respectively. Further study of the natural history of Treg and their specificity in allergic lung inflammation is needed (Lloyd and Hawrylowicz, 2009Lloyd C.M. Hawrylowicz C.M. Immunity. 2009; 31: 438-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). With repeated allergen exposure, eosinophil and basophil infiltration become sustained, the mast cell pool enlarges, the epithelia undergo enhanced goblet cell differentiation with copious mucus production, thickening of the basal lamina reticularis is apparent, and increases in smooth muscle mass occur. The result is hyper-responsiveness to common airway irritants. Although much insight has been gained in understanding the pathogenesis of asthma associated with Th2 cells and allergic pathology, very little is understood regarding the mechanisms that sustain airway inflammation among patients with neutrophilic or “pauci-granulocytic” presentations that make up a substantial number of adult-onset cases of asthma. Common environmental allergens are complex mixtures of bioactive entities. House dust mite allergens that elicit IgE reactivity include a papain-like cysteine protease; a lipid-binding MD-2 molecular mimetic capable of augmenting TLR4 signaling (Trompette et al., 2009Trompette A. Divanovic S. Visintin A. Blanchard C. Hegde R.S. Madan R. Thorne P.S. Wills-Karp M. Gioannini T.L. Weiss J.P. Karp C.L. Nature. 2009; 457: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar); trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and serine proteases; fatty acid- and lipid-binding proteins; chitinases; and at least ten other proteins (Thomas et al., 2002Thomas W.R. Smith W.-A. Hales B.J. Mills K.L. O'Brien R.M. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2002; 129: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Chitin and a variety of polymeric glycans are also present in mite and cockroach fecal pellets. Cockroach allergens are similarly diverse and include active proteases and lipid-binding proteins involved in food digestion that are secreted in the fecal pellets. Fungi, a highly diverse spectrum of organisms, can contribute up to 10% of the particulate mass in air of sufficient size to be inhaled into the terminal airways and alveoli (Frohlich-Nowoisky et al., 2009Frohlich-Nowoisky J. Pickersgill D.A. Despres V.R. Poschl U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 12814-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Fungi contain cell wall chitin and β-glucans that potently elicit eosinophil and neutrophil tissue infiltration in experimental models and also secrete proteases implicated in allergic lung immunity (Porter et al., 2009Porter P. Susarla S.C. Polikepahad S. Qian Y. Hampton J. Kiss A. Vaidya S. Sur S. Ongeri V. Yang T. et al.Mucosal Immunol. 2009; 2: 504-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Chitinases and β-glucanases are present in plants and are induced in edible fruits and berries as part of evolutionarily ancient components of defense against invasive chitin-bearing fungi and insects. Like chitinases in insect excreta, these plant-derived proteins, together with a number of lipid-binding proteins, are common targets of IgE reactivity in atopic individuals. Cross-reactivity of IgE may occur among these shared group responses. Such cross-reactivity with chitin- and β-glucan-binding domain-like structures in natural latex rubber has been proposed to contribute to the prevalence of “latex-fruit syndrome”; similar cross-reactivity may underlie the emergence of “pollen-food allergy syndrome.” Immunologists are only beginning to explore these complex antigen mixtures in experimental models of allergic lung disease, which, in humans, is sustained by “cocktails” of diverse natural substances that intersect multiple innate immune pathways and contribute to allergenic priming and inflammation. Cell wall β-glucans in fungi are potent stimuli of dectin C-type lectin receptors on dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils and initiate IL-17-driven neutrophilic infiltration that may be relevant to the understanding of inflammatory subsets of asthma (Goodridge et al., 2009Goodridge H.S. Wolf A.J. Underhill D.M. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 230: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Chitin, an insoluble polymer of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, is a structural element shared by fungi, crustacea, helminthes, and insects and constitutes, after cellulose, the most widespread natural biopolymer. When administered to the airways of mice, chitin induces a leukotriene-mediated infiltrate of eosinophils and basophils and drives alternative macrophage activation in both resident and recruited macrophages (Reese et al., 2007Reese T.A. Liang H.-E. Tager A.M. Luster A.D. Van Rooijen N. Voehringer D. Locksley R.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). A conserved epithelial and macrophage chitinase, AMCase, is rapidly induced by a Stat6-dependent pathway and degrades chitin, thus solubilizing the particulate structure. Chitin is a component of the fungal cell wall and a constituent of the insect peritrophic matrix (PM). The PM is a complex network of chitin, chitin-binding proteins, glycoproteins, and glycans that encloses the food bolus with a mix of intestinal digestive enzymes (Hegedus et al., 2009Hegedus D. Erlandson M. Gillott C. Toprak U. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2009; 54: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Spatially compartmentalizing the digestive process in the insect, the PM is ultimately excreted as fecal particles enveloping the digestive enzymes, including the allergenic proteases and lipid-binding proteins. Further work is necessary to establish whether environmental chitin from molds and insect excreta contributes to their sensitizing capacity, and whether such associations contribute to links between asthma risk and prevalent human variants of AMCase (Seibold et al., 2009Seibold M.A. Reese T.A. Choudhry S. Salam M.T. Beckman K. Eng C. Atakilit A. Meade K. Lenoir M. Watson H.G. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19650-19658Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, variants of the chitin-binding chi-lectin, YKL-40, have also been associated with asthma (Ober et al., 2008Ober C. Tan Z. Sun Y. Possick J.D. Pan L. Nicolae R. Radford S. Parry R.R. Heinzmann A. Deichmann K.A. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 1652-1691Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Several recent reports have used approaches to isolate MHC class II expression to basophils in experimental mouse systems involving proteases, helminths, IgE-mediated immunity, and airways challenge to suggest a requisite role for basophils as antigen-processing and -presenting cells in allergic immunity (Niu et al., 2009Niu N.

Together, the findings in multiple systems using creative reagents demand further scrutiny of the possibility, although caution will be required before divesting dendritic cells of their role in Th2-associated lung immunity. Mechanisms for purifying and identifying basophils, and for maintaining their viability, remain imperfect, and reliance on FcɛRI antibodies for basophil deletion and detection may be problematic if mouse dendritic cells in allergic inflammatory states can be induced to express this receptor (Grayson et al., 2007Grayson M.H. Cheung D. Rohlfing M.M. Kitchens R. Spiegel D.E. Tucker J. Battaile J.T. Alevy Y. Yan L. Agapov E. et al.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Novel reagents that direct MHC class II to CD11c-expressing cells were used to demonstrate the lack of need for classical dendritic cells but do not recapitulate wild-type expression of MHC class II on dendritic cells, particularly on migratory dendritic cells required for the efficient induction of effector immunity (Allenspach et al., 2008Allenspach E.J. Lemos M.P. Porrett P.M. Turka L.A. Laufer T.M. Immunity. 2008; 29: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Further, CD11c is expressed on other cells during allergic inflammation, including eosinophils (Voehringer et al., 2004Voehringer D. Shinkai K. Locksley R.M.

Indeed, all myeloid cells, including neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and monocyte/macrophages can be induced to express MHC class II and some have been linked with antigen presentation (Kambayashi et al., 2009Kambayashi T.

In each case, expression of MHC class II is low compared to mature dendritic cells and is more compatible with a role for these cells in augmenting inflammation through interactions with effector Th2 cells in peripheral tissues rather than in priming naive T cells in lymph nodes, where activation thresholds are greater. Indeed, activation of naive T cells to gain IL-4 competence is IL-4 independent during priming in lymph nodes (van Panhuys et al., 2008van Panhuys N. Tang S.C. Prout M. Camberis M. Scarlett D. Roberts J. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E. Le Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12423-12428Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but entry into and/or maturation of Th2 cells in tissues is highly Stat6 dependent, suggesting the need for exogenous IL-4 in mediating localization, maturation, and/or activation of Th2 cells in affected tissues rather than in lymph node priming. Here, imaging studies would allow more compelling evidence that basophils, as compared to dendritic cells, can mediate efficient activation of naive T cells in lymph nodes. Accurate lineage marking of basophils has not been accomplished and remains a pressing need. Regardless, the confluence of the recent studies requires further investigation, including extension to humans, in order not to overlook findings of fundamental importance. Contributions of other IL-13-producing cells, such as incompletely characterized IL-25R+ lymphoid cells in lung and intestinal tissues, need to be examined, particularly in humans, as targeting IL-25, a potent activator of these cells, has substantial benefits in animal models of allergic lung inflammation (Ballantyne et al., 2007Ballantyne S.J.

The absence of efficient imaging modalities has stymied efforts to more accurately assess components of allergic inflammation in the lung and draining lymph nodes. The lung presents a complex highly branched tissue optimized for gas exchange but offering a large mucosal surface for antigen surveillance. A heterogeneous group of lung dendritic cells and macrophages patrol epithelia from the large conducting airways to the alveolae, and the balance of tolerance-inducing and stimulatory responses is only beginning to be unraveled (Lambrecht and Hammad, 2009Lambrecht B.N.

This may reflect a reduced systemic remethylation capacity, which would be expected to cause decreased genomic DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL).We examined the association between prevalence of CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke) and its predisposing conditions (hypertension, diabetes) and PBL global genomic DNA methylation as represented by ALU and Satellite 2 (AS) repetitive element DNA methylation in 286 participants of the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based prospective investigation of 63,257 men and women aged 45-74 years recruited during 1993-1998. Men exhibited significantly higher global DNA methylation [geometric mean (95% confidence interval (CI)): 159 (143, 178)] than women [133 (121, 147)] (P = 0.01). Global DNA methylation was significantly elevated in men with a history of CVD or its predisposing conditions at baseline (P = 0.03) but not in women (P = 0.53). Fifty-two subjects (22 men, 30 women) who were negative for these CVD/predisposing conditions at baseline acquired one or more of these conditions by the time of their follow-up I interviews, which took place on average about 5.8 years post-enrollment. Global DNA methylation levels of the 22 incident cases in men were intermediate (AS, 177) relative to the 56 male subjects who remained free of CVD/predisposing conditions at follow-up (lowest AS, 132) and the 51 male subjects with a diagnosis of CVD or predisposing conditions reported at baseline (highest AS 184) (P for trend = 0.0008) No such association was observed in women (P = 0.91). Baseline body mass index was positively associated with AS in both men and women (P = 0.007).Our findings indicate that elevated, not decreased, PBL DNA methylation is positively associated with prevalence of CVD/predisposing conditions and obesity in Singapore Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2060146392,"Nearly 1% of children in the United States exhibit autism spectrum disorders, but causes and treatments remain to be identified. Mice with deletion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene are used to model autism because loss of Fmr1 gene function causes Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and many people with FXS exhibit autistic-like behaviors. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is hyperactive in brains of Fmr1 knockout mice, and inhibition of GSK3 by lithium administration ameliorates some behavioral impairment in these mice. We extended our studies of this association by testing whether GSK3 contributes to socialization behaviors. This used two mouse models with disrupted regulation of GSK3, Fmr1 knockout mice and GSK3 knockin mice, in which inhibitory serines of the two isoforms of GSK3, GSK3alpha and GSK3beta, are mutated to alanines, leaving GSK3 fully active.To assess sociability, test mice were introduced to a restrained stimulus mouse (S1) for 10 min, followed by introduction of a second restrained stimulus mouse (S2) for 10 min, which assesses social preference. Fmr1 knockout and GSK3 knockin mice displayed no deficit in sociability with the S1 mouse, but unlike wild-type mice neither demonstrated social preference for the novel S2 mouse. Fmr1 knockout mice displayed more anxiety-related behaviors during social interaction (grooming, rearing, and digging) than wild-type mice, which was ameliorated by inhibition of GSK3 with chronic lithium treatment.These results indicate that impaired inhibitory regulation of GSK3 in Fmr1 knockout mice may contribute to some socialization deficits and that lithium treatment can ameliorate certain socialization impairments. As discussed in the present work, these results suggest a role for GSK3 in social behaviors and implicate inhibition of GSK3 as a potential therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W2081253240,"Macrophages promote tissue remodeling but few mechanisms exist to modulate their activity during tissue fibrosis. Serum amyloid P (SAP), a member of the pentraxin family of proteins, signals through Fcγ receptors which are known to affect macrophage activation. We determined that IPF/UIP patients have increased protein levels of several alternatively activated pro-fibrotic (M2) macrophage-associated proteins in the lung and monocytes from these patients show skewing towards an M2 macrophage phenotype. SAP therapeutically inhibits established bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, when administered systemically or locally to the lungs. The reduction in aberrant collagen deposition was associated with a reduction in M2 macrophages in the lung and increased IP10/CXCL10. These data highlight the role of macrophages in fibrotic lung disease, and demonstrate a therapeutic action of SAP on macrophages which may extend to many fibrotic indications caused by over-exuberant pro-fibrotic macrophage responses."
https://openalex.org/W2021988052,"Background Dinoflagellates are unicellular, often photosynthetic protists that play a major role in the dynamics of the Earth's oceans and climate. Sequencing of dinoflagellate nuclear DNA is thwarted by their massive genome sizes that are often several times that in humans. However, modern transcriptomic methods offer promising approaches to tackle this challenging system. Here, we used massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) to understand global transcriptional regulation patterns in Alexandrium tamarense cultures that were grown under four different conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings We generated more than 40,000 unique short expression signatures gathered from the four conditions. Of these, about 11,000 signatures did not display detectable differential expression patterns. At a p-value < 1E-10, 1,124 signatures were differentially expressed in the three treatments, xenic, nitrogen-limited, and phosphorus-limited, compared to the nutrient-replete control, with the presence of bacteria explaining the largest set of these differentially expressed signatures. Conclusions/Significance Among microbial eukaryotes, dinoflagellates contain the largest number of genes in their nuclear genomes. These genes occur in complex families, many of which have evolved via recent gene duplication events. Our expression data suggest that about 73% of the Alexandrium transcriptome shows no significant change in gene expression under the experimental conditions used here and may comprise a “core” component for this species. We report a fundamental shift in expression patterns in response to the presence of bacteria, highlighting the impact of biotic interaction on gene expression in dinoflagellates."
https://openalex.org/W2066208434,"Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease and a leading cause of visual disability. Automated assessment of the visual field determines the different stages in the disease process: it would be desirable to link these measurements taken in the clinic with patient's actual function, or establish if patients compensate for their restricted field of view when performing everyday tasks. Hence, this study investigated eye movements in glaucomatous patients when viewing driving scenes in a hazard perception test (HPT).The HPT is a component of the UK driving licence test consisting of a series of short film clips of various traffic scenes viewed from the driver's perspective each containing hazardous situations that require the camera car to change direction or slow down. Data from nine glaucomatous patients with binocular visual field defects and ten age-matched control subjects were considered (all experienced drivers). Each subject viewed 26 different films with eye movements simultaneously monitored by an eye tracker. Computer software was purpose written to pre-process the data, co-register it to the film clips and to quantify eye movements and point-of-regard (using a dynamic bivariate contour ellipse analysis). On average, and across all HPT films, patients exhibited different eye movement characteristics to controls making, for example, significantly more saccades (P<0.001; 95% confidence interval for mean increase: 9.2 to 22.4%). Whilst the average region of 'point-of-regard' of the patients did not differ significantly from the controls, there were revealing cases where patients failed to see a hazard in relation to their binocular visual field defect.Characteristics of eye movement patterns in patients with bilateral glaucoma can differ significantly from age-matched controls when viewing a traffic scene. Further studies of eye movements made by glaucomatous patients could provide useful information about the definition of the visual field component required for fitness to drive."
https://openalex.org/W1996989652,"Background Advanced-stage ovarian cancer patients are generally treated with platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy after primary debulking surgery. However, there is a wide range of outcomes for individual patients. Therefore, the clinicopathological factors alone are insufficient for predicting prognosis. Our aim is to identify a progression-free survival (PFS)-related molecular profile for predicting survival of patients with advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings Advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer tissues from 110 Japanese patients who underwent primary surgery and platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy were profiled using oligonucleotide microarrays. We selected 88 PFS-related genes by a univariate Cox model (p<0.01) and generated the prognostic index based on 88 PFS-related genes after adjustment of regression coefficients of the respective genes by ridge regression Cox model using 10-fold cross-validation. The prognostic index was independently associated with PFS time compared to other clinical factors in multivariate analysis [hazard ratio (HR), 3.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.66–5.43; p<0.0001]. In an external dataset, multivariate analysis revealed that this prognostic index was significantly correlated with PFS time (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.20–1.98; p = 0.0008). Furthermore, the correlation between the prognostic index and overall survival time was confirmed in the two independent external datasets (log rank test, p = 0.0010 and 0.0008). Conclusions/Significance The prognostic ability of our index based on the 88-gene expression profile in ridge regression Cox hazard model was shown to be independent of other clinical factors in predicting cancer prognosis across two distinct datasets. Further study will be necessary to improve predictive accuracy of the prognostic index toward clinical application for evaluation of the risk of recurrence in patients with advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2036236019,"Background Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a common disease affecting up to 5% of pregnancies and which can cause fetal arrhythmia and sudden intrauterine death. We previously demonstrated that bile acid taurocholate (TC), which is raised in the bloodstream of ICP, can acutely alter the rate and rhythm of contraction and induce abnormal calcium destabilization in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM). Apart from their hepatic functions bile acids are ubiquitous signalling molecules with diverse systemic effects mediated by either the nuclear receptor FXR or by a recently discovered G-protein coupled receptor TGR5. We aim to investigate the mechanism of bile-acid induced arrhythmogenic effects in an in-vitro model of the fetal heart. Methods and Results Levels of bile acid transporters and nuclear receptor FXR were studied by quantitative real time PCR, western blot and immunostaining, which showed low levels of expression. We did not observe functional involvement of the canonical receptors FXR and TGR5. Instead, we found that TC binds to the muscarinic M2 receptor in NRCM and serves as a partial agonist of this receptor in terms of inhibitory effect on intracellular cAMP and negative chronotropic response. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-knockdown of the M2 receptor completely abolished the negative effect of TC on contraction, calcium transient amplitude and synchronisation in NRCM clusters. Conclusion We conclude that in NRCM the TC-induced arrhythmia is mediated by the partial agonism at the M2 receptor. This mechanism might serve as a promising new therapeutic target for fetal arrhythmia."
https://openalex.org/W2091649526,"Background The Influenza A pandemic H1N1 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus appeared in India in May 2009 and thereafter outbreaks with considerable morbidity and mortality have been reported from many parts of the country. Continuous monitoring of the genetic makeup of the virus is essential to understand its evolution within the country in relation to global diversification and to track the mutations that may affect the behavior of the virus. Methods H1N1pdm viruses were isolated from both recovered and fatal cases representing major cities and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of six concatenated whole genomes and the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of seven more isolates from May-September 2009 was performed with reference to 685 whole genomes of global isolates available as of November 24, 2009. Molecular characterization of all the 8 segments was carried out for known pathogenic markers. Results The first isolate of May 2009 belonged to clade 5. Although clade 7 was the dominant H1N1pdm lineage in India, both clades 6 and 7 were found to be co-circulating. The neuraminidase of all the Indian isolates possessed H275, the marker for sensitivity to the neuraminidase inhibitor Oseltamivir. Some of the mutations in HA are at or in the vicinity of antigenic sites and may therefore be of possible antigenic significance. Among these a D222G mutation in the HA receptor binding domain was found in two of the eight Indian isolates obtained from fatal cases. Conclusions The majority of the 13 Indian isolates grouped in the globally most widely circulating H1N1pdm clade 7. Further, correlations of the mutations specific to clade 7 Indian isolates to viral fitness and adaptability in the country remains to be understood. The D222G mutation in HA from isolates of fatal cases needs to be studied for pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2033451853,"Background Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the presence of anti-transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and anti-gliadin antibodies. Amongst the neurological dysfunctions associated with CD, ataxia represents the most common one. Methods We analyzed by immunohistochemistry, the anti-neural reactivity of the serum from 20 CD patients. To determine the role of anti-TG2 antibodies in ataxia, two anti-TG2 single chain variable fragments (scFv), isolated from a phage-display IgA antibody library, were characterized by immunohistochemistry and ELISA, and injected in mice to study their effects on motor coordination. We found that 75% of the CD patient population without evidence of neurological involvement, has circulating anti-neural IgA and/or IgG antibodies. Two anti-TG2 scFvs, cloned from one CD patient, stained blood vessels but only one reacted with neurons. This anti-TG2 antibody showed cross reactivity with the transglutaminase isozymes TG3 and TG6. Intraventricular injection of the anti-TG2 or the anti-TG2/3/6 cross-reactive scFv provoked transient, equally intensive ataxia in mice. Conclusion The serum from CD patients contains anti-TG2, TG3 and TG6 antibodies that may potentially cause ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2017091960,"Our expectations of an object's heaviness not only drive our fingertip forces, but also our perception of heaviness. This effect is highlighted by the classic size-weight illusion (SWI), where different-sized objects of identical mass feel different weights. Here, we examined whether these expectations are sufficient to induce the SWI in a single wooden cube when lifted without visual feedback, by varying the size of the object seen prior to the lift.Participants, who believed that they were lifting the same object that they had just seen, reported that the weight of the single, standard-sized cube that they lifted on every trial varied as a function of the size of object they had just seen. Seeing the small object before the lift made the cube feel heavier than it did after seeing the large object. These expectations also affected the fingertip forces that were used to lift the object when vision was not permitted. The expectation-driven errors made in early trials were not corrected with repeated lifting, and participants failed to adapt their grip and load forces from the expected weight to the object's actual mass in the same way that they could when lifting with vision.Vision appears to be crucial for the detection, and subsequent correction, of the ostensibly non-visual grip and load force errors that are a common feature of this type of object interaction. Expectations of heaviness are not only powerful enough to alter the perception of a single object's weight, but also continually drive the forces we use to lift the object when vision is unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W1985946985,"The nuclear receptors encompass a group of regulatory proteins involved in a number of physiological processes. The estrogen receptors (ERs), of which one alpha and one beta form exist in mammals function as transcription factors in response to 17β-estradiol (E2). In zebrafish there are three gene products of estrogen receptors and they are denoted esr1 (ERalpha), esr2a (ERbeta2) and esr2b (ERbeta1). Total RNA of zebrafish early life stages (<3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post fertilization) and of adult fish (liver, intestine, eye, heart, brain, ovary, testis, gill, swim bladder and kidney) were isolated following in vivo exposures. Using specific primers for each of the three zebrafish ERs the expression levels were quantified using real time PCR methodology. It was shown that in absence of exposure all three estrogen receptors were expressed in adult fish. The levels of expression of two of these three ER genes, the esr1 and esr2a were altered in organs such as liver, intestine, brain and testis in response to ligand (E2, diethylstilbestrol or 4-nonylphenol). During embryogenesis two of the three receptor genes, esr1 and esr2b were expressed, and in presence of ligand the mRNA levels of these two genes increased. The conclusions are i) estrogen receptor genes are expressed during early development ii) altered expression of esr genes in response to ligand is dependent on the cellular context; iii) the estrogenic ligand 4-nonylphenol, a manufactured compound commonly found in sewage of water treatment plants, acts as an agonist of the estrogen receptor during development and has both agonist and antagonist properties in tissues of adult fish. This knowledge of esr gene function in development and in adult life will help to understand mechanisms of interfering mimicking endocrine chemicals in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1963851023,"Psoriasis is one of the most frequent skin diseases world-wide. The disease impacts enormously on affected patients and poses a huge financial burden on health care providers. Several lines of evidence suggest that the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator activator (PPAR) beta/delta, known to regulate epithelial differentiation and wound healing, contributes to psoriasis pathogenesis. It is unclear, however, whether activation of PPARbeta/delta is sufficient to trigger psoriasis-like changes in vivo.Using immunohistochemistry, we define the distribution of PPARbeta/delta in the skin lesions of psoriasis. By expression profiling, we confirm that PPARbeta/delta is overexpressed in the vast majority of psoriasis patients. We further establish a transgenic model allowing inducible activation of PPARbeta/delta in murine epidermis mimicking its distribution in psoriasis lesions. Upon activation of PPARbeta/delta, transgenic mice sustain an inflammatory skin disease strikingly similar to psoriasis, featuring hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, dendritic cell accumulation, and endothelial activation. Development of this phenotype requires the activation of the Th17 subset of T cells, shown previously to be central to psoriasis. Moreover, gene dysregulation in the transgenic mice is highly similar to that in psoriasis. Key transcriptional programs activated in psoriasis, including IL1-related signalling and cholesterol biosynthesis, are replicated in the mouse model, suggesting that PPARbeta/delta regulates these transcriptional changes in psoriasis. Finally, we identify phosphorylation of STAT3 as a novel pathway activated by PPARbeta/delta and show that inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation blocks disease development.Activation of PPARbeta/delta in the epidermis is sufficient to trigger inflammatory changes, immune activation, and signalling, and gene dysregulation characteristic of psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W2045629309,"Autophagy is a highly conserved and regulated cellular process employed by living cells to degrade proteins and organelles as a response to metabolic stress. We have previously reported that eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2 kinase, also known as Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III) can positively modulate autophagy and negatively regulate protein synthesis. The purpose of the current study was to determine the role of the eEF-2 kinase-regulated autophagy in the response of breast cancer cells to inhibitors of growth factor signaling.We found that nutrient depletion or growth factor inhibitors activated autophagy in human breast cancer cells, and the increased activity of autophagy was associated with a decrease in cellular ATP and an increase in activities of AMP kinase and eEF-2 kinase. Silencing of eEF-2 kinase relieved the inhibition of protein synthesis, led to a greater reduction of cellular ATP, and blunted autophagic response. We further showed that suppression of eEF-2 kinase-regulated autophagy impeded cell growth in serum/nutrient-deprived cultures and handicapped cell survival, and enhanced the efficacy of the growth factor inhibitors such as trastuzumab, gefitinib, and lapatinib.The results of this study provide new evidence that activation of eEF-2 kinase-mediated autophagy plays a protective role for cancer cells under metabolic stress conditions, and that targeting autophagic survival may represent a novel approach to enhancing the effectiveness of growth factor inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1994730019,"The hypoxic microenvironment contributes to embryonic development and tumor progression through stabilization of the potent transcriptional factor HIFalpha. In normoxia, the tumor suppressor protein VHL acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to target HIFalpha for proteolytic destruction. Increasing evidence shows that VHL is a multifunctional adaptor involved in inhibition of HIFalpha-dependent and independent cellular processes. However, the molecular effect of hypoxic stress on VHL functions remains elusive. Here we report that PIASy, a SUMO E3 ligase upregulated in hypoxia, interacts with VHL and induces VHL SUMOylation on lysine residue 171. Moreover, PIASy-mediated SUMO1 modification induces VHL oligomerization and abrogates its inhibitory function on tumor cell growth, migration and clonogenicity. Knockdown of PIASy by small interfering RNA leads to reduction of VHL oligomerization and increases HIF1alpha degradation. These findings reveal a unique molecular strategy for inactivation of VHL under hypoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2056155495,"As the amount of data from genome wide association studies grows dramatically, many interesting scientific questions require imputation to combine or expand datasets. However, there are two situations for which imputation has been problematic: (1) polymorphisms with low minor allele frequency (MAF), and (2) datasets where subjects are genotyped on different platforms. Traditional measures of imputation cannot effectively address these problems.We introduce a new statistic, the imputation quality score (IQS). In order to differentiate between well-imputed and poorly-imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), IQS adjusts the concordance between imputed and genotyped SNPs for chance. We first evaluated IQS in relation to minor allele frequency. Using a sample of subjects genotyped on the Illumina 1 M array, we extracted those SNPs that were also on the Illumina 550 K array and imputed them to the full set of the 1 M SNPs. As expected, the average IQS value drops dramatically with a decrease in minor allele frequency, indicating that IQS appropriately adjusts for minor allele frequency. We then evaluated whether IQS can filter poorly-imputed SNPs in situations where cases and controls are genotyped on different platforms. Randomly dividing the data into ""cases"" and ""controls"", we extracted the Illumina 550 K SNPs from the cases and imputed the remaining Illumina 1 M SNPs. The initial Q-Q plot for the test of association between cases and controls was grossly distorted (lambda = 1.15) and had 4016 false positives, reflecting imputation error. After filtering out SNPs with IQS<0.9, the Q-Q plot was acceptable and there were no longer false positives. We then evaluated the robustness of IQS computed independently on the two halves of the data. In both European Americans and African Americans the correlation was >0.99 demonstrating that a database of IQS values from common imputations could be used as an effective filter to combine data genotyped on different platforms.IQS effectively differentiates well-imputed and poorly-imputed SNPs. It is particularly useful for SNPs with low minor allele frequency and when datasets are genotyped on different platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2060695219,"A Golgi-associated bi-lobed structure was previously found to be important for Golgi duplication and cell division in Trypanosoma brucei. To further understand its functions, comparative proteomics was performed on extracted flagellar complexes (including the flagellum and flagellum-associated structures such as the basal bodies and the bi-lobe) and purified flagella to identify new bi-lobe proteins. A leucine-rich repeats containing protein, TbLRRP1, was characterized as a new bi-lobe component. The anterior part of the TbLRRP1-labeled bi-lobe is adjacent to the single Golgi apparatus, and the posterior side is tightly associated with the flagellar pocket collar marked by TbBILBO1. Inducible depletion of TbLRRP1 by RNA interference inhibited duplication of the bi-lobe as well as the adjacent Golgi apparatus and flagellar pocket collar. Formation of a new flagellum attachment zone and subsequent cell division were also inhibited, suggesting a central role of bi-lobe in Golgi, flagellar pocket collar and flagellum attachment zone biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2086706156,"The complement system is the main arm of the vertebrate innate immune system against pathogen infection. For the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, subverting the complement system and invading the host cells is crucial to succeed in infection. However, little attention has focused on whether the complement system can effectively control T. cruzi infection. To address this question, we decided to analyse: 1) which complement pathways are activated by T. cruzi using strains isolated from different hosts, 2) the capacity of these strains to resist the complement-mediated killing at nearly physiological conditions, and 3) whether the complement system could limit or control T. cruzi invasion of eukaryotic cells. The complement activating molecules C1q, C3, mannan-binding lectin and ficolins bound to all strains analysed; however, C3b and C4b deposition assays revealed that T. cruzi activates mainly the lectin and alternative complement pathways in non-immune human serum. Strikingly, we detected that metacyclic trypomastigotes of some T. cruzi strains were highly susceptible to complement-mediated killing in non-immune serum, while other strains were resistant. Furthermore, the rate of parasite invasion in eukaryotic cells was decreased by non-immune serum. Altogether, these results establish that the complement system recognizes T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes, resulting in killing of susceptible strains. The complement system, therefore, acts as a physiological barrier which resistant strains have to evade for successful host infection."
https://openalex.org/W2045109499,"Background and Objective Oesophageal cancer is one of the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide. Our previous population-based study reported a high prevalence of oesophageal cancer in Chaoshan, Guangdong Province, China. Ancestors of the Chaoshan population migrated from the Taihang Mountain region of north-central China, which is another high-incidence area for oesophageal cancer. The purpose of the present study was to obtain evidence of inherited susceptibility to oesophageal cancer in the Chaoshan population, with reference to the Taihang Mountain population, with the eventual goal of molecular identification of the disease genes. Methods We conducted familial correlation, commingling, and complex segregation analyses of 224 families from the Chaoshan population and 403 families from the Taihang population using the FPMM program of S.A.G.E. version 5.3.0. A second analysis focused on specific families having large numbers of affected individuals or early onset of the disease. Results For the general population, moderate sib-sib correlation was noticed for esophageal cancer. Additionally, brother-brother correlation was even higher. Commingling analyses indicated that a three-component distribution model best accounts for the variation in age of onset of oesophageal cancer, and that a multifactorial model provides the best fit to the general population data. An autosomal dominant mode and a dominant or recessive major gene with polygenic inheritance were found to be the best models of inherited susceptibility to oesophageal cancer in some large families. Conclusions The current results provide evidence for inherited susceptibility to oesophageal cancer in certain high-risk groups in China, and support efforts to identify the susceptibility genes."
https://openalex.org/W1984446475,"Differentiation programs are aberrant in cancer cells allowing them to express differentiation markers in addition to their tissue of origin. In the present study, we demonstrate the multi-lineage differentiation potential of breast cancer cell lines to express multiple neuronal/glial lineage-specific markers as well as mammary epithelial and melanocytic-specific markers. Multilineage expression was detected in luminal (MCF-7 and SKBR3) and basal (MDA-MB-231) types of human breast cancer cell lines. We also observed comparable co-expression of these three cell lineage markers in MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro, in MDA-MB-435 primary tumors derived from parental and single cell clones and in lung metastases in vivo. Furthermore, ectoderm multi-lineage transdifferentiation was also found in human melanoma (Ul-MeL) and glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and D54). These observations indicate that aberrant multi-lineage transdifferentiation or lineage infidelity may be a wide spread phenomenon in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1995044448,"Background The host's response to infection is characterized by altered levels of neurotrophins and an influx of inflammatory cells to sites of injured tissue. Progenitor cells that give rise to the differentiated cellular mediators of inflammation are derived from bone marrow progenitor cells where their development is regulated, in part, by cues from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). As such, alteration of BMSC function in response to elevated systemic mediators has the potential to alter their function in biologically relevant ways, including downstream alteration of cytokine production that influences hematopoietic development. Methodology/Principal Findings In the current study we investigated BMSC neurotrophin receptor expression by flow cytometric analysis to determine differences in expression as well as potential to respond to NGF or BDNF. Intracellular signaling subsequent to neurotrophin stimulation of BMSC was analyzed by western blot, microarray analysis, confocal microscopy and real-time PCR. Analysis of BMSC Interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression was completed using ELISA and real-time PCR. Conclusion BMSC established from different individuals had distinct expression profiles of the neurotrophin receptors, TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and p75NTR. These receptors were functional, demonstrated by an increase in Akt-phosphorylation following BMSC exposure to recombinant NGF or BDNF. Neurotrophin stimulation of BMSC resulted in increased IL-6 gene and protein expression which required activation of ERK and p38 MAPK signaling, but was not mediated by the NFκB pathway. BMSC response to neurotrophins, including the up-regulation of IL-6, may alter their support of hematopoiesis and regulate the availability of inflammatory cells for migration to sites of injury or infection. As such, these studies are relevant to the growing appreciation of the interplay between neurotropic mediators and the regulation of hematopoiesis."

A functional interference can be taken as evidence that there is a parallel treatment of these two types of information and would argue for the biological grounding of language in action. A novel approach examining the relationship between language and grip force is presented. With eyes closed and arm extended, subjects listened to words relating (verbs) or not relating (nouns) to a manual action while holding a cylinder with an integrated force sensor. There was a change in grip force when subjects heard verbs that related to manual action. Grip force increased from about 100 ms following the verb presentation, peaked at 380 ms and fell abruptly after 400 ms, signalling a possible inhibition of the motor simulation evoked by these words. These observations reveal the intimate relationship that exists between language and grasp and show that it is possible to elucidate online new aspects of sensorimotor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2055330228,"Cell internalization and intracellular fate of H. pylori products/virulence factors in vivo by human gastric epithelium, the main target of H. pylori-induced pathologies (i.e., peptic ulcer and cancer), are still largely unknown. Investigating gastric endoscopic biopsies from dyspeptic patients by means of ultrastructural immunocytochemistry, here we show that, in human superficial-foveolar epithelium and its metaplastic or dysplastic foci, H. pylori virulence factors accumulated in a discrete cytoplasmic structure characterized by 13-nm-thick cylindrical particles of regular punctate-linear substructure resembling the proteasome complex in size and structure. Inside this particle-rich cytoplasmic structure (PaCS) we observed colocalization of VacA, CagA, urease and outer membrane proteins with NOD1 receptor, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, polyubiquitinated proteins, proteasome components and potentially oncogenic proteins like SHP2 and ERKs in human gastric epithelium. By means of electron and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that the in vivo findings were reproduced in vitro by incubating human epithelial cell lines with H. pylori products/virulence factors. PaCSs differed from VacA-induced vacuoles, phagosomes, aggresomes or related bodies. Our data suggest that PaCS is a novel, proteasome-enriched structure arising in ribosome-rich cytoplasm at sites of H. pylori products accumulation. As a site of selective concentration of bacterial virulence factors, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and interactive proteins, PaCS is likely to modulate immune-inflammatory and proliferative responses of the gastric epithelium of potential pathologic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2037282199,"Background The definition of transcriptional networks through measurements of changes in gene expression profiles and mapping of transcription factor binding sites is limited by the moderate overlap between binding and gene expression changes and the inability to directly measure global nuclear transcription (coined “transactome”). Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a method to measure nascent nuclear gene transcription with an Array-based Nuclear Run-On (ANRO) assay using commercial microarray platforms. This strategy provides the missing component, the transactome, to fully map transcriptional networks. ANRO measurements in an inducible c-Myc expressing human P493-6 B cell model reveals time-dependent waves of transcription, with a transactome early after c-Myc induction that does not persist at a late, steady-state phase, when genes that are regulated by c-Myc and E2F predominate. Gene set matrix analysis further uncovers functionally related groups of genes putatively regulated by waves of transcription factor motifs following Myc induction, starting with AP1 and CREB that are followed by EGR1, NFkB and STAT, and ending with E2F, Myc and ARNT/HIF motifs. Conclusions/Significance By coupling ANRO with previous global mapping of c-Myc binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in P493-6 cells, we define a set of transcriptionally regulated direct c-Myc target genes and pave the way for the use of ANRO to comprehensively map any transcriptional network."
https://openalex.org/W2076012925,"Flavonoid metabolites remain in blood for periods of time potentially long enough to allow interactions with cellular components of this tissue. It is well-established that flavonoids are metabolised within the intestine and liver into methylated, sulphated and glucuronidated counterparts, which inhibit platelet function.We demonstrate evidence suggesting platelets which contain metabolic enzymes, as an alternative location for flavonoid metabolism. Quercetin and a plasma metabolite of this compound, 4'-O-methyl quercetin (tamarixetin) were shown to gain access to the cytosolic compartment of platelets, using confocal microscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) showed that quercetin was transformed into a compound with a mass identical to tamarixetin, suggesting that the flavonoid was methylated by catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) within platelets.Platelets potentially mediate a third phase of flavonoid metabolism, which may impact on the regulation of the function of these cells by metabolites of these dietary compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1972395844,"Domesticated laboratory strains of Bacillus subtilis readily take up and integrate exogenous DNA. In contrast, ""wild"" ancestors or Bacillus strains recently isolated from the environment can only be genetically modified by phage transduction, electroporation or protoplast transformation. Such methods are laborious, have a variable yield or cannot efficiently be used to alter chromosomal DNA. A major disadvantage of using laboratory strains is that they have often lost, or do not display ecologically relevant physiologies such as the ability to form biofilms. Here we present a method that allows genetic transformation by natural competence in several environmental isolates of B. subtilis. Competence in these strains was established by expressing the B. subtilis competence transcription factor ComK from an IPTG-inducible promoter construct present on an unstable plasmid. This transiently activates expression of the genes required for DNA uptake and recombination in the host strain. After transformation, the comK encoding plasmid is lost easily because of its intrinsic instability and the transformed strain returns to its wild state. Using this method, we have successfully generated mutants and introduced foreign DNA into a number of environmental isolates and also B. subtilis strain NCIB3610, which is widely used to study biofilm formation. Application of the same method to strains of B. licheniformis was unsuccessful. The efficient and rapid approach described here may facilitate genetic studies in a wider array of environmental B. subtilis strains."
https://openalex.org/W2094283825,"Insulin resistance is a feature of type 2 diabetes. Resistin, secreted from adipocytes, causes insulin resistance in mice. We previously reported that the G/G genotype of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -420 (rs1862513) in the human resistin gene (RETN) increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes by enhancing its promoter activity. Plasma resistin was highest in Japanese subjects with G/G genotype, followed by C/G, and C/C. In this study, we cross-sectionally analyzed plasma resistin and SNPs in the RETN region in 2,019 community-dwelling Japanese subjects. Plasma resistin was associated with SNP-638 (rs34861192), SNP-537 (rs34124816), SNP-420, SNP-358 (rs3219175), SNP+299 (rs3745367), and SNP+1263 (rs3745369) (P<10(-13) in all cases). SNP-638, SNP -420, SNP-358, and SNP+157 were in the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block. SNP-358 and SNP-638 were nearly in complete LD (r(2) = 0.98), and were tightly correlated with SNP-420 (r(2) = 0.50, and 0.51, respectively). The correlation between either SNP-358 (or SNP-638) or SNP-420 and plasma resistin appeared to be strong (risk alleles for high plasma resistin; A at SNP-358, r(2) = 0.5224, P = 4.94x10(-324); G at SNP-420, r(2) = 0.2616, P = 1.71x10(-133)). In haplotypes determined by SNP-420 and SNP-358, the estimated frequencies for C-G, G-A, and G-G were 0.6700, 0.2005, and 0.1284, respectively, and C-A was rare (0.0011), suggesting that subjects with A at -358, generally had G at -420. This G-A haplotype conferred the highest plasma resistin (8.24 ng/ml difference/allele compared to C-G, P<0.0001). In THP-1 cells, the RETN promoter with the G-A haplotype showed the highest activity. Nuclear proteins specifically recognized one base difference at SNP-358, but not at SNP-638. Therefore, A at -358 is required for G at -420 to confer the highest plasma resistin in the general Japanese population. In Caucasians, the association between SNP-420 and plasma resistin is not strong, and A at -358 may not exist, suggesting that SNP-358 could explain this ethnic difference."
https://openalex.org/W2093714966,"Adhesion constitutes one of the initial stages of infection in microbial diseases and is mediated by adhesins. Hence, identification and comprehensive knowledge of adhesins and adhesin-like proteins is essential to understand adhesin mediated pathogenesis and how to exploit its therapeutic potential. However, the knowledge about fungal adhesins is rudimentary compared to that of bacterial adhesins. In addition to host cell attachment and mating, the fungal adhesins play a significant role in homotypic and xenotypic aggregation, foraging and biofilm formation. Experimental identification of fungal adhesins is labor- as well as time-intensive. In this work, we present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method for the prediction of fungal adhesins and adhesin-like proteins. The SVM models were trained with different compositional features, namely, amino acid, dipeptide, multiplet fractions, charge and hydrophobic compositions, as well as PSI-BLAST derived PSSM matrices. The best classifiers are based on compositional properties as well as PSSM and yield an overall accuracy of 86%. The prediction method based on best classifiers is freely accessible as a world wide web based server at http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/faap. This work will aid rapid and rational identification of fungal adhesins, expedite the pace of experimental characterization of novel fungal adhesins and enhance our knowledge about role of adhesins in fungal infections."
https://openalex.org/W1972931764,"Although donor dopamine treatment reduces the requirement for post transplantation dialysis in renal transplant recipients, implementation of dopamine in donor management is hampered by its hemodynamic side-effects. Therefore novel dopamine derivatives lacking any hemodynamic actions and yet are more efficacious in protecting tissue from cold preservation injury are warranted. We hypothesized that variation of the molecular structure would yield more efficacious compounds avoid of any hemodynamic effects.To this end, we assessed protection against cold preservation injury in HUVEC by the attenuation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Modification of dopamine by an alkanoyl group increased cellular uptake and significantly improved efficacy of protection. Further variation revealed that only compounds bearing two hydroxy groups in ortho or para position at the benzene nucleus, i.e. strong reductants, were protective. However, other reducing agents like N-acetyl cysteine and ascorbate, or NADPH oxidase inhibition did not prevent cellular injury following cold storage. Unlike dopamine, a prototypic novel compound caused no hemodynamic side-effects.In conclusion, we demonstrate that protection against cold preservation injury by catecholamines is exclusively governed by strong reducing capacity and sufficient lipophilicity. The novel dopamine derivatives might be of clinical relevance in donor pre-conditioning as they are completely devoid of hemodynamic action, their increased cellular uptake would reduce time of treatment and therefore also may have a potential use for non-heart beating donors."
https://openalex.org/W2150102287,"There is ample evidence that Hsp70 takes part in the progress of coronary heart disease (CHD). This implies that genetic variants of Hsp70 genes such as HSPA8 (HSC70) gene might contribute to the development of CHD. The present study aimed to investigate whether certain genetic variants of HSPA8 gene are associated with CHD in Han Chinese people.A total of 2006 subjects (1003 CHD cases and 1003 age- and sex- matched healthy controls) were recruited. Genetic variants in the HSPA8 gene were identified by sequencing of the gene in 60 unrelated Chinese. Four tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) (rs2236659, rs2276077, rs10892958, and rs1461496) were selected and genotyped. The function of the significant SNP was evaluated using luciferase reporter assays in two cell lines. By sequencing the promoter and all exons and introns of the HSPA8 gene, 23 genetic variants were identified. One promoter SNP rs2236659 was associated with susceptibility to CHD. Carriers of the ""C"" allele of rs2236659 had decreased CHD risk with odds ratio (OR) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.98; P = 0.033) after adjustment for conventional risk factors. Haplotype analyses indicated that haplotype GCGC contributed to a lower CHD risk (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.93; P = 0.006) compared with the common haplotype AGGT. In a transfection assay, the C allele of rs2236659 showed a 37-40% increase in luciferase expression of the reporter gene luciferase in endothelial and non-endothelial cells compared with the T allele.These findings suggest that genetic variants in HSPA8 gene (especially promoter SNP rs2236659) contribute to the CHD susceptibility by affecting its expression level."
https://openalex.org/W1988548998,"Single neurons in the cerebral cortex are immersed in a fluctuating electric field, the local field potential (LFP), which mainly originates from synchronous synaptic input into the local neural neighborhood. As shown by recent studies in visual and auditory cortices, the angular phase of the LFP at the time of spike generation adds significant extra information about the external world, beyond the one contained in the firing rate alone. However, no biologically plausible mechanism has yet been suggested that allows downstream neurons to infer the phase of the LFP at the soma of their pre-synaptic afferents. Therefore, so far there is no evidence that the nervous system can process phase information. Here we study a model of a bursting pyramidal neuron, driven by a time-dependent stimulus. We show that the number of spikes per burst varies systematically with the phase of the fluctuating input at the time of burst onset. The mapping between input phase and number of spikes per burst is a robust response feature for a broad range of stimulus statistics. Our results suggest that cortical bursting neurons could play a crucial role in translating LFP phase information into an easily decodable spike count code."
https://openalex.org/W2041756642,"Background Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of both insulin and amyloid beta peptides. IDE is unique in that it is subject to allosteric activation which is hypothesized to occur through an oligomeric structuture. Methodology/Principal Findings IDE is known to exist as an equilibrium mixture of monomers, dimers, and higher oligomers, with the dimer being the predominant form. Based on the crystal structure of IDE we deleted the putative dimer interface in the C-terminal region, which resulted in a monomeric variant. Monomeric IDE retained enzymatic activity, however instead of the allosteric behavior seen with wild type enzyme it displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior. With the substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp, monomeric IDE retained ∼25% of the wild type activity. In contrast with the larger peptide substrates β-endorphin and amyloid β peptide 1–40, monomeric IDE retained only 1 to 0.25% of wild type activity. Unlike wild type IDE neither bradykinin nor dynorphin B-9 activated the monomeric variant of the enzyme. Similarly, monomeric IDE was not activated by polyphosphates under conditions in which the activity of wild type enzyme was increased more than 50 fold. Conclusions/Significance These findings serve to establish the dimer interface in IDE and demonstrate the requirement for an oligomeric form of the enzyme for its regulatory properties. The data support a mechanism where the binding of activators to oligomeric IDE induces a conformational change that cannot occur in the monomeric variant. Since a conformational change from a closed to a more open structure is likely the rate-determining step in the IDE reaction, the subunit induced conformational change likely shifts the structure of the oligomeric enzyme to a more open conformation."

More specifically, we show how it may be possible to make projections for the ongoing H1N1 pandemic as extrapolated from knowledge of seasonal influenza. We derive first-approximation parameter estimates for the SIR model to describe seasonal influenza, and then explore the implications of the existing classical epidemiological theory for the case of a pandemic virus. In particular, we note the dramatic nonlinear increase in attack rate as a function of the percentage of susceptibles initially present in the population. This has severe consequences for the pandemic, given the general lack of immunity in the global population."
https://openalex.org/W2009725984,"It has been proposed that the immune system could be primed as early as during the fetal life and this might have an impact on postnatal vaccination. Therefore, we addressed in murine models whether gestational treatment with mycobacterial antigens could induce better immune responses in the postnatal life.BALB/c mice were treated subcutaneously (s.c.) at the second week of gestation with antigen (Ag)85A or heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) in the absence of adjuvant. Following birth, offspring mice were immunized intranasally (i.n.) with the same antigens formulated with the adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) at week 1 and week 4. One week after the last immunization, we assessed antigen-specific recall interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) responses by in vitro restimulation of lung-derived lymphocytes. Protection against infection was assessed by challenge with high dose Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) given i.n. We found that recall IFN-gamma responses were higher in the offspring born to the treated mother compared to the untreated-mother. More importantly, we observed that the offspring born to the treated mother controlled infection better than the offspring born to the untreated mother. Since the gestational treatment was done in absence of adjuvant, essentially there was no antibody production observed in the pregnant mice and therefore no influence of maternal antibodies was expected. We hypothesized that the effect of maternal treatment with antigen on the offspring occurred due to antigen transportation through placenta. To trace the antigens, we conjugated fluorescent nanocrystals with Ag85A (Qdot-ITK-Ag85A). After inoculation in the pregnant mice, Qdot-ITK-Ag85A conjugates were detected in the liver, spleen of pregnant females and in all the fetuses and placentas examined.The fetal immune system could be primed in utero by mycobacterial antigens transported through the placenta."
https://openalex.org/W2094743367,"Background Globally, cataract is the leading cause of blindness and impaired vision. Cataract surgery is an attractive treatment option but it remains unavailable in sufficient quantity for the vast majority of the world population living in areas without access to specialized health care. Reducing blindness from cataract requires solutions that can be applied outside operating theatres. Cataract is a protein conformational disease characterized by accumulation of light absorbing, fluorescent and scattering protein aggregates. The aim of the study was to investigate whether these compounds were susceptible to photobleaching by a non-invasive procedure and whether this would lead to optical rejuvenation of the lens. Methodology/Principal Findings Nine human donor lenses were treated with an 800 nm infra-red femtosecond pulsed laser in a treatment zone measuring 1×1×0.52 mm. After laser treatment the age-induced yellow discoloration of the lens was markedly reduced and the transmission of light was increased corresponding to an optical rejuvenation of 3 to 7 years. Conclusions/Significance The results demonstrate that the age-induced yellowing of the human lens can be bleached by a non-invasive procedure based on femtosecond laser photolysis. Cataract is a disease associated with old age. At the current technological stage, lens aging is delayed but with a treatment covering the entire lens volume complete optical rejuvenation is expected. Thus, femtosecond photolysis has the potential clinical value of replacing invasive cataract surgery by a non-invasive treatment modality that can be placed in mobile units, thus breaking down many of the barriers impeding access to treatment in remote and poor regions of the world."
https://openalex.org/W2084669705,"Background Annual seasonal influenza outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Objective To index and document evolutionary changes among influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses isolated from Thailand during 2006–2009, using complete genome sequences. Methods Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from patients diagnosed with respiratory illness in Thailand during 2006–2009. All samples were screened for Influenza A virus. A total of 13 H1N1 and 21 H3N2 were confirmed and whole genome sequenced for the evolutionary analysis using standard phylogenetic approaches. Results Phylogenetic analysis of HA revealed a clear diversification of seasonal from vaccine strain lineages. H3N2 seasonal clusters were closely related to the WHO recommended vaccine strains in each season. Most H1N1 isolates could be differentiated into 3 lineages. The A/Brisbane/59/2007 lineage, a vaccine strain for H1N1 since 2008, is closely related with the H1N1 subtypes circulating in 2009. HA sequences were conserved at the receptor-binding site. Amino acid variations in the antigenic site resulted in a possible N-linked glycosylation motif. Recent H3N2 isolates had higher genetic variations compared to H1N1 isolates. Most substitutions in the NP protein were clustered in the T-cell recognition domains. Conclusion In this study we performed evolutionary genetic analysis of influenza A viruses in Thailand between 2006–2009. Although the current vaccine strain is efficient for controlling the circulating outbreak subtypes, surveillance is necessary to provide unambiguous information on emergent viruses. In summary, the findings of this study contribute the understanding of evolution in influenza A viruses in humans and is useful for routine surveillance and vaccine strain selection."
https://openalex.org/W2011296902,"In contrast to the case fatality rate of patients diagnosed with meningococcal disease (MD) the long-term mortality in these patients is poorly documented.We performed a nationwide, population-based cohort study including all Danish patients diagnosed with MD from 1977 through 2006 and alive one year after diagnosis. Data was retrieved from the Danish National Hospital Register, the Danish Civil Registration System and the Danish Register of Causes of Death. For each patient four age- and gender-matched individuals were identified from the population cohort. The siblings of the MD patients and of the individuals from the population cohort were identified. We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival curves and used Cox regression analysis, cumulative incidence function and subdistribution hazard regression to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR) and analyze causes of death. We identified 4,909 MD patients, 19,636 individuals from the population cohort, 8,126 siblings of MD patients and 31,140 siblings of the individuals from the population cohort. The overall MRR for MD patients was 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-1.45), adjusted MRR, 1.21 (95% CI, 1.06-1.37). MD was associated with increased risk of death due to nervous system diseases (MRR 3.57 (95% CI, 1.82-7.00). No increased mortality due to infections, neoplasms or cardiovascular diseases was observed. The MRR for siblings of MD patients compared with siblings of the individuals from the population cohort was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.92-1.48).Patients surviving the acute phase of MD have increased long-term mortality, but the excess risk of death is small and stems mainly from nervous system diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1989069382,"The benefit of routine HIV-1 viral load (VL) monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-constrained settings is uncertain because of the high costs associated with the test and the limited treatment options. We designed a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare the use of routine VL testing at ART-initiation and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, versus our local standard of care (which uses immunological and clinical criteria to diagnose treatment failure, with discretionary VL testing when the two do not agree).Dedicated study personnel were integrated into public-sector ART clinics. We collected participant information in a dedicated research database. Twelve ART clinics in Lusaka, Zambia constituted the units of randomization. Study clinics were stratified into pairs according to matching criteria (historical mortality rate, size, and duration of operation) to limit the effect of clustering, and independently randomized to the intervention and control arms. The study was powered to detect a 36% reduction in mortality at 18 months.From December 2006 to May 2008, we completed enrollment of 1973 participants. Measured baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the study arms. Enrollment was staggered by clinic pair and truncated at two matched sites.A large clinical trial of routing VL monitoring was successfully implemented in a dynamic and rapidly growing national ART program. Close collaboration with local health authorities and adequate reserve staff were critical to success. Randomized controlled trials such as this will likely prove valuable in determining long-term outcomes in resource-constrained settings.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00929604."
https://openalex.org/W2109987820,"Background Mammary stem cells are maintained within specific microenvironments and recruited throughout lifetime to reconstitute de novo the mammary gland. Mammary stem cells have been isolated through the identification of specific cell surface markers and in vivo transplantation into cleared mammary fat pads. Accumulating evidence showed that during the reformation of mammary stem cell niches by dispersed epithelial cells in the context of the intact epithelium-free mammary stroma, non-mammary epithelial cells may be sequestered and reprogrammed to perform mammary epithelial cell functions and to adopt mammary epithelial characteristics during reconstruction of mammary epithelium in regenerating mammary tissue in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings To examine whether other types of progenitor cells are able to contribute to mammary branching morphogenesis, we examined the potential of murine embryonic stem (mES) cells, undergoing hematopoietic differentiation, to support mammary reconstitution in vivo. We observed that cells from day 14 embryoid bodies (EBs) under hematopoietic differentiation condition, but not supernatants derived from these cells, when transplanted into denuded mammary fat pads, were able to contribute to both the luminal and myoepithelial lineages in branching ductal structures resembling the ductal-alveolar architecture of the mammary tree. No teratomas were observed when these cells were transplanted in vivo. Conclusions/Significance Our data provide evidence for the dominance of the tissue-specific mammary stem cell niche and its role in directing mES cells, undergoing hematopoietic differentiation, to reprogram into mammary epithelial cells and to promote mammary epithelial morphogenesis. These studies should also provide insights into regeneration of damaged mammary gland and the role of the mammary microenvironment in reprogramming cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2014383185,"Background For diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders, a categorical classification system is often utilized as a simple way for conceptualizing an often complex clinical picture. This approach provides an unsatisfactory model of mental illness, since in practice patients do not conform to these prototypical diagnostic categories. Family studies show notable familial co-aggregation between schizophrenia and bipolar illness and between schizoaffective disorders and both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, revealing that mental illness does not conform to such categorical models and is likely to follow a continuum encompassing a spectrum of behavioral symptoms. Results and Methodology We introduce an analytic framework to dissect the phenotypic heterogeneity present in complex psychiatric disorders based on the conceptual paradigm of a continuum of psychosis. The approach identifies subgroups of behavioral symptoms that are likely to be phenotypically and genetically homogenous. We have evaluated this approach through analysis of simulated data with simulated behavioral traits and predisposing genetic factors. We also apply this approach to a psychiatric dataset of a genome scan for schizophrenia for which extensive behavioral information was collected for each individual patient and their families. With this approach, we identified significant evidence for linkage among depressed individuals with two distinct symptom profiles, that is individuals with sleep disturbance symptoms with linkage on chromosome 2q13 and also a mutually exclusive group of individuals with symptoms of concentration problems with linkage on chromosome 2q35. In addition we identified a subset of individuals with schizophrenia defined by language disturbances with linkage to chromosome 2p25.1 and a group of patients with a phenotype intermediate between those of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder with linkage to chromosome 2p21. Conclusions The findings presented are novel and demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in detection of genes underlying such complex human disorders as schizophrenia and depression."
https://openalex.org/W2069600748,"Differential host-pathogen interactions direct viral replication in infected cells. In HIV-1 infected cells, nuclear export of viral RNA transcripts into cellular cytoplasm is governed by interaction of HIV-1 Rev, Exportin-1 (CRM-1) and DDX3X. Knock down of DDX3X has been shown to drastically impair HIV replication. Here we show that evolutionary forces are responsible for demarking previously unidentified critical functionally important residues on the surface of DDX3X. Using computational approaches, we show that these functional residues, depending on their location, are capable of regulating ATPase and RNA helicase functions of DDX3X. The potential of these residues in designing better blockers against HIV-1 replication was also assessed. Also, using stepwise docking simulations, we could identify DDX3X-CRM-1 interface and its critical functional residues. Our data would help explain the role of DDX3X in HIV-1 Rev function with potential to design new intervention strategies against HIV-1 replication."
https://openalex.org/W2163993789,"Myelin of the adult central nervous system (CNS) is one of the major sources of inhibitors of axon regeneration following injury. The three known myelin-derived inhibitors (Nogo, MAG, and OMgp) bind with high affinity to the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) on axons and limit neurite outgrowth. Here we show that RNA aptamers can be generated that bind with high affinity to NgR, compete with myelin-derived inhibitors for binding to NgR, and promote axon elongation of neurons in vitro even in the presence of these inhibitors. Aptamers may have key advantages over protein antagonists, including low immunogenicity and the possibility of ready modification during chemical synthesis for stability, signaling, or immobilization. This first demonstration that aptamers can directly influence neuronal function suggests that aptamers may prove useful for not only healing spinal cord and other neuronal damage, but may be more generally useful as neuromodulators."
https://openalex.org/W2071213296,"We tested the metabolic rate hypothesis (whereby rates of mtDNA evolution are postulated to be mediated primarily by mutagenic by-products of respiration) by examining whether mass-specific metabolic rate was correlated with root-to-tip distance on a set of mtDNA trees for the springtail Cryptopygus antarcticus travei from sub-Antarctic Marion Island. Using Bayesian analyses and a novel application of the comparative phylogenetic method, we did not find significant evidence that contemporary metabolic rates directly correlate with mutation rate (i.e., root-to-tip distance) once the underlying phylogeny is taken into account. However, we did find significant evidence that metabolic rate is dependent on the underlying mtDNA tree, or in other words, lineages with related mtDNA also have similar metabolic rates. We anticipate that future analyses which apply this methodology to datasets with longer sequences, more taxa, or greater variability will have more power to detect a significant direct correlation between metabolic rate and mutation rate. We conclude with suggestions for future analyses that would extend the preliminary approach applied here, in particular highlighting ways to tease apart oxidative stress effects from the effects of population size and/or selection coefficients operating on the molecular evolutionary rate."
https://openalex.org/W2081091687,"The human visual system must perform complex visuospatial extrapolations (VSE) across space and time in order to extract shape and form from the retinal projection of a cluttered visual environment characterized by occluded surfaces and moving objects. Even if we exclude the temporal dimension, for instance when judging whether an extended finger is pointing towards one object or another, the mechanisms of VSE remain opaque. Here we investigated the neural correlates of VSE using functional magnetic resonance imaging in sixteen human observers while they judged the relative position of, or saccaded to, a (virtual) target defined by the extrapolated path of a pointer. Using whole brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses, we compared the brain activity evoked by these VSE tasks to similar control judgements or eye movements made to explicit (dot) targets that did not require extrapolation. The data show that activity in an occipitotemporal region that included the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) was significantly greater during VSE than during control tasks. A similar, though less pronounced, pattern was also evident in regions of the fronto-parietal cortex that included the frontal eye fields. However, none of the ROIs examined exhibited a significant interaction between target type (extrapolated/explicit) and response type (oculomotor/perceptual). These findings are consistent with a close association between visuoperceptual and oculomotor responses, and highlight a critical role for the LOC in the process of VSE."
