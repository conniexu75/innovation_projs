https://openalex.org/W2030677414,"Two closely located islands on the west coast of South Africa support widely different benthic communities. The biota at Malgas Island is dominated by seaweeds and by rock lobsters that consume settling mussels, thereby preventing the establishment of the mussels. They also prey on whelks, although one species, Burnupena papyracea, is protected from predation by a commensal bryozoan that covers its shell. Marcus Island has extensive mussel beds, but rock lobsters and seaweeds are virtually absent; whelks (mostly Burnupena spp.) occur at high densities. Rock lobsters transferred to Marcus Island were overwhelmed and consumed by the whelks, reversing the normal predator-prey relation between the two species. These two contrasting communities persisted during 4 years and may represent multiple states of the same ecosystem. This effective change of roles between a prey species and its chief predator may provide an intrinsic mechanism to maintain these states following the initial exclusion of the predator."
https://openalex.org/W1965744828,"In July 1986, three catastrophic landslides deposited about 20 x 10(6) cubic meters of debris on Bualtar Glacier in the Karakoram Himalaya. A sudden acceleration and superficial breakup of the glacier provided an opportunity to examine the fresh deposits in depth. Beneath a surface layer of large boulders, finer materials, mainly sand and silt, made up half of the total volume. The fine materials were formed during the rock avalanche from mostly intact, massive rock of the source zone. Velocity estimates suggest that this disaggregation occurred in less than 2 minutes. Coarse materials remained in bands of uniform lithology, but the fine materials had diffused throughout the landslides. A small amount of carbonate appears to have been calcined by frictional heating, presumably at the base of the initial sliding masses. These observations are relevant to understanding the mechanisms of catastrophic landslides. Other nearby rock avalanche deposits indicate that landslides are an important geomorphic process in the area and that they pose a continuing risk to human activity."
https://openalex.org/W2054526697,"Research at La Venta, a major Olmec center on a low salt dome 12 kilometers from the Gulf Coast has revealed evidence of initial occupation (about 1750 to 1400 B.C.) along levees of the silted-in Río Barí, north of the site core in a transitional estuarine-riverine environment. Between 1400 and 1150 B.C. settlement expanded to nearby La Venta itself, which between 1150 and 800 B.C. developed into a major temple-town complex. Local development peaked at La Venta and along the river levees between 800 and 500 B.C. In this span La Venta headed a local three-tiered site hierarchy as social distinctions expanded to the peripheral Río Barí sites. New excavations show that growth in population size and density at La Venta preceded the development of sociopolitical complexity. These data contradict the traditional organizational reconstruction of Olmec society, the ""vacant ceremonial center"" model, and provide qualified support for a model that presents riverine resource concentration as a significant factor in the evolution of Olmec civilization."

The form of the remains, largely expressed in terms of surface vegetation, suggests agriculture on planting platforms, separated by canals. The physical and chemical aspects of the stratigraphy have clarified depositional environments but have not indicated agricultural horizons. Maize phytoliths at about 1 meter below the surface in two Central Veracruzan wetlands do confirm the practice of agriculture. Associated ceramics indicate wetlands agriculture was practiced by A.D. 500 and perhaps earlier."
