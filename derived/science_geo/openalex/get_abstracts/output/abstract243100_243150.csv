https://openalex.org/W2064318855,"Cell proliferation requires a constant supply of lipids and lipid precursors to fuel membrane biogenesis and protein modification. Cytokine stimulation of hematopoietic cells directly stimulates glucose utilization in excess of bioenergetic demand, resulting in a shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism. A potential benefit of this form of metabolism is the channeling of glucose into biosynthetic pathways. Here we report that glucose supports de novo lipid synthesis in growing hematopoietic cells in a manner regulated by cytokine availability and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The net conversion of glucose to lipid is dependent on the ability of cells to produce cytosolic acetyl CoA from mitochondria-derived citrate through the action of ATP citrate lyase (ACL). Stable knockdown of ACL leads to a significant impairment of glucose-dependent lipid synthesis and an elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells with ACL knockdown display decreased cytokine-stimulated cell proliferation. In contrast, these cells resist cell death induced by either cytokine or glucose withdrawal. However, ACL knockdown significantly impairs Akt-mediated tumorigenesis in vivo. These data suggest that enzymes involved in the conversion of glucose to lipid may be targets for the treatment of pathologic cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W2132601303,"Thyroid cancer poses a significant clinical challenge, and our understanding of its pathogenesis is incomplete. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, transcriptional profiles of four normal thyroids and 51 papillary carcinomas (PCs) were generated using DNA microarrays. The tumors were genotyped for their common activating mutations: BRAF V600E point mutation, RET/PTC1 and 3 rearrangement and point mutations of KRAS, HRAS and NRAS. Principal component analysis based on the entire expression data set separated the PCs into three groups that were found to reflect tumor morphology and mutational status. By combining expression profiles with mutational status, we defined distinct expression profiles for the BRAF, RET/PTC and RAS mutation groups. Using small numbers of genes, a simple classifier was able to classify correctly the mutational status of all 40 tumors with known mutations. One tumor without a detectable mutation was predicted by the classifier to have a RET/PTC rearrangement and was shown to contain one by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Among the mutation-specific expression signatures were genes whose differential expression was a direct consequence of the mutation, as well as genes involved in a variety of biological processes including immune response and signal transduction. Expression of one mutation-specific differentially expressed gene, TPO, was validated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and tissue arrays containing an independent set of tumors. The results demonstrate that mutational status is the primary determinant of gene expression variation within these tumors, a finding that may have clinical and diagnostic significance and predicts success for therapies designed to prevent the consequences of these mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2057364858,"Oncogenesis results from changes in kinetics or in abundance of proteins in signal transduction networks. Recently, it was shown that control of signalling cannot reside in a single gene product, and might well be dispersed over many components. Which of the reactions in these complex networks are most important, and how can the existing molecular information be used to understand why particular genes are oncogenes whereas others are not? We implement a new method to help address such questions. We apply control analysis to a detailed kinetic model of the epidermal growth factor-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase network. We determine the control of each reaction with respect to three biologically relevant characteristics of the output of this network: the amplitude, duration and integrated output of the transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We confirm that control is distributed, but far from randomly: a small proportion of reactions substantially control signalling. In particular, the activity of Raf is in control of all characteristics of the transient profile of ERK phosphorylation, which may clarify why Raf is an oncogene. Most reactions that really matter for one signalling characteristic are also important for the other characteristics. Our analysis also predicts the effects of mutations and changes in gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2093015940,"Secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1) is an antagonist of the transmembrane frizzled receptor, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, and has been suggested to be a candidate tumor suppressor in several human malignancies. Since SFRP1 is located at chromosome 8p11, where lung cancers also exhibit frequent allelic loss, we hypothesized that the inactivation of SFRP1 is also involved in lung carcinogenesis. To substantiate this, we performed mutational analysis of SFRP1 for 29 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 25 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, and expression analysis for the same cell lines. Although somatic mutations were not detected in the coding sequence, downregulation of SFRP1 was observed in 14 (48%) NSCLC and nine (36%) SCLC cell lines. We analysed epigenetic alteration of the SFRP1 promoter region and detected hypermethylation in 15 (52%) of 29 NSCLC cell lines, two (8%) of 25 SCLC cell lines, and 44 (55%) of 80 primary lung tumors. By comparing the methylation status with SFRP1 expression, we found a significant correlation between them. We also performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis and found that 15 (38%) of 40 informative surgical specimens had LOH in the SFRP1 gene locus. Furthermore, we performed colony formation assay of two NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H460 and NCI-H2009) and found the reduction of colony formation with SFRP1 transfection. In addition, we also detected that SFRP1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of β-catenin, which is thought to be a downstream molecule of SFRP1, with luciferase reporter assay. Our current studies demonstrated that the SFRP1 gene is frequently downregulated by promoter hypermethylation and suppresses tumor growth activity of lung cancer cells, which suggests that SFRP1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene for lung cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1995316111,"Using oligonucleotide microarray analysis, THY1, mapping close to a previously defined 11q22-23 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) critical region was identified as showing consistent downregulated expression in the tumour segregants, as compared to their parental tumour-suppressing microcell hybrids (MCHs). Gene expression and protein analyses show that THY1 was not expressed in the NPC HONE1 recipient cells, tumour segregants, and other NPC cell lines; THY1 was exclusively expressed in the non-tumourigenic MCHs. The mechanism of THY1 gene inactivation in these cell lines was attributed to hypermethylation. Clinical study showed that in 65% of NPC specimens there was either downregulation or loss of THY1 gene expression. Using a tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining, 44% of the NPC cases showed downregulated expression of THY1 and 9% lost THY1 expression. The frequency of THY1 downregulated expression in lymph node metastatic NPC was 63%, which was significantly higher than in the primary tumour (33%). After transfection of THY1 gene into HONE1 cells, a dramatic reduction of colony formation ability was observed. These findings suggest that THY1 is a good candidate tumour suppressor gene in NPC, which is significantly associated with lymph node metastases."

https://openalex.org/W1974939794,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a tissue-specific transcription factor known to regulate a large number of genes in hepatocytes and pancreatic β cells. Although HNF4α is highly expressed in some sections of the kidney, little is known about its role in this organ and about HNF4α-regulated genes in the kidney cells. The abundance and activity of HNF4α are frequently reduced in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) indicating some tumor suppressing function of HNF4α in renal cells. To determine the potential role of HNF4α in RCC, we used Flp recombinase-mediated gene integration to generate human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) that conditionally express wild-type or mutated HNF4α. Expression of wild-type HNF4α but not of the mutants led to reduction of proliferation and alterations of cell morphology. These effects were reversible and induced at physiological concentrations of HNF4α. Using gene expression profiling by microarrays, we determined genes regulated by HNF4α. Interestingly, many of the genes regulated by HNF4α have been shown to be deregulated in RCC microarray studies. These genes (ACY1, WT1, SELENBP1, COBL, EFHD1, AGXT2L1, ALDH5A1, THEM2, ABCB1, FLJ14146, CSPG2, TRIM9 and HEY1) are good candidates for genes whose activity is changed upon the decrease of HNF4α in RCC."
https://openalex.org/W2148523790,"The paediatric eye tumour retinoblastoma is initiated by inactivation of RB1, a tumour suppressor on chromosome 13q. In addition to RB1 loss, many retinoblastomas show other genetic alterations including gains on chromosomes 6p21–pter and 1q31–q32. Recently, the minimal region of gains on chromosome 6 was narrowed to band p22. We examined genomic gains and expression changes in primary retinoblastomas to identify potential target genes in 6p22. Quantitative multiplex PCR detected copy numbers ⩾3 in 25 (33%) tumours and no gains in 31 of 76 (40%) tumours. The remaining 20 (26%) samples showed gains only at some loci, most often including E2F3 and DEK in 6p22.3. Analysis of RNA from 21 primary retinoblastomas showed that expression levels of these and some other genes in 6p22 correspond to DNA gains. However, KIF 13A, a reported candidate oncogene on 6p, was expressed at low levels or absent. Clinical manifestation of tumours with gains at all 6p22 loci was distinct in that distribution of age at diagnosis was markedly shifted to older age compared to tumours with no or partial gains. In summary, our results suggest that DEK and E2F3 are potential targets of 6p gains in retinoblastoma."

https://openalex.org/W2072291354,"Heparanase plays a critical role in the degradation of extracellular matrix and cell membrane and is frequently upregulated in malignant tumors. Transcription factor, early growth response 1 (EGR1), is closely associated with inducible transcription of the heparanase gene. We hypothesized that promoter CpG hypomethylation with increased EGR1 expression could determine heparanase expression during the pathogenesis of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer cell lines (J82, T24 and transitional cell carcinoma) significantly restored heparanase expression after 5-Aza-dC treatment. Transfection of EGR1 siRNA with T24 bladder cancer cell line significantly downregulated heparanase expression compared to the control siRNA transfection. In 54 bladder cancer and paired normal bladder samples, heparanase expression was significantly higher in bladder cancer than in normal bladder (P<0.01). We performed methylation-specific PCR targeting the CpG sites within the core-binding consensus motifs of EGR1 (GGCG) and Sp1 (GGGCGG). Methylation prevalence was significantly higher in normal bladder than in bladder cancer (P<0.05) and inversely correlated with heparanase expression (P=0.055). In the total series of bladder cancer and normal bladder samples, the combination of promoter CpG methylation and EGR1 expression regulated heparanase expression in a stepwise manner, where heparanase expression was the lowest in methylation-positive and EGR1-negative samples and the highest in methylation-negative and EGR1-positive samples. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that increased heparanase expression during the pathogenesis of bladder cancer is due to promoter hypomethylation and transcription factor EGR1."

https://openalex.org/W2060269194,"Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) inhibits the proto-oncogene ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and is known to induce cell cycle arrest. However, the effect of DFMO on human neuroblastoma (NB) cells and the exact mechanism of DFMO-induced cell death are largely unknown. Treatment with DFMO in combination with SAM486A, an S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) inhibitor, has been shown to enhance polyamine pool depletion. Therefore, we analysed the mechanism of action of DFMO and/or SAM486A in two established MYCN-amplified human NB cell lines. DFMO and SAM486A caused rapid cell growth inhibition, polyamine depletion, and G1 cell cycle arrest without apoptosis in cell lines LAN-1 and NMB-7. These effects were enhanced with combined inhibitors and largely prevented by cotreatment with exogenous polyamines. The G1 cell cycle arrest was concomitant with an increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. In a similar fashion, DFMO and DFMO/SAM486A inhibited the phosphorylation of the G1/S transition-regulating retinoblastoma protein Rb at residues Ser795 and Ser807/811. Moreover, we observed a dramatic decrease in MYCN protein levels. Overexpression of MYCN induces an aggressive NB phenotype with malignant behavior. We show for the first time that DFMO and SAM486A induce G1 cell cycle arrest in NB cells through p27Kip1 and Rb hypophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2084647824,"It has been suggested in many studies that combined treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and apoptosis-inducing ligands belonging to TNFR family is a more effective strategy for cancer treatment. However, the role of androgen regulation of TNFR family-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the dose-dependent effects of androgen on TNF-α and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP. To investigate the interaction between the androgen receptor (AR) and the caspase-2 gene, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used, and we are the first to identify that AR interacts in vivo with an androgen-responsive elements in intron 8 of caspase-2 gene. We have found that DHT inhibited apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. There is a direct, androgen-dependent correlation between the levels of activated Akt and caspase activation after treatment with TNF-α and TRAIL. We have also found that there are at least two different regulatory mechanisms of p53 expression by androgen: at the gene and protein levels. At the same time, the level of AR was found to be higher in LNCaP-si-p53 compared to LNCaP-mock cells. These data indicate that there is a mutual regulation of expression between p53 and AR. Our study suggests that androgen-dependent outcome of apoptotic treatment can occur, at least in part, via the caspase-2, Akt and p53-mediated pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2076706169,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a multifactorial etiology involving environmental and/or genetic factors. End-binding protein 1 (EB1), which was cloned as an interacting partner of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein, was previously found overexpressed in ESCC. However, the precise role of EB1 in the development of this malignancy has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we analysed freshly resected ESCC specimens and demonstrated that EB1 was overexpressed in approximately 63% of tumor samples compared to matched normal tissue. We report that overexpression of EB1 in the ESCC line EC9706 significantly promotes cell growth, whereas suppression of EB1 protein level by RNA interference significantly inhibited growth of esophageal tumor cells. In addition, EB1 overexpression induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and promoted the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF). These effects were partially or completely abolished by coexpression of APC or ΔN TCF4, respectively. Also, we found that EB1 affected the interaction between β-catenin and APC. Furthermore, EB1 overexpression was correlated with cytoplasmic/nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in primary human ESCC. Taken together, these results support the novel hypothesis that EB1 overexpression may play a role in the development of ESCC by affecting APC function and activating the β-catenin/TCF pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2040452424,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted phosphoglycoprotein that has been linked to tumor progression and survival in several solid tumors, including head and neck cancers. Previous studies showed that OPN expression is induced by tumor hypoxia, and its plasma levels can serve as a surrogate marker for tumor hypoxia and treatment outcome in head and neck cancer patients. In this study, we investigate the transcriptional mechanism by which hypoxia enhances OPN expression. We found that OPN is induced in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines and in NIH3T3 cells by hypoxia at both mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent manner. Actinomycin D chase experiments showed that hypoxic induction of OPN was not due to increased mRNA stability. Deletion analyses of the mouse OPN promoter regions indicated that a ras-activated enhancer (RAE) located at −731 to −712 relative to the transcription start site was essential for hypoxia-enhanced OPN transcription. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the RAE DNA sequence, we found that hypoxia induced sequence-specific DNA-binding complexes. Furthermore, hypoxia and ras exposure resulted in an additive induction of OPN protein and mRNA levels that appeared to be mediated by the RAE. Induction of OPN through the RAE element by hypoxia is mediated by an Akt-kinase signaled pathway as decreasing Akt levels with dominant negative constructs resulted in inhibition of OPN induction by hypoxia. Taken together, these results have identified a new hypoxia responsive transcriptional enhancer that is regulated by Akt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2044838118,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by Bcr-Abl, an activated tyrosine kinase. The amounts of Bcr-Abl mRNA and protein in cells from patients in blast crisis (BC) are higher than in those chronic phase (CP), indicating that their expression rises with disease progression. In order to study this phenomenon on cells with the same genetic background, we transfected the 32D cell line with the BCR-ABL transgene and selected clones with graded expression of Bcr-Abl within the range found in cells from CP to BC. In vitro, we found that Bcr-Abl exerted dose-dependent effects upon growth factor dependence, clonogenicity and migration. However, the relationship between Bcr-Abl expression and cellular adhesion to fibronectin was more complex: rather than a direct positive correlation, clones that expressed low, but not high, levels of Bcr-Abl were less adhesive than growth factor stimulated, parental BCR-ABL-negative 32D cells. This finding parallels the situation with normal and CML-CP progenitors where the latter exhibit defective adhesion to fibronectin. Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate reversed the adhesion deficient phenotype of clones expressing low levels of Bcr-Abl. When injected subcutaneously into syngeneic mice, cell lines expressing high levels of Bcr-Abl rapidly induced tumors, whereas low-expressing clones led to tumor formation only after a prolonged latency. These findings suggest that the level of Bcr-Abl may be essential in determining the phenotype of the leukemic clone at different stages of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2163872065,"On the basis of epidemiological studies, infection was suggested to play a role in the etiology of human cancer. While for some cancers such a role was indeed demonstrated, there is no direct biological support for the role of viral pathogens in the pathogenesis of childhood leukemia. Using a novel bioinformatic tool that alternates between clustering and standard statistical methods of analysis, we performed a ‘double-blind’ search of published gene expression data of subjects with different childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subtypes, looking for unanticipated partitions of patients, induced by unexpected groups of genes with correlated expression. We discovered a group of about 30 genes, related to the interferon response pathway, whose expression levels divide the ALL samples into two subgroups; high in 50, low in 285 patients. Leukemic subclasses prevalent in early childhood (the age most susceptible to infection) are over-represented in the high-expression subgroup. Similar partitions, induced by the same genes, were found also in breast and ovarian cancer but not in lung cancer, prostate cancer and lymphoma. About 40% of breast cancer samples expressed the ‘interferon-related’ signature. It is of interest that several studies demonstrated mouse mammary tumor virus-like sequences in about 40% of breast cancer samples. Our discovery of an unanticipated strong signature of an interferon-induced pathway provides molecular support for a role for either inflammation or viral infection in the pathogenesis of childhood leukemia as well as breast and ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2099533955,"Prostate adenocarcinoma metastasizes to the skeleton more frequently than any other organ. An underlying cause of this phenomenon may be the ability of bone-produced factors to specifically select disseminated prostate cancer cells that are susceptible to their trophic effects. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent mitogen for both normal and tumor cells, is produced in several tissues including bone, where it is synthesized by both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Here, we show that PDGF causes a significantly stronger activation of the Akt/PKB survival pathway in bone-metastatic prostate cancer cells compared to nonmetastatic cells. Normal prostate epithelial cells and DU-145 prostate cells, originally derived from a brain metastasis, are not responsive to PDGF. In contrast, epidermal growth factor stimulates Akt to the same extent in all prostate cells tested. This difference in PDGF responsiveness depends on the higher expression of alpha-PDGFR in bone-metastatic compared to nonmetastatic prostate cells and the lack of alpha-PDGFR expression in normal and metastatic prostate cells derived from tissues other than bone. Thus, alpha-PDGFR expression might identify prostate cancer cells with the highest propensity to metastasize to the skeleton."

https://openalex.org/W2063250254,"Elevated levels of cyclin A1 expression have been implicated in acute myeloid leukemia and in male germ cell tumors. However, a role of cyclin A1 in tumorigenesis of prostate cancer has not been reported. In the present study, expression of cyclin A1 in patients with prostate cancer and a role of cyclin A1 in mediating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were investigated. Cyclin A1 was highly expressed in aggressive tumors and was significantly correlated with VEGF expression in 96 patients with prostate cancer. Treatment of LNCaP cells with R1881, a synthetic androgen resulted in increased cyclin A1 expression. Induction of cyclin A1 expression in LNCaP cells led to an increase in VEGF expression and this effect was manifested upon the R1881 treatment. Cyclin A1 failed to mediate VEGF activation in DU-145 cells lacking a functional Rb and an androgen receptor (AR). Although AR expression was induced into DU-145 cells, cyclin A1 was unable to mediate VEGF expression. However, induced coexpression of cyclin A1, Rb and AR in DU-145 cells in the presence of R1881 greatly promoted VEGF promoter activity. This suggests that cyclin A1 mediates VEGF expression in cooperation with Rb- and androgen-dependent pathways in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1971041045,"We previously showed that nitric oxide (NO) induces overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and production of prostaglandin E2 in cancer cells. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which NO induces COX-2 expression in cancer cells. We found that the cAMP-response element (CRE) is a critical factor in NO-induced COX-2 expression in all cells tested. We found that in cancer cells, three transcription factors (TFs) – cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) and c-jun, bound the CRE in the COX-2 promoter, and their activities were increased by addition of the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP). NO-induced activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) upregulated the three TFs, leading to COX-2 overexpression. Addition of dibutyryl-cGMP (db-cGMP) induced COX-2 expression in a manner similar to SNAP; this induction was blocked by a p38 inhibitor (SB202190), but not by a JNK inhibitor (SP600125). NO-induced cGMP was found to activate CREB and ATF-2 in a p38, but not c-jun-dependent manner, while NO induced JNK in a cGMP-independent manner, leading to subsequent activation of c-jun and ATF-2. These results suggest that the low concentrations of endogenous NO present in cancer cell may induce the expression of many genes, including COX-2, which promotes the growth and survival of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986256457,"We reported earlier that IL-1β, an NF-κB-regulated cytokine, was made by intestinal epithelial cells during detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) and that IL-1 was antiapoptotic for detached cells. Since surviving anoikis is a prerequisite for cancer progression and metastases, we are further exploring the link between anoikis and cytokines. Here we determined that multiple genes are expressed following detachment including a number of NF-κB-regulated products and therefore aimed to determine whether NF-κB signalling plays any role in regulating apoptosis. Using Western blotting, we detected that IκBα becomes phosphorylated immediately following detachment and that levels of phospho-IκBα peaked within 20 min. Phosphorylation of IκBα was followed by Rel A (p65) nuclear translocation. Increased NF-κB activity following detachment was confirmed using the detection of NF-κB-promoted luciferase gene expression delivered by adenovirus infection. Infection of cells with adenovirus expressing a super-repressor IκBα protein and pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB resulted in the failure to phosphorylate IκBα, a more rapid activation of caspases and earlier apoptosis. We also detected that IκB kinase α (IKKα) and not IKKβ became phosphorylated following detachment. Since IKKα is activated by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), we overexpressed native NIK using an adenovirus vector that resulted in enhanced phospho-IκBα and nuclear p65 in detached cells compared to control detached cells but did not result in a significantly greater number of cells surviving to 24 h. We conclude that detachment directly activates NF-κB, which, in addition to launching an inflammatory cytokine wave, contributes to a delay in apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1992414536,"Constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade is a hallmark of cutaneous malignant melanoma. A single activating mutation (c.1799T>A; p.V600E) in the gene encoding the serine/threonine kinase B-RAF occurs in >60% of the tumors. Previous work has shown that knockdown of V600EB-RAF by RNA interference induces a variety of phenotypic changes in cultured melanoma cells, including lower proliferation rates, reduced anchorage-independent growth and apoptosis. Here, we show that the majority of melanomas harboring the V600EB-RAF mutation have retained the wild-type (WT) B-RAF allele, and that these cells can be rescued from the effects of V600EB-RAF knockdown by stimulation with growth factors. Ectopic expression of short hairpin RNAs specifically suppressing V600EB-RAF in melanoma cell lines reduced colony formation by ∼80%. This response could be rescued by basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor or, to a lesser extent, endothelin-1. Rescue with growth factors was not possible in cell lines lacking WTB-RAF. Single-cell clones with efficient knockdown of V600EB-RAF could be propagated in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor but underwent apoptosis or senescence-like growth arrest upon withdrawal of this growth factor. The ability of growth factors to modulate the response of V600EB-RAF knockdown in melanoma cells may have both experimental and therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W1977329581,"Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members alter mitochondrial permeability resulting in the release of apoptogenic factors that initiate a caspase cascade. These changes are well described; however, the effects of caspases on mitochondrial function are less well characterized. Here we describe the consequence of caspase-9 and effector caspase inhibition on mitochondrial physiology during intrinsic cell death. Caspase inhibition prevents the complete loss of mitochondrial membrane potential without affecting cytochrome c release. When effector caspases are inhibited, mitochondria become uncoupled and produce reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, the effector caspase-mediated depolarization of the mitochondria occurs independent of the activity of complexes I-IV of the electron transport chain. In contrast, caspase-9 inhibition prevents mitochondrial uncoupling and ROS production and allows for continued electron transport despite the release of cytochrome c. Taken together, these data suggest that activated caspase-9 prevents the accessibility of cytochrome c to complex III, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species, and that effector caspases may depolarize mitochondria to terminate ROS production and preserve an apoptotic phenotype."

Its activated form (HMGA2/T) presents oncogenic activities both in vivo and in vitro. However, its precise role during embryogenesis is unknown. We investigated its role during the commitment of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by constructing cell lines expressing either wild type (wt) or HMGA2/T forms of the gene. Following differentiation, control and wt HMGA2 ES cells did not display myotubes; whereas HMGA2/T ES cell lines massively formed contractile myotubes. Furthermore, as opposed to control cells, HMGA2/T ES cells highly expressed the muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) marker. Interestingly, in experimental conditions inhibitory for myogenesis, we observed a strong expression of MyoD and myogenin in HMGA2/T cells. By contrast, commitment into adipocyte, neuron, and cardiomyocyte lineages was not affected. Teratocarcinomas induced by HMGA2/T ES cell lines presented numerous skeletal muscle-differentiated tissues that were not observed in wt HMGA2 or control tumours. Finally, rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR kinase, downregulated endogenous HMGA-2 expression and inhibited myogenesis. This effect was prevented by overexpression of exogenous HMGA-2. Our results reveal a novel function of HMGA-2 in skeletal muscle differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2002491199,"A critical region of loss of heterozygosity on human chromosome 13q14 harbors the tumor suppressor gene DICE1 (DDX26). To elucidate the reduced DICE1 expression in tumor cells, the putative promoter sequence upstream of the DICE1 gene was analysed. This sequence shows a high GC content and is rich in CpG sites and binding sites of transcriptional factors. Promoter activity was identified within three overlapping fragments of the 800 bp sequence upstream of the DICE1 gene. A 13 bp deletion polymorphism detected in the DICE1 promoter region showed a decreased activity compared with the undeleted variant. However, this 13 bp deletion was seen in male control samples and patients with prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia at similar rates. A reduced DICE1 expression was observed in prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP. This downregulation is associated with hypermethylation of the DICE1 promoter. Treatment of both prostate cancer cell lines with 5-azacytidine leads to upregulation of DICE1 expression. Hypermethylation of CpG sites of the DICE1 promoter was observed in four of eight analysed prostate cancers. This study suggests that transcriptional repression of DICE1 is caused by hypermethylation of the DICE1 promoter region in prostate cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1974735366,"The secreted phospholipase A2 type IIA (Pla2g2a) gene was previously identified as a modifier of intestinal adenoma multiplicity in ApcMin/+ mice. To determine if intestinal secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity was also attenuated in susceptible strains, we developed a sensitive assay to directly quantitate sPLA2 activity in the murine intestinal tract utilizing a fluorescent BODIPY-labeled phospholipid substrate. Here, we report assay conditions that distinguish between secreted and cytosolic PLA2 enzyme activities in extracts of intestinal tissue. The small intestine exhibited higher activity levels than the large intestine. Consistent with predictions from the sPLA2-IIA gene sequence in inbred strains, we detected low levels of enzyme activity in inbred strains containing sPLA2-IIA mutations; these strains were also associated with greater numbers of intestinal polyps. Additionally, the assay was able to distinguish differences in levels of sPLA2 activity between neoplasia-resistant strains, which were then shown by sequencing to carry variant wild-type sPLA2-IIA alleles. Immunohistochemical analyses of intestinal tissues were consistent with sPLA2-IIA activity levels. This approach enables further studies of the mechanisms of sPLA2 action influencing the development and tumorigenesis of the small intestine and colon in both mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2143937358,"4.1B is a member of the protein 4.1 superfamily of proteins that link transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. The 4.1B gene localizes to chromosome 18p11.3, which undergoes loss of heterozygosity in mammary tumors. Here, we examine the expression of 4.1B in murine mammary epithelium and find that 4.1B is dramatically upregulated in mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy when there is extensive cell proliferation. In contrast, 4.1B is not expressed in virgin, lactating, or involuting mammary epithelium. To examine the consequence of 4.1B loss on mammary epithelial cell proliferation, we analysed mammary glands in 4.1B-null mice. 4.1B loss results in a significant increase in mammary epithelial cell proliferation during pregnancy, but has no effect on mammary epithelial cell proliferation, in virgin or involuting mice. Furthermore, we show that 4.1B inhibits the proliferation of mammary epithelial cell lines by inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest, characterized by decreased cyclin A expression and reduced Rb phosphorylation, and accompanied by reduced erbB2 phosphorylation. This cell cycle arrest does not involve alterations in the activities of MAPK, JNK, or Akt. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that 4.1B regulates mammary epithelial cell proliferation during pregnancy and suggest that its loss may influence mammary carcinoma pathogenesis in multiparous women."
https://openalex.org/W2009269143,"Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors play a pivotal role in the regulation of tumorigenesis, and also in a wide range of other developmental processes in diverse species from yeast to humans. Here we demonstrate for the first time that Ret finger protein (RFP), a member of the TRIM family of proteins initially identified as a recombined transforming gene from a human lymphoma, is a novel interaction partner for four different bHLH proteins (SCL, E47, MyoD and mASH-1), but does not interact with GATA-1 or PU.1. Interaction with SCL required the B-box and first coiled-coil region of RFP together with the bHLH domain of SCL. RFP was able to repress transcriptional activation by E47, MyoD and mASH-1, but not by members of several other transcription factor families. Transcriptional repression by RFP was trichostatin A sensitive and did not involve an Id-like mechanism or ubiquitination with subsequent degradation of bHLH proteins. Instead, our results suggest that bHLH transcription factors are regulated by a previously undescribed interaction with RFP, which functions to recruit HDAC and/or Polycomb proteins and thus repress target genes of bHLH proteins. These results reveal an unexpected link between the bHLH and TRIM protein families."
https://openalex.org/W2030487145,"The v-Erb A oncoprotein of avian erythroblastosis virus is derived from c-Erb A, a hormone-activated transcription factor. Notably, v-Erb A has sustained multiple mutations relative to c-Erb A and functions as a constitutive transcriptional repressor. We report here an analysis of the contributions of these different mutations to v-Erb A function. Our experiments demonstrate that two amino-acid differences between v-Erb A and c-Erb A, located in the ‘I-box,’ alter the dimerization properties of the viral protein, resulting in more stable homodimer formation, increased corepressor binding, and increased target gene repression. An additional amino-acid difference between v- and c-Erb A, located in helix 3 of the hormone binding domain, renders corepressor binding by the viral protein more resistant to release by thyroid hormone. Finally, we report that a C-terminal truncation in v-Erb A not only inhibits exchange of corepressor and coactivator, as previously noted, but also permits v-Erb A to recruit both SMRT and N-CoR corepressors, whereas c-Erb A is selective for N-CoR. The latter two mutations in v-Erb A also impair its ability to suppress c-Jun function in response to T3 hormone. We propose that the acquisition of oncogenic potential by the v-Erb A protein was a multistep process involving a series of mutations that alter the transcriptional repressive properties of the viral protein through multiple mechanisms."
