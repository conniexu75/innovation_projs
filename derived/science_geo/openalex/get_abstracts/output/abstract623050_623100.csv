https://openalex.org/W2902888572,"Plesiomonas shigelloides is an emerging pathogen with damaging effects on human health such as gastroenteritis and extraintestinal infections. Here, we carried out a bibliometric survey that aimed to examine publication trends in Plesiomonas-related research by time and place, international collaborative works, identify gaps and suggest directions for future research. The search term ""Plesiomonas shigelloides"" was used to retrieve articles published between 1990 and 2017 from the Web of Science database. Only primary research articles were included in the analysis. A total of 155 articles were published within the survey period, with an average of 5.54±2.66 articles per year and an annual growth rate of -0.8%. Research output peaked in 2000 and 2006 (each accounting for 7.7% of the total). The United States ranked first in terms of numbers of articles (n = 29, 18.1%) and total citations (n = 451). Cameroon, Canada, Cuba, Switzerland and Turkey co-shared the 10th position each with 2 articles (1.3%). Research collaboration was low (collaboration index = 3. 32). In addition to Plesiomonas shigelloides (n = 82, 52.9%), the top Authors Keywords and research focus included lipopolysaccharide and nuclear magnetic resonance (n = 13, 8.4%). Diarrhea (n = 43, 27.7%), Aeromonas species (n = 41, 26.5%) and infections (n = 31, 20.0%) were also highly represented in Keywords-Plus. Authors' collaborations and coupling networks formed two mega-clusters which nodes were shared solely by authors from high-income countries. The common conceptual framework in retrieved articles determined by K-means clustering revealed three clusters with sizes of 7, 16, and 29, representing research responses focused on extraintestinal and gastroenteritis, P. shigelloides lipopolysaccharide structure, and co-infections, respectively. Our bibliometric analysis revealed a global diminishing research in Plesiomonas; greater research outcomes from high-income countries compared to others and low collaboration with developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2902493189,"The nucleus accumbens (NAc) contains multiple subpopulations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). One subpopulation expresses D1-type dopamine receptors, another expresses D2-type receptors, and a third expresses both. The relative roles in NAc of D1 neurons versus D2 neurons in appetitive motivation were assessed here. Specifically, we asked whether D1-Cre mice would instrumentally seek optogenetic self-stimulation specifically targeted at D1 MSNs in NAc, and similarly if D2-Cre mice would self-stimulate D2 neurons in NAc. Mice were implanted with Cre-targeted channelrhodopsin (ChR2) virus and optic fibers in NAc. Subsequently, mice could earn brief NAc laser illuminations by actively touching a metal spout in one task, or by going to a particular location in a separate task. Results indicated that D1 neuronal excitation in NAc supported intense self-stimulation in both tasks. D1-Cre mice earned hundreds to thousands of spout-touches per half-hour session, and also sought out locations that delivered NAc laser to excite D1 MSNs. By comparison, D2 ChR2 mice showed lower but still positive levels of self-stimulation in the spout-touch task, earning dozens to hundreds of NAc laser illuminations. However, in the location task, D2 mice failed to show positive self-stimulation. If anything, a few D2 individuals gradually avoided the laser location. Brain-wide measures indicated that D1 and D2 stimulations in NAc recruited heavily overlapping patterns of Fos activation in distant limbic structures. These results confirm that excitation of D1 MSNs in NAc supports strong incentive motivation to self-stimulate. They also suggest that excitation of D2 neurons in NAc supports self-stimulation under some conditions, but fails under others and possibly may even shift to negative avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W2902277453,"The rumen microbiome is fundamental for the productivity and health of dairy cattle and diet is known to influence the rumen microbiota composition. In this study, grape-pomace, a natural source of polyphenols, and copper sulfate were provided as feed supplementation in 15 Holstein-Friesian calves, including 5 controls. After 75 days of supplementation, genomic DNA was extracted from the rumen liquor and prepared for 16S rRNA-gene sequencing to characterize the composition of the rumen microbiota. From this, the rumen metagenome was predicted to obtain the associated gene functions and metabolic pathways in a cost-effective manner. Results showed that feed supplementations did alter the rumen microbiome of calves. Copper and grape-pomace increased the diversity of the rumen microbiota: the Shannon’s and Fisher’s alpha indices were significantly different across groups (p-values 0.045 and 0.039), and Bray-Curtis distances could separate grape-pomace calves from the other two groups. Differentially abundant taxa were identified: in particular, an uncultured Bacteroidales UCG-001 genus and OTUs from genus Sarcina were the most differentially abundant in pomace-supplemented calves compared to controls (p-values 0.003 and 0.0002, respectively). Enriched taxonomies such as Ruminiclostridium and Eubacterium sp., whose functions are related to degradation of the grape- pomace constituents (e.g. flavonoids or xyloglucan) have been described (p-values 0.027/0.028 and 0.040/0.022 in Pomace vs Copper and Controls, respectively). The most abundant predicted metagenomic genes belonged to the arginine and proline metabolism and the two- component (sensor/responder) regulatory system, which were increased in the supplemented groups. Interestingly, the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway was decreased in the two supplemented groups, possibly as a result of antimicrobial effects. Methanogenic taxa also responded to the feed supplementation, and methane metabolism in the rumen was the second most different pathway (up-regulated by feed supplementations) between experimental groups."
https://openalex.org/W2902584607,"For many insects, diapause is the primary mechanism for surviving unfavorable seasons. Some aspects of diapause regulation are well known, but we still lack a mechanistic understanding of molecular mechanisms that control the diapause pathway. Accumulating evidence suggests microRNAs regulate diapause in evolutionarily diverse insect species including flesh flies and moths, and, it is likely that microRNAs regulate multiple characteristics of diapause, including arrested egg follicle development and fat hypertrophy, in females of the Northern house mosquito, Culex pipiens. To investigate microRNA regulation of diapause in this species, we measured changes in egg follicle development and total lipid content over 22 days following adult emergence. We also evaluated changes in the abundance of candidate microRNAs associated with these physical changes during the same time frame. We found egg follicle size and lipid content were nearly the same in diapausing and nondiapausing females on the day of adult emergence, and then diverged over time such that by day 22 diapausing females had significantly smaller egg follicles and higher total lipids than their nondiapausing counterparts. Several microRNAs associated with lipid metabolism in insects, including miR-14-3p, miR-277-3p, and miR-305-5p, were underexpressed in diapausing females compared to nondiapausing females on the day of adult emergence, which suggests microRNA regulation occurs ahead of observed changes in these two features of the diapause phenotype. We also found miR-309-3p, miR-375-3p which stimulate ovarian development in other mosquito species, were underexpressed in diapausing females of Cx. pipiens at times after diapause is fully established and may be responsible for the arrest in ovarian development in this species. Taken together, our results demonstrate that changes in the abundance of some microRNAs is associated with phenotypic changes in diapause Cx. pipiens and suggests this epigenetic mechanism is part of the molecular toolkit regulating diapause."
https://openalex.org/W2903082935,"Utilization of maternal health care services is key to reducing the number of perinatal deaths and post-natal complications in sub-Saharan Africa. With a few exceptions, many studies that examine the use of maternal health services in sub-Saharan Africa have focused largely on individual-level explanations and have ignored the importance of contextual and community-level explanations. In Ghana, progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality ratio from 740/100,000 in the late 1990s to 319/100,000 in 2015 but these rates are still high. Our study focuses on impact of individual and community level-factors on maternal outcomes with the hope that it will inform public policy in Ghana. This approach highlights latent or unacknowledged aspects of fragility within health systems designed to improve maternal health and opportunities for improving uptake of services.Using the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, we examined the effects of individual and community-level factors on antenatal care, facility-based delivery, and post-natal care. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of individual and community-level factors on the outcome variables. Our analysis revealed that overall utilization of antenatal, facility-based delivery and post-natal care was substantial across the board; however, both individual and community-level factors were significant predictors of these maternal health outcomes. Wealthier and better educated women were more likely to use antenatal services and facility-based delivery; in contrast poor and uneducated women were more likely to use antenatal and postnatal care but not facility-based delivery. Additionally, use of National Health Insurance Scheme was statistically associated with the utilization of maternal health services.The findings point to areas where services can be better tailored to meet community-specific needs. Policy makers must consider factors such as educational levels and economic security at both individual and community-levels that shape women's preferences and uptake of maternal health care in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2902005226,"Recently, as the paradigm of medical services has shifted from treatment to prevention, there is a growing interest in smart healthcare that can provide users with healthcare services anywhere, at any time, using information and communications technologies. With the development of the smart healthcare industry, there is a growing need for collecting large-scale personal health data to exploit the knowledge obtained through analyzing them for improving the smart healthcare services. Although such a considerable amount of health data can be a valuable asset to the smart healthcare fields, they may cause serious privacy problems if sensitive information of an individual user is leaked to outside users. Therefore, most individuals are reluctant to provide their health data to smart healthcare service providers for data analysis and utilization purpose, which is the biggest challenge in smart healthcare fields. Thus, in this paper, we develop a novel mechanism for privacy-preserving collection of personal health data streams that is characterized as temporal data collected at fixed intervals by leveraging local differential privacy (LDP). In particular, with the proposed approach, a data contributor uses a given privacy budget of LDP to report a small amount of salient data, which are extracted from an entire health data stream, to a data collector. Then, a data collector can effectively reconstruct a health data stream based on the noisy salient data received from a data contributor. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides significant accuracy gains over straightforward solutions to this problem."
https://openalex.org/W2902121240,"Introduction Exploiting information in health-related social media services is of great interest for patients, researchers and medical companies. The challenge is, however, to provide easy, quick and relevant access to the vast amount of information that is available. One step towards facilitating information access to online health data is opinion mining. Even though the classification of patient opinions into positive and negative has been previously tackled, most works make use of machine learning methods and bags of words. Our first contribution is an extensive evaluation of different features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based, sentiment-based and word embeddings features to represent patient-authored texts for polarity classification. The second contribution of this work is the study of polar facts (i.e. objective information with polar connotations). Traditionally, the presence of polar facts has been neglected and research in polarity classification has been bounded to opinionated texts. We demonstrate the existence and importance of polar facts for the polarity classification of health information. Material and methods We annotate a set of more than 3500 posts to online health forums of breast cancer, crohn and different allergies, respectively. Each sentence in a post is manually labeled as “experience”, “fact” or “opinion”, and as “positive”, “negative” and “neutral”. Using this data, we train different machine learning algorithms and compare traditional bags of words representations with word embeddings in combination with lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based and emotional properties of texts to automatically classify patient-authored contents into positive, negative and neutral. Beside, we experiment with a combination of textual and semantic representations by generating concept embeddings using the UMLS Metathesaurus. Results We reach two main results: first, we find that it is possible to predict polarity of patient-authored contents with a very high accuracy (≈ 70 percent) using word embeddings, and that this considerably outperforms more traditional representations like bags of words; and second, when dealing with medical information, negative and positive facts (i.e. objective information) are nearly as frequent as negative and positive opinions and experiences (i.e. subjective information), and their importance for polarity classification is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W2902223898,"The authors conducted a prospective longitudinal study from 2009 to 2016 to assess the short and long-term impact of a formal mentorship program on junior faculty satisfaction and productivity. Junior faculty mentees enrolled in the program and junior faculty without formal mentorship were administered surveys before and after the program to assess satisfaction with their mentoring experiences. Long-term retention, promotion, and funding data were also collected. Twenty-three junior faculty mentees and 91 junior faculty controls were included in the study. Mentees came from the Departments of Radiation Oncology and Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Management. After participating in the mentorship program, mentees demonstrated an increase in satisfaction from baseline in five of seven domains related to mentoring, while controls experienced no significant change in satisfaction in six of the seven domains. At long-term follow up, mentees were more likely than controls to hold senior faculty positions (percent senior faculty: 47% vs. 13%, p = 0.030) despite no difference in initial administrative rank. When comparing the subset of faculty who were Instructors at baseline, mentees were more likely to be funded and/or promoted than controls (p = 0.030). A majority of mentees reported that the program strengthened their long-term success, and many maintained their original mentoring relationships and formed new ones, highlighting the strong culture of mentorship that was instilled. Several short-term and long-term benefits were fostered from this formal mentorship program. These findings highlight the potential impact of mentorship programs in propagating a culture of mentorship and excellence."
https://openalex.org/W2903254549,"One of the biggest challenges for genetic studies on natural or unstructured populations is the unbalanced datasets where individuals are measured at different times and environments. This problem is also common in crop and animal breeding where many individuals are only evaluated for a single year and large but unbalanced datasets can be generated over multiple years. Many wheat breeding programs have focused on increasing bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield, but processing and end-use quality are critical components when considering its use in feeding the rising population of the next century. The challenges with end-use quality trait improvements are high cost and seed amounts for testing, the latter making selection in early breeding populations impossible. Here we describe a novel approach to identify marker-trait associations within a breeding program using a meta-genome wide association study (GWAS), which combines GWAS analysis from multi-year unbalanced breeding nurseries, in a manner reflecting meta-GWAS in humans. This method facilitated mapping of processing and end-use quality phenotypes from advanced breeding lines (n = 4,095) of the CIMMYT bread wheat breeding program from 2009 to 2014. Using the meta-GWAS we identified marker-trait associations, allele effects, candidate genes, and can select using markers generated in this process. Finally, the scope of this approach can be broadly applied in 'breeding-assisted genomics' across many crops to greatly increase our functional understanding of plant genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2902698098,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces severe deficiencies in sensory-motor and autonomic functions and has a significant negative impact on patients’ quality of life. There is currently no systematic rehabilitation technique assuring recovery of the neurological impairments caused by a complete SCI. Here, we report significant clinical improvement in a group of seven chronic SCI patients (six AIS A, one AIS B) following a 28-month, multi-step protocol that combined training with non-invasive brain-machine interfaces, visuo-tactile feedback and assisted locomotion. All patients recovered significant levels of nociceptive sensation below their original SCI (up to 16 dermatomes, average 11 dermatomes), voluntary motor functions (lower-limbs muscle contractions plus multi-joint movements) and partial sensory function for several modalities (proprioception, tactile, pressure, vibration). Patients also recovered partial intestinal, urinary and sexual functions. By the end of the protocol, all patients had their AIS classification upgraded (six from AIS A to C, one from B to C). These improvements translated into significant changes in the patients’ quality of life as measured by standardized psychological instruments. Reexamination of one patient that discontinued the protocol after 12 months of training showed that the 16-month break resulted in neurological stagnation and no reclassification. We suggest that our neurorehabilitation protocol, based uniquely on non-invasive technology (therefore necessitating no surgical operation), can become a promising therapy for patients diagnosed with severe paraplegia (AIS A, B), even at the chronic phase of their lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2903220440,"In Iran, People Who Inject Drugs (PWID), Female Sex Workers (FSW), and prisoners are the main key populations at risk of HIV infection. This study aimed to evaluate the trend of HIV incidence among PWID, FSW and prisoners as an impact measure of HIV harm reduction and prevention efforts in Iran. Data were obtained from the two rounds of national bio-behavioral surveillance surveys among FSW (2010 (n = 872), 2015 (n = 1339)), PWID (2010 (n = 2417), 2014 (n = 2307)), and prisoners (2009 (n = 4536), 2013 (n = 5390)) through facility-based (FSW and PWID surveys) and cluster sampling (prisoner surveys). Time-at-risk was calculated assuming the age at first sex or drug injection as the beginning of the at-risk period and the age at the time of the interview or date when they received a positive HIV test result as the end of this period, adjusted for interval censoring. HIV incidence among PWID in 2014 was 5.39 (95% CI 4.71, 6.16) per 1,000 person-years (PY), significantly lower than in 2009 (17.07, 95% CI 15.34, 19.34). Similarly, HIV incidence was 1.12 (95% CI 0.77, 1.64) per 1,000 PY among FSW in 2015, a significant drop from 2010 (2.38, 95% CI 1.66, 3.40). Also, HIV incidence decreased among prisoners from 1.34 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.67) in 2009 to 0.49 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.61) per 1,000 PY in 2013. Our findings suggest that after an increase in the 2000s, the HIV incidence may have been decreased and stabilized among key populations in Iran."
https://openalex.org/W2903057056,"To analyse patient and healthcare system related factors influencing the time to first healthcare visit, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients in sub-Saharan Africa and the impact on survival in order to advise on early detection strategies.A prospective hospital cohort study was conducted at the only pathology department in Mali, at the University Hospital in Bamako. All the female patients with a breast cancer diagnosis between January and April 2016 were interviewed with a structured questionnaire (N = 64) to gather information about breast symptom recognition and first healthcare visit. Information on beginning of treatment and survival were collected at 18-months follow-up. Simple Cox regression analyses were performed.The median time to first healthcare visit was 4.8 months, from first healthcare visit to diagnosis was 0.9 months and for the patients who started treatment (N = 46) the time from diagnosis to treatment was 1.3 months. Knowledge of breast-self-examination and correct symptom interpretation increased the chance of an earlier healthcare visit. Prolonged time to diagnosis was found with shorter duration to first healthcare visit, for working women compared to housewives and for those living within Bamako. Living outside Bamako and smaller tumour size (T1/T2) prolonged time to treatment. Visit of a traditional healer and larger tumour size (T3/T4) shortened survival time, whereas time to first healthcare visit and subsequent time to diagnosis had no influence on survival.Down-staging strategies are only useful if the continuum of breast cancer care is warranted for the majority of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2903017909,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) living with HIV are disproportionately impacted by HPV-associated anal cancer, with rates about 100-fold that of the general population. Fortunately, HPV vaccination has proven efficacy in preventing both anogenital warts (condyloma) in males and anal pre-cancers (anal intraepithelial neoplasia; AIN) in GBM up to the age of 26. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 25 HIV-positive gay men in Toronto to gain an understanding of their knowledge and experiences related to HPV and the HPV vaccine. These participants were part of The HPV Screening and Vaccine Evaluation (HPV-SAVE) Study, and received invitations to have anal cancer screening from their primary care doctors. Interviews were analyzed following a Grounded Theory Approach. Most participants had not received the HPV vaccine. Men described a lack of prior knowledge of the health consequences of HPV for GBM living with HIV and financial barriers to vaccine access. Participants did not articulate concerns about vaccine safety. Men frequently reported initial beliefs that HPV was predominantly-or exclusively-a risk for females or young girls, and thus they had not considered the vaccine to be necessary. Some participants remained uncertain if the current availability of the vaccine, and their newly acquired knowledge of its importance, was ""too little, too late"" because of their age and/or HPV exposure. Improving access and uptake of HPV vaccination requires addressing both financial barriers to access as well as increasing HPV health literacy levels, particularly by reframing the long-standing gendered associations of HPV. Physicians should provide clear, tailored messages regarding HPV vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2903178772,"Cerebrospinal fluid is investigated in biomarker studies for various neurological disorders of the central nervous system due to its proximity to the brain. Currently, only a limited number of biomarkers have been validated in independent studies. The high variability in the protein composition and protein abundance of cerebrospinal fluid between as well as within individuals might be an important reason for this phenomenon. To evaluate this possibility, we investigated the inter- and intraindividual variability in the cerebrospinal fluid proteome globally, with a specific focus on disease biomarkers described in the literature. Cerebrospinal fluid from a longitudinal study group including 12 healthy control subjects was analyzed by label-free quantification (LFQ) via LC-MS/MS. Data were quantified via MaxQuant. Then, the intra- and interindividual variability and the reference change value were calculated for every protein. We identified and quantified 791 proteins, and 216 of these proteins were abundant in all samples and were selected for further analysis. For these proteins, we found an interindividual coefficient of variation of up to 101.5% and an intraindividual coefficient of variation of up to 29.3%. Remarkably, these values were comparably high for both proteins that were published as disease biomarkers and other proteins. Our results support the hypothesis that natural variability greatly impacts cerebrospinal fluid protein biomarkers because high variability can lead to unreliable results. Thus, we suggest controlling the variability of each protein to distinguish between good and bad biomarker candidates, e.g., by utilizing reference change values to improve the process of evaluating potential biomarkers in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2902727914,"Physical activity contributes to prevent serious diseases and ailments, and previous research indicates that lifestyle habits are likely to track from early childhood to adulthood. 90% of Norwegian children aged 1-5 are enrolled in preschools, and preschool staff can play an important role in children's activity levels. This study's aim was to identify whether any associations exist between preschool staff's characteristics (initiative, participation, attitudes, and activity levels) and children's activity in preschool.289 children aged 4-6 and 72 preschool staff from 13 randomly selected preschools in a region of Nord-Troendelag, Norway, were enrolled in the study. All participants wore an Actigraph accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Questionnaires were also utilized to identify correlates between preschool staff's attitudes and initiative in relation to children's physical activity, in addition to their participation in children's physical activity. A multilevel analysis, the linear mixed model (LMM), was used to elucidate associations between preschool staff and children's activity levels.A significant association was found between preschool staff's average activity levels during preschool hours and children's corresponding activity levels during preschool hours (t = 2.57; p = 0.021; f2 = 0.013). There were, however, no significant associations identified between the attitudes (t = -0.44; p = 0.67), initiative (t = -0.14; p = 0.89), and participation (t = 0.66; p = 0.52) variables among preschool staff and children's activity levels during preschool hours.The study demonstrated that a significant association exists between preschool staff's aggregated activity levels and 4-6-year-olds' individual activity levels. However, an observational study is requisite in order to determine whether the association is based on preschool staff's impact on children's physical activity or if it is the children that affect the preschool staff's activity levels, or a combination thereof."
https://openalex.org/W2903250178,"Interaction networks are sensitive to elevation gradients through changes in local distribution of interacting partners. Here, we use plant-pollinator interaction network metrics to assess the effect of elevation on flowers and flower-visiting insect assemblages on a sentinel mountain used for monitoring climate change in the flower- and insect-rich Cape Floristic Region. We also use these interaction metrics to explain the effect of environmental factors on the interaction networks. We did this over four vegetation zones <1640m asl, as determined by former botanical studies. Overall, bees were the dominant flower visitors, followed by monkey beetles, and far behind were wasps and flies. The middle elevation zone (650-744 m a.s.l), which is also an ecotone between two distinct botanical zones, had the highest species richness and abundance of interacting plants and insects. Interaction frequency and size of network were also greatest in the middle zone, as were network diversity, generality, and linkage density, while lowest in the peak zone. In sum, there was distinct elevation zoning of flower-visiting insects. The greatest zonal change was between species at the middle compared with peak zone. Large-sized monkey beetles, bees and flies characterized the unique assemblage in the peak zone (1576-1640 m a.s.l.). The insect zonation tracked that of plant assemblages, with air temperature (lapse rate) being the primary driver of bee distribution, with lowest levels in the peak zone. In contrast, beetle distribution was driven mostly by flower assemblages as well as air temperature. In turn, wasp and fly interaction networks were not affected by any of the measured environmental variables. We conclude that increased elevation stress from reduced temperatures, changing abiotic weather conditions (e.g. strong winds at high elevations),and decline in flowering plant composition causes breakdown of interaction networks involving bees and beetles but not that of flies and wasps."
https://openalex.org/W2902864014,"Extensive antibiotic use makes the intensive care unit (ICU) an important focus for antibiotic stewardship programs. The aim of this study was to develop a set of actionable quality indicators for appropriate antibiotic use at ICUs and an implementation toolbox, which can be used to assess and improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use in the treatment of adult patients at an ICU.A four round modified-RAND Delphi procedure was used. Potential indicators were identified by a multidisciplinary panel of 15 Dutch experts, from international literature and guidelines. Using an online survey, the identified indicators were rated on three criteria: relevance, actionability and feasibility. Experts discussed and rated the indicators for the second time during a face-to-face consensus meeting. During a final consensus meeting the toolbox was developed, containing potential barriers and improvement strategies which were identified using a validated checklist by Flottorp et al., and if available also containing supporting material.The first round resulted in 24 potential indicators. After the final meeting a set of three process indicators, one structure indicator and one quantity metric remained: 1) perform at least two sets of blood cultures before start of empirical systemic therapy; 2) perform therapeutic drug monitoring in patients treated with vancomycin or aminoglycosides; 3) perform surveillance cultures if selective digestive or oropharyngeal decontamination is applied at the ICU; 4) biannual face-to-face meetings between ICU and microbiology staff in which local resistance rates are discussed; and 5) quantitative antibiotic use at the ICU expressed in days of therapy (DOT). The toolbox contains 24 unique barriers and 37 improvement strategies.Our study identified a set of four actionable quality indicators and one quantity metric, together with an implementation toolbox, to improve appropriate antibiotic use at ICUs."
https://openalex.org/W2902186708,"Substandard and falsified medicines represent a serious threat for public health and patient safety. Especially in low and middle-income countries, the prevalence of substandard and falsified medicines is reportedly high. However, reliable information on the prevalence of poor-quality medicines is scarce. In this study, 12 essential medicines, including antibiotics, antidiabetics, cardiac drugs and antiasthmatic drugs, were collected from six informal vendors and six licensed pharmacies in the southern part of Togo (regions Maritime and Plateaux). A mystery shopper approach was used in both types of outlets. In total, 64 samples were collected from licensed pharmacies and 30 from informal vendors. Both availability of medicines and prices of medicines were higher in licensed pharmacies than in informal vendors. 92 medicine samples were analyzed by visual examination, followed by chemical analysis for the content and for the dissolution of the active pharmaceutical ingredients according to the respective monographs of the United States Pharmacopoeia. 7 samples (8%) did not comply with the pharmacopoeial specifications, and one sample (1%) showed even extreme deviations. None of the samples was obviously falsified. However, one sample of amoxicillin capsules contained only 47% of the declared content of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, indicating that it may represent amoxicillin capsules 250 mg, rather than 500mg as declared on the label. Medicines stated to originate from Asia (i.e. mainly from India and China) showed a significantly higher proportion (24%) of non-compliant samples than those from Africa and Europe (4%, p = 0.007). High failure rates were observed in medicines both from informal vendors (13%) and from licensed pharmacies (5%), but the difference between both groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.152). The observed high prevalence of substandard medicines requires action from regulatory authorities and health care providers. Testing of selected samples for related substances indicated that inappropriate transport and storage conditions may have been an important cause for substandard quality."
https://openalex.org/W2902401970,"Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Oral Health Literacy Assessment in Spanish (OHLA-S) for the Brazilian-Portuguese language using robust analysis and with the results disclose possibilities to develop a shorter and more valid instrument. Methods OHLA-S is an oral health literacy instrument comprising a word recognition section and a comprehension section. It consists of 24 dental words. It was translated into the Brazilian-Portuguese language (OHLA-B) and its psychometric properties were evaluated in a random sample of 250 adults aged 20–59 years. To assess the dimensionality and factor structure were tested by means of Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Reliability was assessed using two indicators: Cronbach's alpha and McDonald’s Omega. Results EFA and CFA demonstrated that the OHLA-B with 24 items did not present an adequate adjustment of the model, compromising its validity. In addition, reliability values at 0.50 for Cronbach's alpha and 0.67 for McDonald's omega were below the minimum acceptable rate of 0.70. As no support was found for the original structure, we decided to proceed with the withdrawal of individual items and successive reanalysis of the model until the indicators were adjusted in a shorter instrument. A new structure with 15 items produced an instrument with two dimensions and a better goodness of fit than the original instrument. The Alpha and Omega reliability index values increased to 0.83 and 0.80, respectively, and all scores were better in the OLHA-B with 15 items than in the instrument with 24 items. Conclusion OLHA-B with the original structure composed by 24 items did not show acceptable construct validity. The shorter version with 15 items showed more promising results for assessing oral health literacy levels in the Brazilian population."

Aiming at the demands of local information for terminal device and the shortcomings of cloud computing framework in supporting mobile applications, by taking the hospital scene as an example, a searchable personal health records framework with fine-grained access control in cloud-fog computing is proposed. The proposed framework combines the attribute-based encryption (ABE) technology and search encryption (SE) technology to implement keyword search function and fine-grained access control ability. When keyword index and trapdoor match are successful, the cloud server provider only returns relevant search results to the user, thus achieving a more accurate search. At the same time, the scheme is multi-authority, and the key leakage problem is solved by dividing the user secret key distribution task. Moreover, in the proposed scheme, we securely outsource part of the encryption and decryption operations to the fog node. It is effective both in local resources and in resource-constrained mobile devices. Based on the decisional q-parallel bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent (q-DBDHE) assumption and decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption, our scheme is proven to be secure. Simulation experiments show that our scheme is efficient in the cloud-fog environment."
https://openalex.org/W2902152627,"Information regarding species’ status at a regional scale is instrumental for effective conservation planning. Some regions of southwestern Europe, such as Portugal, albeit included in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, lack a detailed assessment of the distribution patterns of several taxonomic groups, such as carnivores. Moreover, information is scattered, often unreliable and biased towards some species or regions. This study aimed at reviewing the existing knowledge on mammalian terrestrial carnivores in Portugal, to analyse research trends, update the species checklist and assess their historical and current distribution patterns. We conducted a comprehensive review of 755 scientific studies to analyse several publication metrics and compiled 20,189 presence records of all mammalian terrestrial carnivores occurring in Portugal since historical times to evaluate their distribution patterns. Carnivore research in Portugal began in the 18th century, with a recent boost in the mid-1990s, and has been biased towards certain research topics and regionally threatened species. There are 15 extant species in Portugal, with nine occurring across the country, six showing a more limited range, as well as one additional species currently locally extinct (Ursus arctos). Over the last decades, the distribution ranges of seven species apparently remained stable, two expanded, two contracted, and three showed unclear trends. The presence of a new invasive carnivore, the raccoon (Procyon lotor), is also documented here. This study illustrates the relevance of a comprehensive analysis of non-systematic data to assess the historic and current status of mammalian terrestrial carnivores at a national level, and to identify knowledge gaps and research priorities."
https://openalex.org/W2903142149,"Background Adequate disease and treatment-related risk knowledge of people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) is a prerequisite for informed choices in medical encounters. Previous work showed that MS risk knowledge is low among pwMS and role preferences are different in Italy and Germany. Objective We investigated the level of risk knowledge and role preferences in 8 countries and assessed putative variables associated with risk knowledge. Methods An online-survey was performed based on the Risk knowledge questionnaire for people with relapsing-remitting MS (RIKNO 2.0), the electronic Control Preference Scale (eCPS), and other patient questionnaires. Inclusion criteria of participants were: (1) age ≥18 years, (2) a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), (3) being in a decision making process for a disease modifying drug. Results Of 1939 participants from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Serbia, Spain and Turkey, 986 (51%) (mean age 38.6 years [range 18–67], 77% women, 7.8 years of disease duration) completed the RIKNO 2.0, with a mean of 41% correct answers. There were less than 50 participants in the UK and Estonia and data were not analysed. Risk knowledge differed across countries (p < 0.001). Variables significantly associated with higher risk knowledge were higher education (p < 0.001), previous experience with disease modifying drugs (p = 0.001), correct answer to a medical data interpretation question (p < 0.001), while higher fear for wheelchair dependency was negatively associated to risk knowledge (p = 0.001). Conclusion MS risk knowledge was overall low and differed across participating countries. These data indicate that information is an unmet need of most pwMS."
https://openalex.org/W2902078253,"Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of 3D anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) for the detection of corneal endothelial features in patients with Fuchs’ Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD). Methods Twenty patients with clinical diagnosis of FECD (group A), and 20 control subjects (group B) were enrolled. In all patients a complete ophthalmological examination was performed, including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp examination for subjective grading of FECD and corneal endothelial specular microscopy. A 512x128 AS-OCT cube centered on the corneal apex was performed, and then the inner surface of the cornea was visualized and analyzed individually. Results Overall, the study participants were adults (mean age was 57.35 ± 8.45 years [mean ± SD] 80% female) with a BCVA ranged from 1.3 to 0 LogMAR. The OCT analysis disclosed three different patterns of the corneal endothelium (1, 2, 3) according to the signal distribution and the level of reflectivity: a homogenous, hypo-reflective surface (pattern 1); the presence of hyper-reflective orange-yellowish points (pattern 2); and a mottled appearance with a variable number of hyper-reflective areas (pattern 3). The distributions of these morphological models in the two populations were as follows: patterns 1, 2 and 3 were observed respectively in 0%, 80%, and 20% of patients in group A, and in 80%, 20% and 0% of subjects in group B. Correlation analysis unveiled a positive relationship between OCT corneal endothelium reflectivity and the clinical severity score (assessed with biomicroscopy), as well as an inverse relationship between the OCT pattern and the integrity of corneal endothelium. Conclusion 3D AS-OCT is a useful tool in investigation of endothelial features and therefore may represent a valuable support in the setting of FECD diagnosis and staging."
https://openalex.org/W2902937888,"Though both contraction of agonist muscles and co-contraction of antagonistic muscle pairs across the ankle joint are essential to postural stability, they are perceived to operate independently of each other, In an antagonistic setup, agonist muscles contract generating moment about the joint, while antagonist muscles contract generating stiffness across the joint. While both work together in maintaining robustness in the face of external perturbations, contractions of agonist muscles and co-contractions of antagonistic muscle pairs across the ankle joint play different roles in responding to and adapting to external perturbations. To determine their respective roles, we exposed participants to repeated perturbations in both large and small magnitudes. The center of pressure (COP) and a co-contraction index (CCI) were used to quantify the activation of agonist muscles and antagonistic muscle pairs across the ankle joint. Our results found that participants generated moment of a large magnitude across the ankle joint—a large deviation in the COP curve—in response to perturbations of a large magnitude (p <0.05), whereas the same participants generated higher stiffness about the ankle—a larger value in CCI—in response to perturbations of a small magnitude (p <0.05). These results indicate that participants use different postural strategies pertaining to circumstances. Further, the moment across the ankle decreased with repetitions of the same perturbation (p <0.05), and CCI tended to remain unchanged even in response to a different perturbation following repetition of the same perturbation (p <0.05). These findings suggest that ankle muscle contraction and co-contraction play different roles in regaining and maintaining postural stability. This study demonstrates that ankle moment and stiffness are not correlated in response to external perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2903183072,"Purpose This study compared subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) measurements using a skinfold caliper and Renco Lean-Meater Series 12 A-mode portable ultrasound scanner (A-US). It aimed to assess their inter- and intra-rater reliability and measure the agreement between both methods. Methods Eighty-four volunteers of different fitness levels were divided into three groups by Ʃ6 skinfolds: G1 ≤ 55 mm (n = 33 males); G2 > 55 mm (n = 32 males); G3 = 98.0 ± 52.3 mm (n = 19 females). Triceps, subscapular, biceps, iliac crest, supraspinal, abdominal, front thigh and medial calf were assessed by ultrasound and skinfolds. Two technicians for both tools performed triplicate measures. Intraclass correlation (ICC), technical error of measurement (TEM) and coefficients of variation (CVs) were applied for test-retest and inter-rater reliability. Non-Parametric statistics were used in order to establish possible statistical differences and correlation between skinfolds thickness and uncompressed subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness from ultrasound. The amount of agreement between both methods was assessed with Lin’s coefficient and a scatterplot of all site locations. A Bland-Altman plot was constructed to establish limits of agreement between groups and regression analysis was employed to assess the ability of skinfolds to explain the variance of ultrasound. Results Test-retest ICC for skinfolds and ultrasound were higher than 0.989 and 0.793, respectively. Inter-rater ICC for skinfolds was 0.999 with a 95% CI of 0.995 to 0.999 and for ultrasound was 0.755 with a much larger 95% CI of 0.622 to 0.841. TEMs (> 8.50%) and CVs (> 6.72%) compromised ultrasound reliability. Statistical differences were found in most of the analysed anatomical sites (p < 0.001) except in biceps G2 (Z = -1.150, p = 0.25) and G3 (Z = -1.309, p = 0.19). Good correlations (r > 0.7, p ≤ 0.05) were reported at almost all anatomical sites and groups except for biceps (G1: Rho = 0.26, p = 0.140) and abdominal (G2: Rho = -0.16, p = 0.38; G3: Rho = 0.43, p = 0.068). Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient registered low values of agreement between skinfolds and A-mode ultrasound (ranged from—0.009–0.646). The scatterplot and the estimated regression line drawn through the midst of all anatomical sites of the whole sample had a slope of 0.51 and R2 adjusted = 0.62 was obtained. The combined analysis between the Bland-Altman plot and the linear regression showed that specifically in the G2 and G3 groups, as the SAT increases the differences between skinfolds and ultrasounds measurements also increases. Conclusions The Renco Lean-Meater ultrasound is not interchangeable with skinfold measures. Its utility is questionable, particularly for assessing SAT in active adult populations. Its poor test-retest and inter-rater reliability as well as the lack of agreement when compared to the skinfolds would exclude the free use of the A-mode ultrasound scanner in its hypothetical replacing of the classical calipers."
https://openalex.org/W2903432820,"Purpose To characterize resting-state brain activation patterns and investigate altered areas for cognitive decline in HIV patients. Methods Twelve male HIV patients with intact cognition (HIV-IC), 10 with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), and 11 male healthy controls (HC) underwent resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Three rsfMRI values, regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were calculated and compared between groups. Correlation analyses were performed between rsfMRI values and neuropsychological tests. Results rsfMRI analyses revealed decreased rsfMRI values in the frontal areas, and increases in the posterior brain regions for both HIV-IC and HAND compared to HC. When directly compared to HIV-IC, HAND showed lower fALFF in the orbitofrontal cortex and higher ReHo in the primary sensorimotor area. Additionally, decreased orbitofrontal fALFF, increased sensorimotor ReHo, and a larger difference between the two values were highly correlated with decreased verbal memory and executive function in HIV patients. Conclusions Regardless of cognitive status, altered local intrinsic activities were found in HIV patients. The orbitofrontal cortex and primary sensorimotor area were more disrupted in HAND relative to HIV-IC and correlated with behavioral performance, suggesting these areas are relevant to cognitive impairment in HIV patients."

Dynamic lighting was reported beneficial in supporting individuals’ psychological behavior and physiological responses during work period in Europe. It has yet to be investigated in workplaces with minimal/no natural daylight contribution in tropical Malaysia. Hence, an exploratory experimental study was initiated in an experimental windowless open-plan workplace in Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang. The aim was to identify dynamic lighting configurations that were more supportive of a morning boosting effect than the control constant lighting, to support dayshift individuals’ psychophysiological wellbeing indicators during the peak morning work period. The immediate impact of a 2-hour morning exposure to overhead white LED (6500 K) with different horizontal illuminance levels and oscillations (lighting patterns) were investigated on physiological indicator limited to urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, and psychological indicators for alertness, mood, visual comfort, cognitive and visual task performance. Not all of the investigated dynamic lighting configurations were supportive of a morning boost. Only configurations 500increased to750 and 500increased to1000 lx therapeutically supported most of the indicators. Both these configurations suppressed urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, and improved alertness, cognitive performance, positive affect, and visual comfort better than ‘visit 1: 500constant500’ lx (control). The increasing oscillation was observed more beneficial for the morning boost in tropical Malaysia, which is in reverse to that specified in the human rhythmic dynamic lighting protocol developed by researchers from the Netherlands for application during winter. The findings from this study present the feasibility of dynamic architectural lighting acting as an environmental therapeutic solution in supporting the individuals’ psychophysiological wellbeing indicators in windowless open-plan workplace in tropical Malaysia. Further investigations on the two prospective configurations are recommended to determine the better supportive one for the morning boosting effect in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W2949479897,"Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) edited with genetic reporters are useful tools for differentiation analysis and for isolation of specific cell populations for study. Reporter integration into the genome is now commonly achieved by targeted DNA nuclease-enhanced homology directed repair (HDR). However, human PSCs are known to have a low frequency of gene knock-in (KI) by HDR, making reporter line generation an arduous process. Here, we report a methodology for scarless KI of large fluorescent reporter genes into PSCs by transient selection with puromycin or zeocin. With this method, we can perform targeted KI of a single reporter gene with up to 65% efficiency, as well as simultaneous KI of two reporter genes into different loci with up to 11% efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate that this method also works in mouse PSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2902011134,"The aim of this work was to characterize the microbial nitrogen cycling potential in sediments from Ushuaia Bay, a subantarctic environment that has suffered a recent explosive demographic growth. Subtidal sediment samples were retrieved in triplicate from two urban points in the Bay, and analyzed through metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Sequences assigned to genes related to nitrification, nitrate reduction and denitrification were predominant in this environment with respect to metagenomes from other environments, including other marine sediments. The nosZ gene, responsible for nitrous oxide transformation into di-nitrogen, presented a high diversity. The majority of NosZ sequences were classified as Clade II (atypical) variants affiliated to different bacterial lineages such as Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, as well as to Archaea. The analysis of a fosmid metagenomic library from the same site showed that the genomic context of atypical variants was variable, and was accompanied by distinct regulatory elements, suggesting the evolution of differential ecophysiological roles. This work increases our understanding of the microbial ecology of nitrogen transformations in cold coastal environments and provides evidence of an enhanced denitrification potential in impacted sediment microbial communities. In addition, it highlights the role of yet overlooked populations in the mitigation of environmentally harmful forms of nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2902597541,"Background The prevalence of chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) varies from 22% to 84% among patients receiving hemodialysis. It occurs more frequently at night, and often affects patient’s sleep quality. CKD-aP is often unreported by patients, and many do not receive effective treatment. There is, however, a paucity of available data on the prevalence and impact of CKD-aP on patients receiving hemodialysis in Pakistan. Methods A multicenter cross-sectional study was undertaken from July 2016 to April 2017 at a tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan. Results 354 patients undergoing hemodialysis were studied. 35.6% had CKD for 1–2 years, and 42.4% were receiving hemodialysis for 1–2 years. The prevalence of pruritus was 74%. The median [interquartile range] score for pruritus was 10.0 (out of possible 25) [8.0–12.0]; while the median [interquartile range] Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score was 8.0 (out of possible 21) [7.0–10.0]'. Pruritus was significantly correlated with the sleep score (r = 0.423, p<0.001). The results of the multivariate linear regression revealed a positive association between pruritus and age of patients (β = 0.031; 95% CI = 0.002–0.061; p = 0.038) and duration of CKD (β = -0.013; 95% CI = -0.023 –-0.003; p = 0.014). Similarly there was a positive association between sleep score and duration of CKD (β = 0.010; 95% CI = 0.002–0.019; p = 0.012) and pruritus (β = 0.143; 95% CI = 0.056–0.230; p = 0.001). Conclusions Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus is very common in patients receiving hemodialysis in Pakistan. Pruritus is significantly associated with poor sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W2902308273,"Many patients with coronary artery heart disease are unable to access traditional psychosocial rehabilitation conducted face to face due to excessive travel distance. Therefore, this study developed and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy program, described the patterns of use and measured change in risk factors.This study adopted an online video conference system, JointNet, to maintain group interaction functions similar to face to face groups online, and also built an self-learning platform to deliver psychoeducation content and cognitive-behavior therapy related materials and homework. Forty-three out-patients were recruited in the pilot study, who then chose to participate in either the Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy or face to face group based on their preference. Fourteen patients were assigned to the waiting-list control.Seventeen participants (17/43 = 39.5%) chose the Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy program. Among them, thirteen participants (13/17 = 76.5%) finished the program and were more male (92.3% vs. 50%), employed (53.8% vs. 35.3%), and had longer education duration (13.9 vs. 12.5 years) than the counterparts of the face to face group. Furthermore, they were highly motivated with average number of log-ins (66.5 time), website surfing time (950.94 min), reading frequency (78.15 time) and reading time (355.90 min) for the self-learning platform during eight weeks; and also highly satisfied (97%) with visiting the self-learning platform and video conferences. The treatment effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy was comparable with face to face one in reducing anxiety, hostility, respiration rate, and in improving vasodilation but not depression compared with the waiting-list control.These results indicated that the Internet-based group therapy program using video conference is feasible and acceptable for the psychosocial rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery heart disease, and provides an alternative for patients who are unable to obtain conventional psychosocial rehabilitation conducted face to face."
https://openalex.org/W2902486015,"The most common complication in cancer patients is catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), of which Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen. Although S. aureus CRBSI patients are recommended for prolonged intravenous therapy, this is often not feasible. We assessed the effectiveness of switching from intravenous to oral antimicrobial therapy in cancer patients with CRBSI due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). We conducted a retrospective observational study of 60 patients at one tertiary-care cancer center between April 2005 and March 2016. Patients who received effective intravenous (IV) antibiotics for at least 10 days (IV group) were compared to the IV group of patients who had switched to effective oral (PO) antibiotics after IV treatment for at least 10 days (IV + PO group). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 90 days. Univariate and propensity score-adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses using variables likely to influence the outcomes were performed. Of the 60 patients, 32 (53.3%) and 28 (46.7%) were in the IV and IV + PO groups, respectively. The median antibiotic treatment durations in the IV and IV + PO groups were 17 (13-31) and 33 (26-52) days, respectively (p<0.001). The 90-day mortality in the IV and IV + PO groups were 53.1% (17/32) and 10.7% (3/28), respectively (p = 0.001). Univariate logistic regression model showed that the odds ratios of oral switch therapy for 90-day mortality was 0.106 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.027-0.423; p = 0.001). The propensity score-adjusted multivariate logistic regression model estimated the odds ratios of oral switched therapy for 90-day mortality as 0.377 (95% CI: 0.037-3.884; p = 0.413). Our results suggest that oral switch therapy was not associated with mortality in cancer patients with CRBSI due to MSSA compared with no oral switch therapy. Oral switch therapy may be a reasonable option for patients with CRBSI due to MSSA."
https://openalex.org/W2902772089,"The multi-group asset flow model is a nonlinear dynamical system originally developed as a tool for understanding the behavioral foundations of market phenomena such as flash crashes and price bubbles. In this paper we use a modification of this model to analyze the dynamics of a single-asset market in situations when the trading rates of investors (i.e., their desire to exchange stock for cash) are prescribed ahead of time and independent of the state of the market. Under the assumption of fast trading compared to the time-rate of change in the prescribed trading rates we decompose the dynamics of the system to fast and slow components. We use the model to derive a variety of observations regarding the dynamics of price and investors’ wealth, and the dependence of these quantities on the prescribed trading rates. In particular, we show that strategies with constant trading rates, which represent the well-known constant-rebalanced portfolio (CRP) strategies, are optimal in the sense that they minimize investment risks. In contrast, we show that investors pursuing non-CRP strategies are at risk of loss of wealth, as a result of the slow system not being integrable in the sense that cyclic trading rates do not always result in periodic price variations."
https://openalex.org/W2761242379,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is endemic in people who inject drugs (PWID), with prevalence estimates above 60 percent for PWID in the United States. Previous modeling studies suggest that direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment can lower overall prevalence in this population, but treatment is often delayed until the onset of advanced liver disease (fibrosis stage 3 or later) due to cost. Lower cost interventions featuring syringe access (SA) and medically assisted treatment (MAT) for addiction are known to be less costly, but have shown mixed results in lowering HCV rates below current levels. Little is known about the potential synergistic effects of combining DAA and MAT treatment, and large-scale tests of combined interventions are rare. While simulation experiments can reveal likely long-term effects, most prior simulations have been performed on closed populations of model agents--a scenario quite different from the open, mobile populations known to most health agencies. This paper uses data from the Centers for Disease Control's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance project, IDU round 3, collected in New York City in 2012 by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to parameterize simulations of open populations. Our results show that, in an open population, SA/MAT by itself has only small effects on HCV prevalence, while DAA treatment by itself can significantly lower both HCV and HCV-related advanced liver disease prevalence. More importantly, the simulation experiments suggest that cost effective synergistic combinations of the two strategies can dramatically reduce HCV incidence. We conclude that adopting SA/MAT implementations alongside DAA interventions can play a critical role in reducing the long-term consequences of ongoing infection."
https://openalex.org/W2902015524,"The study of parasites in recently established populations of invasive species can shed light on the sources of invasion and possible indirect interactions between the alien species and native ones. We studied parasites of the global invader Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in the Caucasus. In 2012, the first established population of Ha. axyridis was recorded in the Caucasus in Sochi (south of European Russia, Black Sea coast). By 2018, the ladybird had spread to a vast area: Armenia, Georgia and south Russia (Adygea, the Krasnodar territory, the Stavropol territory, Dagestan, Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia). The examination of 213 adults collected in Sochi in 2018 showed that 53% were infested with Hesperomyces virescens fungi (Ascomycota: Laboulbeniales) and that 8% were infested with Parasitylenchus bifurcatus nematodes (Nematoda: Tylenchida, Allantonematidae). The examined Ha. axyridis specimens were free of the parasitic mite Coccipolipus hippodamiae. An analysis of the phylogenetic relationships of P. bifurcatus based on 18S rDNA confirmed the morphological identification of this species. Hesperomyces virescens and P. bifurcatus were first recorded in the Caucasus and Russia, although they are rather widespread in Europe. This likely indicates that they appeared as a result of coinvasion with their host because the populations of Ha. axyridis, He. virescens and P. bifurcatus in the Caucasus are isolated from the main parts of the ranges of these species in Europe. The nearest localities of Ha. axyridis is on another shore of the Black Sea, and the nearest localities of He. virescens and P. bifurcatus are more than 1000 km from the Caucasus. It is impossible to determine whether the first founders of the Caucasian population were infested with the parasites or whether the parasites were introduced by specimens of Ha. axyridis that arrived later from Europe. Harmonia axyridis was released in the region for pest control, but laboratory cultures are always free of He. virescens and P. bifurcatus. Therefore, the detection of He. virescens and P. bifurcatus indicates that the population of Ha. axyridis in the Caucasus could not have derived exclusively from released specimens. We did not find He. virescens on 400 specimens of 29 other ladybird species collected from the same localities as Ha. axyridis in the Caucasus. No reliable correlation between infestation by He. virescens and that by P. bifurcatus has been found. In addition to these two parasites, an unidentified species of the order Mermithida was recorded. This is the first documented case of Ha. axyridis infestation by a parasitic nematode of this order in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2953115619,"The olive fruit fly (OFF), Bactrocera oleae is the most devastating pest affecting olive fruit worldwide. Previous investigations have addressed the fungal microbiome associated with olive drupes or B. oleae, but the impact of the insect on fungal communities of olive fruit remains undescribed. In the present work, the fungal microbiome of olive drupes, infested and non-infested by the OFF, was investigated in four different localities and cultivars. Olive fruit fly infestations caused a general reduction of the fungal diversity, a higher quantity of the total DNA and an increase in taxa that remained unidentified or had unknown roles. The infestations led to imbalanced fungal communities with the growth of taxa that are usually outcompeted. While it was difficult to establish a cause-effect link between fly infestation and specific fungi, it is clear that the fly alters the natural microbial balance, especially the low abundant taxa. On the other hand, the most abundant ones, were not significantly influenced by the insect. In fact, despite the slight variation between the sampling locations, Aureobasidium, Cladosporium, and Alternaria, were the dominant genera, suggesting the existence of a typical olive fungal microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2902054673,"Most tumors are composed of a heterogeneous population of subclones. A more detailed insight into the subclonal evolution of these tumors can be helpful to study progression and treatment response. Problematically, tumor samples are typically very heterogeneous, making deconvolving individual tumor subclones a major challenge. To overcome this limitation, reducing heterogeneity, such as by means of microdissections, coupled with targeted sequencing, is a viable approach. However, computational methods that enable reconstruction of the evolutionary relationships require unbiased read depth measurements, which are commonly challenging to obtain in this setting. We introduce TargetClone, a novel method to reconstruct the subclonal evolution tree of tumors from single-nucleotide polymorphism allele frequency and somatic single-nucleotide variant measurements. Furthermore, our method infers copy numbers, alleles and the fraction of the tumor component in each sample. TargetClone was specifically designed for targeted sequencing data obtained from microdissected samples. We demonstrate that our method obtains low error rates on simulated data. Additionally, we show that our method is able to reconstruct expected trees in a testicular germ cell cancer and ovarian cancer dataset. The TargetClone package including tree visualization is written in Python and is publicly available at https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/targetclone."
https://openalex.org/W2903154632,"Bacterial resistance has become a worldwide concern, particularly after the emergence of resistant strains overproducing carbapenemases. Among these, the KPC-2 carbapenemase represents a significant clinical challenge, being characterized by a broad substrate spectrum that includes aminothiazoleoxime and cephalosporins such as cefotaxime. Moreover, strains harboring KPC-type β-lactamases are often reported as resistant to available β-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanic acid, tazobactam and sulbactam). Therefore, the identification of novel non β-lactam KPC-2 inhibitors is strongly necessary to maintain treatment options. This study explored novel, non-covalent inhibitors active against KPC-2, as putative hit candidates. We performed a structure-based in silico screening of commercially available compounds for non-β-lactam KPC-2 inhibitors. Thirty-two commercially available high-scoring, fragment-like hits were selected for in vitro validation and their activity and mechanism of action vs the target was experimentally evaluated using recombinant KPC-2. N-(3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)-3-fluorobenzamide (11a), in light of its ligand efficiency (LE = 0.28 kcal/mol/non-hydrogen atom) and chemistry, was selected as hit to be directed to chemical optimization to improve potency vs the enzyme and explore structural requirement for inhibition in KPC-2 binding site. Further, the compounds were evaluated against clinical strains overexpressing KPC-2 and the most promising compound reduced the MIC of the β-lactam antibiotic meropenem by four-fold."
https://openalex.org/W2902827666,"Background The major cause of ischemic stroke is unstable or thrombogenic atherosclerotic plaques. Vascular calcification, a process that appears crucial for plaque stability, shares common features with bone formation. Many bone turnover proteins exhibit metabolic properties, but the evidence is conflicting regarding their possible involvement in vascular disease. Antibodies against sclerostin and dickkopf-1 are currently being evaluated as potential therapy for treating bone disorders. It is important to carefully assess the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of these proteins. The aim of the present study was to explore serum levels of bone turnover markers in patients with acute noncardio-embolic ischemic stroke in comparison with healthy controls. Methods In a cross-sectional study, we compared 48 patients aged ≥75 years with noncardio-embolic ischemic stroke and 46 healthy controls. Serum levels of dickkopf-1, sclerostin, osteoprotegerin, osteopontin and osteocalcin were determined by Luminex technique. Results We found clearly increased serum levels of osteoprotegerin, sclerostin, dickkopf-1 and osteopontin in patients with stroke compared with healthy controls. No difference was seen in serum levels of osteocalcin between the two groups. Conclusion Our findings strengthen the hypothesis of bone turnover markers being involved in vascular disease. Whether these proteins can be used as candidate markers for increased stroke risk or prognostic biomarkers remains to be further elucidated."

This retrospective study assessed the serum TG levels of patients with SAP admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in 2017. Variables with a statistically significant association with the incidence of in-hospital TG elevation, as determined by univariate analysis, were analysed using a logistic regression model to predictors. Of the 99 patients included in the study, TG levels were within the normal range in 59 (59.59%) patients at admission. Among patients with normal TG level when admitted to ICU, 28 (47.46%) experienced at least one episode of TG level elevation during their ICU stay. Elevated TG level in hospitalization is associated with an increased length of ICU stay, as well as increased mortality. In addition to other factors, propofol usage was independently associated with the occurrence of in-hospital-TG elevation. To conclude, we retrospectively investigated the incidence, outcome, and risk factors for in-hospital TG elevation events in SAP patients admitted to the ICU. We found a high incidence of both preexisting and in-hospital-acquired TG elevation in SAP patients admitted to the ICU. The TG elevation that occurred during the ICU stay was associated with worse outcomes and long-term hospitalization of the ICU. Propofol usage was independently associated with the TG elevation occurrence in the ICU."

The outcome of interest was workplace violence, including physical and verbal violence, which were categorized according to the perpetrator of violence (patients/relatives and worker-to-worker). Primary exposure was the medical specialty, categorized as clinical, surgical, and other specialties. To evaluate the associations of interest, we estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using Poisson regression models with robust variances.A total of 1054 Peruvian medical residents were evaluated. The mean age was 32.6 years and 42.3% were female. Overall 73.4% reported having suffered of workplace violence sometime during the residency, 34.4% reported violence from patients/relatives, and 61.1% reported worker-to-worker violence. Compared with clinical residents, surgical residents had a lower prevalence of violence from patients/relatives (PR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.59-0.87), but a higher prevalence of worker-to-worker violence (PR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.23).Nearly three quarters of medical residents reported having suffered workplace violence sometime during their residency. Compared with clinical residents, surgical residents had lower rates of violence from patients/relatives, but higher rates of worker-to-worker violence; while residents from non-clinical and non-surgical specialties had a lower prevalence of both types of violence."
https://openalex.org/W2903153063,"Sensorimotor learning typically shows generalization from one context to another. Models of sensorimotor learning characterize this with a fixed generalization function that couples learning between contexts. Here we examine whether such coupling is indeed fixed or changes with experience. We examine the interaction between motor memories for novel dynamics during reciprocating, back and forth reaching movements. Subjects first experienced a force field for one movement direction and we used channel trials to assess generalization on the reciprocal movements. This showed minimal coupling such that errors experienced for one movement direction did not lead to adaptation for the other. However, after subjects had experienced a force field for both movement directions concurrently, a coupling developed between the corresponding motor memories. That is, on re-exposure for one direction there was a significant adaptation for movements in the other direction. The coupling was specific to the errors experienced, with minimal coupling when the errors had the opposite sign to those experienced during adaptation. We developed a state-space model in which the states for the two movement directions are represented by separate, yet potentially coupled learning processes. The coupling in the model controlled the extent to which each learning process was updated by the errors experienced on the other movement direction. We show that the coupling relies on a memory trace of the consecutive errors experienced for both movement directions. Our results suggest that the generalization of motor learning is an adaptive process, reflecting the relation between errors experienced across different movements."
https://openalex.org/W2903312351,"Background Hemorrhage is the most common cause of preventable death in the pre-hospital phase in trauma, with a critical capability gap optimizing pre-hospital resuscitation in austere environments. One promising avenue is the concept of a multi-functional resuscitation fluid (MRF) that contains a blood product backbone with agents that promote clotting and enhance oxygen delivery. Oxygen therapeutics, such as hemoglobin based oxygen carriers(HBOCs) and perfluorocarbons(PFCs), may be a critical MRF component. Our purpose was to assess the efficacy of resuscitation with a PFC, dodecafluoropentane(DDFPe), compared to fresh whole blood(FWB). Methods and findings Forty-five swine(78±5kg) underwent splenectomy and controlled hemorrhage via femoral arterial catheter until shock physiology(lactate = 7.0) was achieved prior to randomization into the following groups: 1) Control-no intervention, 2)Hextend-500mL, 3)FFP-500mL, 4)FFP+DDFPe-500mL, 5)FWB-500mL. Animals were observed for an additional 180 minutes following randomization. Results Baseline physiologic values did not statistically differ. At T = 60min, FWB had significantly decreased lactate(p = 0.001) and DDFPe was not statistically different from control. There was no statistical significance in tissue oxygenation(StO2) between groups at T = 60min. Survival was highest in the FWB and Hextend groups(30% at 180min). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed decreased survival of DDFPe+FFP in comparison to FWB(p<0.05) and was not significantly different from control or FFP. Four animals who received DDFPe died within 10 minutes of administration. This study was limited by a group receiving DDFPe alone, however this would not be feasible in this lethal swine model as DDFPe given its small volume. Conclusion DDFPe administration with FFP does not improve survival or enhance tissue oxygenation. However, given similar survival rates of Hextend and FWB, there is evidence that an ideal MRF should contain an element of volume expansion to enhance oxygen delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2903557184,"In this article we analyse diary reports concerning childhood symptoms of illness, these data are part of a larger study with other types of measurements on childhood asthma. The children are followed for three years and the diaries are updated, by the parents, on a daily basis. Here we focus on the methodological implications of analysing such data. We investigate two ways of representing the data and explore which tools are applicable given both representations. The first representation relies on proper alignment and point by point comparison of the signals. The second approach takes into account combinations of symptoms on a day by day basis and boils down to the analysis of counts. In the present case both methods are well applicable. However, more generally, when symptom episodes are occurring more at random locations in time, a point by point comparison becomes less applicable and shape based approaches will fail to come up with satisfactory results. In such cases, pattern based methods will be of much greater use. The pattern based representation focuses on reoccurring patterns and ignores ordering in time. With this representation we stratify the data on the level of years, so that possibly yearly differences can still be detected."
https://openalex.org/W2902258412,"The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of recommended long term care settings following aged care assessments in Australia. Using unique administrative data on 500,000 aged care assessments, we utilized multinomial logistic regression models to estimate the association between characteristics of the individual (their assistance needs, health conditions and demographic characteristics) and the recommended long-term care setting. The vast majority (94%) of recommended long-term care settings were for private residences (54%) or residential care (40%). Persons assessed in a setting other than a private residence were unlikely to have a recommended setting for a private residence. Consistent with the assessors toolkit, assistance needs were strongly associated with long term care recommendations. Results provide strong support for the evidence-based approach of aged care assessments in Australia. Nonetheless, with improvements in administrative data linkages and ongoing policy reforms, further analysis is required to reinforce extant policy guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2949444317,"We study a self-organising neural network model of how visual representations in the primate dorsal visual pathway are transformed from an eye-centred to head-centred frame of reference. The model has previously been shown to robustly develop head-centred output neurons with a standard trace learning rule, but only under limited conditions. Specifically it fails when incorporating visual input neurons with monotonic gain modulation by eye-position. Since eye-centred neurons with monotonic gain modulation are so common in the dorsal visual pathway, it is an important challenge to show how efferent synaptic connections from these neurons may self-organise to produce head-centred responses in a subpopulation of postsynaptic neurons. We show for the first time how a variety of modified, yet still biologically plausible, versions of the standard trace learning rule enable the model to perform a coordinate transformation from eye-centred to head-centred reference frames when the visual input neurons have monotonic gain modulation by eye-position."
https://openalex.org/W2903030566,"Idealized passive dynamic walkers (PDW) exhibit limit cycle stability at steady state. Yet in reality, uncertainty in ground interaction forces result in variability in limit cycles even for a simple walker known as the Rimless Wheel (RW) on seemingly even slopes. This class of walkers is called metastable walkers in that they usually walk in a stable limit cycle, though guaranteed to eventually fail. Thus, control action is only needed if a failure state (i.e. RW stopping down the ramp) is imminent. Therefore, efficiency of estimating the time to reach a failure state is key to develop a minimal intervention controller to inject just enough energy to overcome a failure state when required. Current methods use what is known as a Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) from current state (rotary speed of RW at the most recent leg collision) to an arbitrary state deemed to be a failure in the future. The frequently used Markov chain based MFPT prediction requires an absorbing state, which in this case is a collision where the RW comes to a stop without an escape. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate an MFPT from current state to an arbitrary state which is not necessarily an absorbing state. This provides freedom to a controller to adaptively take action when deemed necessary. We demonstrate the proposed MFPT predictions in a minimal intervention controller for a RW. Our results show that the proposed method is useful in controllers for walkers showing up to 44.1% increase of time-to-fail compared to a PID based closed-loop controller."
https://openalex.org/W2951221512,"We describe a new assaying system for the detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus (HPV) based on linear-after-the-exponential-PCR(LATE-PCR) and melting curve analysis. The 23 most prevalent HPV strains (types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 70, 73, 81, 82, and 83) are assayed in two sealed reaction tubes within 2 h. Good sensitivity and specificity was evaluated by testing cloned HPV DNA and clinical samples. The detection limit was 5–500 copies/reaction depending on the genotype. No cross-reactivity was observed with the other HPV types that are not covered by our method or pathogens tested which were commonly found in female genital tract. When compared with the HPV GenoArray Diagnostic kit, the results from 1104 clinical samples suggest good overall agreement between the two methods,(98.37%, 95% CI: 97.44%–98.97%) and the kappa value was 0.954. Overall, this new HPV genotyping assay system presents a simple, rapid, universally applicable, sensitive, and highly specific detection methodology that should be useful for HPV detection and genotyping, therefore, is potentially of great value in clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2902171247,"Background Previous experimental research on testosterone (T) and psychological traits is inconclusive. Thus, we performed the first large-scale observational study of the association between T and dispositional optimism / pessimism. Methods We used prospective data from 6,493 primary-care patients (3,840 women) of the DETECT study (Diabetes Cardiovascular Risk-Evaluation: Targets and Essential Data for Commitment of Treatment), including repeated immunoassay-based measurement of serum T and optimism / pessimism assessed by the revised Life-Orientation Test (LOT-R). Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of baseline T and one-year change in T with optimism and pessimism were investigated using age- and multivariable-adjusted regression models. Results Cross-sectional analyses showed no association of T with optimism or pessimism in both sexes. Longitudinal analyses also showed no association of baseline T with optimism or pessimism at four-year follow-up. Multivariable analyses of total LOT-R score yielded similarly non-significant results (β-coefficient per unit change in T for men: -0.01 (95% CI: -0.24–0.22), women: 0.08 (-0.03–0.20)). Furthermore, change in T was not related to optimism or pessimism at four-year follow-up. Conclusions The present observational study of a large-scale prospective sample showed no association of T with optimism or pessimism. Integrating further experimental and interventional evidence from alternative methodological approaches would strengthen this conclusion and establish stronger evidence about the potential hormonal basis of psychological traits."
