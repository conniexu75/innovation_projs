https://openalex.org/W1512370781,"Abstract Information on the role of λ exonuclease in genetic recombination has been sought by testing the enzymic activity on certain internal sites in DNA as well as termini. Large excesses of λ exonuclease failed to release 32P from 5'-phosphoryl-labeled nicks or to attack the hydrogen-bonded circular form of λ DNA (Hershey circle) which contains two intrinsic nicks. This was true at pH 7.5 or 9.6, and was unaffected by the addition of β protein. λ exonuclease did not readily reinitiate digestion at a terminal gap produced by prior digestion of phage P22 DNA by the same enzyme. At pH 7.5, λ exonuclease did not detach from a molecule of DNA until the susceptible portion of that molecule was largely degraded."

https://openalex.org/W1525437046,"Abstract Synthesis of DNA by DNA polymerases has been studied by using circular duplex DNA templates which contain single phosphodiester bond interruptions (nicks). Escherichia coli DNA polymerase can initiate synthesis at nicks by the covalent attachment of nucleotides to the 3' end of the primer strand. An initial phase of synthesis is accompanied by the removal of nucleotides from the 5' end of the nick by the 5'-hydrolytic activity of the E. coli polymerase (nick translation). After the incorporation of 10 to 50 nucleotides, the 5' end of the primer strand is displaced by the growing 3' end of the primer strand. Elimination of the 5'-hydrolytic activity of the E. coli polymerase does not prevent this strand displacement. In contrast, phage T4 polymerase cannot initiate synthesis at nicks. In these studies polynucleotide ligase has been used to identify nicks and to measure their disappearance during strand displacement. The DNA synthesized during the phase of strand displacement is sensitive to both exonucleases I and III of E. coli. This observation suggests that an equilibrium exists between single and double stranded forms of the newly synthesized DNA. A third phase of more extensive synthesis yields a DNA product which is resistant to exonuclease I even after denaturation, suggesting a self-complementary structure. Electron micrographs of such a product synthesized on circular PM2 DNA containing one nick per molecule reveal a single branch extending from the intact circle. Subsequent synthesis gives rise to multiple branches."

The main components of this mixture were: the 81-residue, single chain proinsulin, two degradation products of proinsulin, termed Intermediate Forms I and II, and an insulin dimer, possibly linked by covalent bonds and apparently an artifact of the preparation. Treatment of the biologically inactive proinsulin or intermediate forms with trypsin yielded dealanylinsulin, which is fully biologically active. The amino acid sequence of the intact proinsulin was shown to be bovine insulin B chain-Arg-Arg-Glu-Val-Glu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Val-Gly-Ala-Leu-Glu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ala-Gly-Gly-Leu-Glu-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gln-Lys-Arg-bovine insulin A chain. The only disulfide bonds in this protein are those in the insulin moiety. Intermediate Form I is a two-chain protein consisting of the insulin B chain extended to the glutaminyl residue preceding the Lys-Arg terminal sequence of the connecting peptide segment, and the A chain, these two chains being held together by the disulfide bonds found in insulin. Intermediate Form II is a similar protein, consisting of the insulin B chain and an A chain extended to the glutamyl residue following the Arg-Arg sequence at the amino terminus of the connecting segment. Proinsulin is the biosynthetic precursor of insulin and functions to facilitate the folding of the molecule to yield the correct pairing of cysteinyl residues required to form the disulfide bonds of insulin. The transformation of proinsulin to insulin occurs intracellularly in the β cells of the islets of Langerhans and insulin is the major storage form. The structures of the intermediate forms, the recovery from pancreas of connecting peptide lacking the amino- and carboxyl-terminal basic dipeptide sequences in molar quantities equal to those of insulin, and the variability of the residue at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain of the insulins of various species, all indicate that the proteolytic enzyme or enzymes responsible for the proinsulin to insulin transformation probably act by virtue of trypsin-like and carboxypeptidase B-like specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1526503565,"Abstract Pancreatic DNase has been used to introduce single phosphodiester bond interruptions (nicks) into double stranded circular DNA. Such DNA substrates have been used to study the action of several exonucleases at the site of nicks. Escherichia coli exonuclease III and the exonuclease activities of phage T4 DNA polymerase (3' → 5'-nuclease) and E. coli DNA polymerase (3' → 5'- and 5' → 3'-nuclease) initiate hydrolysis at these sites as well as at the termini of linear molecules. Under conditions of limited hydrolysis, these enzymes initiate hydrolysis at all nicks in the molecules. In contrast, phage λ exonuclease is unable to hydrolyze DNA containing nicks. Either the phage T4 or the E. coli DNA polymerase, in the presence of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, can completely fill in the gaps created by exonuclease action. The combined 5' → 3'-hydrolytic activity and the polymerizing activity of the E. coli DNA polymerase can account for the conversion of a nick displaying a 5'-hydroxyl end group to one displaying a 5'-phosphomonoester; i.e. the nick is translated. These studies have been facilitated by the use of polynucleotide ligase to distinguish nicks containing 5'-phosphomonoesters from gaps and from nicks containing 5'-hydroxyl groups. E. coli alkaline phosphatase does not readily distinguish 5'-phosphomonoesters at gaps from those at nicks; quantitative hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters at these sites by the phosphatase requires a higher temperature than that required for the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters at the ends of linear duplexes."

https://openalex.org/W1599084276,"Abstract Partial purification of an Escherichia coli sialyltransferase (CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid-colominic acid sialyltransferase) that transfers N-acetylneuraminic acid (N-AN) from cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid to colominic acid has been achieved. The enzyme was detected in a particulate fraction. Kinetics of the reaction have been studied and the substrate specificity is discussed. Both endogenous colominic acid, bound to the enzyme fraction, and purified, soluble exogenous colominic acid acted as N-AN acceptors, the endogenous acceptor being much more effective. The presence of 1.2 m ammonium sulfate yielded a 4-fold increase of N-AN incorporation into the endogenous colominic acid, and was required for N-AN incorporation into the soluble exogenous colominic acid. The available data suggest that chain elongation proceeds at the nonreducing termini of the polymer, comparable to the formation of glycogen, rather than at the reducing end, as in the case of the bacterial lipopolysaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W1498529684,"thyA101 is a temperature-sensitive, thymine-requiring mutant of Escherichia coli B. At 37° it has approximately 1 to 2% of the thymidylate synthetase activity of the wild type organism. At 25° the level is about 30% of the wild type culture. These studies provide evidence that at 37° thy-101 is unable to complete the synthesis of thymidylate synthetase at the ribosomal level. On shifting a culture of thy-101 from 37° to 25°, a rapid formation of thymidylate synthetase occurs. The amount of this enzyme per unit of cell mass increases in two phases, first rapidly and then more slowly. A control enzyme such as glutamic acid dehydrogenase shows no evidence of a biphasic synthesis. Neither the rapid nor slow phase of thymidylate synthetase synthesis occurs in the presence of chloramphenicol or 5-methyltryptophan. To establish that the enzyme molecule is partially completed at 37°, thy-101 was grown at 37° in medium containing 90% deuterium oxide. The culture was then shifted to a water-containing medium at 25°. After a short period at 25°, an extract of the culture was prepared and subjected to separation by a CsCl centrifugal gradient. This procedure will separate thymidylate synthetase of cultures grown in D2O medium from thymidylate synthetase from cells grown in water medium. The presence of an intermediate enzyme band at 51% of the distance between the light and heavy bands has been taken as tentative evidence for the spontaneous formation of a light-heavy hybrid enzyme. After the shift from 37° to 25°, two major bands of thymidylate synthetase activity were found, one corresponding to light enzyme and one corresponding to heavy enzyme. From these data it was concluded that most of the thymidylate synthetase polypeptide chain had been synthesized at 37° and that the chain was completed with light amino acids at 25°. A model is presented proposing that thy-101 at nonpermissive temperatures is uniquely blocked in the synthesis of thymidylate synthetase because of an amino acid change which prevents the growing polypeptide chain from assuming the proper conformation and that this defect inhibits further movement of the ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W2001739373,"ARGYLE1 has revived suggestions2–4 that descriptions of ball lightning may simply represent some form of optical illusion. In particular, he postulates that the “bright spheres” are positive after-images caused by observation of short lived effects from nearby lightning strokes. On this view, the apparent movement of a “sphere” is due to the projection of the fixed retinal after-image against different backgrounds, as a result of voluntary or involuntary eye movements."
https://openalex.org/W2068262675,"THERE is increasing evidence that chromosome size and mass are highly variable within a species. Both natural and induced variation in the DNA1,2 and protein3–5 content of chromosomes is known, and I have demonstrated a positive linear correlation between naturally occurring changes in the volume of metaphase chromosomes and the RNA and histone protein content of the nuclei of Vicia faba. The changes in chromosome volume were not accompanied by variation in the amount of 4C DNA. Similar changes are known to be induced by variations in the mineral content of a culture solution5, in temperature7 and in the hormone balance of plants (personal communication from N. Jones). It has been suggested5,6 that such changes within a species are correlated with the metabolic activity of the meristems in which they occur. To test this hypothesis, I have investigated the effects of ethirimol, which is known to affect root growth, on chromosome volume and root length. If the hypothesis is correct, ethirimol should affect both characters in the same way. Apart from the theoretical interest of such a study, it seemed useful to investigate any possible cytological effects of ethirimol, which may be used widely as a fungicide."
