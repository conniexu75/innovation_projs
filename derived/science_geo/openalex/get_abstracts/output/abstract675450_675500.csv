https://openalex.org/W3172296615,"Abstract The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 1–3 has demonstrated clinical efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, including against the B.1.351 variant that is partially resistant to neutralizing antibodies 1 . However, the immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern remains unclear. Here we report humoral and cellular immune responses from 20 Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals from the COV1001 phase I–IIa clinical trial 2 against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 as well as against the B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, P.1 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Ad26.COV2.S induced median pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres that were 5.0-fold and 3.3-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020 on day 71 after vaccination. Median binding antibody titres were 2.9-fold and 2.7-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, complement deposition and natural killer cell activation responses were largely preserved against the B.1.351 variant. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, including central and effector memory responses, were comparable among the WA1/2020, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C variants. These data show that neutralizing antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S were reduced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, but functional non-neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses were largely preserved against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These findings have implications for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern."
https://openalex.org/W3166132123,"Abstract The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the general community is still unclear. Here, we used the Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey—a large community-based survey of individuals living in randomly selected private households across the United Kingdom—to assess the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca; ChAdOx1) vaccines against any new SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests, split according to self-reported symptoms, cycle threshold value (&lt;30 versus ≥30; as a surrogate for viral load) and gene positivity pattern (compatible with B.1.1.7 or not). Using 1,945,071 real-time PCR results from nose and throat swabs taken from 383,812 participants between 1 December 2020 and 8 May 2021, we found that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines already reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections ≥21 d after the first dose (61% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 54–68%) versus 66% (95% CI = 60–71%), respectively), with greater reductions observed after a second dose (79% (95% CI = 65–88%) versus 80% (95% CI = 73–85%), respectively). The largest reductions were observed for symptomatic infections and/or infections with a higher viral burden. Overall, COVID-19 vaccination reduced the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, with the largest benefit received after two vaccinations and against symptomatic and high viral burden infections, and with no evidence of a difference between the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3166101893,"Reports of ChAdOx1 vaccine-associated thrombocytopenia and vascular adverse events have led to some countries restricting its use. Using a national prospective cohort, we estimated associations between exposure to first-dose ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccination and hematological and vascular adverse events using a nested incident-matched case-control study and a confirmatory self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis. An association was found between ChAdOx1 vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (0-27 d after vaccination; adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 5.77, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.41-13.83), with an estimated incidence of 1.13 (0.62-1.63) cases per 100,000 doses. An SCCS analysis confirmed that this was unlikely due to bias (RR = 1.98 (1.29-3.02)). There was also an increased risk for arterial thromboembolic events (aRR = 1.22, 1.12-1.34) 0-27 d after vaccination, with an SCCS RR of 0.97 (0.93-1.02). For hemorrhagic events 0-27 d after vaccination, the aRR was 1.48 (1.12-1.96), with an SCCS RR of 0.95 (0.82-1.11). A first dose of ChAdOx1 was found to be associated with small increased risks of ITP, with suggestive evidence of an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events. The attenuation of effect found in the SCCS analysis means that there is the potential for overestimation of the reported results, which might indicate the presence of some residual confounding or confounding by indication. Public health authorities should inform their jurisdictions of these relatively small increased risks associated with ChAdOx1. No positive associations were seen between BNT162b2 and thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events."

https://openalex.org/W3168265815,"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles derived from the endosomal compartment that are potentially involved in intercellular communication. Here, we found that frequently used biomarkers of exosomes are heterogeneous, and do not exhibit universal utility across different cell types. To uncover ubiquitous and abundant proteins, we used an unbiased and quantitative proteomic approach based on super-stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (super-SILAC), coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. In total, 1,212 proteins were quantified in the proteome of exosomes, irrespective of the cellular source or isolation method. A cohort of 22 proteins was universally enriched. Fifteen proteins were consistently depleted in the proteome of exosomes compared to cells. Among the enriched proteins, we identified biogenesis-related proteins, GTPases and membrane proteins, such as CD47 and ITGB1. The cohort of depleted proteins in exosomes was predominantly composed of nuclear proteins. We identified syntenin-1 as a consistently abundant protein in exosomes from different cellular origins. Syntenin-1 is also present in exosomes across different species and biofluids, highlighting its potential use as a putative universal biomarker of exosomes. Our study provides a comprehensive quantitative atlas of core proteins ubiquitous to exosomes that can serve as a resource for the scientific community. Using an unbiased and quantitative proteomic approach, Kugeratski et al. identified the core constituents of exosomes and found that syntenin-1 was the most abundant component, making it a putative universal biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W3168169234,"T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing molecule 3 (TIM-3), first identified as a molecule expressed on interferon-γ producing T cells1, is emerging as an important immune-checkpoint molecule, with therapeutic blockade of TIM-3 being investigated in multiple human malignancies. Expression of TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells in the tumour microenvironment is considered a cardinal sign of T cell dysfunction; however, TIM-3 is also expressed on several other types of immune cell, confounding interpretation of results following blockade using anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibodies. Here, using conditional knockouts of TIM-3 together with single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate the singular importance of TIM-3 on dendritic cells (DCs), whereby loss of TIM-3 on DCs—but not on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells—promotes strong anti-tumour immunity. Loss of TIM-3 prevented DCs from expressing a regulatory program and facilitated the maintenance of CD8+ effector and stem-like T cells. Conditional deletion of TIM-3 in DCs led to increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species resulting in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Inhibition of inflammasome activation, or downstream effector cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, completely abrogated the protective anti-tumour immunity observed with TIM-3 deletion in DCs. Together, our findings reveal an important role for TIM-3 in regulating DC function and underscore the potential of TIM-3 blockade in promoting anti-tumour immunity by regulating inflammasome activation. Mouse genetic studies and single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrate that TIM-3 on dendritic cells has a key role in regulating antitumour immunity via inflammasome activation and is a potential target for anticancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W3167740220,"Perceptual constancy requires the brain to maintain a stable representation of sensory input. In the olfactory system, activity in primary olfactory cortex (piriform cortex) is thought to determine odour identity1-5. Here we present the results of electrophysiological recordings of single units maintained over weeks to examine the stability of odour-evoked responses in mouse piriform cortex. Although activity in piriform cortex could be used to discriminate between odorants at any moment in time, odour-evoked responses drifted over periods of days to weeks. The performance of a linear classifier trained on the first recording day approached chance levels after 32 days. Fear conditioning did not stabilize odour-evoked responses. Daily exposure to the same odorant slowed the rate of drift, but when exposure was halted the rate increased again. This demonstration of continuous drift poses the question of the role of piriform cortex in odour perception. This instability might reflect the unstructured connectivity of piriform cortex6-12, and may be a property of other unstructured cortices."
https://openalex.org/W3168571452,"In higher eukaryotes, many genes are regulated by enhancers that are 104-106 base pairs (bp) away from the promoter. Enhancers contain transcription-factor-binding sites (which are typically around 7-22 bp), and physical contact between the promoters and enhancers is thought to be required to modulate gene expression. Although chromatin architecture has been mapped extensively at resolutions of 1 kilobase and above; it has not been possible to define physical contacts at the scale of the proteins that determine gene expression. Here we define these interactions in detail using a chromosome conformation capture method (Micro-Capture-C) that enables the physical contacts between different classes of regulatory elements to be determined at base-pair resolution. We find that highly punctate contacts occur between enhancers, promoters and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites and we show that transcription factors have an important role in the maintenance of the contacts between enhancers and promoters. Our data show that interactions between CTCF sites are increased when active promoters and enhancers are located within the intervening chromatin. This supports a model in which chromatin loop extrusion1 is dependent on cohesin loading at active promoters and enhancers, which explains the formation of tissue-specific chromatin domains without changes in CTCF binding."
https://openalex.org/W3172035218,"Liquid–liquid phase separation is a major mechanism of subcellular compartmentalization1,2. Although the segregation of RNA into phase-separated condensates broadly affects RNA metabolism3,4, whether and how specific RNAs use phase separation to regulate interacting factors such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and the phenotypic consequences of such regulatory interactions, are poorly understood. Here we show that RNA-driven phase separation is a key mechanism through which a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) controls the activity of RBPs and maintains genomic stability in mammalian cells. The lncRNA NORAD prevents aberrant mitosis by inhibiting Pumilio (PUM) proteins5,6,7,8. We show that NORAD can out-compete thousands of other PUM-binding transcripts to inhibit PUM by nucleating the formation of phase-separated PUM condensates, termed NP bodies. Dual mechanisms of PUM recruitment, involving multivalent PUM–NORAD and PUM–PUM interactions, enable NORAD to competitively sequester a super-stoichiometric amount of PUM in NP bodies. Disruption of NORAD-driven PUM phase separation leads to PUM hyperactivity and genome instability that is rescued by synthetic RNAs that induce the formation of PUM condensates. These results reveal a mechanism by which RNA-driven phase separation can regulate RBP activity and identify an essential role for this process in genome maintenance. The repetitive sequence architecture of NORAD and other lncRNAs9,10,11 suggests that phase separation may be a widely used mechanism of lncRNA-mediated regulation."

Yet, little is known about the biological assembly between LRRK2 and Rab proteins. Here, we present high-resolution structures of full-length human LRRK2 in three physiologically important states: monomer, dimer, and LRRK2G2019S, using single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis. In light of the vast functional data on human LRRK2 (Berwick et al., 2019Berwick D.C. Heaton G.R. Azeggagh S. Harvey K. LRRK2 Biology from structure to dysfunction: research progresses, but the themes remain the same.Mol. Neurodegener. 2019; 14: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), our cryo-EM structures provide a deeper molecular understanding of this vital molecule. The full-length human LRRK2 was purified mainly as monomers in solution (Figure 1A) and used for structural analysis. To test whether the protein was still functional after our expression and purification procedure, we measured its kinase activity by using an ADP-Glo kinase assay. As expected, the purified protein catalyzed ATP hydrolysis in the presence of a peptide substrate, LRRKtide (Jaleel et al., 2007Jaleel M. Nichols R.J. Deak M. Campbell D.G. Gillardon F. Knebel A.

Unexpectedly, we captured structures of LRRK2 in both monomeric and dimeric states at overall resolutions of 3.7 Å and 3.5 Å, respectively (Figure S1A; Table S1). The N terminus of LRRK2 in both monomeric and dimeric states are flexible (Figures S1B and S1C). To further improve the map quality, we carried out symmetry expansion for the dimer followed by focused 3D classification and refinement—this improved map resolution of the C-terminal part to 3.1 Å (Figure S1A; Table S1) and allowed de novo model building for the majority of the protein ranging from residue 558 to the end. We performed homology modeling and rigid-body fitting for the illustration of residues 1–557 (Figures 1 and S2A).Figure S1Structural determination of LRRK2, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) A brief flow chart of single-particle cryo-EM data collection and process.(B) The flexibility of ANK and ARM domains in the context of LRRK2 monomers.(C) The flexibility of ANK and ARM domains in the context of LRRK2 dimers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S2Structural features of LRRK2, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Docking of the ARM domain in cryo-EM densities.

The LRRK2 monomer adopts a “J” shape, with the longest dimension of ∼225 Å (Figure 1C). The extended ARM domain (Figures 1C and S2A) shows flexibility relative to the rest of the protein (Figure S1B). The LRR domain of LRRK2 differs from the canonical structure and has a long insertion between the first and second repeats (Figure S2B). The truncated LRRK2RCKW structure, which only contains the ROC, COR, KIN, and WD40 domains, was recently reported (Deniston et al., 2020Deniston C.K. Salogiannis J. Mathea S. Snead D.M. Lahiri I. Matyszewski M. Donosa O. Watanabe R. Böhning J. Shiau A.K. et al.Structure of LRRK2 in Parkinson’s disease and model for microtubule interaction.Nature. 2020; 588: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We compared these four domains from the current structure with LRRK2RCKW, resulting in a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 5.2 Å. The ROC and COR domains displace significantly relative to the KIN and WD40 domains (Figure S2C). When aligned with the ROC domain and viewed from that perspective, the COR domain shows a clockwise rotation in the LRRK2RCKW structure (Figure S2C). Of note, the Thr1343 has a phosphorylation modification in the LRRK2RCKW sample, which may have contributed to the observed conformational differences. Despite adding GTP before freezing the sample for cryo-EM analysis, we likely captured LRRK2 in a GDP-bound form, as suggested by the following two observations. First, the GDP fits better in the cryo-EM density (Figure S2D). Second, the conformation of the ROC “switch 1” motif, which deviates from the GTP-bound state (Figure S2D), favors a GDP molecule. In general, “switch 1” motifs are structurally similar in GTP-bound ROC domains but show variations in the GDP-bound state (Figure S2D) (Eathiraj et al., 2005Eathiraj S. Pan X. Ritacco C.

The full-length structure of LRRK2 monomers revealed its overall architecture and enabled us to dissect the interdomain interactions at atomic details (Figures 2, 3C, 3D, S3A, and S3C), which otherwise was impossible with low-resolution or truncated structures (Deniston et al., 2020Deniston C.K.

Two of the interdomain interfaces show high disease relevance (Figures 2A and 2B). First, the COR-ROC interface that buries a surface area of ∼2,600 Å2 is a hotspot for PD disease mutations. All four high-risk mutation sites in ROC and COR domains (Asn1437, Arg1441, Tyr1699, and Ser1761) are found at or near the interface (Figure 2A), indicating the importance of the coupling between the ROC and COR domains in PD pathogenesis. Second, the ANK and LRR domains interact with the KIN domain through three sites: two on the C-lobe (Figures 2B and 3D) and one on the N-lobe of the KIN domain (Figures 3D and S3C). One of the C-lobe interacting sites involves Asn2081 (Figure 2B), whose mutation to aspartic acid (N2081D) confers risk for Cohn’s diseases (Hui et al., 2018Hui K.Y. Fernandez-Hernandez H. Hu J.

Transl. Med. 2018; 10: eaai7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Asn2081 interacts with the LRR domain through hydrophilic interactions. Mutation of Asn2081Asp, which shows increased kinase activity, is expected to destabilize such interactions. Intriguingly, the autophosphorylation site, Ser1292 (Gloeckner et al., 2010Gloeckner C.J. Boldt K. von Zweydorf F. Helm S. Wiesent L. Sarioglu H. Ueffing M.

Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), is also localized in the close vicinity (Figure 2B). It is plausible that Asn2018Asp and Ser1292 phosphorylation lead to similar structural changes by introducing negative charges at the interface.Figure 3The inactive kinase domain of LRRK2 and LRRK2G2019SShow full caption(A) Structural elements of the LRRK2 kinase domain.

In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies’ effect. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level during the first seven weeks of the outbreak in the United States. We estimate the association between stay-at-home orders and alterations in COVID-19 cases and fatalities using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) average reduction in weekly incident cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) average reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. These results suggest that stay-at-home orders might have reduced confirmed cases by 390,000 (170,000 to 680,000) and fatalities by 41,000 (27,000 to 59,000) within the first three weeks in localities that implemented stay-at-home orders."

However, asymptomatic infection has also been reported, highlighting the difference in immune responses among individuals. Here we performed single-cell chromatin accessibility and T cell-receptor analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19 and healthy donors. Chromatin remodelling was observed in both innate and adaptive immune cells in the individuals convalescing from COVID-19. Compared with healthy donors, recovered individuals contained abundant TBET-enriched CD16+ and IRF1-enriched CD14+ monocytes with sequential trained and activated epigenomic states. The B-cell lineage in recovered individuals exhibited an accelerated developmental programme from immature B cells to antibody-producing plasma cells. Finally, an integrated analysis of single-cell T cell-receptor clonality with the chromatin accessibility landscape revealed the expansion of putative SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells with epigenomic profiles that promote the differentiation of effector or memory cells. Overall, our data suggest that immune cells of individuals convalescing from COVID-19 exhibit global remodelling of the chromatin accessibility landscape, indicative of the establishment of immunological memory. You et al. report single-cell ATAC-seq profiles of periphery immune cells from patients recovered from COVID-19, which reveals a global remodelling of the chromatin accessibility that may contribute to immune memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W3166293740,"In the last few decades, topological phase1–11 has emerged as a new classification of matter states beyond the Ginzburg–Landau symmetry-breaking paradigm. The underlying global invariant is usually well characterized by integers, such as Chern numbers or winding numbers—the Abelian charges12–15. Very recently, researchers proposed the notion of non-Abelian topological charges16–19, which possess non-commutative and fruitful braiding structures with multiple (more than one) bandgaps tangled together. Here we experimentally observe the non-Abelian topological charges in a time-reversal and inversion-symmetric transmission line network. The quaternion-valued non-Abelian topological charges are clearly mapped onto an eigenstate-frame sphere. Moreover, we find a non-Abelian quotient relation that provides a global perspective on the distribution of edge/domain-wall states. Our work opens the door towards characterization and manipulation of non-Abelian topological charges, which may lead to interesting observables such as trajectory-dependent Dirac/Weyl node collisions in two-dimensional systems16,17,20, admissible nodal line configurations in three dimensions16,19,20, and may provide insight into certain strongly correlated phases of twisted bilayer graphene21. Non-Abelian topological charges and edge states in a PT-symmetric transmission line network are experimentally observed, and a non-Abelian quotient relation for the bulk–edge correspondence is found."

The use of anionic redox represents one possible approach to meeting this ambitious target. However, questions remain regarding the validity of the O2-/O- oxygen redox paradigm, and alternative explanations for the origin of the anionic capacity have been proposed3, because the electronic orbitals associated with redox reactions cannot be measured by standard experiments. Here, using high-energy X-ray Compton measurements together with first-principles modelling, we show how the electronic orbital that lies at the heart of the reversible and stable anionic redox activity can be imaged and visualized, and its character and symmetry determined. We find that differential changes in the Compton profile with lithium-ion concentration are sensitive to the phase of the electronic wave function, and carry signatures of electrostatic and covalent bonding effects4. Our study not only provides a picture of the workings of a lithium-rich battery at the atomic scale, but also suggests pathways to improving existing battery materials and designing new ones."
https://openalex.org/W3169377525,"Correct transcription is crucial for life. However, DNA damage severely impedes elongating RNA polymerase II, causing transcription inhibition and transcription-replication conflicts. Cells are equipped with intricate mechanisms to counteract the severe consequence of these transcription-blocking lesions. However, the exact mechanism and factors involved remain largely unknown. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screen, we identified the elongation factor ELOF1 as an important factor in the transcription stress response following DNA damage. We show that ELOF1 has an evolutionarily conserved role in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), where it promotes recruitment of the TC-NER factors UVSSA and TFIIH to efficiently repair transcription-blocking lesions and resume transcription. Additionally, ELOF1 modulates transcription to protect cells against transcription-mediated replication stress, thereby preserving genome stability. Thus, ELOF1 protects the transcription machinery from DNA damage via two distinct mechanisms. Two side-by-side papers report that the transcription elongation factor ELOF1 drives transcription-coupled repair and prevents replication stress."
https://openalex.org/W3170184056,"Cells employ transcription-coupled repair (TCR) to eliminate transcription-blocking DNA lesions. DNA damage-induced binding of the TCR-specific repair factor CSB to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) triggers RNAPII ubiquitylation of a single lysine (K1268) by the CRL4CSA ubiquitin ligase. How CRL4CSA is specifically directed towards K1268 is unknown. Here, we identify ELOF1 as the missing link that facilitates RNAPII ubiquitylation, a key signal for the assembly of downstream repair factors. This function requires its constitutive interaction with RNAPII close to K1268, revealing ELOF1 as a specificity factor that binds and positions CRL4CSA for optimal RNAPII ubiquitylation. Drug–genetic interaction screening also revealed a CSB-independent pathway in which ELOF1 prevents R-loops in active genes and protects cells against DNA replication stress. Our study offers key insights into the molecular mechanisms of TCR and provides a genetic framework of the interplay between transcriptional stress responses and DNA replication. Two side-by-side papers report that the transcription elongation factor ELOF1 drives transcription-coupled repair and prevents replication stress."
https://openalex.org/W3048966389,"Superfluidity in its various forms has fascinated scientists since the observation of frictionless flow in liquid helium II. In three spatial dimensions (3D), it is conceptually associated with the emergence of long-range order (LRO) at a critical temperature $T_{\text{c}}$. One of its hallmarks, predicted by the highly successful two-fluid model and observed in both liquid helium and ultracold atomic gases, is the existence of two kinds of sound excitations, the first and second sound. In 2D systems, thermal fluctuations preclude LRO, but superfluidity nevertheless emerges at a nonzero $T_{\text{c}}$ via the infinite-order Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, which is associated with a universal jump in the superfluid density $n_{\text{s}}$ without any discontinuities in the fluid's thermodynamic properties. BKT superfluids are also predicted to support two sounds, but the observation of this has remained elusive. Here we observe first and second sound in a homogeneous 2D atomic Bose gas, and from the two temperature-dependent sound speeds extract its superfluid density. Our results agree with BKT theory, including the prediction for the universal superfluid-density jump."
https://openalex.org/W3170919745,"Genetic recombination arises during meiosis through the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are created by Spo11, a topoisomerase-like protein1,2. Spo11 DSBs form preferentially in nucleosome-depleted regions termed hotspots3,4, yet how Spo11 engages with its DNA substrate to catalyse DNA cleavage is poorly understood. Although most recombination events are initiated by a single Spo11 cut, here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that hyperlocalized, concerted Spo11 DSBs separated by 33 to more than 100 base pairs also form, which we term 'double cuts'. Notably, the lengths of double cuts vary with a periodicity of 10.5 base pairs, which is conserved in yeast and mice. This finding suggests a model in which the orientation of adjacent Spo11 molecules is fixed relative to the DNA helix-a proposal supported by the in vitro DNA-binding properties of the Spo11 core complex. Deep sequencing of meiotic progeny identifies recombination scars that are consistent with repair initiated from gaps generated by adjacent Spo11 DSBs. Collectively, these results revise our present understanding of the mechanics of Spo11-DSB formation and expand on the original concepts of gap repair during meiosis to include DNA gaps that are generated by Spo11 itself."

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the TME possess both tumor-promoting and tumor-restraining functions. In the current study, we interrogated the role of αSMA+ CAFs in a genetic mouse model of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Selective depletion of αSMA+ CAFs resulted in increased tumor invasiveness, lymph node metastasis, and reduced overall survival. Depletion of αSMA+ CAFs reduced BMP4 and increased TGFβ1 secretion from stromal cells, and was associated with increased Lgr5+ cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and the generation of an immunosuppressive TME with increased frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and suppression of CD8+ T cells. This study demonstrates that αSMA+ CAFs in CRC exert tumor-restraining functions via BMP4/TGFβ1 paracrine signaling that serves to suppress Lgr5+ CSCs and promote anti-tumor immunity, ultimately limiting CRC progression."

Multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate the role of individually Perceived Threat of COVID-19 , anxiety related personality traits (trait-anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty) and the role of media exposure in predicting quantity and frequency of purchasing behavior. High levels of Perceived Threat of COVID-19 were associated significantly with a reported reduction in purchasing frequency ( b = -.24, p &lt; .001) and an increase in the quantity of products bought per purchase ( b = .22, p &lt; .001). These results are comparable to observed changes in foraging behavior in rodents under threat conditions.

https://openalex.org/W3172476088,"The evolution of satellite galaxies is shaped by their constant interaction with the circumgalactic medium surrounding central galaxies, which in turn may be affected by gas and energy ejected from the central supermassive black hole1-6. The nature of such a coupling between black holes and galaxies is, however, much debated7-9 and observational evidence remains scarce10,11. Here we report an analysis of archival data on 124,163 satellite galaxies in the potential wells of 29,631 dark matter halos with masses between 1012 and 1014 solar masses. We find that quenched satellite galaxies are relatively less frequent along the minor axis of their central galaxies. This observation might appear counterintuitive given that black hole activity is expected to eject mass and energy preferentially in the direction of the minor axis of the host galaxy. We show, however, that the observed anisotropic signal results precisely from the ejective nature of black hole feedback in massive halos, as outflows powered by active galactic nuclei clear out the circumgalactic medium, reducing the ram pressure and thus preserving star formation in satellite galaxies. This interpretation is supported by the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological numerical simulations, even though the model's sub-grid implementation of black hole feedback is effectively isotropic12."

A large proportion of them are able to self-propel in fluids with a vast diversity of swimming gaits and motility patterns. In this paper we present a biophysical survey of the available experimental data produced to date on the characteristics of motile behaviour in unicellular microswimmers. We assemble from the available literature empirical data on the motility of four broad categories of organisms: bacteria (and archaea), flagellated eukaryotes, spermatozoa and ciliates. Whenever possible, we gather the following biological, morphological, kinematic and dynamical parameters: species, geometry and size of the organisms, swimming speeds, actuation frequencies, actuation amplitudes, number of flagella and properties of the surrounding fluid. We then organise the data using the established fluid mechanics principles for propulsion at low Reynolds number. Specifically, we use theoretical biophysical models for the locomotion of cells within the same taxonomic groups of organisms as a means of rationalising the raw material we have assembled, while demonstrating the variability for organisms of different species within the same group. The material gathered in our work is an attempt to summarise the available experimental data in the field, providing a convenient and practical reference point for future studies."

Methods 2,187 Austrian and German GPs answered an internet survey on preparedness, testing, staff protection, perception of risk, self-confidence, a decrease in the number of patient contacts, and efforts to control the spread of the virus in the practice during the early phase of the COVID-pandemic (3rd to 30th April). Results The completion rate of the questionnaire was high (90.9%). GPs gave low ratings to their preparedness for a pandemic, testing of suspected cases and efforts to protect staff. The provision of information to GPs and the perception of risk were rated as moderate. On the other hand, the participants rated their self-confidence, a decrease in patient contacts and their efforts to control the spread of the disease highly. Conclusion Primary care is an important resource for dealing with a pandemic like COVID-19. The workforce is confident and willing to take an active role, but needs to be provided with the appropriate surrounding conditions. This will require that certain conditions are met.

https://openalex.org/W3166925522,"Renal fibrosis leads to chronic kidney disease, which affects over 15% of the U.S. population. PAI-1 is highly upregulated in the tubulointerstitial compartment in several common nephropathies and PAI-1 global ablation affords protection from fibrogenesis in mice. The precise contribution of renal tubular PAI-1 induction to disease progression, however, is unknown and surprisingly, appears to be independent of uPA inhibition. Human renal epithelial (HK-2) cells engineered to stably overexpress PAI-1 underwent dedifferentiation (E-cadherin loss, gain of vimentin), G2/M growth arrest (increased p-Histone3, p21), and robust induction of fibronectin, collagen-1, and CCN2. These cells are also susceptible to apoptosis (elevated cleaved caspase-3, annexin-V positivity) compared to vector controls, demonstrating a previously unknown role for PAI-1 in tubular dysfunction. Persistent PAI-1 expression results in a loss of klotho expression, p53 upregulation, and increases in TGF-βRI/II levels and SMAD3 phosphorylation. Ectopic restoration of klotho in PAI-1-transductants attenuated fibrogenesis and reversed the proliferative defects, implicating PAI-1 in klotho loss in renal disease. Genetic suppression of p53 reversed the PA1-1-driven maladaptive repair, moreover, confirming a pathogenic role for p53 upregulation in this context and uncovering a novel role for PAI-1 in promoting renal p53 signaling. TGF-βRI inhibition also attenuated PAI-1-initiated epithelial dysfunction, independent of TGF-β1 ligand synthesis. Thus, PAI-1 promotes tubular dysfunction via klotho reduction, p53 upregulation, and activation of the TGF-βRI-SMAD3 axis. Since klotho is an upstream regulator of both PAI-1-mediated p53 induction and SMAD3 signaling, targeting tubular PAI-1 expression may provide a novel, multi-level approach to the therapy of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W3166024029,"Palmitic acid (PA) is a saturated fatty acid whose high consumption has been largely associated with the development of different metabolic alterations, such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Particularly in the brain, insulin signaling disruption has been linked to cognitive decline and is considered a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Cumulative evidence has demonstrated the participation of PA in the molecular cascade underlying cellular insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, but its role in the development of neuronal insulin resistance and the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. It has generally been accepted that the brain does not utilize fatty acids as a primary energy source, but recent evidence shows that neurons possess the machinery for fatty acid β-oxidation. However, it is still unclear under what conditions neurons use fatty acids as energy substrates and the implications of their oxidative metabolism in modifying insulin-stimulated effects. In the present work, we have found that neurons differentiated from human neuroblastoma MSN exposed to high but nontoxic concentrations of PA generate ATP through mitochondrial metabolism, which is associated with an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ and diminished insulin signaling in neurons. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which saturated fatty acids produce Ca2+ entry and insulin resistance that may play a causal role in increasing neuronal vulnerability associated with metabolic diseases."

The secondary objective was to explore the economic impact of iStent inject TBS in patients who comply to different degrees with their anti-glaucoma medications.A previously published Markov model was adapted to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with iStent inject TBS + Cat Sx versus Cat Sx alone over a lifetime time horizon in patients with mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma in France. Progression was modeled by health states reflecting increasing stages of vision loss. Disease progression was obtained from the two-year randomized clinical trial assessing safety and effectiveness of both interventions. French specific health-state utilities and costs were obtained through a targeted literature review. Model structure and inputs were validated by French ophthalmologists. Outcomes were expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The robustness of results was tested through sensitivity analyses.iStent inject TBS + Cat Sx reduced the number of medications needed and risk of blindness. Incremental cost and QALYs were €75 and 0.065 leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €1,154/QALY gained. ICER ranged from dominating for non-persistent patients to €31,127 patients fully persistent with their medication regime. Results from one-way sensitivity analysis had a maximum ICER of €29,000 when varying input parameters. iStent inject TBS + Cat Sx had an 86% chance of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 per QALY gained.Results demonstrate that iStent inject TBS + Cat Sx is a cost-effective intervention for intraocular pressure reduction when compared to Cat Sx alone in France."
https://openalex.org/W3167446778,"This paper analyzes the option coordination problem of a fresh agricultural product supply chain under two supply chain structures, when the production cost and the loss rate are disrupted simultaneously. This paper provides the explicit option coordination conditions for the disrupted supply chain under two supply chain structures, and then explores the effects of the disruptions and supply chain structure on the option coordination conditions. The results suggest that it is unfavorable to apply the original coordinating contracts without disruptions to coordinate the disrupted supply chain. The coordination of the disrupted supply chain can be achieved with knowledge of the distribution of demand. In two coordinating contracts for the disrupted supply chain, the exercise price is still at the original level without disruptions while the option price deviates from the original level without disruptions. Moreover, the relationships of the coordination conditions in two supply chain structures depend on the value of the profit allocation coefficient. When the profit allocation coefficient exceeds (falls behind) a certain threshold, the option price is set at a higher (lower) value in the supplier-led supply chain structure than in the distributor-led supply chain structure, while the exercise price is set at a lower (higher) value in the supplier-led supply chain structure than in the distributor-led supply chain structure. Finally, the disrupted supply chain with any supply chain structure will perform better in the modified coordinating contracts than in the original coordinating contracts without disruptions."

https://openalex.org/W3170265385,"Malaria incidence in Myanmar has significantly reduced over recent years, however, completeness and timeliness of incidence data remain a challenge. The first ever nationwide malaria infection and seroprevalence survey was conducted in Myanmar in 2015 to better understand malaria epidemiology and highlight gaps in Annual Parasite Index (API) data. The survey was a cross-sectional two-stage stratified cluster-randomised household survey conducted from July-October 2015. Blood samples were collected from household members for ultra-sensitive PCR and serology testing for P. falciparum and P. vivax. Data was gathered on demography and a priori risk factors of participants. Data was analysed nationally and within each of four domains defined by API data. Prevalence and seroprevalence of malaria were 0.74% and 16.01% nationwide, respectively. Prevalent infection was primarily asymptomatic P. vivax, while P. falciparum was predominant in serology. There was large heterogeneity between villages and by domain. At the township level, API showed moderate correlation with P. falciparum seroprevalence. Risk factors for infection included socioeconomic status, domain, and household ownership of nets. Three K13 P. falciparum mutants were found in highly prevalent villages. There results highlight high heterogeneity of both P. falciparum and P. vivax transmission between villages, accentuated by a large hidden reservoir of asymptomatic P. vivax infection not captured by incidence data, and representing challenges for malaria elimination. Village-level surveillance and stratification to guide interventions to suit local context and targeting of transmission foci with evidence of drug resistance would aid elimination efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3170725566,"Research over the past decade has suggested important roles for pseudogenes in glioma. This study aimed to show that pseudogene PRELI domain-containing 1 pseudogene 6 (PRELID1P6) promotes glioma progression. Aberrant expression of genes was screened using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We found that mRNA level of PRELID1P6 was highly upregulated in glioma and was associated with a shorter survival time. Functional studies showed that the knockdown of PRELID1P6 decreased cell proliferation, sphere formation, and clone formation ability and blocked the cell cycle transition at G0/G1, while overexpression of PRELID1P6 had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, knockdown of PRELID1P6 changed the cellular localization of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1) from nucleus to cytoplasm, which promoted ubiquitin-mediated degradation of hnRNPH1. RNA-sequence and gene set enrichment analysis suggested that knockdown of PRELID1P6 regulates the apoptosis signaling pathway. Western blotting showed that PRELID1P6 increased TRF2 expression by hnRNPH1-mediated alternative splicing effect and activated the Akt/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, Akt inhibitor MK2206 treatment reversed the oncogenic function of PRELID1P6. PRELID1P6 was also found to be negatively regulated by miR-1825. Our result showed that PRELID1P6 promotes glioma progression through the hnHNPH1-Akt/mTOR pathway. These findings shed new light on the important role of PRELID1P6 as a novel oncogene for glioma."
https://openalex.org/W3158596713,"With increasing carbon emissions rising temperatures are likely to impact our economies and societies profoundly. In particular, it has been shown that heat stress can strongly reduce labor productivity. The resulting economic perturbations can propagate along the global supply network. Here we show, using numerical simulations, that output losses due to heat stress alone are expected to increase by about 24% within the next 20 years, if no additional adaptation measures are taken. The subsequent market response with rising prices and supply shortages strongly reduces the consumers' purchasing power in almost all countries including the US and Europe with particularly strong effects in India, Brazil, and Indonesia. As a consequence, the producing sectors in many regions temporarily benefit from higher selling prices while decreasing their production in quantity, whereas other countries suffer losses within their entire national economy. Our results stress that, even though climate shocks may stimulate economic activity in some regions and some sectors, their unpredictability exerts increasing pressure on people's livelihood."
https://openalex.org/W3170781333,"While G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to be excellent drug targets, the second largest family of adhesion-GPCRs is less explored for their role in health and disease. ADGRF1 (GPR110) is an adhesion-GPCR and has an important function in neurodevelopment and cancer. Despite serving as a poor predictor of survival, ADGRF1's coupling to G proteins and downstream pathways remain unknown in cancer. We evaluated the effects of ADGRF1 overexpression on tumorigenesis and signaling pathways using two human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) cell-line models. We also interrogated publicly available clinical datasets to determine the expression of ADGRF1 in various BC subtypes and its impact on BC-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) in patients. ADGRF1 overexpression in HER2+ BC cells increased secondary mammosphere formation, soft agar colony formation, and % of Aldefluor-positive tumorigenic population in vitro and promoted tumor growth in vivo. ADGRF1 co-immunoprecipitated with both Gαs and Gαq proteins and increased cAMP and IP1 when overexpressed. However, inhibition of only the Gαs pathway by SQ22536 reversed the pro-tumorigenic effects of ADGRF1 overexpression. RNA-sequencing and RPPA analysis revealed inhibition of cell cycle pathways with ADGRF1 overexpression, suggesting cellular quiescence, as also evidenced by cell cycle arrest at the G0/1 phase and resistance to chemotherapy in HER2+ BC. ADGRF1 was significantly overexpressed in the HER2-enriched BC compared to luminal A and B subtypes and predicted worse BCSS and OS in these patients. Therefore, ADGRF1 represents a novel drug target in HER2+ BC, warranting discovery of novel ADGRF1 antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W3171217072,"Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) represent the most abundant leukocytes in adipose tissue (AT). An increase in number and a phenotypical switch of ATMs during the development of obesity contribute to chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders, which have been regarded as potential therapeutic targets to restore AT homeostasis. Emodin has been shown to exert strong anti-inflammatory property via acting on macrophages in a range of disease models. However, whether emodin exerts a beneficial effect on obesity via modulating ATMs has not been reported. In high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, emodin significantly inhibited the increase of body weight and lipid accumulation in ATs. Emodin apparently reduced glucose and insulin levels and ameliorated serum lipid profiles in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, the local and systemic inflammation was dramatically alleviated by emodin. We next discovered that M2 macrophage percentage was greatly increased by emodin although total ATMs was not altered, which resulted in a net increase of M2 macrophages in AT. In vitro studies confirmed that emodin promoted the polarization of macrophages towards M2. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that myeloid leukocyte differentiation and activation were among the most significant biological processes in emodin-treated ATMs. We further identified that TREM2 was the most dramatically upregulated molecule by emodin and emodin-induced M2 macrophage polarization was dependent on TREM2. Furthermore, silencing TREM2 apparently abrogated the effect of emodin on AT inflammation and adipogenesis. We, for the first time, disclosed that emodin inhibited obesity by promoting M2 macrophage polarization via TREM2, suggesting that emodin may be explored as a clinical and translational candidate in preventing obesity and its related metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3172627785,"Molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT pathway occur frequently in hormone receptor-positive breast tumors. Patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer are often treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy. Although this is an effective regimen, most patients ultimately progress. The purpose of this study was identifying synthetic lethality partners that can enhance palbociclib's antitumor efficacy in the presence of PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations. We utilized a barcoded shRNA library to determine critical targets for survival in isogenic MCF7 cells with PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations. We demonstrated that the efficacy of palbociclib is reduced in the presence of PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations. We also identified that the downregulation of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is synthetically lethal with palbociclib. DDR1 knockdown and DDR1 pharmacological inhibitor decreased cell growth and inhibited cell cycle progression in all cell lines, while enhanced the sensitivity of PIK3CA/AKT1 mutant cells to palbociclib. Combined treatment of palbociclib and 7rh further induced cell cycle arrest in PIK3CA/AKT1 mutant cell lines. In vivo, 7rh significantly enhanced palbociclib's antitumor efficacy. Our data indicates that DDR1 inhibition can augment cell cycle suppressive effect of palbociclib and could be effective strategy for targeted therapy of ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers with PI3K pathway activation."

https://openalex.org/W3169021042,"Podocyte injury is a major determinant of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) and the identification of potential therapeutic targets for preventing podocyte injury has clinical importance for the treatment of FSGS. CLEC14A is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the vascular expressed C-type lectin family. CLEC14A is found to be expressed in vascular endothelial cells during embryogenesis and is also implicated in tumor angiogenesis. However, the current understanding of the biological functions of CLEC14A in podocyte is very limited. In this study, we found that CLEC14A was expressed in podocyte and protected against podocyte injury in mice with Adriamycin (ADR)-induced FSGS. First, we observed that CLEC14A was downregulated in mice with ADR nephropathy and renal biopsies from individuals with FSGS and other forms of podocytopathies. Moreover, CLEC14A deficiency exacerbated podocyte injury and proteinuria in mice with ADR nephropathy accompanied by enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory responses. In vitro, overexpression of CLEC14A in podocyte had pleiotropic protective actions, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects. Mechanistically, CLEC14A inhibited high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) release, at least in part by directly binding HMGB1, and suppressed HMGB1-mediated signaling, including NF-κB signaling and early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) signaling. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the pivotal role of CLEC14A in maintaining podocyte function, indicating that CLEC14A may be an innovative therapeutic target in FSGS."
https://openalex.org/W3171991125,"The etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is not known. Alterations in gut microbiome, mucosal barrier function, immune cell activation, and blood flow are characterized events in its development, with stress as a contributing factor. The hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a key mediator of stress responses and influences these aforementioned processes. CRF signaling is modulated by NEC’s main risk factors of prematurity and formula feeding. Using an established neonatal rat model of NEC, we tested hypotheses that: (i) increased CRF levels—as seen during stress—promote NEC in formula-fed (FF) newborn rats, and (ii) antagonism of CRF action ameliorates NEC. Newborn pups were formula-fed to initiate gut inflammation and randomized to: no stress, no stress with subcutaneous CRF administration, stress (acute hypoxia followed by cold exposure—NEC model), or stress after pretreatment with the CRF peptide antagonist Astressin. Dam-fed unstressed and stressed littermates served as controls. NEC incidence and severity in the terminal ileum were determined using a histologic scoring system. Changes in CRF, CRF receptor (CRFRs), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression levels were determined by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, respectively. Stress exposure in FF neonates resulted in 40.0% NEC incidence, whereas exogenous CRF administration resulted in 51.7% NEC incidence compared to 8.7% in FF non-stressed neonates (p&lt;0.001). Astressin prevented development of NEC in FF-stressed neonates (7.7% vs. 40.0%; p = 0.003). CRF and CRFR immunoreactivity increased in the ileum of neonates with NEC compared to dam-fed controls or FF unstressed pups. Immunoblotting confirmed increased TLR4 protein levels in FF stressed (NEC model) animals vs. controls, and Astressin treatment restored TLR4 to control levels. Peripheral CRF may serve as specific pharmacologic target for the prevention and treatment of NEC."
https://openalex.org/W3166433843,"Proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes, and other cell types, is accompanied by an increase in glucose uptake. Previous work showed that a pulse of high glucose was required during the first 3 days of differentiation in vitro, but was not required after that. The specific glucose metabolism pathways required for adipocyte differentiation are unknown. Herein, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a model system to study glucose metabolism and expansion of the adipocyte metabolome during the first 3 days of differentiation. Our primary outcome measures were GLUT4 and adiponectin, key proteins associated with healthy adipocytes. Using complete media with 0 or 5 mM glucose, we distinguished between developmental features that were dependent on the differentiation cocktail of dexamethasone, insulin, and isobutylmethylxanthine alone or the cocktail plus glucose. Cocktail alone was sufficient to activate the capacity for 2-deoxglucose uptake and glycolysis, but was unable to support the expression of GLUT4 and adiponectin in mature adipocytes. In contrast, 5 mM glucose in the media promoted a transient increase in glucose uptake and glycolysis as well as a significant expansion of the adipocyte metabolome and proteome. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we found that the positive effects of 5 mM glucose on adipocyte differentiation were specifically due to increased expression of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), a key regulator of glycolysis and the ancillary glucose metabolic pathways. Our data reveal a critical role for PFKFB3 activity in regulating the cellular metabolic remodeling required for adipocyte differentiation and maturation."

https://openalex.org/W3170374725,"The tribological performance of organic molybdenum in the present of organic friction modifier was investigated in this study. Three types of organic friction modifiers were selected, which are Glycerol monooleate, Pentaerythritol and N,N-Dimethylhexadecylamine. The organic molybdenum are MoDTC, MoDDP and molybdenum amide. Friction coefficient and wear were studied in block-on-ring test rig with steel test specimens. Experimental results indicate the Pentaerythritol shows synergistic effect with MoDTC in wide range temperature, while increased the friction coefficient of molybdenum amide in high temperature. N,N-Dimethylhexadecylamine shows synergistic effect with molybdenum amide, while hindered the friction reduction performance of MoDTC in low temperature. The presence of Glycerol monooleate reduced friction coefficient of MoDTC in low temperature, while increased the friction coefficient of molybdenum amide in most situations. All the tested organic friction modifiers improved the friction reduction performance of MoDDP. Most of the tested organic friction modifiers reduced the wear of organic molybdenum. The PT shows the best anti-wear performance with MoDTC. The tribo-chemical products in test specimens lubricated with different lubricant formulas indicate that the presences of Pentaerythritol promotes the production of MoS2 in MoDTC. N,N-Dimethylhexadecylamine promotes the production of MoS2 in molybdenum amide. The side products of MoO1.6S1.6 and Cr/MoS2 of MoDDP in high temperature lead to high friction coefficient."
https://openalex.org/W3172036857,"In this work, we aimed to develop an automatic algorithm for the quantification of total volume and lung impairments in four different diseases. The quantification was completely automatic based upon high resolution computed tomography exams. The algorithm was capable of measuring volume and differentiating pulmonary involvement including inflammatory process and fibrosis, emphysema, and ground-glass opacities. The algorithm classifies the percentage of each pulmonary involvement when compared to the entire lung volume. Our algorithm was applied to four different patients groups: no lung disease patients, patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and patients with paracoccidioidomycosis . The quantification results were compared with a semi-automatic algorithm previously validated. Results confirmed that the automatic approach has a good agreement with the semi-automatic. Bland-Altman (B&amp;A) demonstrated a low dispersion when comparing total lung volume, and also when comparing each lung impairment individually. Linear regression adjustment achieved an R value of 0.81 when comparing total lung volume between both methods. Our approach provides a reliable quantification process for physicians, thus impairments measurements contributes to support prognostic decisions in important lung diseases including the infection of SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3166088373,"Drug-induced gingival overgrowth (DIGO) is a side effect of cyclosporine A (CsA), nifedipine (NIF), and phenytoin (PHT). Nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1) plays a role in fibrosis in multiple organs. However, the relationship between NR4A1 and DIGO remains unclear. We herein investigated the involvement of NR4A1 in DIGO. In the DIGO mouse model, CsA inhibited the up-regulation of Nr4a1 expression induced by periodontal disease (PD) in gingival tissue, but not that of Col1a1 and Pai1. We detected gingival overgrowth (GO) in Nr4a1 knock out (KO) mice with PD. A NR4A1 agonist inhibited the development of GO in DIGO model mice. TGF-β increased Col1a1 and Pai1 expression levels in KO mouse gingival fibroblasts (mGF) than in wild-type mice, while the overexpression of NR4A1 in KO mGF suppressed the levels. NR4A1 expression levels in gingival tissue were significantly lower in DIGO patients than in PD patients. We also investigated the relationship between nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and NR4A1. NFATc3 siRNA suppressed the TGF-β-induced up-regulation of NR4A1 mRNA expression in human gingival fibroblasts (hGF). CsA suppressed the TGF-β-induced translocation of NFATc3 into the nuclei of hGF. Furthermore, NIF and PHT also decreased NR4A1 mRNA expression levels and suppressed the translocation of NFATc3 in hGF. We confirmed that CsA, NIF, and PHT reduced cytosolic calcium levels increased by TGF-β, while CaCl2 enhanced the TGF-β-up-regulated NR4A1 expression. We propose that the suppression of the calcium-NFATc3-NR4A1 cascade by these three drugs plays a role in the development of DIGO."

We aim 1) to examine the associations of financial inclusion with functional impairment during older age in Ghana; and 2) to evaluate whether gender and social networks modify this association.The cross-sectional analyses are based on a sample (N = 1,201) of study participants aged 50 years and over (M = 66.5 years, SD = 11.9, 63.3% female) deriving from the 2016-2017 AgeHeaPsyWel-HeaSeeB Study. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses with interactions were performed to estimate the link between financial inclusion and functional health and how the association is modified by gender and older age social networks.The mean financial inclusion score was 1.66 (SD = 1.74) in women and 2.33 (SD = 1.82) in men whilst mean activities of daily living (ADL) score was 13.03 (SD = 4.99) and 14.85 (SD = 5.06) in women and men respectively. We found that financial inclusion was associated with decreases in ADL (total sample: β = -.548, p < .001; women: β = -.582, p < .001; men: β = -1.082 p < .001) and instrumental ADL (IADL) (total sample: β = -.359, p = .034; women: β = -.445, p = .026 but not in men). Social networks significantly moderated the association of financial inclusion with ADL such that the financially included who were embedded in a stronger constellation of social networks were 6% less likely to report ADL impairment compared to those with weaker social networks (β = -.062, p = .025).The study provides empirical evidence for a better understanding of the association between financial inclusion and physical health functioning in the context of later life social networks. Interventions for functional health through financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa should include improving interpersonal and social networks for older adult and also through gender lenses."

However, repetition rule learning in visual sequences seems more challenging, leading some researchers to claim that this type of rule learning applies preferentially to communicative stimuli. Here we demonstrate that 9-month-old infants can learn repetition rules in sequences of non-communicative dynamic human actions. We also show that when primed with these non-adjacent repetition patterns, infants can learn non-adjacent dependencies that involve memorizing the dependencies between specific human actions—patterns that prior research has shown to be difficult for infants in the visual domain and in speech. We discuss several possible mechanisms that account for the apparent advantage stimuli involving human action sequences has over other kinds of stimuli in supporting non-adjacent dependency learning. We also discuss possible implications for theories of language acquisition."

Depressive symptom prevalence was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The multivariate analysis of the associated factors followed a hierarchical model, using Poisson regression with backward selection.MDE externalizing symptoms were present in 20% of the university students and were more frequent among females, those with brown, black or other skin color in comparison to those with white skin color. Individuals with a family history of depression, minority sexual orientation, negative self-reported academic performance, students taking courses in the area of Linguistics, Modern Languages and Arts and students who reported strong conflicts with university teachers or colleagues also had higher prevalence of externalizing symptoms.It is important for education institutions to train teachers to identify and deal adequately with students who have externalizing symptoms of MDE. In addition, education institutions need to pay attention to conflicts, both between students and also between students and teachers in order to take preventive measures in these circumstances."
