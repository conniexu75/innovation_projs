https://openalex.org/W2952232681,"In this study, we report on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from the leaf extracts of Cynara scolymus (Artichoke) using microwave irradiation and the evaluation of its anti-cancer potential with photodynamic therapy (PDT). Silver nanoparticles formation was characterized by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Silver nanoparticles formation was also investigated the surface charge, particle size and distribution using zetasizer analysis. The cytotoxic effect of AgNPs and/or PDT was studied by MTT assay and migration by the scratch assay. The apoptotic inducing ability of the AgNPs and/or PDT was investigated by intracellular ROS analysis, antioxidant enzyme levels (SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH), Hoechst staining and Bax/Bcl-2 analysis using western blotting. The mean particle size of produced AgNPs was found 98.47±2.04 nm with low polydispersity (0.301±0.033). Zeta potential values of AgNPs show -32.3± 0.8 mV. These results clearly indicate the successful formation of AgNPs for cellular uptake. Mitochondrial damage and intracellular ROS production were observed upon treatment with AgNPs (10μg/mL) and PDT (0.5 mJ/cm2) showed significant reducing cell migration, expression of Bax and suppression of Bcl-2. Significantly, biosynthesized AgNPs showed a broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity with PDT therapy and therefore represent promoting ROS generation by modulating mitochondrial apoptosis induction in MCF7 breast cancer cells."

In this retrospective exploratory study, we used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to evaluate serum, nasopharyngeal, and stool specimens from 94 children (aged 2–54 months) with febrile illness admitted to Tororo District Hospital, Uganda. The most common microbes identified were Plasmodium falciparum (51.1% of samples) and parvovirus B19 (4.4%) from serum; human rhinoviruses A and C (40%), respiratory syncytial virus (10%), and human herpesvirus 5 (10%) from nasopharyngeal swabs; and rotavirus A (50% of those with diarrhea) from stool. We also report the near complete genome of a highly divergent orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, identified from the serum of a child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, a Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx of a child with rash and sepsis, and the genomes of two novel human rhinovirus C species. In this retrospective exploratory study, mNGS identified multiple potential pathogens, including 3 new viral species, associated with fever in Ugandan children."
https://openalex.org/W3101491837,"Convection is a fundamental physical process in the fluid cores of planets. It is the primary transport mechanism for heat and chemical species and the primary energy source for planetary magnetic fields. Key properties of convection-such as the characteristic flow velocity and length scale-are poorly quantified in planetary cores owing to the strong dependence of these properties on planetary rotation, buoyancy driving and magnetic fields, all of which are difficult to model using realistic conditions. In the absence of strong magnetic fields, the convective flows of the core are expected to be in a regime of rapidly rotating turbulence1, which remains largely unexplored. Here we use a combination of non-magnetic numerical models designed to explore this regime to show that the convective length scale becomes independent of the viscosity when realistic parameter values are approached and is entirely determined by the flow velocity and the planetary rotation. The velocity decreases very rapidly at smaller scales, so this turbulent convective length scale is a lower limit for the energy-carrying length scales in the flow. Using this approach, we can model realistically the dynamics of small non-magnetic cores such as the Moon. Although modelling the conditions of larger planetary cores remains out of reach, the fact that the turbulent convective length scale is independent of the viscosity allows a reliable extrapolation to these objects. For the Earth's core conditions, we find that the turbulent convective length scale in the absence of magnetic fields would be about 30 kilometres, which is orders of magnitude larger than the ten-metre viscous length scale. The need to resolve the numerically inaccessible viscous scale could therefore be relaxed in future more realistic geodynamo simulations, at least in weakly magnetized regions."
https://openalex.org/W2949884440,"National contributions to science are influenced by a number of factors, including economic capacity, national scientific priorities, science policy, and institutional settings and cultures. Nations do not have equal opportunities to access the global scientific market, and therefore, often seek out international partners with complementary resources and expertise. This study aims at investigating national collaboration strategies, with a focus on research leadership-measured through corresponding authorship-and its relationship with scientific impact. Results show that countries with higher R&D investments are more scientifically independent, and confirm that international collaboration is positively related to citation impact. However, leadership in international collaboration is inversely related with a countries' share of international collaboration and there is a very little relationship between citation impact and international leadership. For instance, most countries-and particularly those that have fewer resources-have higher scientific impact when they are not leading. This suggests that, despite increasing global participation in science, most international collaborations are asymmetrical, and that the research system remains structured around a few dominate nations."
https://openalex.org/W2951594120,"Triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells (TREM)2 is a genetic high-risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is considered a potential target for AD diagnosis and therapy, although its role in the different stages of AD remains controversial. We generated an embryonic deletion of Trem2 (whole body deletion) and induced hippocampal- and cortical-specific knockdown of microglial Trem2 at different stages of the AD process in amyloid precursor protein/Psen1 mice by adeno-associated virus (AAV) infection. AAV infection induced microglial Trem2 overexpression in the hippocampus of wild-type (WT) and thymus cell antigen 1-enhanced green fluorescent protein mice. Mice were subjected to ethological and pathologic tests. Whole body genetic deletion of Trem2 exerted different electrophysiological outcomes between different AD pathologic stages, which results from a complex integration of synaptic loss and amyloid aggregation. Interestingly, knockdown of Trem2 at the early-middle stage of AD (2-6 mo) prevents synaptic loss through directly inhibiting microglial phagocytosis, whereas knockdown of Trem2 at the middle-late stage of AD (6-10 mo) accelerates synaptic dysfunction because of more severe amyloid deposition caused by the depression of microglial phagocytosis. Additionally, hippocampal overexpression of Trem2 in WT mice results in significant synaptic impairment. Here, with transgenic technology and electrophysiological assay, we revealed that TREM2 up-regulation promotes microglial phagocytosis equally against synapse and amyloid plaques and eventually results in different outcomes. During the early-middle pathologic stage, TREM2 enhancing microglial phagocytosis mainly causes synaptic loss. However, TREM2 up-regulating microglial phagocytosis gradually supports a positive role when amyloid deposition occupies the leading position at the middle-late pathologic stage. In this study, we highlighted that TREM2 triggers synaptic loss during AD pathology development.-Sheng, L., Chen, M., Cai, K., Song, Y., Yu, D., Zhang, H., Xu, G. Microglial Trem2 induces synaptic impairment at early stage and prevents amyloidosis at late stage in APP/PS1 mice."
https://openalex.org/W2809960407,"In 1928, Dirac proposed a wave equation to describe relativistic electrons1. Shortly afterwards, Klein solved a simple potential step problem for the Dirac equation and encountered an apparent paradox: the potential barrier becomes transparent when its height is larger than the electron energy. For massless particles, backscattering is completely forbidden in Klein tunnelling, leading to perfect transmission through any potential barrier2,3. The recent advent of condensed-matter systems with Dirac-like excitations, such as graphene and topological insulators, has opened up the possibility of observing Klein tunnelling experimentally4–6. In the surface states of topological insulators, fermions are bound by spin–momentum locking and are thus immune from backscattering, which is prohibited by time-reversal symmetry. Here we report the observation of perfect Andreev reflection in point-contact spectroscopy—a clear signature of Klein tunnelling and a manifestation of the underlying ‘relativistic’ physics of a proximity-induced superconducting state in a topological Kondo insulator. Our findings shed light on a previously overlooked aspect of topological superconductivity and can serve as the basis for a unique family of spintronic and superconducting devices, the interface transport phenomena of which are completely governed by their helical topological states. Perfect transmission of electrons through a finite potential barrier between a normal metal and a topological superconducting state is demonstrated, as evidenced by an exact doubling of conductance in point contact measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2949709249,"Gait impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are aggravated under dual task conditions. Providing effective training to enhance different dual task gait performance is important for PD rehabilitation. This pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of cognitive and motor dual task gait training on dual task gait performance in PD. Eighteen PD participants (n = 6 per training group) were assigned to cognitive dual task gait training (CDTT), motor dual task gait training (MDTT), or general gait training (control) group randomly. The training was 30 min each session, 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes including gait performance during cognitive dual task, motor dual task, and single walking were assessed at pre- and post-training. The results showed decreased double support time during cognitive dual task walking after CDTT (-17.1±10.3%) was significantly more than MDTT (6.3±25.6%, p = .006) and control training (-5.6±7.8%, p = .041). Stride time variability during motor dual task walking decreased more after MDTT (-16.3±32.3%) than CDTT (38.6±24.0%, p = .015) and control training (36.8±36.4%, p = .041). CDTT also improved motor dual task walking performance especially on gait speed (13.8±10.71%, p = .046) stride length (10.5±6.6%, p = .046), and double support time (-8.0±2.0%, p = .028). CDTT improved single walking performance as well on gait speed (11.4±5.5%, p = .046), stride length (9.2±4.6%, p = .028), and double support time (-8.1±3.0%, p = .028). In summary, our preliminary data showed 12-session of CDTT decreased double support time during cognitive dual task walking, and MDTT reduced gait variability during motor dual task walking. Different training strategy can be adopted for possibly different training effects in people with PD."
https://openalex.org/W2950269435,"Decoupled aquaponic systems have the potential to become one of the most effective sustainable production systems for the combined production of animal protein and plant crops. Here, recirculating aquaculture systems for fish production are combined with hydroponics for soilless plant production thereby recycling dissolved nutrients derived from metabolism of the fish. The aim of the present study was to characterize hydroponic lettuce production using conventional nutrient solution in comparison with decoupled aquaponics using the nutrient rich fish water as basis for the nutrient solution being supplemented by missing nutrients. In addition, one aquaponic treatment became disinfected in order to assess any occurring advantage of the aquaponics derived fish water. For evaluation the temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and the mineral composition of the nutrient solution, as well as colony forming units in the fish water were monitored. Additionally, plant growth (fresh and dry weight, number and area of leaves) and quality parameters of lettuce leaves (nitrate, mineral content, phenolic compounds) were examined. Carbon sources and microorganisms derived from fish water seem to have neither beneficial nor detrimental effects on plant growth in this study. Except for some differences in the mineral content of the lettuce leaves, all other quality parameters were not significantly different. The use of aquaponic fish water saved 62.8% mineral fertilizer and fully substituted the required water for the nutrient solution in comparison to the control. Additionally, the reduced fertilizer demand using decoupled aquaponics can contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of an annual lettuce production site per ha by 72% due to saving the energy for fertilizer production. This study clearly demonstrates the huge potential of the innovative approach of decoupled aquaponics to foster the transformation of our conventional agriculture towards sustainable production systems saving resources and minimizing emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2950330151,"The importance of the family planning service environment and community-level factors on contraceptive use has long been studied. Few studies, however, have been able to link individual and health facility data from surveys that are nationally representative, concurrently fielded, and geographically linked. Data from Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 address these limitations. To assess the relative influences of the service delivery environment and community, household, and individual factors on a woman’s likelihood of using a modern contraceptive in five geographically and culturally diverse sub-Saharan African countries. Nationally representative, cross-sectional data from PMA2020 were linked at the household and service delivery level. Country-specific and pooled multilevel multinomial logistic models, comparing non-users, short- and long-acting method users were used. The variables elected for inclusion in our multivariate analyses were guided by the conceptual framework to profile the different levels of influences on individual use of modern contraception. Average marginal effects were calculated to improve interpretability. We find that the effect of contextual factors varies widely but that being visited by a health worker who spoke about family planning in the past 12 months was consistently and positively associated with individual use of short-acting and long-acting contraception. Characteristics of the nearest health facility did not generally exercise their own independent influences on a woman’s use of contraception, except in the case of Burkina Faso, where the average distance between individuals and the nearest family planning provider was significantly greater than other countries. Inclusion of country fixed effects in the pooled models and the relevance of covariates at different levels in the country-specific models demonstrate that there is significant variation across countries in how community, individual, and service delivery environment factors influence contraceptive use and method choice. Context must be taken into account when designing family planning programs."
https://openalex.org/W2953016756,"The Consortium for Mouse Cell Line Authentication was formed to validate Short Tandem Repeat (STR) markers for intraspecies identification of mouse cell lines. The STR profiling method is a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay comprised of primers targeting 19 mouse STR markers and two human STR markers (for interspecies contamination screening). The goals of the Consortium were to perform an interlaboratory study to-(1) validate the mouse STR markers to uniquely identify mouse cell lines (intraspecies identification), (2) to provide a public database of mouse cell lines with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-validated mouse STR profiles, and (3) to publish the results of the interlaboratory study. The interlaboratory study was an international effort that consisted of 12 participating laboratories representing institutions from academia, industry, biological resource centers, and government. The study was based on 50 of the most commonly used mouse cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Of the 50 mouse cell lines, 18 had unique STR profiles that were 100% concordant (match) among all Consortium laboratory members, and the remaining 32 cell lines had discordance that was resolved readily and led to improvement of the assay. The discordance was due to low signal and interpretation issues involving artifacts and genotyping errors. Although the total number of discordant STR profiles was relatively high in this study, the percent of labs agreeing on allele calls among the discordant samples was above 92%. The STR profiles, including electropherogram images, for NIST-validated mouse cell lines will be published on the NCBI BioSample Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/). Overall, the interlaboratory study showed that the multiplex PCR method using 18 of the 19 mouse STR markers is capable of discriminating at the intraspecies level between mouse cell lines. Further studies are ongoing to refine the assay including (1) development of an allelic ladder for improving the accuracy of allele calling and (2) integration of stutter filters to identify true stutter."
https://openalex.org/W2950365108,"In an ever-aging society the demand for bone-defect filling grafts continues to gain in importance. While autologous grafting still prevails as the gold standard, allografts and xenografts present viable alternatives with promising results. Physiochemical properties of a graft strongly depend on the processing method such as the decellularization protocol. In addition, the physiochemical characteristics are critical factors for a successful integration of the graft after the implantation and might influence mesenchymal stem cell function in therapeutic approaches combining grafts and autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Several decellularization methods have been proposed, however it still remains unclear which method results in favorable physiochemical properties or might be preferred in stem cell applications. In the first part of this study we compared two decellularization approaches resulting in chemically processed allografts (CPAs) or sonication-based processed allografts (SPAs). Each decellularization approach was compared for its decellularization efficacy and its influence on the grafts’ surface texture and composition. In the second part of this study biocompatibility of grafts was assessed by testing the effect of extraction medium on MSC viability and comparing them to commercially available allografts and xenografts. Additionally, grafts’ performance in terms of MSC functionality was assessed by reseeding with MSCs pre-differentiated in osteogenic medium and determining cell adhesion, proliferation, as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the degree of mineralization. In summary, results indicate a more effective decellularization for the SPA approach in comparison to the CPA approach. Even though SPA extracts induced a decrease in MSC viability, MSC performance after reseeding was comparable to commercially available grafts based on DNA quantification, alkaline phosphatase activity and quantification of mineralization. Commercial Tutoplast allografts showed overall the best effects on MSC functionality as indicated by extraction biocompatibility testing as well as by comparing proliferation and osteogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2951776662,"Background Globally, 37 million people are in need of lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART). With the continual increase in the number of people living with HIV starting ART and the need for life-long retention and adherence, increasing attention is being paid to differentiated service delivery (DSD), such as adherence clubs. Adherence clubs are groups of 25–30 stable ART patients who meet five times per year at their clinic or a community location and are facilitated by a lay health-care worker who distributes pre-packed ART. This qualitative study explores patient experiences of clubs in two sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods A total of 144 participants took part in 11 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 56 in-depth interviews in the informal settlements of Khayelitsha and Gugulethu in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants included current club members, stable patients who had never joined a club and club members referred back to clinician-led facility-based standard care. FGDs and interviews were conducted in isiXhosa, translated and transcribed into English, entered into NVivo, coded and thematically analysed. Results The main themes were 1) understanding and knowledge of clubs; 2) understanding of and barriers to enrolment; 3) perceived benefits and 4) perceived disadvantages of the clubs. Participants viewed membership as an achievement and considered returning to clinician-led care a ‘failure’. Moving between clubs and the clinic created frustration and broke down trust in the health-care system. Conclusions Adherence clubs were appreciated by patients, particularly time-saving in relation to flexible ART collection. Improved patient understanding of enrolment processes, eligibility and referral criteria and the role of clinical oversight is essential for building relationships with health-care workers and trust in the health-care system."
https://openalex.org/W2953245539,"Introduction eHealth strategies targeting health-related behaviour often incorporate persuasive software design. To further engage patients with their overall health management, consumer-facing web portals may be integrated with data from one or more care providers. This study aimed to explore effectiveness for healthier behaviour of persuasive design characteristics within a web application integrated with the primary health care electronic record; also patient and general practitioner (GP) preferences for future integrated records. Methods Mixed methods study within the Consumer Navigation of Electronic Cardiovascular Tools randomised controlled trial. Participants were patients with moderate-high risk of cardiovascular disease, and their GPs. Survey and web analytic data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Interview and focus group transcripts were recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed for themes. Results Surveys (n = 397) received from patients indicated improved medication adherence (31.8%); improved mental health and well-being (40%); higher physical activity (47%); and healthier eating (61%). Users of the interactive features reported benefiting from personalised cardiovascular disease risk score (73%); goal tracking (69%); risk factor self-monitoring (52%) and receipt of motivational health tips (54%). Focus group and interview participants (n = 55) described customisations that would increase portal appeal and relevance, including more provider interaction. Of the GP survey respondents (n = 38), 74% reported increased patient attendance and engagement with their care. For future integrated portals, 94% of GPs were in favour and key themes among interviewees (n = 17) related to design optimisation, impact on workflow and data security. Conclusion Intervention features reflecting the persuasive design categories of Primary Task support, Dialogue support and System Credibility support facilitated healthier lifestyle behaviour. Patients valued customisable functions and greater patient-provider interactivity. GPs identified system challenges but saw advantages for patients and the health care relationship. Future studies could further elucidate the persuasive design principles that are at play and which may promote adoption of EHR-integrated consumer portals."
https://openalex.org/W2949103788,"Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a species of great ecological and economical importance in the Baltic Sea. Here, two genetically differentiated stocks, the western and the eastern Baltic cod, display substantial mechanical mixing, hampering our understanding of cod ecology and impeding stock assessments and management. Based on whole-genome re-sequencing data from reference samples obtained from the study area, we designed two different panels of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms markers (SNPs), which take into account the exceptional genome architecture of cod. A minimum panel of 20 diagnostic SNPs and an extended panel (20 diagnostic and 18 biologically informative SNPs, 38 in total) were developed and validated to distinguish unambiguously between the western and the eastern Baltic cod stocks and to enable studies of local adaptation to the specific environment in the Baltic Sea, respectively. We tested both panels on cod sampled from the southern Baltic Sea (n = 603) caught in 2015 and 2016. Genotyping results showed that catches from the mixing zone in the Arkona Sea, were composed of similar proportions of individuals of the western and the eastern stock. Catches from adjacent areas to the east, the Bornholm Basin and Gdańsk Deep, were exclusively composed of eastern Baltic cod, whereas catches from adjacent western areas (Belt Sea and Öresund) were composed of western Baltic cod. Interestingly, the two Baltic cod stocks showed strong genetic differences at loci associated with life-history trait candidate genes, highlighting the species’ potential for ecological adaptation even at small geographical scales. The minimum and the extended panel of SNP markers presented in this study provide powerful tools for future applications in research and fisheries management to further illuminate the mixing dynamics of cod in the Baltic Sea and to better understand Baltic cod ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2949145534,"The metabolic changes that accompany changes in Cardiopulmonary testing (CPET) and heart failure biomarkers (HFbio) are not well known. We undertook metabolomic and lipidomic phenotyping of a cohort of heart failure (HF) patients and utilized Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) to identify associations to CPET and HFBio test performance (peak oxygen consumption (Peak VO2), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), exercise duration, and minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production slope (VE/VCO2 slope), as well as the established HF biomarkers of inflammation C-reactive protein (CRP), beta-galactoside-binding protein (galectin-3), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)). A cohort of 49 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, predominantly males African American, presenting a high frequency of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension were used in the study. MRA revealed that metabolic models for VE/VCO2 and Peak VO2 were the most fitted models, and the highest predictors’ coefficients were from Acylcarnitine C18:2, palmitic acid, citric acid, asparagine, and 3-hydroxybutiric acid. Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA) used predictors to identify the most relevant metabolic pathways associated to the study, aminoacyl-tRNA and amino acid biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) found associations of our findings with pre-existing biological knowledge from studies of human plasma metabolism as brain dysfunction and enzyme deficiencies associated with lactic acidosis. Our results indicate a profile of oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, and metabolic syndrome coupled with mitochondria dysfunction in patients with HF tests poor performance. The insights resulting from this study coincides with what has previously been discussed in existing literature thereby supporting the validity of our findings while at the same time characterizing the metabolic underpinning of CPET and HFBio."
https://openalex.org/W2952316104,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common, progressive multifactorial vision-threatening disease and many genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified. The risk of AMD is influenced by lifestyle and diet, which may be reflected by an altered metabolic profile. Therefore, measurements of metabolites could identify biomarkers for AMD, and could aid in identifying high-risk individuals. Hypothesis-free technologies such as metabolomics have a great potential to uncover biomarkers or pathways that contribute to disease pathophysiology. To date, only a limited number of metabolomic studies have been performed in AMD. Here, we aim to contribute to the discovery of novel biomarkers and metabolic pathways for AMD using a targeted metabolomics approach of 188 metabolites. This study focuses on non-advanced AMD, since there is a need for biomarkers for the early stages of disease before severe visual loss has occurred. Targeted metabolomics was performed in 72 patients with early or intermediate AMD and 72 control individuals, and metabolites predictive for AMD were identified by a sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis. In our cohort, we identified four metabolite variables that were most predictive for early and intermediate stages of AMD. Increased glutamine and phosphatidylcholine diacyl C28:1 levels were detected in non-advanced AMD cases compared to controls, while the rate of glutaminolysis and the glutamine to glutamate ratio were reduced in non-advanced AMD. The association of glutamine with non-advanced AMD corroborates a recent report demonstrating an elevated glutamine level in early AMD using a different metabolomics technique. In conclusion, this study indicates that metabolomics is a suitable method for the discovery of biomarker candidates for AMD. In the future, larger metabolomics studies could add to the discovery of novel biomarkers in yet unknown AMD pathways and expand our insights in AMD pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2952566850,"Background Renal fibrosis is the result of the interaction of cellular and molecular pathways, which is induced by sustained glomerular injury and involves the podocytes and multiple profibrotic factors. In this study, we investigated the correlation of the mRNA expression of podocyte proteins and profibrotic factors with renal fibrosis measured in renal biopsies of patients with primary and secondary glomerulopathies. Methods Eighty-four adult patients with primary or secondary glomerular diseases and 12 controls were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Seventy-two percent of the renal biopsies were done less than one year from clinical disease manifestation. The quantification of the podocyte-associated mRNAs of alpha-actinin-4, podocin, and podocalyxin, as well as of the profibrotic factors TGF-β1, CTGF, and VEGF-A were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The percent positive area of renal fibrosis was measured by immunohistochemistry staining, using anti-CTGF and anti-HHF35 antibodies and unpolarized Sirius Red. Correlations between the expression of tissue mRNAs and the positive area of fibrosis for the measured markers were made by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Results In relation to control biopsies, podocyte-specific proteins were downregulated in podocytopathies, in proliferative nephritis, in diabetic kidney disease (DRD), and in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Messenger RNA of TGF-β1, CTGF, and VEGF-A was upregulated in patients with podocytopathies and in DRD but not in proliferative nephritis and IgAN. Tissue mRNA expression of TGF-β1, CTGF, and VEGF-A were strongly correlated with renal fibrosis, as measured by HHF35; however, the correlation, albeit significant, was moderate for Sirius Red and weak for CTGF. The percent positive area of renal fibrosis measured by Sirius Red was similar between podocytopathies and DRD and significantly higher in podocytopathies compared to IgAN or proliferative nephritis. Conclusions In patients with glomerular diseases, the mRNA of TGF-β1, CTGF, and VEGF-A correlated positively with the extent of renal fibrosis, and the positive area of fibrosis was larger in the podocytopathies and in DRD as measured by Sirius Red. The pathways connecting podocyte damage and activation of profibrotic factors to kidney tissue fibrosis need to be better investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2952377765,"Blooms of the toxic microalga Karenia brevis occur seasonally in Florida, Texas and other portions of the Gulf of Mexico. Brevetoxins produced during Karenia blooms can cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning in humans, massive fish kills, and the death of marine mammals and birds. Brevetoxin-containing aerosols are an additional problem, having a severe impact on beachgoers, triggering coughing, eye and throat irritation in healthy individuals, and more serious respiratory distress in those with asthma or other breathing disorders. The blooms and associated aerosol impacts are patchy in nature, often affecting one beach but having no impact on an adjacent beach. To provide timely information to visitors about which beaches are low-risk, we developed HABscope; a low cost (~$400) microscope system that can be used in the field by citizen scientists with cell phones to enumerate K. brevis cell concentrations in the water along each beach. The HABscope system operates by capturing short videos of collected water samples and uploading them to a central server for rapid enumeration of K. brevis cells using calibrated recognition software. The HABscope has a detection threshold of about 100,000 cells, which is the point when respiratory risk becomes evident. Higher concentrations are reliably estimated up to 10 million cells L-1. When deployed by volunteer citizen scientists, the HABscope consistently distinguished low, medium, and high concentrations of cells in the water. The volunteers were able to collect data on most days during a severe bloom. This indicates that the HABscope can provide an effective capability to significantly increase the sampling coverage during Karenia brevis blooms."
https://openalex.org/W2949257446,"The complete genome of a new rhabdovirus infecting papaya (Carica papaya L.) in Ecuador, named papaya virus E, was sequenced and characterized. The negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome consists of 13,469 nucleotides with six canonical open reading frames (ORFs) and two accessory short ORFs predicted between ORFs corresponding to P3 (movement protein) and M (matrix protein). Phylogenetic analyses using amino acid sequences from the nucleocapsid, glycoprotein and polymerase, grouped the virus with members of the genus Cytorhabdovirus, with rice stripe mosaic virus, yerba mate chlorosis-associated virus and Colocasia bobone disease-associated virus as closest relatives. The 3’ leader and 5’ trailer sequences were 144 and 167 nt long, respectively, containing partially complementary motifs. The motif 3’-AUUCUUUUUG-5’, conserved across rhabdoviruses, was identified in all but one intergenic regions; whereas the motif 3’-ACAAAAACACA-5’ was found in three intergenic junctions. This is the first complete genome sequence of a cytorhabdovirus infecting papaya. The virus was prevalent in commercial plantings of Los Ríos, the most important papaya producing province of Ecuador. Recently, the genome sequence of bean-associated cytorhabdovirus was reported. The genome is 97% identical to that of papaya virus E, indicating that both should be considered strains of the same virus."
https://openalex.org/W2949658301,"Background Online health information, if evidence-based and unbiased, can improve patients’ and caregivers’ health knowledge and assist them in disease management and health care decision-making. Objective To identify standards for the development of health information resources on the internet for patients. Methods We searched in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for publications describing evaluation instruments for websites providing health information. Eligible instruments were identified by three independent reviewers and disagreements resolved by consensus. Items reported were extracted and categorized into seven domains (accuracy, completeness and comprehensiveness, technical elements, design and aesthetics, usability, accessibility, and readability) that were previously thought to be a minimum requirement for websites. Results One hundred eleven articles met inclusion criteria, reporting 92 evaluation instruments (1609 items). We found 74 unique items that we grouped into the seven domains. For the accuracy domain, one item evaluated information provided in concordance with current guidelines. For completeness and comprehensiveness, 18 items described the disease with respect to various topics such as etiology or therapy, among others. For technical elements, 27 items evaluated disclosure of authorship, sponsorship, affiliation, editorial process, feedback process, privacy, and data protection. For design and aesthetics, 10 items evaluated consistent layout and relevant graphics and images. For usability, 10 items evaluated ease of navigation and functionality of internal search engines. For accessibility, five items evaluated the availability of websites to people with audiovisual disabilities. For readability, three items evaluated conversational writing style and use of a readability tool to determine the reading level of the text. Conclusion We identified standards for the development of online patient health information. This proposed instrument can serve as a guideline to develop and improve how health information is presented on the internet."
https://openalex.org/W2950038291,"Purpose To compare the effectiveness of octreotide/everolimus vs. sunitinib for the systemic treatment of recurrent aggressive meningiomas. Methods 31 patients with recurrent or refractory WHO II or WHO III meningiomas were examined in two reference centers in Colombia. Patients who had systemic treatment (sunitinib, everolimus/octreotide) and a complete follow-up were included. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicities were evaluated. Additionally, tissue samples were examined for PDGFRβ and VEGFR2, their expression was correlated with outcomes. Results Twenty-two patients (72%) were female with a median age of 55 years (SD±15.3). The most prevalent histology was anaplastic meningioma in 20 patients (65%) with 48% of patients suffering from three previous relapses before the start of systemic treatment. A total of 14 patients received combination therapy with octreotide/everolimus, 11 received sunitinib and the remaining 6 received other second-line agents. Median OS was 37.3 months (95%CI 28.5–42.1) and the PFS during the treatment with everolimus/octreotide (EO) and sunitinib (Su) was 12.1 months (95%CI 9.2–21.1) and 9.1 months (95%CI 6.8–16.8); p = 0.43), respectively. The OS of the group treated with the EO→Su→Bev sequence (1st/2nd/3rd line) was 6.5 months longer than the Su→EO→Bev sequence (36.0 vs. 29.5 months) (p = 0.0001). When analyzing molecular markers, the positive PDGFRβ and negative VEGFR2 expression were associated with longer survival both in OS and PFS. Conclusion Sunitinib and octreotide/everolimus have similar efficacy and safety in the systemic management of refractory meningioma. VEGFR2 and PDGFRβ expression are associated with better outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2952337070,"A large proportion of Depression Disorder patients do not receive an effective diagnosis, which makes it necessary to find a more objective assessment to facilitate a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of depression. Speech data is easy to acquire clinically, its association with depression has been studied, although the actual predictive effect of voice features has not been examined. Thus, we do not have a general understanding of the extent to which voice features contribute to the identification of depression. In this study, we investigated the significance of the association between voice features and depression using binary logistic regression, and the actual classification effect of voice features on depression was re-examined through classification modeling. Nearly 1000 Chinese females participated in this study. Several different datasets was included as test set. We found that 4 voice features (PC1, PC6, PC17, PC24, P<0.05, corrected) made significant contribution to depression, and that the contribution effect of the voice features alone reached 35.65% (Nagelkerke's R2). In classification modeling, voice data based model has consistently higher predicting accuracy(F-measure) than the baseline model of demographic data when tested on different datasets, even across different emotion context. F-measure of voice features alone reached 81%, consistent with existing data. These results demonstrate that voice features are effective in predicting depression and indicate that more sophisticated models based on voice features can be built to help in clinical diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2951100256,"Vaccine hesitancy is one of the contributors to low vaccination coverage in both developed and developing countries. Sudan is one of the countries that suffers from low measles vaccine coverage and from measles outbreaks. In order to facilitate the future development of interventions, this study aimed at exploring the opinions of Expanded Program on Immunization officers at ministries of health, WHO, UNICEF and vaccine care providers at Khartoum-based primary healthcare centers.Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews during the period January-March 2018. Data (i.e. quotes) were matched to the categories and the sub-categories of a framework that was developed by the WHO-SAGE Working Group called ''Determinants of Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix''.The interviews were conducted with 14 participants. The majority of participants confirmed the existence of measles vaccine hesitancy in Khartoum state. They further identified various determinants that were grouped into three domains including contextual, groups and vaccination influences. The main contextual determinant as reported is the presence of people who can be qualified as ""anti-vaccination"". They mostly belong to particular religious and ethnic groups. Parents' beliefs about prevention and treatment from measles are the main determinants of the group influences. Attitude of the vaccine providers, measles vaccine schedule and its mode of delivery were the main vaccine related determinants.Measles vaccine hesitancy in Sudan appears complex and highly specific to local circumstances. To better understand the magnitude and the context-specific causes of measles vaccine hesitancy and to develop adapted strategies to address them, there is clearly a further need to investigate measles vaccine hesitancy among parents."
https://openalex.org/W2951737865,"Yeast species that colonize the surface of grape berries at harvest time play an important role during the winemaking process. In this study, the use of culturable microbial techniques permitted a quantitative and qualitative inventory of the different yeast species present on the grape berry surfaces of Montepulciano and Verdicchio varieties when treated with conventional and organic fungicides. The results show that the most widespread yeast species at harvest time were Aureobasidium pullulans and Hanseniaspora uvarum, which are considered normal resident species and independent of the grape varieties and treatments applied. Specific differences when comparing the grape varieties were observed in species and were detected at a lower frequency; Pichia spp. were prevalent in Verdicchio, whereas Lachancea thermotolerans and Zygoascus meyerae were found in Montepulciano. In both vineyards, the farming treatments improved the competitiveness of A. pullulans, which was probably due to its reduced susceptibility to treatments that improved the competition toward other fungi. In contrast, the fermenting yeast H. uvarum was negatively affected by fungicide treatments and showed a reduced presence if compared with untreated grapes. Organic treatments directly impacted the occurrence of Issachenkia terricola in Montepulciano grapes and Debaryomyces hansenii and Pichia membranifaciens in Verdicchio. Conversely, a negative effect of organic treatments was found toward Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Starmerella bacillaris. Overall, the data suggest that the yeast community colonizing the grape berry surface was influenced by both grape variety and farming treatments, which characterized the yeast biota of spontaneous must fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W2951933160,"Aims Myocardial infarction induces myocardial injury and tissue damage. During myocardial infarction strong cellular response is initiated to salvage the damaged tissues. This response is associated with the induction of different signaling pathways. Of these, the canonical Wnt signaling is increasingly important for its prosurvival cellular role, making it a good candidate for the search of new molecular targets to develop therapies to prevent heart failure in infarcted patients. Methods Herein we report that GSK3β regulates the canonical Wnt signaling in C57Bl6 mice hearts. GSK3β is a canonical Wnt pathway inhibitor. Using GSK3β inhibitors and inducing myocardial injury (MI) in Lrp5-/- mice model we show that GSK3β phosphorylation levels regulate downstream canonical Wnt pathway genes in the ischemic heart. In the setting of MI, myocardial damage assessment usually correlates with functional and clinical outcomes. Therefore, we measured myocardial injury size in Wt and Lrp5-/- mice in the presence and absence of two different GSK3 inhibitors prior to MI. Myocardial injury was independent of GSK3 inhibitor treatments and GSK3β expression levels. Results These studies support a central role for GSK3β in the activation of the canonical Wnt pathway in the Wt heart. Although LRP5 is protective against myocardial injury, GSK3β expression levels do not regulate heart damage."

https://openalex.org/W2951789062,"Background Restrictive practices on alcohol sales in entertainment districts have been introduced to reduce alcohol-related violence in youth. On 1st July 2016, the Queensland State Government (Australia) imposed a 2-hour reduction in trading hours for alcohol sales in venues within specific night-time entertainment districts (NEDS; from 5am to 3am), a reduction in maximum trading hours for venues outside NEDs (with a maximum 2am closing time), the banning of ‘rapid intoxication drinks’ (e.g. shots) after 12am, and no new approvals for trading hours beyond 10pm for the sale of takeaway alcohol. No independent study has evaluated general levels of intoxication, crowd numbers, fear of violence, and illicit substance use as people enter and exit NEDS, both before and after the introduction of restrictive legislation. Further, no study has assessed the impact using matched times of the year in a controlled study and also assessed actual assault rates as recorded by the police. Method We conducted 3 studies–randomly breath-testing patrons for alcohol, as they entered and exited NEDs. Study 1 assessed patrons’ (n = 807) breath approximated blood alcohol concentration (BrAC) and predictions of how the legislation would change their drinking habits before the legislation was enacted. Study 2 assessed crime statistics and patrons’ BrAC levels and drug taking reports on an equivalent night, one year apart–before (n = 497) and after (n = 406) the new legislation. Study 3 was a test of the generalisation of Study 2 with two months of survey and BrAC data collected as people entered and exited the NEDs over two consecutive years before (n = 652 and n = 155) and one year after (n = 460) the new legislation. In Study 3 we also collected crime statistics and data on people leaving the entertainment district one year before (n = 502) and one year after (n = 514) the legislative change. Findings People predicted that the legislation would lead to them drinking more alcohol before they entered town or make little change to their drinking habits. Baseline data over the 2 years before the legislation (Study 3) demonstrated stable preloading rates and BrAC at entry to the NEDs. However, after the introduction of the legislation patrons entered the NEDs systematically later and increased their alcohol preloading. People were substantially more inebriated as they entered the NEDs after the legislative change, with approximately 50% fewer people not preloading after the new laws. Exit BrAC was less consistent but showed some evidence of an increase. Crime statistics and patrons’ self-reported experiences of violence did not change. Interpretation Legislation that does not specifically adapt to the cultural shift of preloading and take local conditions into account will be unsuccessful in reducing alcohol consumption. Such legislation is unlikely to meaningfully change assault rates in youth."
https://openalex.org/W2952479508,"Introduction Knowledge of species richness patterns and their relation with climate is required to develop various forest management actions including habitat management, biodiversity and risk assessment, restoration and ecosystem modelling. In practice, the pattern of the data might not be spatially constant and cannot be well addressed by ordinary least square (OLS) regression. This study uses GWR to deal with spatial non-stationarity and to identify the spatial correlation between the plant richness distribution and the climate variables (i.e., the temperature and precipitation) in a 1° grid in different biogeographic zones of India. Methodology We utilized the species richness data collected using 0.04 ha nested quadrats in an Indian study. The data from this national study, titled ‘Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level’, were aggregated at the 1° grid level and adjudged for sampling sufficiency. The performances of OLS and GWR models were compared in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). Results and discussion A comparative study of the R2 and AICc values of the models showed that all the GWR models performed better compared with the analogous OLS models. The climate variables were found to significantly influence the distribution of plant richness in India. The minimum precipitation (Pmin) consistently dominated individually (R2 = 0.69; AICc = 2608) and in combinations. Among the shared models, the one with a combination of Pmin and Tmin had the best model fits (R2 = 0.72 and AICc = 2619), and variation partitioning revealed that the influence of these parameters on the species richness distribution was dominant in the arid and the semi-arid zones and in the Deccan peninsula zone. Conclusion The shift in climate variables and their power to explain the species richness of biogeographic zones suggests that the climate–diversity relationships of plants species vary spatially. In particular, the dominant influence of Tmin and Pmin could be closely linked to the climate tolerance hypothesis (CTH). We found that the climate variables had a significant influence in defining species richness patterns in India; however, various other environmental and non-environmental (edaphic, topographic and anthropogenic) variables need to be integrated in the models to understand climate–species richness relationships better at a finer scale."
https://openalex.org/W2949117182,"Background Adopting a healthy lifestyle is associated with prolonged life expectancy. The main modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors are hazardous alcohol drinking, smoking, excess body weight and lack of physical activity. Our aim was to estimate the impact of unfavourable lifestyle factors on abnormalities in laboratory tests reflecting liver status, inflammation and lipid metabolism in a population-based cross-sectional study. Methods The study included 22,273 participants (10,561 men, 11,712 women) aged 25–74 years from the National FINRISK Study. Data on alcohol use, smoking, body weight, and physical activity were recorded from structured interviews. The risk scores for the various life style factors were established on a 0–8 scale and used to stratify the population in classes to allow estimates of their joint effects. Serum liver enzymes (GGT, ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipid profiles were measured using standard laboratory techniques. Results Consistent dose-response relationships were observed between the number of unfavourable risk factors and serum levels of GGT, ALT, CRP, cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides (p < 0.0005 for linear trend in all comparisons). When compared with those with zero risk factors, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for abnormalities in all biomarkers were significantly higher in those with a sum of risk score two or more. The most striking increases in ORs in the group with the highest numbers of risk factors were observed among men in serum GGT: 26.6 (12.4–57.0), ALT: 40.3 (5.3–307.8), CRP: 16.2 (7.8–33.7) and serum triglycerides: 14.4 (8.6–24.0). Conclusions The data support the view that the presence of unfavourable life style risk factors is associated with distinct abnormalities in laboratory tests for liver function, inflammation and lipid status. Such biomarkers may prove to be of value in the assessment of interventions aimed at reducing unfavourable risk factors and in helping individuals in long-term maintenance of lifestyle modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2952955095,"Pain is a highly complex and individualized experience with biopsychosocial components. Neuroimaging research has shown evidence of the involvement of the central nervous system in the development and maintenance of chronic pain conditions, including urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS). Furthermore, a history of early adverse life events (EALs) has been shown to adversely impact symptoms throughout childhood and into adulthood. However, to date, the role of EAL’s in the central processes of chronic pain have not been adequately investigated. We studied 85 patients (56 females) with UCPPS along with 86 healthy controls (HCs) who had resting-state magnetic resonance imaging scans (59 females), and data on EALs as a part of the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network Study. We used graph theory methods in order to investigate the impact of EALs on measures of centrality, which characterize information flow, communication, influence, and integration in a priori selected regions of interest. Patients with UCPPS exhibited lower centrality in the right anterior insula compared to HCs, a key node in the salience network. Males with UCPPS exhibited lower centrality in the right anterior insula compared the HC males. Females with UCPPS exhibited greater centrality in the right caudate nucleus and left angular gyrus compared to HC females. Males with UCPPS exhibited lower centrality in the left posterior cingulate, angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and superior temporal sulcus, but greater centrality in the precuneus and anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) compared to females with UCPPS. Higher reports of EALs was associated with greater centrality in the left precuneus and left aMCC in females with UCPPS. This study provides evidence for disease and sex-related alterations in the default mode, salience, and basal ganglia networks in patients with UCPPS, which are moderated by EALs, and associated with clinical symptoms and quality of life (QoL)."

Children were screened for anemia and followed until 12 months after discharge. The primary outcome measured was mortality. Predictors of mortality were determined using Cox regression analysis.Of the 505 children, 90 (17.8%) had very severe anemia and 415 (82.1%) did not. Mortality was higher for children with very severe anemia compared to children without over a one year period from admission, 27/90 (30.0%) vs. 59/415 (14.2%) respectively (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.42, 95% Cl 1.53-3.83). In-hospital mortality was 11/90 (12.2%) and post-hospital mortality was 16/79 (20.2%) for children with very severe anemia. The strongest predictors of mortality were age (HR 1.01, 95% Cl 1.00-1.03) and decreased urine output (HR 4.30, 95% Cl 1.04-17.7).Children up to 12 years of age with very severe anemia have nearly a 30% chance of mortality following admission over a one year period, with over 50% of mortality occurring after discharge. Post-hospital interventions are urgently needed to reduce mortality in children with very severe anemia, and should include older children."
https://openalex.org/W2952496007,"Most women with breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are diagnosed with late-staged disease. The current study assesses patient-related barriers among women from a general SSA population to better understand how patient-related barriers contribute to diagnostic delays. Using convenience-based sampling, 401 Ugandan women without breast cancer were surveyed to determine how prior participation in cancer detection practices correlate with patient-related barriers to prompt diagnosis. In a predominantly poor (76%) and rural population (75%), the median age of the participants was 38. Of the women surveyed, 155 (46%) had prior exposure to breast cancer education, 92 (27%) performed breast self-examination (BSE) and 68 (20%) had undergone a recent clinical breast examination (CBE), breast ultrasound or breast biopsy. The most commonly identified barriers to prompt diagnosis were knowledge deficits regarding early diagnosis (79%), economic barriers to accessing care (68%), fear (37%) and poor social support (24%). However, only women who reported knowledge deficits—a modifiable barrier—were less likely to participate in cancer detection practices (p<0.05). Women in urban and rural areas were similarly likely to report economic barriers, knowledge deficits and/or poor social support, but rural women were less likely than urban women to have received breast cancer education and/or perform BSE (p<0.001). Women who have had prior breast cancer education (p<0.001) and/or who perform BSE (p = 0.02) were more likely to know where she can go to receive a diagnostic breast evaluation. These findings suggest that SSA countries developing early breast cancer detection programs should specifically address modifiable knowledge deficits among women less likely to achieve a diagnostic work-up to reduce diagnostic delays and improve breast cancer outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2951504616,"Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and their enormous potential and versatility have provided us with an astounding insight in the complexity of bacterial transcriptomes. sRNAs have been shown to be involved in a variety of cellular processes that range from stress to general metabolism. Here we report that the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator ArgR is immediately followed by the gene of the small regulatory RNA ArgX. The latter is transcribed from its own promoter. The production of ArgX is induced by increasing arginine concentrations and repressed by CcpA. Previously, ArgR was shown to act as a transcriptional repressor of the catabolic arginine deiminase pathway (arc operon) by binding in the promoter region of arcA. Here we demonstrate that ArgX downregulates arc mRNA levels. Furthermore, ArgX putatively blocks the translation of one of the genes in the operon, arcC1, a process that would redirect an intermediate in arginine degradation, carbamoyl phosphate, towards pyrimidine synthesis. Our findings exemplify, for the first time, the combinatorial power of a transcription factor and a small regulatory RNA derived from the 3'-UTR region. The regulators ArgR and ArgX share a common target, but act on transcription and on RNA level, respectively."

Moreover, we show that this optimal diffusion disappears for loose spatial constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2952981858,"The normal aging of the extracellular matrix and collagen content of the human lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) remains relatively unknown despite vast amounts of basic science research, partly because of the use of inadequate surrogates for a truly normal, human IVD. Our objective in this study was to describe and compare the morphology and ultrastructure of lumbar IVDs in 2 groups of young (G1-<35 years) and elderly (G2->65 years). Thirty L4-5 and L5-S1 discs per group were obtained during autopsies of presumably-asymptomatic individuals and analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a morphological grading scale, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for collagen types I, II, III, IV, V, VI, IX and X. As expected, a mild to moderate degree of degeneration was present in G1 discs and significantly more advanced in G2. The extracellular matrix of G2 discs was significantly more compact with an increase of cartilaginous features such as large chondrocyte clusters. Elastic fibers were abundant in G1 specimens and their presence correlated more with age than with degeneration grade, being very rare in G2. SEM demonstrated persistence of basic structural characteristics such as denser lamellae with Sharpey-type insertions into the endplates despite advanced age or degeneration grades. Immunohistochemistry revealed type II collagen to be the most abundant type followed by collagen IV. All collagen types were detected in every disc sector except for type X collagen. Statistical analysis demonstrated a general decrease in collagen expression from G1 to G2 with an annular- and another nuclear-specific pattern. These results suggest modifications of IVD morphology do not differ between the anterior or posterior annulus but are more advanced or happen earlier in the posterior areas of the disc. This study finally describes the process of extracellular matrix modification during disc degeneration in an unselected, general population and demonstrates it is similar to the same process in the cervical spine as published previously."
https://openalex.org/W2951623162,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of Poly-gamma-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) and the immunologic changes in patients with CIN 1. Methods Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups and orally treated with placebo or 1,500 mg of γ-PGA for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was histologic regression rate of CIN 1 at 12 weeks between γ-PGA and control groups. The secondary endpoints were HPV clearance and change in immune responses. Result From April 2013 to December 2015, 195 patients participated in the study. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 42 (42.4%) of the women who received γ-PGA experienced histologic remission versus 26 (27.1%) in the control group, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.018). In the γ-PGA group, HPV clearance was found in 37 (43.5%) of 85 patients infected with high-risk HPV, showing a significant difference compared to the control group, in which 20 (26.7%) of 75 patients exhibited HPV clearance (p = 0.026). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the change of NK cell activity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II CD8 count, and CD56 count. Conclusion γ-PGA showed a short-term therapeutic effect on CIN 1 and high-risk HPV infection. It is a non-invasive, promising oral medication for women with these conditions.

Here we describe a novel function of a protein known as Transmembrane 219 (TM219) as an autophagy activator. TM219 is a small membrane protein expressed in all known human tissues except the thymus. We used biochemical approaches to identify calmodulin and calmodulin dependent protein kinase II as a part of TM219 protein complex. Then, we employed in vitro reconstitution system and fluorescence anisotropy to study the requirements of TM219 to bind calmodulin in vitro. We also used this system to study the effects of a synthetic peptide derived from the sequence of the short cytoplasmic tail of TM219 (SCTT) on calmodulin-TM219 receptor interactions. We conjugated SCTT peptide with a pH Low Insertion peptide (pHLIP) for optimal cellular delivery. We finally tested the effects of SCTT-pHLIP on triple negative human breast cancer cells in three dimension culture. Our data defined a novel function of TM219 protein and an efficient approach to inhibit it."
https://openalex.org/W2951506996,"Experiments on infections caused by trypanosomes are widely performed in Swiss white mice through various inoculation routes. To better understand the effect of route of trypanosome inoculation on disease outcomes in this model, we characterised the virulence of two isolates, Trypanosoma brucei KETRI 2710 and T. congolense KETRI 2765 in Swiss white mice. For each of the isolates, five routes of parasite inoculation, namely intraperitoneal (IP), subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM) intradermal (ID) and intravenous (IV) were compared using groups (n = 6) of mice, with each mouse receiving 1x104 trypanosomes. We subsequently assessed impact of the routes on disease indices that included pre-patent period (PP), parasitaemia levels, Packed Cell Volume (PCV), bodyweight changes and survival time. Pre-patent period for IP inoculated mice was a mean ± SE of 3.8 ± 0.2 and 6.5 ± 0.0 for the T brucei and T. congolense isolates respectively; the PP for mice groups inoculated using other routes were not significantly different(p> 0.05) irrespective of route of inoculation and species of trypanosomes. With ID and IP routes, parasitaemia was significantly higher in T. brucei and significantly lower in T. congolense infected mice and the progression to peak parasitaemia routes showed no significant different between the routes of either species of trypanosome. The IM and ID routes in T. congolense inoculations, and IP and IV in T. b. brucei induced the fastest and slowest parasitaemia progressions respectively. There were significant differences in rates of reduction of PCV with time post infection in mice infected by the two species and which was more pronounced in sc and ip injected mice. No significant differences in mice body weight changes and survivorship was observed between the routes of inoculation. Inoculation route therefore appears to be a critical determinant of pathogenicity of Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei brucei in murine mouse model of African trypanosomiasis."

https://openalex.org/W2951709837,"Follicular fluid (FF) is a liquid that surrounds the ovum. Its metabolite and, specifically, its lipid content have been associated with oocyte development. To characterize possible association between the lipid composition of FF and the outcome of pregnancy, we carried out a lipidomics study and compared the abundance of lipids from FF of patients with positive and negative outcomes. We found a differential lipid network wiring in positive-outcome FF, with a significant decrease (∼2 fold; P < 0.001) in triacylglycerol levels and higher accumulation (10-50%; P < 0.001) of membrane lipids groups (phospholipids and sphingolipids). In addition to this major metabolic alteration, other lipid groups such as cholesteryl esters showed lower levels in positive-outcome patients, whereas derivatives of vitamin D were highly accumulated in positive-outcome FF, supporting previous studies that associate vitamin D levels in FF to pregnancy outcome. Our data also point to specific lipid species with a differential accumulation pattern in positive-outcome FF that predicted pregnancy in a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Altogether, our results suggest that FF lipid network is associated with the oocyte development, with possible implications in diagnostics and treatment.-Shehadeh, A., Bruck-Haimson, R., Saidemberg, D., Zacharia.

https://openalex.org/W2952035798,"The vascular system of monocotyledons, including Commelinaceae, has been studied since the 19th century, but to date, the proposed vascular architecture models consist of schematic representations partially based on the authors' interpretation. One of the greatest difficulties in studying these systems is the large number of vascular bundles and the complexity of their connections, especially in the monocotyledons which have a nodal vascular plexus. In this study, shoot apex samples of 14 species of Commelinaceae were submitted to three-dimensional analyses (confocal microscopy, X-ray microtomography, graphic vectorization, and whole-mount diaphanization), as well as conventional techniques in plant anatomy. Based on the results, a previously unreported category of bundles is described in Commelinaceae for the first time, as well as the fact that peripheral bundles are not interrupted or end blindly in the periphery of the pith, as previously thought. With this new interpretation of the vascular architecture, three patterns of nodal vascular plexus are proposed: 1) in the first pattern the internal nodal vascular plexus (IVP) forms a continuous cylinder and does not connect to the external nodal vascular plexus (EVP); 2) the IVP forms a cylinder divided into two columns and does not connect to the EVP and 3) the IVP forms a cylinder connected to the EVP. The first description of central bundles in the Commelinaceae might suggests their existence in closely related groups, such as the remaining four families of Commelinales (i.e., Haemodoraceae, Hanguanaceae, Philydraceae, and Pontederiaceae), and even in other distantly related groups of monocotyledons."

This study is an application of the VOI methodology to the problem of choosing between home telemonitoring and nurse telephone support over usual care in chronic heart failure management in the Netherlands. Methods The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the expected value of partially perfect information (EVPPI) analyses were based on an informal threshold of €20K per quality-adjusted life-year. These VOI-analyses were applied to a probabilistic Markov model comparing the 20-year costs and effects in three interventions. The EVPPI explored the value of decision uncertainty caused by the following group of parameters: treatment-specific transition probabilities between New York Heart Association (NYHA) defined disease states, utilities associated with the disease states, number of hospitalizations and ER visits, health state specific costs, and the distribution of patients per NYHA group. We performed the analysis for two population sizes in the Netherlands—patients in all NYHA classes of severity, and patients in NYHA IV class only. Results The population EVPI for an effective population of 2,841,567 CHF patients in All NYHA classes of severity over the next 20 years is more than €4.5B, implying that further research is highly cost-effective. In the NYHA IV only analysis, for the effective population of 208,003 patients over next 20 years, the population EVPI at the same informal threshold is approx. €590M. The EVPPI analysis showed that the only relevant group of parameters that contribute to the overall decision uncertainty are transition probabilities, in both All NYHA and NYHA IV analyses. Conclusions Results of our VOI exercise show that the cost of uncertainty regarding the decision on reimbursement of telehealth interventions for chronic heart failure patients is high in the Netherlands, and that future research is needed, mainly on the transition probabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2950760651,"Seven hospitals participated in the Dutch national surveillance for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and its risk factors. We analysed time-independent and time-dependent risk factors for VAP using the standard Cox regression and the flexible Weighted Cumulative Effects method (WCE) that evaluates both current and past exposures. The prospective surveillance of intensive care patients aged ≥16 years and ventilated ≥48 hours resulted in the inclusion of 940 primary ventilation periods, comprising 7872 ventilation days. The average VAP incidence density was 10.3/1000 ventilation days. Independent risk factors were age (16–40 years at increased risk: HR 2.42 95% confidence interval 1.07–5.50), COPD (HR 0.19 [0.04–0.78]), current sedation score (higher scores at increased risk), current selective oropharyngeal decontamination (HR 0.19 [0.04–0.91]), jet nebulizer (WCE, decreased risk), intravenous antibiotics for selective decontamination of the digestive tract (ivSDD, WCE, decreased risk), and intravenous antibiotics not for SDD (WCE, decreased risk). The protective effect of ivSDD was afforded for 24 days with a delay of 3 days. For some time-dependent variables, the WCE model was preferable over standard Cox proportional hazard regression. The WCE method can furthermore increase insight into the active time frame and possible delay herein of a time-dependent risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W2949949636,"Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. Although predominately asymptomatic, the disease spectrum of trichomoniasis in women is characterized primarily by signs and symptoms of vaginitis, including purulent discharge and localized vulvar pruritus and erythema. Several FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are available for the diagnosis of T. vaginalis infections, but laboratory developed tests (LDTs) are widely utilized and cost-effective solutions in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings. LDT diagnosis of T. vaginalis is particularly appealing since it can be performed using remnant specimens collected for other STI testing. Using a LDT implemented as part of this study, T. vaginalis was detected in 7% of participating Louisiana women (14/199). The mean T. vaginalis organism burden was 1.0x106 ± 4.5x105 organisms per mL of ThinPrep PreservCyt. Using DNA eluates obtained after HPV testing on the cobas 4800 system, the T. vaginalis LDT was characterized by excellent intra- and interassay reproducibility (coefficient of variation values all <3.5%). Compared with two commercially available NAATs from TIB MOLBIOL, the sensitivity and specificity of the LDT was 92.9 and 99.5%, respectively. Collectively, this study details the diagnostic and quantitative utility of a LDT for T. vaginalis. When applied in the clinical research setting, we confirmed the high prevalence of T. vaginalis, but also observed extraordinarily high organism burdens in the cervix. These findings highlight the unique host-pathogen relationship of T. vaginalis with lower reproductive tract tissues, and substantiate the need for continued investigation of this highly prevalent STI."
https://openalex.org/W2950542606,"Background Due to increasing antimicrobial resistance in low-resource settings, strategies to rationalize antibiotic treatment of children unlikely to have a bacterial infection are needed. This study’s objective was to utilize a database of placebo treated Malawian children with World Health Organization (WHO) fast breathing pneumonia to develop a prognostic risk score that could aid antibiotic decision making. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of children randomized to the placebo group of the Innovative Treatments in Pneumonia (ITIP) fast breathing randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial. Participants were low-risk HIV-uninfected children 2–59 months old with WHO fast breathing pneumonia in Lilongwe, Malawi. Study endpoints were treatment failure, defined as either disease progression at any time on or before Day 4 of treatment or disease persistence on Day 4, or relapse, considered as the recurrence of pneumonia or severe disease among previously cured children between Days 5 and 14. We utilized multivariable linear regression and stepwise model selection to develop a model to predict the probability of treatment failure or relapse. Results Treatment failure or relapse occurred in 11.5% (61/526) of children included in this analysis. The final model incorporated the following predictors: heart rate terms, mid-upper arm circumference, malaria status, water source, family income, and whether or not a sibling or other child in the household received childcare outside the home. The model’s area under the receiver operating characteristic score was 0.712 (95% confidence interval 0.66, 0.78) and it explained 6.1% of the variability in predicting treatment failure or relapse (R2, 0.061). For the model to categorize all children with treatment failure or relapse correctly, 77% of children without treatment failure or relapse would require antibiotics. Conclusion The model had inadequate discrimination to be appropriate for clinical application. Different strategies will likely be required for models to perform accurately among similar pediatric populations."
https://openalex.org/W2952057403,"Montane plant communities throughout the world have responded to changes in temperature regimes by shifting ranges upward in elevation, and made downslope movements to track shifts in climatic water balance. Organisms that cannot disperse or adapt biologically to projected climate scenarios in situ may decrease in distributional range and abundance over time. Restoration strategies will need to incorporate the habitat suitability of future predicted conditions to ensure long-term persistence. We propagated seedlings of three native Hawaiian montane plant species from high- (~2,500 m asl) and low-elevation (~1,900 m asl) sources, planted them in 8 common plots along a 500 m elevation gradient, and monitored microclimate at each plot for 20 weeks. We explored how temperature and precipitation influenced survival and growth differently among high- and low-elevation origin seedlings. Significantly more seedlings of only one species, Dodonaea viscosa, from high-elevation origin (75.2%) survived than seedlings from low-elevation origin (58.7%) across the entire elevation gradient. Origin also influenced survival in generalized linear mixed models that controlled for temperature, precipitation, and elevation in D. viscosa and Chenopodium oahuense. Survival increased with elevation and soil moisture for Sophora chrysophylla, while it decreased for the other two species. Responses to microclimate varied between the three montane plant species; there were no common patterns of growth or survival. Although limited in temporal scope, our experiment represents one of the few attempts to examine local adaptation to prospective climate scenarios and addresses challenges to restoration efforts within species’ current ranges."
https://openalex.org/W2950455842,"Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is limited in its ability to detect diffuse interstitial fibrosis, which is commonly found in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). On the other hand, Washout rate (WR) by cardiac 123I- metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy which evaluates cardiac sympathetic nervous function, is a useful tool for predicting the prognosis in DCM. We investigated the predictive value of the combination of two different types of examinations, LGE on CMR and WR by 123I-MIBG scintigraphy for outcomes in DCM compared with LGE alone. One-hundred forty-eight DCM patients underwent CMR and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the presence or absence of LGE and WR cut-off value of 45% for predicting prognosis based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Cardiac deaths, re-hospitalization for heart failure, implantation of a left ventricular assist device, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias were defined as clinical events. Forty-two DCM patients reached the clinical events during the median follow-up for 9.1 years (interquartile range, 8.0–9.2 years).Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified WR≥45%+LGE positive group as an independent predictor of cardiac events (HR 3.18, 95%CI 1.36–7.45, p = 0.008). Notably, there was no significance in the cardiac event-free survival rate between the WR<45%+LGE positive and WR≥45%+LGE negative groups (p = 0.89). The combination of WR by 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and LGE on CMR, which evaluate different type of cardiac deterioration, serves as a stronger predictor of long-term outcomes in DCM patients than LGE alone."
https://openalex.org/W2950549168,"Purpose To learn whether reported associations between major psychosocial stressors and lung cancer are independent of smoking history. Methods Subjects were at least 25 years old and without lung cancer at enrollment in the United States Census Bureau's National Longitudinal Mortality Survey in 1995-2008. Follow-up via Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results and National Death Index continued until lung cancer diagnosis, death, or December 2011. Involuntary unemployment, widowhood, and divorce, stratified by sex, were tested for association with subsequent lung cancer using proportional hazards regression for competing risks. Smoking status, years smoked, cigarettes per day, and years since quitting were imputed when missing. Results At enrollment, subjects (n = 100,733, 47.4% male, age 49.1(±15.8) years) included 17.6% current smokers, 23.5% former smokers. Of men and women, respectively, 11.3% and 15.0% were divorced/separated, 2.9% and 11.8% were widowed, and 2.9% and 2.3% were involuntarily unemployed. Ultimately, 667 subjects developed lung cancer; another 10,071 died without lung cancer. Adjusted for age, education, and ancestry, lung cancer was associated with unemployment, widowhood, and divorce/separation in men but not women. Further adjusted for years smoked, cigarettes per day, and years since quitting, none of these associations was significant in either sex. Conclusions Once smoking is accounted for, psychosocial stressors in adulthood do not independently promote lung cancer. Given their increased smoking behavior, persons experiencing stressors should be referred to effective alternatives to smoking and to support for smoking cessation."
