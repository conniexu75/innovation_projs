https://openalex.org/W2031468048,Monoclonal antibodies specific for 5-bromodeoxyuridine have been produced and applied in detecting low levels of DNA replication on a cell-by-cell basis in vitro. The immunoglobulin-producing hybridomas were derived from spleen cells of mice immunized with a conjugate of iodouridine and ovalbumin. The cells were fused with the plasmacytoma line SP2/0Ag14. The antibodies produced are highly specific for bromodeoxyuridine and iododeoxyuridine and do not cross-react with thymidine. DNA synthesis in cultured cells exposed to bromodeoxyuridine for as short a time as 6 minutes can be detected easily and rapidly by an immunofluorescent staining method and quantitated by flow cytometry.
https://openalex.org/W2050273631,"The differentiated phenotype of rabbit articular chondrocytes consists primarily of type II collagen and cartilage-specific proteoglycan. During serial monolayer culture this phenotype is lost and replaced by a complex collagen phenotype consisting predominately of type I collagen and a low level of proteoglycan synthesis. Such dedifferentiated chondrocytes reexpress the differentiated phenotype during suspension culture in firm gels of 0.5% low Tm agarose. Approximately 80% of the cells survive this transition from the flattened morphology of anchorage-dependent culture to the spherical morphology of anchorage-independent culture and then deposit characteristic proteoglycan matrix domains. The rates of proteoglycan and collagen synthesis return to those of primary chondrocytes. Using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of intact collagen chains and two-dimensional cyanogen bromide peptide mapping, we demonstrated a complete return to the differentiated collagen phenotype. These results emphasize the primary role of cell shape in the modulation of the chondrocyte phenotype and demonstrate a reversible system for the study of gene expression."

This perception of biological motion has been hypothesized to be an intrinsic capacity of the visual system. The results of this experiment, which demonstrate that infants 4 to 6 months of age exhibit a preference for biological motion patterns, support that hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982363639,"Exogenous thrombin produced a biphasic response (a potent dose-related vasodilatation followed by vasoconstriction) in nonischemic canine coronary arteries. The vasodilatation was not blocked by propranolol, atropine, or indomethacin, but was completely blocked by heparin or denudation of the intimal endothelial cells. A similar loss of vasodilating response to thrombin occurred in ischemic coronary arteries with a concomitant enhancement of vasoconstriction. This study indicates that altered responses to thrombin in coronary arteries with damaged endothelium may play an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary vasospasm."

These novel catalysts are not proteins, but they may incorporate the typical enzyme catalytic groups and they achieve selectivity in their reactions by use of geometric control, as do enzymes. Catalysts that carry out geometrically controlled chlorinations of aromatic rings and steroids have been constructed. Other catalysts achieve the selective synthesis of amino acids, and still others imitate ribonuclease in detailed mechanism and hydrolyze RNA. Optimization of geometries has led to a rate acceleration of over 10(8) in one instance."
https://openalex.org/W2088818069,"Qualitatively distinct patterns of cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses were observed in male college students during mental work and during sensory intake task performance. During mental work, Type A (coronary-prone) subjects showed greater muscle vasodilatation and more enhanced secretion of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol than Type B subjects. During sensory intake, Type A hyperresponsivity was found for testosterone and, among those subjects with a positive family history of hypertension, for cortisol. As a demonstration of combined cardiovascular, sympathetic nervous system, and neuroendocrine hyperresponsivity to specific cognitive tasks in Type A subjects, this study breaks ground in the search for mechanisms mediating the increased coronary disease risk among Type A persons."

Outer hair cells have higher membrane potentials than do inner hair cells, but they produce smaller a-c receptor potentials. The frequency response characteristics of both types of hair cells are probably not significantly different. In the frequency region where tuning is optimal, both cell types produce depolarizing d-c receptor potentials, but outer hair cells also generate hyperpolarizing responses at low frequencies."

E. (1982) Int. J. Cancer, 29, 269-275) was shown to be directed to a ganglioside with the carbohydrate structure NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 8NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer. The carbohydrate structure, established by enzymatic degradation and methylation analysis with mass spectrometry, is identical with that of brain GD3 ganglioside, but its ceramide is characterized by a predominance of longer chain fatty acids, in contrast to brain GD3 that has mainly C18:0 fatty acid. The antibody did not react with various other gangliosides, including those having the same terminal sugar sequence (NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 8NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal) as GD3, such as GT1a and GQ1b. Its specificity is therefore restricted to the NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 8NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc leads to Cer sequence, including the innermost sugar, Glc residue."

Autoradiography at various times later revealed that regenerating left and right fibers overlapped extensively for up to 4 weeks and subsequently segregated into eye dominance columns by 8 weeks. Continuous tetrodotoxin treatment of both eyes prevented the formation of columns for up to 13 weeks and was equally effective if begun at 6 weeks. When tetrodotoxin treatment was stopped after 11 weeks, columns subsequently formed in the next 3 weeks. Blockade of only one eye did prevent column formation at 8 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W1864119499,"Cell-free extracts from Xenopus laevis oocytes (ovarian tissue), unfertilized eggs, embryos, and cultured kidney cells direct accurate transcription of cloned 5 S RNA and tRNA genes. Fractionation of these extracts by conventional ion exchange chromatography shows that multiple components are essential for the transcription of each of these genes by RNA polymerase III. Two chromatographically distinct fractions from ovary, egg, embryo, and kidney cell extracts are necessary and sufficient, in the presence of purified RNA polymerase III, for the transcription of tRNA genes. Transcription of 5 S RNA genes requires components present in these same fractions as well as the previously described 5 S gene-specific factor (TFIIIA). The analogous chromatographic fractions from different tissue extracts are functionally interchangeable, consistent with the suggestions that the endogenous factors which are necessary and sufficient for purified gene transcription are general (and not tissue-specific) factors."
https://openalex.org/W1491886680,"The denaturation of ribonuclease A, lysozyme alpha-lactalbumin, and myoglobin by urea, guanidine hydrochloride, and guanidine thiocyanate has been followed with the use of difference spectral measurements. The free energy of stabilization (delta GH2OD) has been determined by the linear extrapolation of the free energy of denaturation to zero denaturant concentration. The values of delta GH2OD are 7.3 +/- 0.2, 8.9 +/- 0.1, 4.3 +/- 0.1;, and 7.9 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C for ribonuclease A (pH 7.0), lysozyme (pH 7.0), alpha-lactalbumin (pH 7.0), and myoglobin (pH 6.6), respectively. The dependence of the free energy of denaturation on concentration ranges from 0.88 to 2.08 kcal/mol.M for urea and from 1.27 to 4.22 kcal/mol.M for guanidine hydrochloride for four proteins. The ratio of this dependence in guanidine hydrochloride to that in urea may depend on the polarity of the amino acid residues in the unfolding unit."
https://openalex.org/W2079778485,Estrogen pellets were placed in either the right or left hypothalamus of newborn female rats so that only one side of this brain area was exposed to the postnatal masculinizing and defeminizing effects of the hormone. The effects of estrogen on gonadotropin secretion and reproductive behavior depended on both the region and the side of implantation. Exposure of the left hypothalamus to estrogen resulted in defeminized development. Exposure of the right hypothalamus to estrogen resulted in masculinized development. Thus the response of the developing hypothalamus to gonadal steroids may be asymmetric.

N-2 is a mixture of three isomeric monogalactosyl derivatives of N-3b, and N-1 is a mixture of two isomeric digalactosyl derivatives of N-3b. Most of the galactoses are beta-linked at the C-4 position of beta-N-acetylglucosamine residues 2 and 4 in the N-3b structure shown above. Small amounts of the galactoses are also linked at the C-4 position of beta-N-acetylglucosamine residue 3."
https://openalex.org/W2017935553,"Echolocating bats (Eptesicus fuscus) can perceive changes of as little as 3 degrees of arc in the vertical angles separating pairs of horizontal rods. This acuity depends upon modification of sounds entering the external ear canal by the structures of the external ear. Deflection of the tragus degrades the acuity of vertical-angle perception from 3 degrees to about 12 degrees to 14 degrees. The pinna-tragus structure produces a strong secondary echo of sounds entering the external ear canal, and the delay of this echo after the time when the sound directly enters the ear canal apparently encodes the vertical direction of a sound source."
https://openalex.org/W2091262911,"The [2-14C]deoxyglucose method was used to identify the cerebral areas related to vision in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). This was achieved by comparing glucose utilization in a visually stimulated with that in a visually deafferented hemisphere. The cortical areas related to vision included the entire expanse of striate, prestriate, and inferior temporal cortex as far forward as the temporal pole, the posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule, and the prearcuate and inferior prefrontal cortex. Subcortically, in addition to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and superficial layers of the superior colliculus, the structures related to vision included large parts of the pulvinar, caudate, putamen, claustrum, and amygdala. These results, which are consonant with a model of visual function that postulates an occipito-temporo-prefrontal pathway for object vision and an occipito-parieto-prefrontal pathway for spatial vision, reveal the full extent of those pathways and identify their points of contact with limbic, striatal, and diencephalic structures."

The results resembled those generated from similarity judgments by humans, suggesting cross-task and cross-species generality in processes of letter discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2084945736,"Saturable and stereospecific binding sites for (+)-[3H]amphetamine were demonstrated in membrane preparations from rat brain. The density of these binding sites varies among brain regions and is highest in the hypothalamus and brainstem. Specific (+)-[3H]amphetamine binding in hypothalamus is largely confined to synaptosomal membranes, rapidly reversible, and sensitive to both heat and proteolytic enzymes. Scatchard analysis of the equilibrium binding data revealed two distinct sites with apparent affinity constants of 93 and 300 nanomoles per liter, respectively. The effects of various psychotropic drugs as well as a number of putative neurotransmitters and related agonists and antagonists in displacing specific (+)-[3H]amphetamine binding demonstrate that these binding sites are not associated with any previously described neurotransmitter or drug receptors, but are specific for amphetamine and related phenylethylamine derivatives. Furthermore, the relative affinities of a series of phenylethylamine derivatives for (+)-[3H]amphetamine binding sites in hypothalamic membranes is highly correlated to their potencies as anorexic agents. These results suggest the presence of specific receptor sites in hypothalamus that mediate the anorexic activity of amphetamine and related drugs."

The site of binding of the β-lactam antibiotics penicillin and cephalosporin has been located. These findings constitute direct observation of the interaction of β-lactams with a transpeptidase enzyme and establish the feasibility of defining the molecular stereochemistry of this interaction for purposes of drug design.

Application of this modification to the tetramer triphosphate ppp5'A2'p5'A2'p5'A2'p5'A resulted in an analogue with 10 times the activity of ppp5'A2'p5'A2'p5'A (2-5A trimer triphosphate) as an inhibitor of protein synthesis or activator of the 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease. This activator of the 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease. This new 2-5A analogue, the most potent 2-5A derivative reported to date, inhibited translation in extracts of mouse L-cells programmed with encephalomyocarditis virus RNA at a concentration of 10(-10) M (concentration for half-maximal inhibition). All such N-substituted morpholine modified 2',5'-oligoriboadenylates were found to be extremely resistant to degradation by L-cell extracts under conditions where unmodified 2-5A or its derivatives were quickly destroyed. These data demonstrate the necessity for an intact terminal ribose ring for the action of the 2-5A phosphodiesterase. Thus, extensive chemical modification of 2' terminus of 2-5A may be possible without adversely affecting its biological activity while endowing it with other favorable properties such as resistance to degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1585699921,"Benzoate-1,2-dioxygenase system from Pseudomonas arvilla C-1 consists of two protein components, benzoate-1,2-dioxygenase reductase and benzoate-1,2-dioxygenase (Yamaguchi, M., and Fujisawa, H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5058-5063). Benzoate-1,2-dioxygenase exhibited two protein bands (alpha and beta) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their molecular weights were estimated to the 50,000 and 20,000, respectively. The intensities of protein staining on polyacrylamide gels suggested that these two subunits were present in equimolar quantities in benzoate-1,2-dioxygenase. Molecular weight of benzoate-1,2-dioxygenase was estimated to be 201,000 by sedimentation equilibrium (Yphantis method). The values of molecular weights of native enzyme and its subunits suggested that the subunit structure of benzoate-1,2-dioxygenase may be alpha 3 beta 3. Cross-linking experiments also suggested the same subunit structure. These two subunits were separated from each other by Ultrogel AcA44 chromatography in the presence of 6 M urea. Amino acid compositions of the two subunits were examined and compared with that of native enzyme. NH2-terminal amino acids of alpha and beta subunits were both serine, and isoelectric points of alpha and beta in the presence of 6 M urea were determined to be pH 5.6 and pH 4.8, respectively. The enzyme contained 8.2 mol of iron and 5.9 mol of labile sulfide/mol of enzyme, suggesting the presence of additional iron atoms besides iron-sulfur clusters. The isolated beta subunit did not contain any significant amounts of iron and labile sulfide, but the alpha subunit contained approximately 2 mol each of iron and labile sulfide and exhibited an absorption spectrum of binuclear iron cluster type."
https://openalex.org/W1578457711,"Chemical Labeling has been employed to attempt to identify the lactate transport protein of rabbit erythrocytes, which have a very high capacity for stereoselective lactate transport. The lactate transport protein catalyzes lactate/proton cotransport (or lactate/hydroxyl exchange) at physiological pH, as demonstrated by uphill proton fluxes induced by lactate gradients. However, lactate/lactate and lactate/pyruvate exchange are considerably more rapid than lactate/proton cotransport. Although the lactate transporter is less sensitive to inhibition by the stilbenedisulfonate derivative H2DIDS (4,4'diisothiocyano-2,2'-dihydrostilbenedisulfonate) than is the inorganic anion exchanger (band 3), H2DIDS is nonetheless a reasonably potent inhibitor of the lactate transport. A 1-h treatment with 10(-4) M H2DIDS irreversibly inhibits lactate/lactate exchange by greater than 80%. This inhibition appears to be related to the labeling (by [3H]H2DIDS) of an integral membrane polypeptide of Mr = 43,000. This [3H]H2DIDS-labeled polypeptide is absent from human erythrocytes, which have a 100-fold lower Vmax for lactate transport than do rabbit erythrocytes. These experiments suggest that the polypeptide of Mr = 43,000 is a component of the lactate transport system."

The product is sialidase-labile (96%), and the NeuAc group is linked to O-3 of the terminal galactose residue. The (alpha 2-3) linkage between sialic acid and the terminal galactose was determined on the basis of identification of 2,4,6-tri-O-methyl[3H]galactose obtained after hydrolysis of the permethylated enzymatic product. The CMP-sialic acid:nLcOse4Cer (alpha 2-3)sialyltransferase activity sediments (90%) at the junction of 1.2 M and 1.5 M on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient when still membrane bound (insoluble in 0.2% Triton X-100).

We present evidence that such intact chromatin fibers are a prerequisite for the maintenance of the characteristic shape of metaphase chromosomes. The evidence is based on the finding that treatment of chromosomes with 0.5 M NaCl, a condition which is known to remove histone H1 and which destroys the higher order structure of chromatin fibers, also leads to a disintegration of the metaphase chromosome structure, whereas treatment with 0.3 M (or less) NaCl has no effect on the integrity of the chromosomes and their chromatin fibers. These data support a model in which the metaphase chromosome is maintained by a tight assembly of the 25-30 nm thick chromatin fibers containing all the histones."

https://openalex.org/W1517228555,"Purification of the dihydrofolate reductases overproduced by 16 independently-derived antifolate-resistant sublines of Chinese hamster lung cells and their drug-sensitive parental cell line, DC-3F, has confirmed our original observation that two molecular weight classes of this enzyme, viz. Mr = 21,000 can be overproduced by drug-resistant cells (Melera, P. W., Wolgemuth, D., Biedler, J. L., and Hession, C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 319-322). Of the 16 drug-resistant sublines analyzed, 12 overproduce the 21,000-dalton enzyme, while 4 overproduce the 20,000-dalton enzyme. Both molecular weight classes are found in the drug-sensitive parental line. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the two molecular weight classes of enzyme has shown that each is composed of two isoelectric forms, and that the relative distributions of the isoelectric forms within a molecular weight class are maintained during overproduction. In vitro translation experiments have demonstrated that the synthesis of these isoelectric forms and their relative distributions are mediated by mRNA. Finally, evidence is presented for the existence of two sets of three dihydrofolate reductase mRNAs in overproducing sublines. Both sets, within a subline, encode the same molecular weight class of dihydrofolate reductase, while each set directs the synthesis of only one of the isoelectric forms within that class. Although the genetic basis for these observations is not yet understood, it is clear that the production of dihydrofolate reductase by Chinese hamster lung cells is complex and probably involves the expression of multiple dihydrofolate reductase genes and/or alleles."

The acids were separated in biological samples by ion exchange chromatography, derivatized as n-butyl esters with boron trifluoride-butanol, and extracted with chloroform. Complete chemical ionization mass spectra and mass ion abundance ratios established the identity of N tau - and N pi - methylimidazoleacetic acids in the biological extracts and of imidazoleacetic acid in urine, but not in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and brain. The methylimidazoleacetic acids as n-butyl esters were quantified by electron impact selected ion monitoring of m/e 95 esters at different retention times. 3-Pyridylacetic acid was used as an internal standard and monitored at m/e 93. The levels of N tau-methylimidazoleacetic acid and N pi-methylimidazoleacetic acid were, respectively (picomoles/g or picomoles/ml +/- S.E.), for brain, 373, 19 +/- 13.08 and 110.33 +/- 12.44; for cerebrospinal fluid, 22.77 +/- 2.15 and 80.76 +/- 18.92; and for plasma, 84.57 +/- 13.64 and 73.64 +/- 14.50.

https://openalex.org/W1638747941,"A rapid and reproducible method for the purification of rat liver histone acetyltransferase is presented. Extraction of nuclei in low salt, followed by phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic affinity chromatography, G-200 gel filtration in the presence of 1 M urea, CM-cellulose ion exchange and acetyllysine affinity chromatography minimize exposure of the enzyme to high salt. Evidence is provided which indicates that the instability of the enzyme activity is due in part to hydrophobic interactions. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 96,000 as judged by gel filtration. In agreement with others, the enzyme is unstable in the presence of divalent cations, although a requirement for low concentration of Mg2+ or Ca2+ was observed. The enzyme is also sensitive to sulfhydryl blocking agents and is susceptible to rapid thermal denaturation at 37 and 45 degrees C (t1/2 = 22.2 and 9.54 min, respectively). The optimum pH and the energy of activation for the reaction were pH 7.5 and 5230 +/- 378 cal/mol, respectively. In the presence of all five histones, the enzyme catalyzes the acetylation in the order of H3 greater than H4 greater than H2b greater than H2a greater than H1 and appears to operate in a nonprocessive manner. While no other isozymic forms of nuclear acetyltransferase were detected, the enzyme exhibits the properties of both nuclear isozymic forms which have been reported, histone acetyltransferase A and DB, observed in calf thymus and bovine lymphocytes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1605636762,"Normal feline and human arylsulfatase B isozymes were purified to homogeniety from liver.

Although both enzymes had the same pH optimum (5.7), the feline enzyme was more electronegative than the human enzyme when electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels. Compared to the human isozyme, feline arylsulfatase B had a lower Km toward p-nitrocatechol sulfate (1.2 versus 3.6 mM), was more thermostable at 60 degrees C (68 versus 30 min), and had a slightly lower pI (7.8 versus 8.0). The native molecular weight of the feline enzyme was estimated to be about twice that the human isozyme by gel filtration, analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed single protein bands of Mr = 41,000 and 38,000 for the feline and human isozymes, respectively. Alkylation and cross-linking experiments were consistent with the feline enzyme being a homodimer and the human enzyme a monomer. Amino acid compositional analyses revealed few significant differences between the two isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1520864787,"The role of collagen macromolecules in the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors on the surface of cultured rat muscle cells was investigated. Both the synthesis and secretion of collagen, as well as acetylcholine receptor aggregation were stimulated by treatment of muscle cultures with an embryonic brain extract. Treatments with cis-hydroxyproline or monensin, which interfere with collagen synthesis and secretion, significantly reduced the number of acetylcholine receptor aggregates detected. Incubation of the cultures with embryonic brain extract induced a decrease in extractability of acetylcholine receptors. This effect could be reversed by treating the cells with bacterial collagenase. In addition, affinity purified antibodies against collagen of types I and IV inhibited the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors by stimulated brain extract. These data suggest that neurotrophic factor(s) present in embryonic nerve tissue have the ability to induce collagen production; the collagen formed plays a role in the formation and/or stabilization of acetylcholine receptor aggregates and possibly also of synaptic connections."

M., and Talalay, P. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6851-6858). Upon release of the steroid by mild acid hydrolysis, the peptide is converted into a more basic structure while retaining its amino acid composition (as determined by conventional means). These findings were rationalized by postulating that the steroid is bound as an imido ester via the amide group of asparagine 57 and that the polypeptide backbone participates (via attack by nitrogen or oxygen) in the hydrolysis of this ester with the formation of a cyclic amidine or basic oxazine. By comparing the properties of the isolated tetrapeptide, from which the steroid has been removed, with those of synthetic H2N-Tyr-Ala-Asn-Ser-CO2H and H2N-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Ser-CO2H by electron impact and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, we now have evidence for the presence of an oxazine (5,6-dihydro-6-iminio-4H-1,3-oxazine) in the modified peptide. Our results draw attention to the hitherto unsuspected degree of nucleophilicity of the amide group of the side chain of asparagine and the participation of this group in the formation of an imido ester."
https://openalex.org/W1557052403,"The degradation rates of mitochondrial matrix polypeptides were examined in nonproliferating hepatoma monolayers. The cultures were first pulsed with [3H]methionine, and after chasing for 41 h in the presence of excess methionine, the cultures were pulsed with [35S]methionine. Sonic extracts from the mitochondrial fraction of the double-labeled cells were then resolved on two-dimensional isoelectric focussing-electrophoresis gels in the presence of excess matrix proteins from digitonin-fractionated rat liver mitochondria. Thirty-three of 80 spots appearing upon staining and destaining contained radioactivity significantly above background, indicating that these polypeptides were present in hepatoma as well as liver mitochondria. The half-lives of isolated polypeptides were then determined from their 3H/35S, the 3H/35S of the isolated mitochondria fraction, and the half-life of the mitochondria fraction determined independently from a decay experiment. The 3H/35S of these resolved polypeptides ranged from 0.32 to 1.93, corresponding to calculated half-lives of 17 to 100+ h. The 3H/35S of these same polypeptides from mixed control cultures given [3H]- and [35S]methionine pulses, respectively, at the beginning and end of confluent maintenance in the absence of chase were nearly identical (1.78 +/- 0.17), thus assuring unchanging rates of protein synthesis during the chase experiment. The results show that mitochondrial matrix polypeptides are degraded at heterogeneous rates in these nonproliferating cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593344292,"These experiments were designed to determine whether there are tissue factors which affect the activity of branched chain alpha-keto acid (BCKA) dehydrogenase in the mitochondria of the same or different tissues. The activity of BCKA dehydrogenase was increased by the addition of the cytoplasmic fraction of the gastro-cnemius muscle to liver mitochondria. The specificity of the effect of the muscle factor was established by the fact that it only increased the BCKA dehydrogenase activity in liver mitochondria. The activity of this enzyme in mitochondria from skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, or brain was either not affected or inhibited by the muscle factor. Muscle factor also increased the activity of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase but decreased that of pyruvate dehydrogenase in liver mitochondria. This factor was found in a variety of skeletal muscles but not in smooth muscle such as uterus. A factor similar to that of muscle was not found in liver or kidney cytoplasm but was detected in plasma. There were similarities between the effects of muscle and plasma factors on the BCKA dehydrogenase activity in liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle mitochondria. Studies concerning the properties and partial characterization of this factor revealed that it (a) is nondialyzable, (b) is a protein, (c) is heat labile, and (d) increases the activity of BCKA dehydrogenase by increasing the Vmax without a change in the apparent Km."
https://openalex.org/W1611642334,"We employed a newly developed radioimmunoassay to quantitate P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase protein directly in liver and kidney of intact rats. The radioimmunoassay was dependent upon the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate in the competitive binding reaction mixture. In conjunction with assayable activity measurements, the radioimmunoassay results also made it possible to assess the average specific activity of the enzyme. In the fed state, liver P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase was 0.89 microM (micromoles/kg of tissue) and the kidney enzyme was 1.90 microM. Following a 48-h fast, the enzyme in liver increased to 2.83 microM and that in kidney to 6.83 microM. Although liver enzyme concentration increased 3-fold, total liver enzymic activity was increased only about 30%. The discrepancy was due to the decrease in liver weight which occurred during fasting. The kidneys, which do not lose weight during fasting, had a 65% elevation of total organ activity. Total organ enzyme activity was predominantly dependent on changes in enzyme mass. In the fed state, the kidney/liver enzyme mass ratio was 0.44, in the fasted state it was 0.68. Variation in enzyme concentration, enzyme half-life, and response to tryptophan and chronic triamcinolone administration all gave evidence for organ-specific regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2002709775,"Gangliosides, which are membrane constituents of animal cells, may be altered under various conditions that cause change in metabolism. In this study, gangliosides from tracheal and lung tissues were extracted and measured as a function of bronchial hyperreactivity in a guinea pig model of bronchial asthma. When plotted logarithmically, the data showed that tracheal gangliosides decreased with an increase in airway reactivity index, suggesting a linear relation between them. Differential analysis of tracheal gangliosides in the acute stage of bronchial hyperreactivity indicates accumulation of polysialogangliosides. These data support the hypothesis that tracheal gangliosides are intimately involved in the development of bronchial asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1510878761,"The beta-carboxyl group of Asp 101 was modified with several amine nucleophiles by the amine-carbodiimide procedure and the trypsin susceptibilities of the derivatives were analyzed by peptide mapping. The (aminoethyl)asparaginyl peptide bond was completely cleaved by trypsin but the (3-aminopropyl)asparaginyl bond was not. When the positive charge was in the proper position, large residues such as (2-[imidazol-4(5)-ylmethylamino]ethyl) asparagine or (11-amino-3,-6,9-triazaundecyl)asparagine were susceptible to trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1595776072,"A model is presented suggesting a function of specific cysteine residue of cytochrome P-450CAM in binding the substrate camphor, via a thiohemiketal bond, for its correct orientation to the heme iron and for the subsequent transfer of nascent product to facilitate its release. This model was developed to explain the results of affinity labeling with isobornyl bromoacetate. This reagent couples to the proteins via a thioether bond to cysteine, eliciting a type I transition in the difference spectrum. Formation of this covalent complex, which is strongly inhibited by the substrate, can be monitored by quantitation of S-carboxymethylcysteine in acid hydrolyzates. While addition of one equivalent of label yields 0.3 equivalents of the cysteine derivative after 5 min, increasing to 0.8 equivalents after 24 h, the spectral shift decays with time. Kinetic analysis of the spectral decay and of covalent coupling strongly suggests that thioether bond formation occurs at the substrate binding-site, in a reaction step prior to, and distinct from, the step associated with the spectral decay. The P-450CAM derivative, when titrated with camphor, produced again a type I spectrum virtually identical with the spectrum of the native P-450CAM-substrate complex. While the model presented here is not the only possible interpretation of the results, it is fully consistent with them and provides an excellent framework for further study of the catalytic mechanism of P-450CAM."
https://openalex.org/W1523969480,"To study the effect of carbamylation on the polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin (HB) S, three types of NH2-terminal-carbamylated Hb S specifically modified at the NH2 termini at the alpha, beta, or all four subunit chains, alpha c2 beta sc2, and alpha 2 beta sc2, and epsilon-lysine-carbamylated Hb S were prepared by reacting Hb S with cyanate. The solubility of deoxy-Hb S in concentrated phosphate buffer was increased by carbamylation of the NH2-terminal residues of beta chains. Kinetic studies on the polymerization of purified carbamylated deoxy-Hb S showed that the length of the delay time prior to polymerization is related to solubility; carbamylated Hb S with higher solubilities exhibited longer delay times than those with lower solubilities. The delay times for alpha 2 beta sc2 and alpha c2 beta sc2 were prolonged 2-3- and 3-6-fold, respectively, as compared to those of native deoxy-Hb S in 1.8 M phosphate buffer. The logarithmic plot of reciprocal delay time versus hemoglobin concentration of alpha c2 beta s2, alpha 2 beta sc2, and epsilon-lysine-carbamylated deoxy-Hb S showed straight lines with slopes (n values) of 4.0, 3.8, 3.6, and 3.5, respectively. These values are slightly higher than the n value of native deoxy-Hb S (n = 2.7), suggesting that nuclei of carbamylated Hb S are larger than those of native deoxy-Hb S."
https://openalex.org/W1594667418,"Chick embryos, chick embryo fibroblasts, and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts contain a factor that preferentially blocks the accumulation of DNA-directed RNA polymerase II transcripts. The factor was detected by inhibition of transcription in a cell-free assay system utilizing partially purified RNA polymerase II from calf thymus, soluble factors from HeLa cells, and a purified DNA template. At low concentrations, it specifically prevents the accumulation of RNA polymerase II transcripts; at higher concentrations, it blocks the accumulation of other transcripts. The factor has been partially purified by sequential chromatography on BioRex 70, DNA-cellulose, Bio-Gel P-6, and HPX-87 from extracts of chicken embryos. The activity was resistant to treatment with trypsin, pronase, or micrococcal nuclease. A partial characterization of the molecule indicates that (i) it has an apparent molecular mass of about 200-300 daltons, (ii) it is stable at pH 2 and pH 12 and to heating at 100 degrees C, (iii) it is not extractable by ether or chloroform:methanol, (2:1, v/v), and (iv) it is labile to heating at 800 degrees C. These data suggest that it is a small, hydrolphilic compound probably organic in nature. The factor is active in a transcription assay utilizing either the Rous sarcoma virus Long Terminal Repeat promoter or the chick alpha 2 (Type I) collagen-promoter as DNA templates. The accumulation of promoter-specific transcripts is blocked in a cell-free assay utilizing either Rous sarcoma virus-chick embryo fibroblast extracts or HeLa S-100 factors and calf thymus RNA polymerase II. In the absence of S-100, the factor does not appreciably affect the accumulation of randomly initiated transcripts produced by calf thymus RNA polymerase II on a DNA template; this result indicates the factor interacts directly or indirectly with some component(s) of HeLa S-100 to prevent the accumulation of RNA."
