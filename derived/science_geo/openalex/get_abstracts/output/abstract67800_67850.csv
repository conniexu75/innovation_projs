https://openalex.org/W1489147212,"Allopurinol and other 6-unsubstituted pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidines have been shown to reduce all of the oxidation-reduction reactive groups of milk xanthine oxidase. The great inhibitory action of these compounds has been shown to be due to a sort of suicide reaction, in which the product formed by enzymatic hydroxylation in position 6 is joined in complex with a partially reduced from of the enzyme. Several lines of evidence are presented indicating that complex formation is with the enzyme-bound molybdenum in the Mo(IV) state. Studies on the stoichiometry of binding of the product of allopurinol reaction, allo-xanthine(4,6-dihydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), revealed that the amount of allo-xanthine bound was proportional to the percentage of functional active sites in the enzyme preparation; i.e. it serves as an active site label. From these results it is concluded that the best preparations of xanthine oxidase so far obtained contain only 75 to 80% functional active sites, even though they possess their full complement of flavin, molybdenum, and iron-sulfur components. Evidence is presented that the presence of nonfunctional active sites is responsible for several of the slow reactions previously observed with the enzyme."

Fibroblasts from his mother and sister had two distinct clonal populations, one with enzymatic activity and the other enzyme deficient. This provides evidence of genetic inactivation at the alpha-galactosidase locus and makes possible the detection of carriers of Fabry's disease even when the enzymatic activity in their leukocytes and uncloned fibroblasts is within the range of controls."

The best combinations for the mechanical induction of pseudopregnancy were comparable to those male behaviors normally seen during mating. The behavior of the male coincides with a species-related vaginal code, increasing chances for reproductive success between cospecifics."
https://openalex.org/W1542790225,"The swelling of isolated bovine heart and rat liver mitochondria has been compared in various suspending media in the absence of a source of metabolic energy. It is concluded that mitochondria will swell under these conditions in the presence of a permeant anion and a permeant cation, provided that the internal pH is not restrictive. Mitochondria show a high selectivity for cation penetration in the absence of energy, but almost no selectivity in the presence of respiration or of exogenous ATP. It is concluded that no monovalent cations penetrate the mitochondrion by simple diffusion in the absence of energy, but that an exchange diffusion system permits Na+ to be exchanged for internal H+. Lipid-soluble amines, such as NH3, can penetrate the mitochondrion and, in the presence of reagents that acidify the interior, such as free acetic acid or the protonated form of an uncoupler, can generate a cation (NH4+). The combination of NH4+ plus an uncoupler, therefore, represents a means of allowing cation accumulation in the matrix which is equivalent to the presence of the valinomycin-K+ or the gramicidin-Na+ complex. Certain anions, such as nitrate, appear to diffuse into the mitochondrion at neutral pH when cation penetration is induced by one of the above mechanisms. Bovine heart mitochondria show little, if any, tendency to admit substrate anions by the specific exchange diffusion systems found in rat liver mitochondria. All anions tested, however, are able to penetrate the bovine heart mitochondrion in the presence of a penetrating cation by a pH-dependent mechanism. This pathway for anion penetration can also be demonstrated in liver mitochondria at high pH, but it is not as striking as in the heart mitochondria in the range of pH 7.2 to 7.5. Uncoupled mitochondria swollen in the ammonium salts of nitrate, trichloracetate, fumarate, succinate, or malate can be contracted by either exogenous ATP or respiratory substrate as previously described for NH4Cl."
https://openalex.org/W1497965264,"Abstract In an earlier study, 51% of total renal nuclear content of 3H-aldosterone was recovered bound to nuclear proteins readily extractable with Tris-3 mm CaCl2. Modifications in the methods used to prepare renal nuclear fractions resulted in the isolation of 3H-aldosterone bound to chromatin to the extent of 55% of the total nuclear content of the steroid. The chromatin binding system was stereospecific for aldosterone and related mineralocorticoids. In competition studies, the order of affinities for the 3H-aldosterone binding sites was d-aldosterone g 9α-fluorocortisol g cortisol g 17α-estradiol ≌ progesterone = 17α-isoaldosterone. Actinomycin D did not compete for the 3H-aldosterone binding sites in renal chromatin. The binding affinities were in accord with the relative potencies of these steroids as mineralocorticoids. In addition, spirolactone blocked the binding of 3H-aldosterone to chromatin at the molar ratio needed to block the action of the steroid on sodium transport. Based on differential susceptibility to specific hydrolases (i.e. DNase, RNase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin), CsCl density centrifugation, chemical analysis of 0.3 m KCl extracts of labeled chromatin, and glycerol density centrifugation, the primary binding unit appears to be a 4 S, nonhistone chromosomal protein. The aldosterone-binding protein is heatlabile and tends to be stabilized by 20% glycerol. The possibility that the formation of the aldosterone-chromosomal binding system initiates steroidal action on active sodium transport is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1550752444,It is generally agreed that knowledge of what affects the environment is markedly inadequate. Due to inadequate monitoring and measurement what is happening to the atmosphere or the biosphere is unknown. Research is needed to keep track of what is happening and to develop the techniques that will produce the goods that are wanted without the associated evils. Attention is directed to an economists review of resource exhaustion population growth in the United States connection between population and pollution and policies that would affect the growth of population. Population in the United States today is a little more than 200 million having increased by slightly over 50% since 1940. If this rate of population increase continued throughout the next century the population would reach a billion shortly before the year 2100. A reasonable goal would be to reduce fertility as soon as possible to a level where couples produced just enough children to insure that each gneration exactly replaced itself. The connection between the current population growth and the deterioration of the environment is esstially an indirect one. With the will and intelligence to devise and apply proper policies the environment can be improved with the current population of 200 million or with the population of 50 years from now which will probably be 300 million. Although slower population growth would make it easier to improve the environment the task would not be much easier.
https://openalex.org/W1549208455,"Abstract To elucidate the effect of perfusate pH on hepatic glutamine metabolism, livers were isolated from normal adult fed male Sprague-Dawley rats and perfused with diluted whole heparinized rat blood for 6 hours. With the aid of discontinuous infusion of appropriate solutions automatically regulated with a pH-stat, the perfusate pH was maintained at either 7.45 ± 0.05 (a normal physiological value) or at 7.15 ± 0.05 (a value corresponding to severe metabolic acidosis). Glutamine utilization was examined in two types of experiments designed to study the steady state utilization of uniformly labeled glutamine-14C-infused at a constant rate and the utilization of a single dose of uniformly labeled glutamine-14C with concomitant inhibition of glutamine synthesis by methionine sulfoximine. Livers perfused at pH 7.15 utilized one-half as much glutamine from a constant infusion as those perfused at pH 7.45. Production of 14CO2 and urea was also less at pH 7.15. With glutamine synthetase irreversibly inhibited by methionine sulfoximine, utilization of a single dose of uniformly labeled glutamine-14C indicated glutamine half-lives of 3.7 and 1.2 hours at pH 7.15 and pH 7.45, respectively. The pH dependence of glutamine synthesis from a continuous infusion of (NH4)2CO3 plus uniformly labeled glutamate-14C was examined; glutamine synthesis was greater at pH 7.45. The observed suppression of glutamine utilization at pH 7.15 is relatively greater than suppression of glutamine synthesis at that pH and could account for greater net hepatic synthesis of glutamine said to occur in acidosis in intact animals. In contrast to l-glutamine, uptake of l-glutamic acid by the isolated perfused liver occurred as readily at pH 7.15 as at pH 7.45 and there was no significant difference in per cent doses oxidized to 14CO2 or in urea synthesis. Additional comparative observations at both values of perfusate pH were made on urea synthesis, glucose metabolism, lactate formation, and the oxidation-reduction state of the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1504596048,"Abstract The biochemical basis for the action of glucocorticoids on lymphoid tissue has been studied using cell suspensions of the cortisol-sensitive and -resistant lines of lymphosarcoma P1798. Comparison of these tumors indicated that exposure to physiological doses of glucocorticoids produces a significant inhibition of thymidine-3H incorporation into tumor DNA and of uniformly labeled glucose-14C uptake only in the sensitive line. Using 2-deoxy-d-glucose-1-14C, it was found that cortisol causes an inhibition of uptake or phosphorylation of this analogue. Impairment of glucose uptake is significant within 1 hour and at this time is greater than the inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA. When glucose is omitted from the medium, thymidine uptake into DNA is reduced by 80 to 90%, and under these conditions the inhibitory action of cortisol on thymidine incorporation is half of that seen in the complete medium. Omission of amino acids from the incubation medium resulted in a 50% decrease of glucose uptake into whole cells and also reduced the inhibition produced by cortisol. These findings provide additional support for the concept that reduced energy utilization may be of significance in mediating the physiological action of glucocorticoids on lymphoid tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1578630970,"Abstract Mevalonic kinase (EC 2.7.1.36), the first enzyme in the ATP-requiring sequence of cholesterol biosynthesis, has been purified from hog liver. This enzyme has a specific activity of 17 µmoles of product formed per min per mg of protein. The purified mevalonic kinase is homogeneous, or nearly homogeneous, on assay by Sephadex gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrofocusing, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The molecular weight of this enzyme is estimated to be 98,000 from its elution position on Sephadex gel filtration. From a combination of studies on the initial velocity of the reaction, inhibition by product, and inhibition by dead end inhibitor, it is concluded that (a) the phosphorylation of mevalonic acid, catalyzed by mevalonic kinase, is sequential; that is, all substrates must react with the enzyme before the first product is released, (b) mevalonate reacts with the enzyme first, followed by MgATP, and (c) the order of release of products is first mevalonate 5-phosphate and then ADP. Evidence is also presented that an —SH group is important in the phosphorylation of mevalonic acid and that the reactivity of this group is influenced by the presence of potassium mevalonate and MgATP. No evidence has been obtained for the formation of enzyme-bound intermediates in this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1605660635,"Abstract The hydrolysis of methyl oleate by pancreatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) is inhibited by added normal alcohols. The efficiency of inhibition increases with the chain length of the alcohol, attaining a maximum at 10 carbon atoms. A further increase in chain length causes no further increase in inhibitory action. The data have been successfully treated by assuming that the reaction occurs at an interface. The inhibitory action of the alcohols followed the pattern of a typical Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The calculated free energy of adsorption of each —CH2— group of the alcohol was 820 cal. Although the uninhibited reaction was enzyme-limited, the effect of the alcohols could be overcome by the addition of more substrate, but not by the addition of more enzyme. It is concluded that the inhibiting effect of alcohol is due to its adsorption on the substrate, thus blocking the enzyme from the substrate. Some of the properties of ester hydrolysis, which result from the reaction taking place at an oil-water interface, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1490473625,"Abstract Hydroxyproline 2-epimerase, purified to homogeneity from hydroxyproline-induced cells of Pseudomonas putida, behaved like a single peptide chain of approximately 64,000 molecular weight, based both on ultracentrifugal data and on a study of tryptic peptides and amino acid composition. Several methods indicated a total of 12 reduced cysteines per mole of native enzyme. Of these only six reacted with Ellman's reagent (5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)), including three which reacted relatively rapidly. Loss of enzyme activity was associated with reaction of one or more of the latter cysteines. The presence of substrate protected two of the rapidly reacting cysteines from reaction with Ellman's reagent and prevented loss of enzyme activity. A detailed kinetic study indicated that three 4-hydroxyproline epimers and two 3-hydroxyproline epimers had similar Km values; Vmax for the 3-hydroxyprolines was markedly lower than for the 4-hydroxyprolines. Vmax was reduced 2- to 3- fold by replacement of the α-hydrogen of substrates with deuterium or by substitution of deuterium oxide for water; deuterium substitution in both substrate and solvent had a cumulative effect in reducing Vmax. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies showed that the α-hydrogen exchanges during enzymatic racemization at the α-carbon, and that the rate of exchange parallels initial formation of product, consistent with a model in which two sites on the enzyme act as mutual, and perhaps concerted, acceptor and donor of the α-hydrogen in catalyzing epimerization. The indication of two cysteines in the active site suggests that these residues may act as the donor and recipient sites."
https://openalex.org/W1496917079,"Abstract An assay of a cyanide-binding protein of rat liver microsomes has been developed based on a cyanide-induced difference spectrum between λmax of 443 nm and λmin of 405 to 410 nm (K = 0.5 mm). The cyanide-binding protein has been isolated by chromatography of deoxycholate-treated microsomes on diethylaminoethylcellulose. Chromatography of a preparation of Nagarse-treated microsomes yielded the cyanide-binding protein free from cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5. The absolute spectrum of the purified cyanide-binding protein suggests that the substance is a cytochrome (λmax 410 nm, oxidized; λmax 418, 524, 555 nm, reduced). Preliminary evidence relating the cyanide-binding protein to mixed function oxidation of methyl sterols and stearyl coenzyme A suggests that the protein may function as a component of these oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W1604018924,"Abstract The role of aliphatic alcohols on the temperatures of the helix-coil (Tii) and of the melting transformation (Ti) for collagen in water solutions was investigated. Alcohols used were CH3OH, C2H5OH, and C3H7OH and the role of chloroethanol was also investigated. The results indicate that on increasing alcohol concentration both Ti and Tii are initially depressed (i.e. the random coil form is favored with respect to both the helical and the crystalline form) the order for increasing alcohol effectiveness being C2H4ClOH g C3H7OH g C2H5OH g CH3OH. In the case of the melting transition a subsequent reincrease of Ti with further increase of alcohol content was observed, and in this region the order for increasing effectiveness for depressing the melting temperature was CH3OH g C2H5OH g C3H7OH. Measurements of the equilibrium degree of swelling for cross-linked collagen membranes indicates that the over-all degree of swelling decreases with increasing alcohol concentration. However, measurements of the selective absorption of the alcohols by the membrane reveal a behavior which can be correlated to the melting behavior; i.e. the absorption goes through a maximum on increasing alcohol content and the order for increasing absorption is C3H7OH g C2H5OH g CH3OH below the maximum and CH3OH g C2H5OH g C3H7OH above the maximum. The depressing effect on Ti and Tii observed in diluted alcohol solutions is attributed to a solvation of the side chain apolar groups which become exposed during the transitions."
https://openalex.org/W1494737805,"Abstract Quinaldic acid and 5-methoxy indole-2-carboxylic acid inhibited the oxidation of pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and citrate but not of β-hydroxybutyrate or succinate in rat liver mitochondria. The inhibition of glutamate and citrate metabolism resulted primarily from inhibition of the further oxidation of α-ketoglutarate. Isolated liver mitochondria accumulated these inhibitors to concentrations 30-fold in excess of those found in the suspending medium. Octanoate or 2,4-dinitrophenol reduced this accumulation and also reversed the inhibition of pyruvate oxidation. Kidney mitochondria did not accumulate these aromatic monocarboxylic acid inhibitors to nearly the same extent as liver mitochondria; neither compound inhibited kidney mitochondrial oxidations. The site of inhibition was lipoyl dehydrogenase. Concentrations of the inhibitors which could be accumulated by isolated mitochondria significantly inhibited the enzyme isolated from rat liver mitochondria. The specificity of various indole derivatives indicated that different structural requirements were necessary for accumulation by mitochondria, inhibition of isolated lipoyl dehydrogenase, and, finally, inhibition of α-keto acid oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1561314132,"Abstract The ADP ribosylation in vitro of aminoacyl transferase II, catalyzed by diphtheria toxin, was used to determine the subcellular location of transferase II in extracts obtained from intact HeLa cells incubated under a variety of conditions. Very little transferase II was found associated with either heavy or light polyribosomes, most of the ribosome-associated enzyme being bound to monoribosomes. Incubation conditions of cells which increased the amount of monoribosomes, such as amino acid deprivation and puromycin inhibition of protein synthesis, caused an increased binding of the enzyme to monoribosomes compared to controls. Transferase II, accumulated on monoribosomes as a result of amino acid deprivation, was rapidly released into the cytoplasm upon restoration of protein synthesis. The free 74 S monoribosomes contained almost all of the ribosome-bound aminoacyl transferase II; only traces were found associated with nascent 60 S and 40 S ribosomal subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1564909152,"Abstract Studies on mixtures of canine and human hemoglobin incubated in the liganded form and separated in the unliganded form (and vice versa) indicate that liganded and unliganded hemoglobin cleave along the same plane in dimer formation. The separation was carried out by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels. The same result was indicated by experiments in which the canine-human hemoglobin mixture was focused in the oxy form and then refocused in the deoxy form as the oxygen in the gel reacted with dithionite. This technique clearly illustrates that, as a result of the Bohr effect, liganded and unliganded hemoglobin have different isoelectric points. Electrofocusing in gels could profitably be used to study cooperativity in allosteric enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1512189499,"Abstract 1. Hydrogen cyanide inhibited acetoacetate decarboxylase only when incubated with the enzyme in the presence of carbonyl compounds. This resulted in an inhibitory synergism between hydrogen cyanide and carbonyl compounds. This synergism was used to investigate the comparative abilities of various carbonyl compounds to form Schiff's bases at the active site of the enzyme. The order of effectiveness among the compounds tested was acetaldehyde g acetone g cyclohexanone g methyl ethyl ketone g 3-hexanone g diethyl ketone. 2. The ability of hydrogen cyanide to inhibit the enzyme was optimal at pH 6 and decreased abruptly on both sides of this optimum. Although primarily an uncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme, hydrogen cyanide caused perceptible decreases in the slopes of the lines obtained by plotting kinetic data on reciprocal coordinates. Thus, raising the concentration of substrate increased the degree of inhibition caused by a given level of hydrogen cyanide more than could be explained on the basis of combination of the inhibitor only with enzyme-substrate or enzyme-product complexes. 3. Continuous infusion of borohydride into well stirred and well buffered solutions of the enzyme resulted in no loss of activity unless carbonyl compounds, capable of forming Schiff's base compounds at the active site, were present. The rate of inactivation of the enzyme, under these conditions, could be used as an index of the degree of saturation of the active sites by the carbonyl compound being tested and of the reactivity with borohydride of the Schiff's base compounds so generated at the active site. Quantitative data were obtained in this way for acetone sulfonate, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone. Nitrate was observed to protect the enzyme against inactivation by borohydride in the presence of acetone. 4. A number of diketones were compared for their abilities to inhibit the enzyme and the structural features essential for this action were discussed. β-Diketones, which inhibited the enzyme, generally did so with perceptible slowness which was accentuated by electron-withdrawing substituents adjacent to one of the carbonyl functions. The ability of acetylacetone to protect the enzyme against inactivation by borohydride, like its ability to inhibit the enzyme, developed slowly. 5. The reaction of acetoacetate decarboxylase with p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (CMS) was investigated both in terms of mercaptide formation and in terms of activity. One sulfhydryl group per subunit could be derivatized without loss of activity whereas reaction of a second sulfhydryl was associated with some inactivation. A third equivalent of CMS per subunit reached with an unidentified group to cause additional inactivation. Amounts of CMS in excess of three per subunit had no further effects and the enzyme retained activity which was impervious to additional CMS. The native enzyme retained 70% of its activity after treatment with CMS whereas the fully activated enzyme retained only 50% of its activity after exposure to CMS. Inhibition by CMS was reversed by cysteine."

https://openalex.org/W1553239339,"Abstract The first two steps in the dissimilation of p-hydroxybenzoate through the β-ketoadipate pathway are (a) conversion of the primary substrate to protocatechuate by a monooxygenase, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, and (b) conversion of protocatechuate to β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate by a dioxygenase, protocatechuate oxygenase. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is specifically induced by its substrate. Protocatechuate oxygenase can be induced either by its substrate or by p-hydroxybenzoate. Exposure of cells to p-hydroxybenzoate therefore elicits simultaneous but independent inductions of both enzymes. Tests with a wide range of other aromatic acids showed that the specificity of induction of both enzymes is extremely high. No other effective inducers of protocatechuate oxygenase were discovered. A few of the compounds tested could induce slight activity of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, but the levels in all cases were less than 7% of that induced by p-hydroxybenzoate. The kinetic data of induction by p-hydroxybenzoate and by protocatechuate differ. Protocatechuate elicits immediate enzyme synthesis, whereas there is a lag of approximately 20 min before enzyme synthesis in response to p-hydroxybenzoate begins."

A three-dimensional x-ray crystal structure analysis has shown that the complex is disodium tetraglycylglycinatocuprate(II) 4.5-hydrate, Na2[Cu(NH2— (CH2CON)3—CH2CONHCH2COO)]·4.5H2O. The crystals are triclinic, a = 7.306 A, b = 10.902 A, c = 12.012 A, α = 91.73°, β = 103.64°, γ = 96.14°, Z = 2, Dm = 1.76 ± 0.02, Dx = 1.76 g·cm-3, space group P1. The intensities of 3003 x-ray reflections were recorded by counter methods. The structure was refined to a conventional residual R = 0.080. The copper atom has coordination number four and a square planar configuration. It is bound to the peptide at the terminal N(amino) and the first three N(peptide) atoms. The amide protons are dissociated from the three metal-binding peptide groups. The fourth peptide group is not deprotonated. Neither it nor the terminal carboxyl group plays any part in the metal binding. The carboxyl group is so oriented that it accepts a weak hydrogen bond from the terminal amino group of the same peptide. In the crystal, complexes related by centers of symmetry form dimers linked by two hydrogen bonds, from the free N(peptide) in each complex to an O(peptide) in the other. In each complex the O(peptide) which is involved in this hydrogen bond is also the atom which makes the closest nonbonding contact (3.17 A) with the copper in the other half of the dimer. The Na+ ions are surrounded by octahedra of oxygen atoms belonging partly to H2O molecules and partly to peptide and carboxyl groups. The octahedra share edges to form blocks of four. The blocks are stacked on top of one another to form columns, and these columns separate regions of the crystal in which the complex anions are stacked."

https://openalex.org/W1577129630,"Abstract When the kinetics of unmasking of certain inaccessible acid-binding groups in native horse ferrihemoglobin (Hb+) is measured in a pH-stat, the results are essentially identical with those obtained by spectrophotometric methods of following denaturation and regeneration. The pH-stat method has therefore been applied to determine the pH profile of the denaturation kinetics and equilibria of globin at a number of temperatures. The acid denaturation of globin is first order and has the same dependence on pH as Hb+, but globin reacts at any pH about 2000 times more rapidly than Hb+; the measurements are therefore made at about 1 pH unit higher than with Hb+. As with apomyoglobin, fewer groups in globin are unmasked than when intact ferrihemoglobin is acid-denatured; it appears that as many as 16 groups may be unmasked when hemin is removed from Hb+. Hb+ reconstituted from globin and hemin has the same absorption spectrum and kinetic properties as the initial material. When protoporphyrin IX (which contains no iron) rather than hemin is complexed with globin under certain narrowly critical conditions, the resulting complex approaches Hb+ in its kinetic stability. The conclusion is drawn that Hb+, unlike such ferrohemoglobins as COHb, derives little of its stability from the highly polar (ionic) iron-nitrogen bond in the ferric protein. Under other conditions of formation, protoporphyrin-globin may consist of more than one complex, each of which has a different stability. Globin and the most stable protoporphyrin-globin complexes behave differently from Hb+ with respect to the effects of temperature on their denaturation rates and equilibria. Two denaturation paths exist in the case of Hb+, one of which prevails at low temperatures and the other at temperatures above 15°. Globin appears to denature by the path characteristic of Hb+ at low temperatures, and protoporphyrin-globin by the reaction path characteristic of Hb+ above 15°."

https://openalex.org/W23886466,"Abstract The kinetics of the reaction of human deoxyhemoglobin with ethylisocyanide has been studied, by rapid mixing, over a 50- to 100-fold range of ligand concentration, both as a function of protein concentration (from 3 to 30 x 10-6 m) and ionic strength (from 0.2 to 2.2 m). The results show that the progress curve, which is autocatalytic at high ligand concentration, tends to change shape as the ethylisocyanide concentration is decreased, and finally becomes markedly diphasic. The experimental results can be fitted satisfactorily with a simple dimer scheme, with only two combination and two dissociation velocity constants. Consideration of these results, in conjunction with other data, allows us to arrive at important conclusions concerning the kinetic origin of co-operativity as observed at equilibrium. The most significant of these is that, to a major degree, cooperative ligand binding finds its kinetic justification in a large decrease of the dissociation velocity constant as the reaction proceeds."

https://openalex.org/W1558683553,"Abstract The acetoacetate decarboxylase obtained from Clostridium acetobutylicum undergoes a biphasic thermal inactivation; the rapid phase of which was temperature sensitive, whereas the slow phase was much less so. ΔHa for the rapid phase of inactivation was 49 kcal per mole. The fraction of the total activity which was lost by the rapid process was increased with increasing temperature. Acetylacetone protected the enzyme against thermal inactivation and was more effective in preventing the rapid phase than in preventing the slow phase of activity loss. When the enzyme was heated until the rapid phase was over and then chilled; subsequent reheating did not result in the reappearance of a rapid phase of inactivation. When the organism was cultured in the presence of benzoylacetone it generated an active decarboxylase which differed from the normal enzyme in several respects. This modified enzyme did not possess any latent activity; was more susceptible to thermal inactivation and exhibited a ΔHa for the rapid phase of thermal inactivation of 104 kcal per mole. A mechanism is proposed to account for the properties of the thermal inactivation of acetoacetic decarboxylase."

The thesaurus is used both for indexing the literature and for retrieving the information stored in the computer. Courses of instruction on selected subjects in ophthalmology have been programmed and form part of the data base. A search of the literature retrieval system by single subject, or by a combination of several subjects chosen from the thesaurus, retrieves the appropriate bibliographic citations. The response to the service offered by the Vision Information Center indicates that the center should expand its facilities to satisfy the needs of its clients."
