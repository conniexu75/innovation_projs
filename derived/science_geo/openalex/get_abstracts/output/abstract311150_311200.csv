https://openalex.org/W2008646949,"By outbreeding Wistar rats and selecting for breeding animals that differ in their alcohol consumption, we have raised two genetically different lines. Marked differences between the sexes and the strains were evident by the eighth generation. Selection is reflected in the regression coefficient .754, which accounts for 65.9 percent of the variance. The heritabilities differ significantly in the two sexes, h2 for the males being .263, and for the females .371; this difference seems mainly ascribable to sex-linkage of some of the genetic factors controlling voluntary consumption of alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W1992114309,"Treatment of human red blood cell membranes with phospholipase C releases 68 to 74 percent of the total membrane phosphorus into solution, through hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to diglycerides and water-soluble phosphorylated amines. In spite of this drastic change, the membrane remains intact in phase microscopy, and the average protein conformation in the membranes, as determined by circular dichroism measurements in the ultraviolet, is unaffected. These results are readily explained by a model of membrane structure that is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and in which the polar and ionic heads of lipids are on the outer surfaces of the membrane, in contact with the bulk aqueous phase and accessible to the action of phospholipase C."

The gain and phase relations between an applied stretch, which initiates the reflex, and the output of the primary muscle spindles, which impinge upon α-motoneurons, are not further changed by the properties of the motoneurons. The dynamic relation between motoneuron activity and the resultant muscle tension balances these changes in gain and phase; the result is a flat gain and nearly zero phase difference between stretch and tension produced by the myotatic reflex. Moreover, the distribution of activity in multiple channels extends the range in which the overall reflex is linear."

Topography indicates that the steps were formed by block faulting. Distribution of the steps and the character of their tops suggest that they originated in the central 2 or 3 kilometers of the valley floor and were subsequently moved outward, uplifted, and tilted along with their underlying blocks as the sea floor spread. Gorda Rise is considered a slowly spreading part of the oceanic-rise system. Studies of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge report features that may be similar uplifted blocks."

For example, boron-based temary compounds for permanent magnets make new compact motor designs practical; amorphous transformer materials show greatly reduced losses at high frequencies; and thin magnetic alloy films offer increased data storage densities. The major technical issues associated with the new magnetic materials are identified."

https://openalex.org/W2091196135,Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in doses of 1.5 to 300 micrograms was given to 55 pregnant rats during periods of organogenesis and on the 4th or 5th day of pregnancy to 34 rats. Examination of the resultant 887 young for congenital defects showed no greater frequency than in controls. These experimtents failed to prove that LSD is teratogenic in rats.
https://openalex.org/W2025241758,"Liver tyrosine alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase has a daily rhythm such that in rats fed on an unrestricted basis the activity is highest at approximately 11:00 p.m. In contrast, rats fed only from 8:00 a.m. to noon show a markedly different rhythm in the enzyme, with maximum activity at 11:00 a.m. Controlling the time of food intake seems to be a useful means of studying the mechanism of the daily changes in this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2021589660,"Hemoglobin Rainier, a new hemoglobin variant associated with erythrocytosis, was found in six members of a Caucasian family. Structurally, it represents substitution of histidine for the invariant residue H23 tyrosine in the β-hemoglobin polypeptide chain (β145 tyrosine → histidine). Hemoglobin Rainier is the first example of a single amino acid substitution in adult human hemoglobin, causing increased resistance to alkali denaturation."

https://openalex.org/W2014062068,"The Experimental City suggested some years ago is now being planned. Started from scratch, the Experimental City will be unlike other cities or towns that have been built in this way. It will not be a bedroom satellite of an existing city, as some of the New Towns in England have become; nor will it attempt to be an instant utopia. It will be neither a single company town?Hershey, Penn sylvania?nor a single occupation town?Oak Ridge, Manned Space Center, Los Alamos, Chandrigar, Brazilia, Washington, D. C. The Experimental City should not be confused with demonstra tion or model cities that attempt to show what can be done temporarily to renew old cities. Yet it will experiment with ex tensions of many of the assets and experiences of these. It will attempt to be a city representing a true cross section of people, income, business and industry, recreation, education, health care, and cultural opportunities that are representative of the United States."

https://openalex.org/W1637725829,"Oral administration to a dairy cow of Furadan insecticide (2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-7-benzofuranyl N-methylcarbamate) labeled with carbon-14 on the carbonyl produced in the milk certain radioactive materials which were not Furadan metabolites. The data suggest that these products were natural milk constituents containing only the carbon-14 atom from the Furadan molecule. Carbon-14-labeled carbon dioxide formed by the hydrolysis of the carbamate insecticide is the apparent precursor of these radiolabeled constituents of the milk."
https://openalex.org/W1976186905,"Human metmyoglobin was separated electrophoretically into four subfractions: Mb(1), Mb(2), Mb(3), and Mb(4), which divide into at least two biochemically independent groups: Mb(1) and Mb(2), and Mb(3), and Mb(4). In normal subjects, Mb(1) constituted the predominant component; Mb(2), Mb(3), and Mb(4) were the minor components in this descending order. In the Duchenne type of progressive muscular dystrophy, on the contrary, a remarkable decrease in Mb(1) and a concomitant increase in Mb(3) were observed. This unique abnormality in the relative distribution of myoglobin subfractions was recognized only in the Duchenne type and not in other types of progressive muscular dystrophy or in other myopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2057027501,"When cats are subjected to an atmosphere of 100 percent oxygen at a sufficiently low pressure, their sleeping patterns are changed: paradoxical sleep disappears and drowsiness increases. This change appears when the pressure decreases to a level close to that at which the hemoglobin begins to dissociate. Return of a cat to a normal atmosphere produces a rebound: the cat spends more time in paradoxical sleep than it did during the base-line period. This finding suggests that a mechanism, closely related to the metabolism of oxygen in the brain, must play an important role in the production of paradoxical sleep. Yet the increase in paradoxical sleep after decompression indicates that still other mechanisms must merge to produce paradoxical sleep."
