https://openalex.org/W2059694820,"We determined the nucleotide sequence of DNA segments containing functional centromeres (CEN3 and CEN11) isolated from yeast chromosomes III and XI. The two centromere regions differ in primary nucleotide sequence, but contain structural features in common. Both centromere regions contain an extremely A + T-rich core segment 87-88 bp in length, flanked by two short sequences (14 bp and 11 bp) that are identical in both DNAs. These elements plus one additional 10 bp region of perfect homology are positioned in an almost identical spatial arrangement within the two centromere regions. Significant homologies are also observed among the sequences flanking the high A + T region and various satellite DNA sequences from higher eucaryotes, although no repeated sequences occur near the yeast centromeres. Centromere activity in vivo is maintained on relatively small DNA fragments (627 bp for CEN3 and 858 bp for CEN11), as assayed by mitotic stabilization of autonomously replicating ars plasmids in yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1498690712,"alpha-Sarcin is a cytotoxic protein that inhibits eukaryotic elongation factor 1 catalyzed binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to eukaryotic ribosomes as a result of cleaving a fragment from the large RNA in the 60 S ribosomal subunit. Rat liver polysomes are sensitive to alpha-sarcin in vitro only if the treatment is carried out in the presence of EDTA. The oligonucleotide produced by alpha-sarcin action on rat liver ribosomes is derived from the 3' end of 28 S rRNA and has a molecular weight of approximately 161,000 (about 488 bases). The sequence at the site of cleavage (the 5' end of the oligonucleotide produced by alpha-sarcin action on rat liver ribosomes) was AGGAAC for both rat liver 28 S rRNA and yeast 25 S rRNA. Based on the size of the alpha-fragment derived from Escherichia coli ribosomes (about 243 nucleotides), it is likely that a similar sequence, AGGACC, occurs at the site of cleavage of prokaryotic 23 S rRNA. It is also likely that the sequence on the 5' side of the alpha-sarcin cleavage site is UAGUACGAG. The sequence UAGUACGAGAGGAAC must be important because it is conserved and because hydrolysis of a single phosphodiester bond there inactivates the ribosome. We suggest that this region of the large nucleic acid in the 60 S subparticle is involved in binding aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, first, because it is the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 catalyzed reaction that is inhibited by alpha-sarcin, and second, because peptidyl-tRNA seems to protect polysomes against the toxin. The function of EDTA appears to be to remove peptidyl-tRNA since puromycin also sensitizes polysomes to alpha-sarcin."
https://openalex.org/W2045347928,"It has been shown that the establishment of urinary tract infection by Escherichia coli is dependent on attachment of the bacteria to epithelial cells1–4. The attachment involves specific epithelial cell receptors, which have been characterized as glycolipids5–10. Reversible binding to cell-surface mannosides may also be important4,11–13. This suggests an approach to the treatment of infections—that of blocking bacterial attachment with cell membrane receptor analogues. Using E. coli mutants lacking one or other of the two binding specificities (glycolipid and mannose), we show here that glycolipid analogues can block in vitro adhesion and in vivo urinary tract infection."
https://openalex.org/W1603856432,"The glucose transport activity associated with the plasma membrane-rich and Golgi-rich fractions of fat cells was determined after they were reconstituted into egg lecithin liposomes. When the two subcellular fractions were isolated under conditions that would minimize their cross-contamination, the transport activity in the plasma membrane-rich fraction was found to be increased 6.3- to 8.6-fold by insulin, which was added to cells before homogenization, and that the activity in the Golgi-rich fraction was reduced approximately to one-half. In this study, the glucose transport activity in the plasma membrane-rich fraction (either in the basal or plus insulin state) was solubilized, reconstituted, and assayed with an overall efficiency of 25-35%. Four agents known to have insulin-like effects on the glucose transport activity in intact fat cells (hydrogen peroxide, sodium vanadate, trypsin, and p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate) not only increased the transport activity in the plasma membrane-rich fraction, but also decreased the activity in the Golgi-rich fraction. The effect of hydrogen peroxide, unlike that of insulin, was not abolished when the insulin receptor was modified proteolytically. Upon administration of insulin to fat cells, and subsequent elimination of the hormone, the glucose transport activities associated with the plasma membrane-rich and Golgi-rich fractions were affected almost concomitantly towards opposite directions. It is proposed as a working hypothesis that translocation of the glucose transport system to the plasma membrane from the Golgi-rich fraction is the major, if not the sole, mechanism by which insulin stimulates glucose transport in fat cells."
https://openalex.org/W1564095880,"Avian luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) has been isolated from 249,000 chicken hypothalami and shown to differ structurally from mammalian hypothalamic LH-RH. Purification was achieved by acetic acid extraction, anti-LH-RH affinity chromatography, and cation exchange and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The isolated peptide eluted as a single peak on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Acid hydrolysis of the peptide yielded integral molar ratios of amino acids and a composition identical with that of mammalian decapeptide LH-RH, except for the presence of an additional glutamic acid residue and the absence of arginine. The isoelectric point of chicken LH-RH (7.3) is consistent with the glutamic acid representing a glutamine residue. We therefore synthesized [Gln8]LH-RH and established that it has chromatographic properties identical with natural chicken LH-RH. These studies indicate that the structure of chicken hypothalamic LH-RH is: pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Gln-Pro-Gly-NH2."
https://openalex.org/W2149068919,"The complete amino acid sequence of the cell attachment domain of human plasma fibronectin (Pierschbacher, M. D., Hayman, E. G., and Ruoslahti, E. (1981) Cell 26, 259-267) has been determined by automated sequential degradation of a peptic fragment comprising this region and of peptides derived from this fragment by digestion with thermolysin, staphylococcal V8 protease, cyanogen bromide cleavage, and partial acid hydrolysis. The fragment contains 108 residues with isoleucine and methionine as the NH2- and carboxyl-terminal amino acids, respectively. No cysteines are present. The calculated molecular weight of the cell attachment fragment, based on the amino acid sequence, is 11,482, which is in good agreement with the molecular weight estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. There are no homologies in this fragment with other published sequences. The implications of the structure of the cell attachment fragment to the molecular mechanism of cell-fibronectin interaction are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2027174789,"As visualized by electron microscopy, RecA protein binds in a highly cooperative manner to single-stranded fd DNA in solutions of 0.01 M Tris (pH 7.5). The resulting nucleoprotein filament loops are 1.25 micrometers in length, have a fiber diameter of 12 nm and show an indication of a 4.5 nm repeat along the axis of the compact fibers. RecA binds to linear duplex fd DNA in solutions of 0.01 M Tris (pH 7.5) to yield chains of beads which, in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, coalesce into smooth filaments with a length of 1.9 micrometers (the length of protein-free fd duplex DNA) and have a fiber diameter of 12 nm. In solutions containing Mg2+ and ATP-gamma-S, however, RecA binds to duplex DNA in a highly cooperative manner to yield rigid filaments 3.0 micrometers in length. These filaments are 12 nm in diameter and show a very clear 7.5 nm axial repeat. This extension of DNA to 150% of its usual length in the apparent absence of any single-stranded components suggests that the DNA helix must also be highly unwound and provides new insights into the mode of RecA action."
https://openalex.org/W1505215090,"Rat liver glucosidase II, an endoplasmic reticulum hydrolase involved in the biosynthesis of the N-linked class of glycoproteins, has been purified in good yield to a state approaching homogeneity. The purified enzyme hydrolyzes p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, maltose, and the precursor oligosaccharides glucose1-2mannose9N-acetylglucosamine, but it does not act on glucose3mannose9N-acetylglucosamine or p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The ratio of the rate at which glucose is released from p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside to that from glucose2mannose9N-acetylglucosamine or glucose1mannose9N-acetylglucosamine remains constant throughout the 8-step purification procedure; thus it appears that a single enzyme is responsible for the activities toward both the artificial and oligosaccharide substrates. The fact that the enzyme cleaves both of the inner 1,3-linked glucosyl residues from the precursor oligosaccharides supports the view that they are linked in the alpha-configuration. The pH dependence of enzymatic activity is quite similar for different substrates, showing a broad optimum between pH 6 and 7.5. Activity toward p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside is enhanced by 12 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (260-300% activation) and 25 mM mannose (150% activation), but these two compounds inhibit the action of the enzyme toward the precursor oligosaccharides. By isoelectrofocusing the purified enzyme exhibits one form, which has a pI of 3.5-3.8. Reductive polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate indicates that glucosidase II has a subunit molecular weight of 65,000. Ferguson plot analysis of the behavior of native enzyme in polyacrylamide gels indicates that it is a 262,000-dalton tetramer. Gel filtration gives a molecular weight of 288,000. Several lines of evidence indicate that the enzyme is a glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1566509230,"The protein complement of the bovine mitochondrial ribosome has been analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels to determine the number and molecular weights of the ribosomal proteins. Salt-washed ribosomal subunits are found to contain a total of 85 ribosomal proteins, 84 of which are electrophoretically distinct between the two subunits. These proteins are also electrophoretically distinguished from those of cytoplasmic ribosomes. This large number of proteins does not appear to be due to contamination by cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins or by adherent nonribosomal proteins. The molecular weights of these proteins are considerably larger than those of Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins, and are similar to those of bovine cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. The sum of the molecular weights of the 85 proteins agrees well with that predicted by physical chemical measurements of the total mass of protein in the two subunits. Bovine mitochondrial ribosomes thus contain about twice as much protein as RNA, a highly unusual composition in comparison to the other kinds of ribosomes which have been characterized to date. In addition, it appears that the ribosomal proteins themselves are less basic than the proteins of most other ribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1518996810,"Glycosylation of asparagine residues of glycoproteins occurs by the transfer of a glucose3mannose9N-acetylglucosamine2 (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) oligosaccharide from a lipid carrier to the nascent protein. Normally, this transfer is quickly followed by the stepwise removal of the glucose residues which are arranged in the sequence: Glc1 leads to 2Glc1 leads to 3Glc1 leads to 3Man. We now report studies which demonstrate that a lectin-resistant mutant of the BW5147 mouse lymphoma cell line is deficient in the enzyme which removes the two inner glucose residues. This cell line (PHAR2.7) was selected for resistance to the cytotoxic effects of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinating lectin (Trowbridge, I. S., Hyman, R., Ferson, T., and Mazauskas, C. (1978) Eur. J. Immunol. 8, 716-723). Glycopeptides prepared from cells equilibrium-labeled with either [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]galactose were characterized using lectin affinity chromatography, treatment with specific endo- and exoglycosidases, sizing by paper chromatography, and methylation analysis. Approximately 50% of the radioactivity in [3H]mannose-labeled glycopeptides from the mutant cells is present as glucosylated high mannose-type oligosaccharides whereas parent cell glycopeptides labeled under similar conditions lack detectable amounts of these species. Using [3H]galactose labeling, the major glucosylated oligosaccharides were identified as Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc2Man8GlcNAc2. In vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that the mutant cells cannot remove either of the two inner 1 leads to 3-linked glucose residues. Removal of the outer 1 leads to 3-linked glucose is normal. We conclude from these data that the PHAR2.7 cell line is deficient in glucosidase II, the enzyme which removes the two inner glucose residues from the oligosaccharides of newly glycosylated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1491683643,"The endodermal cell line PF-HR9, derived from the murine teratocarcinoma cell line PCC4-F, was grown as monolayers and as cell clusters called embryoid bodies. Procollagen IV and laminin were isolated from both kinds of culture media. Antibodies specific to collagen IV and to laminin demonstrated these materials in association with the cells and in the culture media. The procollagen IV consisted of pro alpha 1 IV and pro alpha 2 IV chains and gave a circular dichroic spectrum characteristic for collagen helices, with thermal transitions at 40, 44, and 51 degrees C. The molecules were visualized electron microscopically after rotary shadowing. Laminin showed the characteristic beaded cross-appearance, and procollagen IV was a 434 +/- 12-nm long linear thread containing a 17-nm carboxyl-terminal knob. The 7% of collagen helix with Tm = 51 degrees C corresponds to about a 30-nm length of the molecule and is probably that section of the amino end through which several procollagen IV molecules form a junctional complex. Several noncovalent associations of procollagen IV molecules were demonstrated by velocity sedimentation and electron microscopy of concentrated culture media, specifically associations of two and four procollagen IV molecules through their amino ends and dimers linked at their carboxyl ends. The results show that procollagen IV molecules associate noncovalently into the components which others have isolated from basement membranes and strongly support a network model of these supramolecular assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W1576620622,"Following incubation of sealed, right side out, rat liver Golgi-derived vesicles with a mixture of [3H]GDP-fucose and GDP-[14C]fucose, the difference in the 3H to 14C ratio between the incubation medium and the lumen of the vesicles was less than 11%, suggesting that the sugar nucleotide was transported intact into the vesicles. Transport of GDP-fucose weas temperature-dependent, saturable, with an apparent Km of 7.5 microM and a Vmax of 14 pmol/mg of protein/10 min and inhibited by substrate analogues. Pretreatment of intact Golgi vesicles with pronase inhibited transport by 80% under conditions in which sialyltransferases (a lumenal marker) were not inhibited. This result is consistent with a sugar nucleotide carrier protein, portions of which face the cytoplasmic side of Golgi vesicles. Previous studies from this laboratory had shown that CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) could penetrate mouse liver microsomes in a manner suggesting carrier-mediated transport (Carey, D. J., Sommers, L. W., and Hirschberg, C. B. (1980) Cell 19, 597-605). Subsequent to transport, a portion of the N-acetylneuraminic acid moiety became covalently linked to proteins facing the lumen of Golgi vesicles (Carey, D. J., and Hirschberg, C. B. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 989-993). Upon subfractionation of rat liver into vesicles derived from the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, both the highest CMP-NeuAc specific transport activity and total transport activity were localized in the Golgi. Any transport activity in the other vesicles could be accounted for by contamination with Golgi, as determined by established marker enzyme activities. Transport of CMP-NeuAc was temperature-dependent, inhibited by pronase, substrate analogues, and saturable, with an apparent Km of 2.4 microM and a Vmax of 150 pmol/mg of protein/10 min."
https://openalex.org/W2095084216,"The ability of tumor cells to metastasize may be related to their ability to promote aggregation of host platelets. The use of inhibitors of cysteine proteinases resulted in parallel inhibition of B16 amelanotic melanoma-induced platelet aggregation and of a cathepsin B activity. The antimetastatic agent prostacyclin inhibited platelet aggregation induced by the tumor cells and by papain, a cathepsin B-mimicking agent."
https://openalex.org/W1568976198,"L-Glutamine markedly enhances insulin release evoked by L-leucine in rat pancreatic islets. The metabolic situation found in the islets exposed to both L-glutamine and L-leucine was investigated. L-Leucine slightly decreased the rate of L-glutamine deamidation, inhibited the conversion of glutamate to 2-ketoglutarate by transamination, increased the oxidative deamination of L-glutamate, stimulated the recirculation of 2-ketoglutarate to glutamate and inhibited the further oxidative metabolism of 2-ketoglutarate. L-Glutamine slightly decreased the rate of L-leucine conversion to 2-ketoisocaproate, but inhibited more severely the conversion of 2-ketoisocaproate to acetoacetate and CO2. Several of these findings appeared attributable to activation of glutamate dehydrogenase by L-leucine. When allowance was made for the influence of exogenous amino acids on the oxidation of endogenous fatty acids, a close parallelism was found between the rate of generation of reducing equivalents or O2 uptake and the insulin secretory response to L-leucine and/or L-glutamine. These findings reinforce the view that the process of nutrient-stimulated insulin release coincides with and may be attributable to an increase in catabolic fluxes in the islet cells."

https://openalex.org/W1587268699,"We have previously reported a signal peptidase activity in Escherichia coli cell envelope which processes prolipoprotein modified with glyceride (Tokunaga, M., Tokunaga, H., and Wu, H. C. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 2255-2259). To ascertain whether the processing enzyme for prolipoprotein is distinct from the signal peptidase for M13 procoat protein purified by Zwizinski and Wickner (Zwizinski, C., and Wickner, W. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7973-7977), we have used antibody against purified procoat protein signal peptidase to study the processings of prolipoprotein and M13 procoat protein in vitro. the signal peptidase for modified prolipoprotein remained fully active in solubilized membrane preparations which had been treated with antibody against purified procoat protein signal peptidase whereas the activity towards procoat protein was completely abolished by immunoadsorption. Furthermore, both unmodified and glyceride-modified prolipoprotein were not cleaved by the highly purified signal peptidase preparation provided by Wickner. These data clearly indicate that prolipoprotein signal peptidase is distinct from the M13 procoat protein signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1494763961,"The role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of pancreatic function by carbachol, cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK8), and insulin was investigated using isolated pancreatic acini of the mouse. Carbachol and CCK8 increased the phosphorylation of a Mr = 32,500 particulate protein and Mr = 16,000 and 23,000 soluble proteins. These agents also caused the dephosphorylation of Mr = 21,000 and 20,500 soluble proteins. Alterations in phosphorylation produced by carbachol were dose-dependent (maximal at 1-3 microM) and consistent with the dose-response relationship for carbachol-induced amylase secretion. Maximal dephosphorylation of the Mr = 21,000 and 20,500 proteins occurred within 1 min of addition of carbachol and was concurrent with the first detectable stimulation of amylase cyclase by carbachol. Moreover, atropine inhibition of carbachol-induced amylase secretion was concurrent with reversal of dephosphorylation of these two proteins. The calcium ionophore A23187, which mimicks the actions of carbachol and CCK8 on the pancreas, also mimicked the effects of these agents on protein phosphorylation, suggesting that pancreatic protein phosphorylation is regulated by calcium. Insulin, which enhances many of the actions of carbachol and CCK8 on the pancreas, alone increased the phosphorylation of the Mr = 16,000, 23,000, and 32,500 proteins and enhanced in an additive manner the effects of carbachol and CCK8 on the latter two proteins. By contrast, phosphorylation of the Mr = 21,000 or 20,500 proteins was not altered by insulin either in the absence or presence of carbachol or CCK8. In conclusion, the results suggest that alterations in phosphorylation of specific acinar cell proteins may provide a mechanism by which hormones and neurotransmitters interact in the regulation of pancreatic function."
https://openalex.org/W1498462216,"Nucleoplasm prepared from murine erythroleukemia cells was assayed from enzymatic activity which removes methyl groups from DNA methylated at the internal C of the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' (Hpa II sites). Under the conditions of assay, the release of methyl groups was linear with time for 1 h, and up to 2 pmol could be released per microgram of extract protein. The activity was proportional to the amount of added extract and was sensitive to heat ant to proteinase K exposure. The initial velocity was hyperbolic with increasing amounts of substrate, and the Km for methyl groups was estimated to be between 1 and 1.5 microM. These results show that DNA demethylation catalyzed by extracts from cell nuclei can occur in vitro where no DNA synthesis is occurring and suggest that such a process might occur in vivo to alter DNA methylation during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1533117992,"A strong homology was found between the amino acid sequences, deduced from DNA nucleotide sequences, of cytoplasmic membrane-associated components of the high affinity histidine transport system of Salmonella typhimurium (coded by the hisP gene) and the maltose-maltodextrin transport system of Escherichia coli (coded by the malK gene). When the HisP protein sequence was aligned with that of the NH2-terminal two-thirds of the MalK protein, 32% of the positions were identical, and an additional 35% were occupied by functionally similar amino acid residues. These results suggest that some, and possibly many, periplasmic-binding protein-dependent transport systems have evolved from a common ancestral system."
https://openalex.org/W1585268399,The alpha-galactoside transport system of Escherichia coli utilizes either H+ of Na+ as a coupling cation for melibiose transport. Mutants were isolated which showed altered cation recognition for melibiose transport. The transport carrier of the mutants has lost the ability to accept H+ but can utilize either Na/ or Li+ for co-transport with melibiose. Such mutants might be predicted if the melibiose carrier were viewed as a descendant of an evolutionary transition between the H+-substrate co-transport systems of primitive cells and the Na+-substrate systems of more complex organisms. A second mutation was found in these mutants which involves the Na+ (Li+)-H+ exchange carrier. The maximal rate of Li+-H+ exchange in one of the mutants was 11 times higher than the parent and the Km for Li+ by this carrier was one-sixth that of the parent.
https://openalex.org/W2070781286,"The National Cancer Chemotherapy Program was initiated in 1955. It is administered and integrated by the Division of Cancer Treatment at the National Cancer Institute. The program involves the discovery and development of potential new antitumor agents; their screening in preclinical experimental systems for antitumor effect, and, if active, for toxicology; and, for selected agents, preliminary, and more definitive clinical trials. While serendipity and empiricism played a substantial role in the early years of the program, the program has increasingly emphasized and been influenced by advances in tumor biology, drug development, clinical pharmacology, and the science of clinical trials. There has been effective interaction between investigator-initiated research on the one hand and developmental research at preclinical and clinical levels on the other. Over 30 chemotherapeutic agents with substantial clinical antitumor activity have been discovered, and their proper use, often in combination and often integrated with surgery or radiotherapy, has resulted in significant progress in the effective treatment of many forms of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1505295310,"We have studied the metabolism of insulin to peptide intermediates which arise during the early stages of cellular hormone processing. [125I]Iodoinsulin (prepared by direct radioiodination of the hormone) and [(125I)iodotyrosylB1]insulin (prepared by semisynthetic procedures and indirect radioiodination) were used as specific probes for the metabolic fates of the A and B chain domains of the hormone, respectively. Incubation of the A chain-labeled probe with isolated rat hepatocytes and subsequent analysis of the cell-associated products revealed low amounts of several insulin-derived peptides. Mapping of these insulin fragments by chemical and enzymatic modification, electrophoresis, and autoradiography showed that they result from specific cleavages in both chains of the hormone. Two A chain-labeled fragments containing residues A14 to A20-21 in disulfide linkage to COOH-terminal portions of the insulin B chain were identified among the cell-associated metabolites. Other products contained intact A chains yet their elution positions during gel filtration were distinct from the position of [125I]iodoinsulin. Incubation of [(125I)iodotyrosylB1]insulin with hepatocytes resulted in cell-associated products containing a set of B chain-labeled fragments complementary to those described above. Structural analysis showed that these metabolites result from sequential cleavage of the insulin molecule at three sites between the interchain disulfide bonds of the B chain domain. Taken together, these A and B chain-labeled peptides form a series of cell-associated and structurally related metabolites. They likely represent the intermediate products which arise during the cellular processing of insulin."

The extracts, prepared via spheroplasts and depleted of endogenous mRNA with nuclease, translate exogenous natural mRNA and polyuridylic acid. The activity of wt A364A with respect to translation of yeast mRNA, poly(U)-dependent synthesis of polyphenylalanine which measures elongation components, reactions involved in the initiation of protein synthesis, and termination and release of polypeptides, is not significantly affected when spheroplasts are incubated at 39 degrees C for relatively short periods of time, prior to the preparation of the cell-free system. With extracts obtained from ts 187 cells, preincubation of spheroplasts at 39 degrees C prior to the preparations of the cell-free system markedly decreases the ability to translate natural mRNA but not poly(U). Compared to extracts from unheated spheroplasts, the following activities in ts 187 extracts from spheroplasts preincubated at 39 degrees C are not significantly affected: activation of methionine and methionylation of tRNAMet; formation of (eukaryotic initiation factor 2.Met-tRNAf.GTP] ternary complex; binding of mRNA to 40S preinitiation intermediate containing Met-tRNAf, and joining of 60S subunits to form the 80S initiation complex; elongation factor 1- and elongation factor 2-dependent elongations reactions; and termination and release of completed polypeptide chains. However, the interaction between the [eukaryotic initiation factor 2.Met-tRNAf.GTP] ternary complex and 40 S subunits, to form the 40 S preinitiation complex, is drastically inhibited by treatment of the spheroplasts at 39 degrees C."

The cells synthesized and secreted into the culture medium collagenous proteins with apparent molecular weights of 220,000 and 150,000. These were identified as the pro alpha 1 and pro alpha 2 chains of type V collagen by immunoprecipitation and by peptide mapping. The pro alpha 1(V) chain was made in excess of a 2:1 ratio for pro alpha 1(V) to pro alpha 2(V), and a fraction of the pro alpha 1(V) chains together with all of the pro alpha 2(V) chains participated in intermolecular disulfide bonding. The chains were extensively glycosylated at hydroxylysyl residues in ascorbate-supplemented cultures. A fraction of the secreted pro alpha 1(V) chains was processed to the p alpha 1(V) form, but further processing in the culture medium was very slow and the type V collagen molecules deposits in the extracellular matrix apparently retained large non-triple helical domains. Since the A204 cell line does not produce other collagen types, it may prove useful in further studies of the biosynthesis of type V procollagen."

We prepared antibody to highly purified alpha-mannosidase from the spent medium of stationary phase cultures. It precipitated alpha-mannosidase but not beta-hexosaminidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, or any of the major proteins in cell lysates or secretions. The antibody precipitated a 150,000- and an 80,000-dalton protein in addition to mature forms (56,000-62,000 daltons) of alpha-mannosidase subunits. The possibility that the 150,000 and 80,000 dalton bands were precursors of mature forms was evaluated by pulse-chase experiments. Following a 20-min pulse labeling period, only the 150,000-dalton protein was detected in the immunoprecipitate. Apparent conversion of this form into 80,000- and 60,000-dalton forms was observed following a 30-min chase. During the next 90 min continued accumulation of 60,000-dalton and appearance of 62,000-dalton forms was observed while the 80,000-dalton form disappeared. The fate of the 150,000-dalton precursor depended on nutritional conditions. In cells conditioned with fresh growth medium intracellular processing predominated. Less than 10% of either the precursor or mature forms was secreted in 8 hr. However, when cells were shifted from growth medium to starvation buffer, secretion of precursor soon predominated. After a 1-hr lag period, cells began secreting 150,000-dalton precursor into the medium. After 4 hr in starvation buffer, the rate of secretion of 150,000-dalton form increased by at least an order of magnitude while processing was markedly diminished. This may be a case where nutritional conditions control the sorting of an acid hydrolase precursor."

To determine if the mod5-1 mutation affects mitochondrial tRNA structure, the migration of mitochondrial tRNA from mod5-1 and wild type cells has been compared by reverse-phase chromatography. We conclude from this analysis that the single nuclear mutation that affects the isopentenylation of cytoplasmic tRNA also affects the isopentenylation of mitochondrial tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1553294700,"Homopolymer replication systems and measurement of precise product chain length have been used to elucidate two new points about the mechanism of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I large fragment: chain termination as a function of product chain length is multiphasic, and polynucleotides exert a secondary effect in the mechanism of this enzyme. During replication of (dT)800 or (dA)800 with short oligonucleotides as primer, DNA polymerase I large fragment was processive, catalyzing hundreds of dNMP incorporations during each cycle of binding to the template-primer, incorporation, and termination. Our observations indicated, however, that polynucleotides could terminate chain elongation and that this effect probably occurred through interaction at a secondary binding site on the enzyme. Thus, in the presence of higher levels of template-primer, early termination occurred and the relatively short product molecules could be resolved by gel electrophoresis. Incubation conditions were adjusted so that the number of product molecules at each chain length was equal to the actual number of termination events, and, therefore, the statistical chance for termination as a function of product chain length could be calculated. These termination probability values depended upon specific incubation conditions, such as dNTP level and whether the primer was a ribo- or deoxyribonucleotide, and interestingly, the values changed as the chain length of the product increased. For the first 5 to 10 dMP residues added to the primer, termination probability declined with each dNMP addition, but then remained constant for the addition of the next 20 to 40 dNMP residues. These results are discussed in the context of a kinetic model representing two stages of synthesis during the formation of each product molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1522256835,"Administration of bacterial endotoxin to rats exposed to greater than 95% O2 results in increased lung superoxide dismutase activity, decreased O2-induced lung damage, and a 3- to 4-fold improvement in survival rate (Frank, L., Yam, J., and Roberts, R. J. (1978) J. Clin. Invest, 61, 269-275). Antibodies to rat liver (Cu,Zn) superoxide dismutase were prepared and utilized to investigate the mechanism by which endotoxin treatment leads to increased lung superoxide dismutase activity. Assay of enzyme activity and of immunodetectable enzyme showed that the increased activity is due to an increase in the number of enzyme molecules rather than activation of existing enzyme. Compared to air controls, lung slices from rats exposed to greater than 95% O2 and treated with endotoxin have elevated rats of synthesis of (Cu,Zn)superoxide dismutase (51%) and of total protein (100%). Lung slices from untreated rats exposed to greater than 95% O2 have no such elevations. Endotoxin treatment thus appears to stimulate lung protein synthesis, leading to greater (Cu,Zn)superoxide dismutase activity due to an increased number of enzyme molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1489106209,"Cells of Escherichia coli K12 strain MM18 accumulate precursors of various exported proteins when the synthesis of the malE-lacZ hybrid protein is induced by maltose. Starting from a soluble cell extract of this strain, the precursor form of the maltose-binding protein, a periplasmic protein, was purified to homogeneity. The procedure includes affinity chromatography on cross-linked amylose and chromatofocusing. The purified precursor has an intact signal sequence at the NH2 terminus. It is soluble in aqueous buffer probably in monomeric state and is proteolytically processed by the leader peptidase, which was previously purified by Wickner and co-workers as an enzyme that processes M13 phage procoat protein."
https://openalex.org/W1565711624,"The magnesium ion dependencies of several of the reaction rates for assembly of the Escherichia coli protein synthesis initiation complex have been determined as well as the effects of IF-3 (initiation factor 3) on the overall reaction of 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits. The reaction kinetics were studied by light-scattering changes as well as by changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of dansylated-IF-3. The full model for treating these processes consists of four reactions, three of which are thermodynamically independent. Conditions were chosen and techniques were employed that allowed three of the reactions to be studied individually. This allowed us to fit, with a single adjustable rate constant, all of the light-scattering changes that occurred upon flowing 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits against varying concentrations of both Mg2+ and IF-3. Preparations of IF-3 were found to react toward 30 S subunits with either of two markedly different binding rates. We find that the simplest model that explains both the light-scattering and anisotropy data for all IF-3 experiments is one that includes as a necessary step the association of 30 S-IF-3 with 50 S subunits to form a 70 S-IF-3 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1533316495,"The structure of carbohydrate chains of dog gastric mucus glycoprotein bearing Forssman antigenic determinant was investigated. The reduced oligosaccharides obtained by alkaline borohydride reductive cleavage of the glycoprotein were chromatographed on a immunoaffinity column containing monoclonal anti-Forssman antibody coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B. The bound oligosaccharides, eluted from the affinity column with 6 M urea, separated on thin layer chromatography into two major components. These two compounds, representing 92% of the absorbed oligosaccharides, were purified to homogeneity, and their structures and antigenic properties were determined. Based on the results of immunological assays, analysis of sugar composition, sequential degradation with specific glycosidases, and methylation analyses of the intact and enzyme-degraded compounds, we propose the following structures for these oligosaccharides. (formula, see text)."
https://openalex.org/W1606762722,"Recombinant plasmids carrying the structural gene for Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (fol) were mutagenized in vitro and in vivo and were used to transform a suitable recipient strain. Twenty-three transformants were isolated that were able to grow in the presence of high levels of the folate analog trimethoprim, and, in each strain, the resistance determinant was shown to be carried on the plasmid. Three of the strains produced dihydrofolate reductase with an increased Ki value for trimethoprim. DNA sequence analysis showed that the plasmids in these strains had mutations in fol which altered a conserved region of the polypeptide that forms part of the dihydrofolate-binding site. Two other strains had approximately 3-fold elevated dihydrofolate reductase levels, apparently resulting from plasmid copy number mutations. The remaining 18 strains had dihydrofolate reductase levels that were 10-30 times higher than those of the starting strain. Surprisingly, three of these strains had no discernible changes either in plasmid copy number or in the nucleotide sequence of the plasmid fol gene. Sequence analysis of the plasmids in 12 more of the strains revealed mutations in the promoter region adjacent to the fol gene. Most of these mutations occurred in the conserved sequences known as the Pribnow box and the -35 region and increased the homology of these sequences with the consensus E. coli promoter sequence. Strains carrying these plasmids produced a significant fraction of their total cell protein as wild type dihydrofolate reductase and should therefore be useful as sources of the purified enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1519524242,"Glutamate synthase, isolated in apparently homogeneous form (Mr approximately 265,000) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae after 7500-fold purification, is markedly inhibited by homocysteine sulfonamide. Inhibitions competitive with respect to L-glutamine; the apparent Ki value calculated for L-homocysteine sulfonamide is 3.6 microM; the apparent Km value for L-glutamine is 280 microM. The very high affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme, as well as structural considerations, suggest that homocysteine sulfonamide is a transition state inhibitor. The previously reported growth inhibitory properties of homocysteine sulfonamide (Reisner, D. B. (1958) J. Am. Chem. soc. 78, 5102-5104) may be due, at least in part, to inhibition of glutamate synthase. L-Methionine sulfone is also a potent competitive inhibitor, whereas L-albizziin, L-methionine-SR-sulfoximine, and L-methionine-SR-sulfoxide are much less effective inhibitors. S. cerevisiae glutamate synthase, which is composed of two dissimilar subunits, uses NADH exclusively, and exhibits low but definite activity when NH3 is substituted for glutamine."
https://openalex.org/W1567077897,"The selective solubilization of different murine lymphocyte membrane compartments with several nonionic detergents was used to study the subcellular distribution of two distinct forms of lymphocyte cell recognition structures (Ia antigens). Ia antigens were isolated with a monoclonal anti-Ia immunoadsorbent from murine splenocytes that had been solubilized with four different nonionic detergents. Analyses of the immunoprecipitates indicated that Lubrol WX was selectively solubilizing a subpopulation of Ia consisting of mature highly glycosylated alpha and beta polypeptides which were not associated with Ii polypeptide. A second Ia subpopulation consisting of less glycosylated cytoplasmic precursor alpha and beta polypeptides associated with Ii polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from the Lubrol WX-insoluble material after solubilizing this material with Triton X-100. Comparable results were obtained when HLA-DR antigens were similarly isolated from cultured human lymphoblastoid cells. This selective solubilization phenomenon was not unique to Ia antigens. Only mature highly glycosylated H-2K molecules were immunoprecipitated from the Lubrol WX-soluble material while the less glycosylated precursor H-2K molecules were immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100-solubilized Lubrol-insoluble material. These data directly demonstrate that the Ii polypeptide is exclusively associated with the intracellular Ia antigen cytoplasmic precursor molecules. These data also indicate that, under the conditions used in these experiments, Lubrol WX does not completely solubilize integral membrane proteins that have previously been shown to be associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1487501539,"Haptoglobin forms a stable, irreversible complex with hemoglobin. The H chain of haptoglobin, which is the subunit that binds hemoglobin, shows strong sequence homology with the serine protease family. This raises the question of whether hemoglobin binds to the protease-like active site pocket of H chain as the protease inhibitors do with serine proteases. This question can be tested by binding proflavin and thionin to haptoglobin because these dyes are known to interact specifically with serine proteases at the peptide binding site. A single, specific binding site, characteristic of the serine proteases, was found for haptoglobin with association constants for proflavin or 1.4 x 10(3) at pH 7.1 and 8.2 x 10(3) at pH 9.5 and for thionin of 3.5 x 10(3) at pH 7.1. In order to confirm that these dyes are indeed binding to the specificity pocket of haptoglobin, competition experiments with classical serine protease substrates and inhibitors were performed. The results showed that trypsin-specific substrates and inhibitors did compete with proflavin binding, as expected from the homology, and that reagents of a chymotryptic specificity did not. When the dye titrations were performed on haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex, the same binding constants were obtained as for haptoglobin alone. This demonstrates that the active site-like region of haptoglobin and the hemoglobin binding site are mutually exclusive and do not interact in any way."
https://openalex.org/W1542476307,"The M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase contains two kinds of allosteric sites, the activity site and the specificity site, which regulate the overall catalytic activity and the substrate specificity of the enzyme, respectively. The effector nucleotides, dGTP and dTTP, bind only to the specificity site; dATP and ATP bind to both sites. Partially purified protein M1 was photolabeled specifically after UV irradiation in the presence of [32P]dATP. The labeling occurred exclusively at the allosteric specificity site as evidenced by 1) total inhibition of the labeling by dGTP and dTTP, 2) normal photoincorporation of [32P]dATP by mutant protein M1 molecules that lack a functional activity site, and 3) coidentity of one-dimensional peptide maps of protein M1 labeled with either [32P]dATP or [32P]dTTP. A mutant protein M1 that is resistant to normal regulation by dGTP and dTTP (indicating an alteration in the allosteric specificity site) showed normal photoincorporation of [32P]dATP (but not [32P]dTTP). This labeling was not inhibited by dGTP or dTTP. Our data suggest that this mutation has altered the binding of dGTP and dTTP but not dATP (or ATP) at the specificity site. Thus, by the combination of genetic and photolabeling techniques, two independent nucleotide binding interactions occurring within this one complex regulatory domain can be distinguished."
https://openalex.org/W1540116407,"Fluorescence characteristics of tryptophan residues in yeast plasma membrane indicate that the residues are buried. The fluorescence is fully quenchable by iodide with similar quenching kinetics at temperatures from 8 to 37 degrees C in oleate-enriched membranes and from 25 to 37 degrees C in palmitelaidate-enriched membranes. Substantial increases in lipid microviscosity in palmitelaidate-enriched membranes reduce the fraction of quenchable tryptophan fluorescence by about 40% and increase the effective quenching constant 3-fold. These observations indicate that at above 25 degrees C, proteins in this membrane undergo transient conformational changes and that freedom of conformational changes of the proteins is regulated by lipid microviscosity."
https://openalex.org/W1506417755,"The chloroplast leucyl-tRNA synthetase from Phaseolus vulgaris was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and phosphocellulose. Finally, the pure enzyme was obtained after affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose CL-6B using specific elution with a pure Escherichia coli tRNALeu isoacceptor. The specific activity of chloroplast leucyl-tRNA synthetase (1550 units/mg) is the highest ever obtained for a higher plant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The purified enzyme has an optimal pH of 9.0 and Km values are, respectively, 2.6 X 10(-6) M for unfractionated E. coli tRNA, 0.85 X 10(-6) M for E. coli tRNA5Leu, 1.8 X 10(-4) M for ATP, and 1.4 X 10(-5) M for L-leucine. Chloroplast leucyl-tRNA synthetase is a large monomer which has a Mr of 122,000 as determined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea and by gel filtration. Determination of Stokes radius, diffusion coefficient, and frictional ratio suggests that the enzyme structure is rather compact. The amino acid composition shows a relatively large proportion of apolar residues. Specific antibodies were raised in rabbits against the pure chloroplast leucyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1636613585,"Expression of the tryptophan (trp) operon of Escherichia coli was shown to be regulated by attenuation in an in vitro DNA-dependent protein-synthesizing system. In extracts prepared from a temperature-sensitive tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase mutant, plasmid-directed trpE enzyme synthesis was inhibited 2- to 3-fold by addition of purified wild type tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. When the extract used from a strain bearing a trpTts mutation that reduces charging of tRNATrp in vivo, a 2- to 3-fold increase in trpE enzyme synthesis was observed when an excess of uncharged wild type tRNATrp was added. Analysis of attenuation by measurement of trp mRNA synthesis was facilitated by constructing a plasmid (pAD1) containing the rpoC transcription terminator inserted early in trpE. Transcription proceeding past the trp attenuator of this plasmid terminates at this new terminator sequence and results in the production of a approximately 400-nucleotide long read-through transcript. Using this plasmid and extracts prepared from the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase mutant, a 4- to 8-fold decrease in relative read-through transcription was observed in response to exogenously added wild type tryptophanyl-tRNA synthase. Kinetic analyses of trp mRNA synthesis and studies using plasmid template DNAs bearing trp attenuator mutations indicate that translation of the leader peptide coding region of the transcript regulates transcription termination at the trp attenuator."

https://openalex.org/W1518284746,"The deletion of nucleoside 37 from yeast tRNAPhe was accomplished in a three-step procedure that involved (i) specific depurination of this purine under acidic conditions and removal of the carbohydrate moiety with aniline-2-aminopyridine, (ii) removal of phosphate monoesters from the 5'-half-molecule with alkaline phosphatase, and (iii) resealing of the anticodon loop with T4 RNA ligase. The course of the resealing reaction was monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and found to be complete within a few hours when incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of 215 units/ml of RNA ligase. Although the half-molecules used to prepare the modified tRNA had substantial phenylalanine acceptance when assayed at low ionic strength, the modified species itself was essentially devoid of phenylalanine acceptance. We conclude that the anticodon loop of tRNAPhe is involved in the activation of this tRNA and that both the presence of specific nucleotides in this loop and their ability to assume an appropriate spatial or conformational arrangement may be important for enzyme recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1591833303,"Isolated myocytes were prepared from the adult rat heart and characterized for viability. The myocytes were exposed to 125I-insulin, and the 125I-insulin-receptor complex was extracted with 1% Triton X-102 and then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column. When the chromatography were applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column, a 140,000-dalton complex with high specific radioactivity was found. Alternatively, when myocyte insulin receptors were first extracted with 1% Triton X-102 without prior exposure to 125I-insulin and then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column, three peak protein fractions were obtained. They were treated separately with 125I-insulin and the 125I-insulin-protein complexes were covalently cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. The cross-linked samples were applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column and the radioactive protein fractions were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The first and second peak samples from the ion exchange chromatography yielded complexes of low specific radioactivity, which appear to be formed by nonspecific random binding of 125I-insulin to the solubilized membrane proteins. In contrast, Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration of the cross-linked sample from the third peak fractions gave a major highly radioactive 125I-insulin-receptor complex with a molecular weight of 370,000 and a minor complex of low radioactivity with a molecular weight of 140,000. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, the 370,000-dalton complex was dissociated to 130,000- and 82,000-dalton components and the 140,000-dalton complex was dissociated to a 47,000-dalton component."
https://openalex.org/W1999671623,"Gridlike patterns of differing cell density were observed in evenly seeded cell monolayers. Such patterns were obtained in five of six cell lines tested, suggesting widespread occurrence. The mechanism appears to involve small, transient temperature changes related to incubator tray structure. The very short time course of appearance of the patterns implicates attachment rather than growth as the critically affected factor. Impaired adhesion or directed sedimentation resulting from thermally induced microcurrents in the medium are the two most likely mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1510718299,"A technique for site-selective introduction of psoralens into DNA has been developed. Irradiation of Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA with aminomethyltrimethyl psoralen (AMT) at 390 nm leads to the incorporation of AMT monoadducts in double-stranded regions of the RNA, but no cross-links. The AMT-containing RNA hybridizes efficiently to a supercoiled plasmid, pCS3, a derivative of pBR313 containing an insert of part of the E. coli rrnC cistron including the 3' 60% of the 16 S rDNA. When the resulting hybrids are re-irradiated at 360 nm, psoralen cross-links form between the rRNA and the rDNA, resulting in covalent R-loops. These were partially purified and used to transform E. coli after various nuclease treatments, employing an ampicillin selection to make cell survival dependent on successful repair of the psoralen-containing region. S1 nuclease-treated AMT-containing covalent R-looped plasmids show efficient transformation, and 9 mutants with large deletions were isolated by random screening of 100 colonies. These fell into 3 specific classes, each of which appears to start some place within the AMT-cross-linked rDNA. The structure of one mutant has been analyzed by DNA sequencing which shows a deletion which extends approximately 6800 nucleotides from nucleotide 868 of 16 S rDNA to nucleotide 315 on the tetracycline gene. Some hints of symmetry exist around the point of the deletion, but the pattern is not a striking one. This technique should be useful in making covalent D-loops as well as R-loops. It offers a number of potential applications for site-specific DNA modification and studies of DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1516968402,"The bifunctional tryptophan biosynthetic enzyme N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate (PRA) isomerase/indole-3-glycerol phosphate (InGP) synthetase was purified from Escherichia coli cultures incubated under several conditions, some of which result in inactivation of the enzyme (starvation for ammonium or sulfate, chloramphenicol inhibition). Recovery of enzyme activity during purification from cultures incubated under inactivating conditions suggested that activity was restored or that an inhibitor was removed. In these preparations, the enzymatic properties were altered slightly but not in a manner that could account for inactivation. Each preparation exhibited one major protein species (Mr approximately 50,000) when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but revealed several species during isoelectric focusing in the range of pH 5.5 to 6.0. Comparison of the distribution of species indicated that modification to the more acidic forms had occurred in growing and nongrowing cells but not during stationary phase, glucose starvation, or energy depletion. The results suggested that inactivation and modification had occurred in vivo by an energy-dependent process. Several metabolites tested did not inhibit the purified enzyme. Attempts to detect an inhibitor in crude cell extracts were also not successful."
