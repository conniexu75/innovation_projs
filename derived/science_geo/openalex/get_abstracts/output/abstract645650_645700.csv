In practice, however, it is currently too expensive to produce the peroxide ahead of time for this purpose. Jin et al. report a catalyst system that generates and concentrates hydrogen peroxide for immediate reaction with methane. A hydrophobically coated zeolite keeps the peroxide close to the gold and palladium active site, where incoming methane is then selectively oxidized to methanol. Science , this issue p. 193"

Clinically, however, drugs tend to be used empirically, and results can be contradictory. Liu et al. translated observations made in vitro to patient samples to understand the role of antibiotic tolerance in promoting or suppressing resistance when drug combinations are used (see the Perspective by Berti and Hirsch). Although bacterial populations exposed to multiple antibiotics can develop tolerance to multiple drugs, one drug in a combination may be able counter resistance to a partner drug and provide effective therapy. However, if tolerance has already emerged to one drug, the combination may end up promoting the transmission of resistance to a partner drug. Science , this issue p. 200 ; see also p. 141"

One major class of γδ T cells, designated Vγ9Vδ2 + , is activated by small, phosphorylated nonpeptide antigens, or phosphoantigens, produced by microbes and cancer cells. Rigau et al. found that these cells needed the combination of two immunoglobulin superfamily members, butyrophilin 2A1 (BTN2A1) and BTN3A1, on their cell surface to recognize these phosphoantigens. BTN2A1 directly binds the Vγ9 + domain of the T cell receptor (TCR), whereas a second ligand, potentially BTN3A1, binds the Vδ2 and γ-chain regions on the opposite side of the TCR. A better understanding of this unexpected form of T cell antigen recognition should inform and enhance future γδ T cell–mediated immunotherapies. Science , this issue p. eaay5516"

Chen et al. tackled the challenge of identifying the exact location of hydrogen atoms in two common steels. The light weight and high mobility of hydrogen creates serious problems with conventional techniques. The authors used cryo-transfer atom probe tomography to show that hydrogen is pinned to various interfaces in the steels. This direct look into hydrogen trapping should help with the development of materials that are more resistant to hydrogen embrittlement. Science , this issue p. 171"

Several promising materials have been found recently, but diamond remains the bulk material with the highest thermal conductivity. Chen et al. found that isotopically pure cubic boron nitride has an ultrahigh thermal conductivity, 75% that of diamond. Using only boron-11 or boron-10 allows the crystal vibrations that carry heat to move more efficiently through the material. This property could be exploited for better regulating the temperature of high-power devices. Science , this issue p. 555"

Previous attempts using optical and ultraviolet techniques have failed to reveal its key spectroscopic signature during ultrafast transformation into a OH radical. Loh et al. address this gap by using intense, ultrafast x-ray pulses from an x-ray free electron laser at ∼530 electron volts. They found compelling evidence for the formation H 2 O + and its decay to an OH radical by a proton transfer mechanism and elucidated the other fastest–time scale steps in the early-time dynamics of ionized liquid water.

https://openalex.org/W2998827475,"The loss of water from Mars to space is thought to result from the transport of water to the upper atmosphere, where it is dissociated to hydrogen and escapes the planet. Recent observations have suggested large, rapid seasonal intrusions of water into the upper atmosphere, boosting the hydrogen abundance. We use the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to characterize the water distribution by altitude. Water profiles during the 2018-2019 southern spring and summer stormy seasons show that high-altitude water is preferentially supplied close to perihelion, and supersaturation occurs even when clouds are present. This implies that the potential for water to escape from Mars is higher than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W3102063552,"Elementary particles such as the electron carry several quantum numbers, for example, charge and spin. However, in an ensemble of strongly interacting particles, the emerging degrees of freedom can fundamentally differ from those of the individual constituents. Paradigmatic examples of this phenomenon are one-dimensional systems described by independent quasiparticles carrying either spin (spinon) or charge (holon). Here we report on the dynamical deconfinement of spin and charge excitations in real space following the removal of a particle in Fermi-Hubbard chains of ultracold atoms. Using space- and time-resolved quantum gas microscopy, we track the evolution of the excitations through their signatures in spin and charge correlations. By evaluating multi-point correlators, we quantify the spatial separation of the excitations in the context of fractionalization into single spinons and holons at finite temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2999083352,"Tumor DNA sequencing data can be interpreted by computational methods that analyze genomic heterogeneity to infer evolutionary dynamics. A growing number of studies have used these approaches to link cancer evolution with clinical progression and response to therapy. Although the inference of tumor phylogenies is rapidly becoming standard practice in cancer genome analyses, standards for evaluating them are lacking. To address this need, we systematically assess methods for reconstructing tumor subclonality. First, we elucidate the main algorithmic problems in subclonal reconstruction and develop quantitative metrics for evaluating them. Then we simulate realistic tumor genomes that harbor all known clonal and subclonal mutation types and processes. Finally, we benchmark 580 tumor reconstructions, varying tumor read depth, tumor type and somatic variant detection. Our analysis provides a baseline for the establishment of gold-standard methods to analyze tumor heterogeneity. Methods for reconstructing tumor evolution are benchmarked in the DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Tumour Heterogeneity Challenge."

During various processes in the body, nitrates are converted into nitrites, which causes various diseases, such as blue baby syndrome and cancer. This study aimed to determine the concentration of nitrates in several vegetable farms in Sanandaj city and to evaluate their health-related risks.This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2017 to July 2018. A total of 90 samples were taken from nine farms. Soil and water sampling was also carried out. All stages of sample preparation and extraction were carried out according to Food Standards 2-16721, and the nitrate measurements were performed using ion chromatography (Compact IC Plus 882 Model, Metrohm, Switzerland). A health risk assessment was performed using the non-carcinogenic risk assessment.This study's results showed that the nitrate concertation in all vegetables was less than National Iranian Vegetable Nitrate Standard. Nitrate levels in leafy vegetables were higher than in root vegetables, and the root vegetables levels were higher than those in Fruit vegetable. The nitrate level in vegetables in autumn was higher than in spring. The cooking process reduced the raw vegetables' nitrate content from 4.094% to 13.407%, while the frying process increased the vegetables' nitrate content from 12.46% to 29.93%. The highest health risk level in raw, cooked and fried vegetables was parsley, parsley and beet leaves, respectively, and the lowest in all categories was tomatoes. Generally, the highest health risk was related to fried beet leaves, and the lowest was raw tomatoes. In addition, each of the abovementioned relationships between vegetables' nitrate levels and the harvest season, type of processing procedure and type of vegetables was significant (p < 0.05). The irrigation water's nitrate concentration in all fields was between 12.36 and 33.14 mg/l. The soil contained nitrate levels of between 4.35 and 9.7 mg/kg.Based on this study, we can conclude that the amount of nitrates in raw vegetables was lower than the standard limit's level and that this level does not cause health problems for consumers."

However, the timing of the first appearance of Homo erectus at the site has been controversial. Using a combination of dating techniques for hominin-bearing sediments, Matsu'ura et al. resolved the arrival of H. erectus at ∼1.3 million years ago (see the Perspective by Brasseur). This dating suggests that the earliest hominins in Sangiran are at least 200,000 years younger than has been thought and may represent an important step to the resolution of the controversy.

https://openalex.org/W3000121155,"Aquaporin-5 (AQP5) plays a role in breast cancer cell migration. This study aimed to identify AQP5-targeting miRNAs and examine their effects on breast cancer cell migration through exosome-mediated delivery. Bioinformatic analyses identified miR-1226-3p, miR-19a-3p, and miR-19b-3p as putative regulators of AQP5 mRNA. Immunoblotting revealed a decrease of AQP5 protein abundance when each of these miRNAs was transfected into human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated the reduction of AQP5 mRNA expression by the transfection of miR-1226-3p and a luciferase reporter assay revealed the reduction of AQP5 translation after the transfection of miR-19b-3p in MDA-MB-231 cells. Consistently, the transfection of each miRNA impeded cell migration. Pathway enrichment analyses showed that these three miRNAs regulate target genes, which were predominantly enriched in the gap junction pathway. For the efficient delivery of AQP5-targeting miRNAs to breast cancer cells, exosomes expressing both miRNAs and a peptide targeting interleukin-4 receptor, which is highly expressed in breast cancer cells, were bioengineered and their inhibitory effects on AQP5 protein expression and cell migration were demonstrated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, AQP5-regulating miRNAs are identified, which could be exploited for the inhibition of breast cancer cell migration via the exosome-mediated delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3000158820,"Dental enamel comprises interwoven arrays of extremely long and narrow crystals of carbonated hydroxyapatite called enamel rods. Amelogenin (AMELX) is the predominant extracellular enamel matrix protein and plays an essential role in enamel formation (amelogenesis). Previously, we have demonstrated that full-length AMELX forms higher-order supramolecular assemblies that regulate ordered mineralization in vitro, as observed in enamel rods. Phosphorylation of the sole AMELX phosphorylation site (Ser-16) in vitro greatly enhances its capacity to stabilize amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), the first mineral phase formed in developing enamel, and prevents apatitic crystal formation. To test our hypothesis that AMELX phosphorylation is critical for amelogenesis, we generated and characterized a hemizygous knockin (KI) mouse model with a phosphorylation-defective Ser-16 to Ala-16 substitution in AMELX. Using EM analysis, we demonstrate that in the absence of phosphorylated AMELX, KI enamel lacks enamel rods, the hallmark component of mammalian enamel, and, unlike WT enamel, appears to be composed of less organized arrays of shorter crystals oriented normal to the dentinoenamel junction. KI enamel also exhibited hypoplasia and numerous surface defects, whereas heterozygous enamel displayed highly variable mosaic structures with both KI and WT features. Importantly, ACP-to-apatitic crystal transformation occurred significantly faster in KI enamel. Secretory KI ameloblasts also lacked Tomes' processes, consistent with the absence of enamel rods, and underwent progressive cell pathology throughout enamel development.

Studies from our laboratories have focused on elucidating the role AMELX plays in amelogenesis. The primary sequence of AMELX is comprised of three amino acid domains: a 45-amino acid N-terminal domain that is rich in tyrosine, a large central domain that is primarily hydrophobic, and an 11-amino acid hydrophilic C terminus (reviewed in Ref. 4Margolis H.C.

The primary structure of the N- and C-terminal domains are almost completely conserved across mammalian species, whereas variations occur in the central portion of the protein. Of note, the highly conserved N terminus contains the only post-translational modification in AMELX, i.e. the phosphorylation of Ser-16.

These in vitro findings are of significant biological importance, as ACP is the first mineral phase that forms in newly deposited enamel mineral, which subsequently undergoes transformation to HA-like enamel crystals during the secretory stage of amelogenesis (36Beniash E.

These prior findings provide us with a strong scientific basis on which to evaluate the impact of a key mutation in native AMELX (i.e. the lack of amelogenin phosphorylation) on the mechanism of enamel formation. Based on these collective findings we hypothesize that phosphorylation of Ser-16 in AMELX plays an essential role in regulating enamel mineral formation. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we have developed a novel knockin (KI) mouse that lacks AMELX phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that AMELX phosphorylation is essential for proper tooth enamel formation, based on the analyses of this new KI mouse model. Our present findings show that AMELX phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating the rate of enamel mineral phase transformation, appositional enamel crystal growth, and in maintaining the integrity and functional capacity of the ameloblast cell layer to form the enamel rod structure. KI mice, carrying a single point mutation of AGC to GCC (S16A) in the exon 3 of the Amelx gene, were successfully generated as described under “Experimental procedures” and in Fig. 1A. The S16A mutation and the targeting vector integration were confirmed by PCR (Fig. 1B) and also by Southern blotting (Fig. S1). Both heterozygous (HET) female and hemizygous KI male mice had normal fertility and growth without apparent developmental defects, once weaned from a gel-diet at 5 weeks. To assess AMELX expression in the secretory stage of developing enamel and confirm its phosphorylation status in KI and HET mice, protein extracts of 5-day-old mouse molars were similarly subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses. As shown with SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 2A), relative protein levels appear equivalent in wildtype (WT), HET, and KI molar enamel extracts. The absence of AMELX phosphorylation in KI enamel was verified by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, using a polyclonal antibody specific for the amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylated Ser-16 of native mouse AMELX (anti-pS16AMELX), as described under “Experimental procedures.” The specificity of the anti-pS16AMELX antibody was first established by Western blot analyses using nonphosphorylated full-length recombinant AMELX, rM179, and 5-day-old mouse molar extracts (M5d) of WT enamel. As shown in Fig. 2B, anti-rM179 (40Simmer J.P. Lau E.C. Hu C.C. Aoba T. Lacey M. Nelson D. Zeichner-David M. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Fincham A.G. Isolation and characterization of a mouse amelogenin expressed in Escherichia coli.Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54 (8062146): 312-31910.1007/BF00295956Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) detected both recombinant nonphosphorylated rM179 and a 5-day-old WT mouse molar extracts that is comprised of native phosphorylated AMELXs. In contrast, anti-pS16AMELX only detected native phosphorylated AMELXs in the WT enamel extracts. In Western blot analyses using anti-rM179 and anti-pS16AMELX, phosphorylated AMELX levels are shown to be significantly reduced in HET enamel, relative to that seen in the WT, and undetectable in KI enamel extracts, as expected (Fig. 2C), validating the efficacy of the knockin S16A mutation. These findings were further confirmed in paraffin sections of developing enamel using immunofluorescence. The fluorescent signal of AMELX using anti-AMELX (FL-191) in enamel was detected in both WT and KI incisor sections (Fig. 2, D and E), whereas there is a clear absence of phosphorylated AMELX in the KI enamel layer (Fig. 2G), unlike in the WT (Fig. 2F), as assessed using anti-pS16AMELX. Marked differences in the appearance of erupted mandibular incisors from adult WT, HET, and KI mice were observed at low magnification using a stereomicroscope. In sharp contrast to WT mouse incisors that exhibit a smooth, shiny and naturally pigmented enamel surface, KI incisor surfaces appear to be hypoplastic, rough, and covered with numerous protrusions, with a notable loss of the characteristic yellow iron pigmentation seen in WT enamel (41Smith C.E. Cellular and chemical events during enamel maturation.Crit. Rev. Oral Biol.

The tips of KI incisors also appear to be more rounded, compared with that seen for WT incisors, reflecting differences in mechanical wear properties (Fig. 3, upper and lower panels). Of note, HET incisor surfaces show a range of phenotypes, exhibiting varying proportions of the characteristic features associated with WT and KI enamel surfaces (Fig. 3, upper and lower panels). Differences in enamel surfaces attributed to the AMELX-S16A mutation were also observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). WT incisors again exhibit smooth enamel surfaces (Fig. 4A), whereas numerous large mineral nodules were present on KI enamel surfaces (Fig. 4B). SEM again shows that HET enamel exhibits a wide range of phenotypes reflecting varying contributions of both WT, with few to no surface defects (Fig. 4C), and KI enamel surface characteristics (Fig. 4D). Similar surface defects were also seen on KI molars (Fig. S2). SEM images of KI molars showed the presence of large mineralized nodules, in contrast to the smooth enamel surfaces observed for WT molars. The cusps of KI molars also appear rounded compared with the sharp, chisel-like appearance of WT molar cusps, suggesting that the enamel of KI cusps is much thinner than that of the WT.Figure 4SEM images of enamel surfaces from WT, KI, and HET mandibular incisors.

https://openalex.org/W2998926895,"Interleukin 11 (IL11) is a profibrotic cytokine, secreted by myofibroblasts and damaged epithelial cells. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) also secrete IL11 under pathological conditions and express the IL11 receptor. Here we examined the effects of SMC-specific, conditional expression of murine IL11 in a transgenic mouse (Il11SMC). Within days of transgene activation, Il11SMC mice developed loose stools and progressive bleeding and rectal prolapse, which was associated with a 65% mortality by two weeks. The bowel of Il11SMC mice was inflamed, fibrotic and had a thickened wall, which was accompanied by activation of ERK and STAT3. In other organs, including the heart, lung, liver, kidney and skin there was a phenotypic spectrum of fibro-inflammation, together with consistent ERK activation. To investigate further the importance of stromal-derived IL11 in the inflammatory bowel phenotype we used a second model with fibroblast-specific expression of IL11, the Il11Fib mouse. This additional model largely phenocopied the Il11SMC bowel phenotype. These data show that IL11 secretion from the stromal niche is sufficient to drive inflammatory bowel disease in mice. Given that IL11 expression in colonic stromal cells predicts anti-TNF therapy failure in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, we suggest IL11 as a therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease."

However, for carbon monoxide (CO) molecules adsorbed on a NaCl(100) surface, infrared emission from even high vibrational states can be resolved. In quantum-state resolved spectra, Lau et al. found that infrared-laser excitation of a monolayer of CO adsorbed on NaCl(100) forms an isomer in which CO binds to Na + through its O atom in an upside-down configuration (see the Perspective by Wu). These results could be understood with a simple vibrationally adiabatic electrostatic theory, making this system convenient for studies of the isomerization chemistry.

Using intervention strategies generated from the Ophelia (OPtimise HEalth LIteracy and Access) community co-design process, translated mammography reminder letters and in-language phone calls were tested within two randomised control trials (RCTs).Women aged 50-75 years who were due for their 2-yearly screening mammography (for RCT#1) or were under-screened, i.e. ≥27 months since last screen (for RCT#2) were randomised into intervention or control groups. RCT#1 compared sending women routine reminder letters (English only) with translated (Arabic or Italian) letters. RCT#2 compared reminder telephone calls to women in their preferred language (Arabic or Italian) to no telephone call. The primary outcome for each trial was screening booking rates within 14-days. Primary outcomes were tested using Pearson's chi-square test. Rates within language group (incidence ratio: IR) were compared using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.For RCT#1 (letters) 1,032 women were randomised into the intervention arm or to usual care. Uptake of screening bookings was similar between both groups, with no differences observed by language group. For RCT#2 (phone calls), 195 women were randomised to the intervention group or to usual care. Overall, 64.2% of women in the intervention arm and 6% in the control arm booked a screening appointment within 14 days (p<0.0001). The IR (95%CI) of booking was 10.1 (3.9, 26.3) times higher among Italian women, and 11.6 (2.9, 46.5) times higher among Arabic women in the intervention compared to usual care groups.A service improvement initiative derived from community members and breast screen providers was found to be highly effective. This evidence informed the service provider, BreastScreen Victoria, who have implemented these improvements into routine practice to improve screening among CALD groups and reduce health inequalities."

Here, we measured mitochondrial respiration variability, in a relatively large sample, and for the first time, using statistical simulations, we provide the sample size required to detect meaningful respiration changes following lifestyle intervention. Muscle biopsies were taken from healthy, young men from the Gene SMART cohort, at multiple time points. We utilized samples for each measurement with two technical repeats using two respirometer chambers (n = 160 pairs of same muscle after removal of low-quality samples). We measured the Technical Error of measurement (TEM ) and the coefficient of variation (CV) for each mitochondrial complex. There was a high correlation between measurements from the two chambers (R > 0.7 P < .001) for all complexes, but the TEM was large (7.9-27 pmol s-1 mg-1 ; complex dependent), and the CV was >15% for all complexes. We performed statistical simulations of a range of effect sizes at 80% power and found that 75 participants (with duplicate measurements) are required to detect a 6% change in mitochondrial respiration after an intervention, while for interventions with 11% effect size, ~24 participants are sufficient. The high variability in respiration suggests that the typical sample sizes in exercise studies may not be sufficient to capture exercise-induced changes."
https://openalex.org/W2999032949,"Dendritic cells are an important link between innate and adaptive immune response. The role of dendritic cells in bone homeostasis, however, is not understood. Osteoporosis medications that inhibit osteoclasts have been associated with osteonecrosis, a condition limited to the jawbone, thus called medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. We propose that disruption of the local immune response renders the oral microenvironment conducive to osteonecrosis. We tested whether zoledronate (Zol) treatment impaired dendritic cell (DC) functions and increased bacterial load in alveolar bone in vivo and whether DC inhibition alone predisposed the animals to osteonecrosis. We also analyzed the role of Zol in impairment of differentiation and function of migratory and tissue-resident DCs, promoting disruption of T-cell activation in vitro. Results demonstrated a Zol induced impairment in DC functions and an increased bacterial load in the oral cavity. DC-deficient mice were predisposed to osteonecrosis following dental extraction. Zol treatment of DCs in vitro caused an impairment in immune functions including differentiation, maturation, migration, antigen presentation, and T-cell activation. We conclude that the mechanism of Zol-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw involves disruption of DC immune functions required to clear bacterial infection and activate T cell effector response."

IR exposure to the heart results in chronic toxicities including heart failure. We hypothesize that the circadian system plays regulatory roles in minimizing the IR-induced cardiotoxicity. We treated mice in control (Day Shift), environmentally disrupted (Rotating Shift), and genetically disrupted (Per 1/2 mutant) circadian conditions with 18 Gy of IR to the heart. Compared to control mice, circadian clock disruption significantly exacerbated post-IR systolic dysfunction (by ultrasound echocardiography) and increased fibrosis in mice. At the cellular level, Bmal1 protein bound to Atm, Brca1, and Brca2 promoter regions and its expression level was inversely correlated with the DNA damage levels based on the state of the clock. Further studies with circadian synchronized cardiomyocytes revealed that Bmal1 depletion increased the IR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that the circadian clock protects from IR-induced toxicity and potentially impacts RT treatment outcome in cancer patients through IR-induced DNA damage responses."

The system consists of GFP-based reporters that become fluorescent upon cleavage by recombinant DENV-2/ZIKV proteases in vitro. A version of this sensor containing the flavivirus internal NS3 cleavage site linker reported the highest fluorescence activation in stably transduced mammalian cells upon DENV-2/ZIKV infection.

https://openalex.org/W3000539358,"The aim of this study was to purify potential allergenic components of Vespa velutina venom, the yellow legged Asian Hornet, and perform a preliminary characterization of the purified proteins. Starting from the whole venom of V.velutina, several chromatographic steps allowed to purify the phospholipase (named Vesp v 1), as well as the antigen 5 (Vesp v 5, the only allergenic component described as such so far). The two hyaluronidase isoforms found (Vesp v 2A and Vesp v 2B) cannot be separated from each other, but they are partially purified and characterized. Purity of the isolated proteins in shown by SDSPAGE, as well as by the results of the N-terminal sequencing. This characterization and nLC-MS/MS data provide most of the sequence for Vesp v 1 and Vesp v 5 (72 and 84% coverage, respectively), confirming that the whole sequences of the isolated natural components match with the data available in public transcriptomic databases. It is of particular interest that Vesp v 1 is a glycosylated phospholipase, a fact that had only described so far for the corresponding allergen components of Dolichovespula maculata and Solenopsis invicta. The availability of the complete sequences of Vespa velutina components permits comparison with homologous sequences from other Hymenoptera. These data demonstrate the higher similarity among the species of the genera Vespa and Vespula, in comparison to Polistes species, as it is especially observed with the hyaluronidases isoforms: the isoform Vesp v 2A only exists in the former genera, and not in Polistes; in addition, the most abundant isoform (Vesp v 2B) exhibits 93% sequence identity with the Ves v 2 isoform of Vespula vulgaris. Finally, the isolated components might be useful for improving the diagnosis of patients that could be allergic to stings of this invasive Asian hornet, as it has been the case of an improved diagnosis and treatment of other Hymenoptera-sensitized patients."
https://openalex.org/W2999393378,"The majority of congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infections are asymptomatic at birth and therefore not diagnosed. Approximately 10-15% of these infants develop late-onset hearing loss and other developmental disorders. Implementation of a universal screening approach at birth may allow early initiation of symptomatic interventions due to a closer follow-up of infants at risk and offers the opportunity to consider treatment of late-onset disease. Real-time PCR assays for the detection of CMV DNA in buccal swab samples demonstrated feasibility and good clinical sensitivity in comparison to a rapid culture screening assay. Because most cCMV infections remain asymptomatic, a universal screening assay that stratifies CMV infected infants according to low and high risk of late-onset cCMV disease could limit the parental anxiety and reduce follow-up costs. We therefore developed and characterized a screening algorithm based on a highly-sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assay that is compatible with centralized testing of samples from universal screening and allows to determine CMV DNA load of saliva samples either as International Units (IU)/ml saliva or IU/105 cell equivalents. 18 of 34 saliva samples of newborns that tested positively by the screening algorithm were confirmed by detection of CMV DNA in blood and/or urine samples obtained during the first weeks of life. All screening samples that could not be confirmed had viral loads of <2.3x105 IU/ml saliva (median: 6.8x103) or 1.3x105 IU/105 cell equivalents (median: 4.0x102). The viral load of screening samples with confirmed cCMV infection ranged from 7.5x102 to 8.2x109 IU/ml saliva (median: 9.3x107) or 1.5x102 to 5.6x1010 IU/105 cell equivalents (median: 3.5x106).

New federal guidelines were implemented for healthier school lunches for the National School Lunch Programs (NSLP). Consequently, students waste large amounts of fruits and vegetables. Several organizations advocate implementation of classroom nutrition education programs as a school nutrition policy. Methods We conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a classroom nutrition education on food consumption behavior of public elementary school students. Our intervention was designed to improve students’ preferences for fruits and vegetables. We collected data using digital-photography, and estimated the amount of fruits and vegetables selected and wasted using ordinary least squares. Results The nutrition education program had no impact on the amount of fruits and vegetables selected by the students in the treatment group. We also find no significant difference in the amount of fruits and vegetables wasted by students in the treatment and control group. Conclusion Nutrition education did not change students’ consumption behavior, implying the proposed policy might not be optimal. Inducing a behavioral change in elementary school students is an intricate process and might require more than classroom lessons to change their dietary habits."

In contrast to the well-established in vivo studies over decades, in vitro studies of this pathway, including biochemical characterization and high-resolution structures, are relatively limited. In this study, we have developed a unique fusion technique using microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B, a key marker protein of autophagy, to tag the N terminus of the proteins involved in the N-degron pathway, which enables high yield of homogeneous target proteins with variable N-terminal residues for diverse biochemical studies including enzymatic and binding assays and substrate identification. Intriguingly, crystallization showed a markedly enhanced probability, even for the N-degron complexes. To validate our results, we determined the structures of select proteins in the N-degron pathway and compared them with the Protein Data Bank–deposited proteins. Furthermore, several biochemical applications of this technique were introduced. Therefore, this technique can be used as a general tool for the in vitro study of the N-degron pathway.

https://openalex.org/W3000734682,"Ror2 signaling has been shown to regulate the cell cycle progression in normal and cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism of the cell cycle progression upon activation of Ror2 signaling still remains unknown. Here, we found that the expression levels of Ror2 in G1-arrested NIH/3T3 fibroblasts are low and are rapidly increased following the cell cycle progression induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulation. By expressing wild-type or a dominant negative mutant of E2F1, we show that E2F1 mediates bFGF-induced expression of Ror2, and that E2F1 binds to the promoter of the Ror2 gene to activate its expression. We also found that G1/S phase transition of bFGF-stimulated NIH/3T3 cells is delayed by the suppressed expression of Ror2. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the suppressed expression of Ror2 results in the decreased expression of various E2F target genes concomitantly with increased expression of Forkhead box O (FoxO) target genes, including p21Cip1 , and p27Kip1 . Moreover, the inhibitory effect of Ror2 knockdown on the cell cycle progression can be restored by suppressed expression of p21Cip1 , p27Kip1 ,or FoxO3a. Collectively, these findings indicate that E2F1-Ror2 signaling mediates the transcriptional activation and inhibition of E2F1-driven and FoxO3a-driven cell cycle-regulated genes, respectively, thereby promoting G1/S phase transition of bFGF-stimulated NIH/3T3 cells."

Serological tests for HA, LN, C-IV and PIIINP were performed in 210 patients. The liver stiffness was measured in 69 patients by transient elastography (FibroScan).The analysis showed that the four serum fibrosis markers were negatively correlated with PLT counts, but positively correlated with the MPV, PDW and P-LCR values. Moreover, a similar pattern was found after analyzing the FibroScan measurements, which were negatively correlated with PLT counts, but positively correlated with MPV, PDW and P-LCR values. We subdivided the HCV-infected patients into mild and advanced fibrosis groups. The PLT counts were significantly decreased and the MPV, PDW and P-LCR values were significantly increased in the advanced fibrosis group when compared with the mild fibrosis group.Our results demonstrate that not only the PLT counts but also the MPV, PDW and P-LCR indices significantly correlate with liver fibrosis in HCV-infected patients. Therefore, these indices may be useful laboratory measures for evaluating liver fibrosis progression."

https://openalex.org/W2999784464,"Female songbirds use male song to discriminate among individuals and evaluate their quality as potential mates. Previous behavioral experiments in many species, including the species studied here, have shown that females will solicit copulation in response to song even if no male is present. Those data demonstrate that female mate choice is closely tied to song features, but they leave open the question of which song parameters are most influential in female mate selection. We sought to identify features of male song that are salient for mate choice in female Bengalese finches. Using a novel experimental approach, we simultaneously tested the possible influence of specific notes or note transitions, the number of different note types in the male’s repertoire, the complexity of note content and note sequence, and the stereotypy of note content and note sequence. In additional experiments, we also tested the influence of the pitch and tempo of note production. Our results demonstrate that females generally preferred songs containing increased tempo in the context of species-typical frequency bandwidth, consistent with the idea that females prefer songs that are especially challenging to produce. Female preference for song features that pose a neuromuscular challenge has also been reported in other species. Our data extend those observations into a species that thrives in a laboratory setting and is commonly used in studies of the neural basis of behavior. These results provide an excellent new model system in which to study female preference and the neural mechanisms that underlie signal evaluation and mate choice."

It makes acylphosphate from acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) and is also involved in coordinating phospholipid and fatty acid biosyntheses. PlsX is a peripheral membrane enzyme in Bacillus subtilis, but how it associates with the membrane remains largely unknown. In the present study, using fluorescence microscopy, liposome sedimentation, differential scanning calorimetry, and acyltransferase assays, we determined that PlsX binds directly to lipid bilayers and identified its membrane anchoring moiety, consisting of a hydrophobic loop located at the tip of two amphipathic dimerization helices. To establish the role of the membrane association of PlsX in acylphosphate synthesis and in the flux through the phosphatidic acid pathway, we then created mutations and gene fusions that prevent PlsX's interaction with the membrane. Interestingly, phospholipid synthesis was severely hampered in cells in which PlsX was detached from the membrane, and results from metabolic labeling indicated that these cells accumulated free fatty acids. Because the same mutations did not affect PlsX transacylase activity, we conclude that membrane association is required for the proper delivery of PlsX's product to PlsY, the next enzyme in the phosphatidic acid pathway. We conclude that PlsX plays a dual role in phospholipid synthesis, acting both as a catalyst and as a chaperone protein that mediates substrate channeling into the pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2999219718,"Elucidating the genetic basis of influenza A viruses (IAVs) is important to understand which mutations will determine the virulence and the host range of mammals. Here, seasonal H3N2 influenza was adapted in mice by serial passage and four mutants, each carrying amino acid substitutions related to mouse adaptation in either the PB2, HA, NP, or NA protein, were generated. To confirm the contribution of each gene to enhanced pathogenicity and mouse adaptation, mice were inoculated with the respective variants, and virulence, replication, histopathology, and infectivity were examined. The virus harboring HA mutations displayed increased infection efficiency and replication competence, resulting in higher mortality in mice relative to those infected with wild-type virus. By contrast, the NP D34N mutation caused rapid and widespread infection in multiple organs without presenting virulent symptoms. Additionally, the PB2 F323L mutation presented delayed but elevated replication competence in the respiratory tract, whereas the S331R mutation in NA showed no considerable effects on mouse adaptation. These results suggested that mouse-adapted changes in HA are major factors in increased pathogenicity and that mutations in NP and PB2 also contribute to cross-species adaptability. Our findings offer a better understanding of the molecular basis for IAV pathogenicity and adaptation in a new host."

Online crowdsourcing is a burgeoning technology, with potential to mitigate the burden of limited accessibility to speech-language-pathologists (SLPs). This pilot study investigates the concordance of online crowdsourced evaluations of hypernasality with SLP ratings of children with cleft palate.Six audio-phrases each from children with cleft palate were assessed by online crowdsourcing using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and compared to SLP's gold-standard hypernasality score on the Pittsburgh Weighted Speech Score (PWSS). Phrases were presented to MTurk crowdsourced lay-raters to assess hypernasality on a Likert scale analogous to the PWSS. The survey included clickable reference audio samples for different levels of hypernasality.1,088 unique online crowdsourced speech ratings were collected on 16 sentences of 3 children with cleft palate aged 4-8 years, with audio averaging 6.5 years follow-up after cleft palate surgery. Patient 1 crowd-mean was 2.62 (SLP rated 2-3); Patient 2 crowd-mean 2.66 (SLP rated 3); and Patient 3 crowd-mean 1.76 (SLP rated 2). Rounded for consistency with PWSS scale, all patients matched SLP ratings. Different sentences had different accuracies compared to the SLP gold standard scores.Online crowdsourced ratings of hypernasal speech in children with cleft palate were concordant with SLP ratings, predicting SLP scores in all 3 patients. This novel technology has potential for translation in clinical speech assessments, and may serve as a valuable screening tool for non-experts to identify children requiring further assessment and intervention by a qualified speech language pathology expert."

We examined whether PSTI affected mesenteric I/R-induced injury. Hypoxia/normoxia (H/N) caused 50% drop in cell viability of AGS, RIE1 and Caco-2 cells but PSTI (10 μg/ml) given prior- or during-hypoxic period improved survival by 50% (p<0.01). Similarly, Caco-2 monolayers exposed to H/N had 300% increase in transepithelial permeability, PSTI truncated this by 50% (p<0.01). Mice underwent mesenteric I/R by clamping jejunum, causing severe mucosal injury, increased apoptotic markers and 3-fold increases in plasma IL-6, IL1β, TNFα, and tissue lipid peroxidation (MDA) and inflammatory infiltration (MPO) levels. Lungs showed similar significant injury and inflammatory infiltrate markers. Smaller increases in MDA and MPO were seen in kidney & liver. PSTI (20 mg/kg) reduced all injury markers by 50-80% (p<0.01). In vitro and in vivo studies showed PSTI reduced pro-apoptotic Caspase 3, 9 and Baxα levels, normalised Bcl2 and caused additional increases in HIF1α, VEGF and Hsp70 above rises caused by I/R alone (all p<0.01).

The mechanism regulating the function of antigen-presenting cells during the development of atherosclerosis is not fully understood. Here we aimed to study the involvement of PPARδ in CD11c+ cells in atherosclerosis. We used the Cre-loxP approach to make conditional deletion of Ppard in CD11c+ cells in mice on Apoe-/- background, which were fed with high cholesterol diet to develop atherosclerosis. Ppard deficiency in CD11c+ cells attenuated atherosclerotic plaque formation and infiltration of myeloid-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and T lymphocytes. Reduced lesion was accompanied by reduced activation of dendritic cells, and also a reduction of activation and differentiation of T cells to Th1 cells. In addition, DC migration to lymph node was also attenuated with Ppard deletion. In bone marrow-derived DCs, Ppard deficiency reduced palmitic acid-induced upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL12 and TNFα. Our results indicated PPARδ activation by fatty acid resulted in the activation of myeloid DCs and subsequent polarization of T lymphocytes, which contributed to atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- mice. These findings also reveal the potential regulatory role of PPARδ in antigen presentation to orchestrate the immune responses during atherosclerosis."

To do so, we categorize responses based on five dimensions of language choice: egocentric (referring to self), social, moral, positively emotional, and negatively emotional. Our results reveal statistically significant differences between blood donors and non-donors in the use of all five categories. With respect to organ donation, we find statistically significant differences between donors and non-donors in the use of social, moral and positive emotional terms but not in the use of egocentric or negatively emotional justifications. Such results suggest that the ‘gift of life’ terminology used universally to market to potential blood and organ donors may only be relevant in the blood donation market and unlikely to incentivize or change organ donation behaviour."

Because the disease is widespread throughout sheep flocks in Switzerland, a nationwide footrot control program for sheep focusing on virulent strains shall soon be implemented. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the nationwide prevalence of both strain groups of D. nodosus in four wild indigenous ruminant species and to identify potential susceptible wildlife maintenance hosts that could be a reinfection source for domestic sheep. During two years (2017–2018), interdigital swabs of 1,821 wild indigenous ruminant species (Alpine ibex, Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus)) were analysed by Real-Time PCR. Furthermore, observed interspecies interactions were documented for each sample. Overall, we report a low prevalence of D. nodosus in all four indigenous wild ruminants, for both benign (1.97%, N = 36, of which 31 red deer) and virulent (0.05%, N = 1 ibex) strains. Footrot lesions were documented in one ibex with virulent strains, and in one ibex with benign strains. Interspecific interactions involving domestic livestock occurred mainly with cattle and sheep. In conclusion, the data suggest that wild ungulates are likely irrelevant for the maintenance and spread of D. nodosus. Furthermore, we add evidence that both D. nodosus strain types can be associated with severe disease in Alpine ibex.

Since several prophylactic agents have recently shown promising preliminary results, more complete studies comparing their real efficacy and safety are needed urgently. The aim of this study was to investigate and describe practical considerations of a porcine model that can be used to assess such prophylactic agents. First, 10 healthy 5½ months old female pigs (24.3–31.3 Kg) underwent a standardized laparoscopy to provoke peritubal adhesion formation without prophylactic agents. After 30 days, a second-look laparoscopy was performed to evaluate adhesions and perform adnexectomy for histopathological evaluation. Adhesions at different sites were classified by grade, for which the scores range from 0 (no adhesion) to 3 (very strong vascularized adhesions), and also by area, with scores ranging from 0 (no adhesion) to 4 (>75% of the injured area). The histopathological evaluation of the distal uterine horns, oviducts and ovaries were compared withthose from a control group of six healthy pigs with no previous surgery. Biological samples were collected to assess vitality, inflammation and renal, hepatic and hematopoietic systems. There were small (but significant) changes in serum albumin (P = 0.07), globulin (P = 0.07), C-reactive protein (P = 0.011), fibrinogen (P = 0.023) and bilirubin (P<0.01) after 30 days, but all values were within the normal range. No inflammation or abscess formation was observed, but different degrees of adhesion were identified. The estimated occurrence of adhesion (scores >0) and of strong / very strong adhesion (scores >1) was 75% (95% CI: 55–94.9) and 65% (95% CI: 45–85), respectively. The porcine model represents a useful animal platform that can be used to test the efficacy and safety of candidate prophylactic agents intended to prevent postoperative peritubal adhesions formation. We present several practical considerations and measures that can help to minimize animal suffering and avoid problems during such experiments."

The order arrival intensity is marked by an exogenous part and two endogenous processes reflecting the self-excitation and cross-excitation respectively. We calibrate the model for an SSE stock. We find that the exponential kernel with a smooth cut-off (i.e. the subtraction of two exponentials) produces much better calibration than the monotonous exponential kernel (i.e. the sum of two exponentials). The exogenous baseline intensity explains the $U$-shaped intraday pattern. Our empirical results show that the endogenous submission clustering is mainly caused by self-excitation rather than cross-excitation.

I spent an evening running around like a chicken with its head cut off: slicing fruit, replacing liquor bottles, and doing other menial tasks.

> “The demands of the job were exactly what I was missing from my Ph.D. program.” 

I got into my doctoral program on a technicality. On my application, I'd checked the box for “Ph.D.” not knowing that a master's degree was a prerequisite. My adviser—who interviewed me over the phone—misread my undergraduate record and thought I had a graduate degree under my belt, so I was admitted to the Ph.D. program. He welcomed me into his lab even after finding out about the error. But it left me feeling like I had a lot to prove.

I got off to a running start. My adviser had 3 years of funding to cover my stipend and tuition. I threw myself into reading every paper I could find and thinking about how to test scientific questions no one had yet delved into. And I was awarded a grant to help fund some expensive genetics labwork.

But 4 years later, I felt lost. I barely passed my qualifying exam. A manuscript I spent a year working on was rejected outright, without peer review, and I was running out of funding. My mood was in the gutter. I told my therapist at the time, “The more people are interested in what I study, the angrier I am that they care and I don't.” I dreamed about quitting my program, moving back home, and working at the bike shop that had employed me during college. Then came the barback gig.

After we finished cleaning up the bar that night, I was handed festival tickets and an envelope with my cut of the tips—close to $40. It felt wrong to be compensated while having so much fun. I grinned as we snuck upstairs to watch the gala attendees finish their drinks and to steal shrimp from the serving bowls.

The next day, I tried to figure out why I loved this short-lived experience so much. I realized it was because the demands of the job were exactly what I was missing from my Ph.D. program. It was physically exhausting, the tasks I was responsible for were simple and could be completed in a short time, and I knew without a doubt when I succeeded and when I failed. My mind was blissfully blank all night. At that point, I had not had a break from thinking as hard as I possibly could for 4 years. I had never come up for air, and I was completely unaware of the toll it was taking on my mental health.

Since then, I've tried to give my mind more breaks. When I start to feel overwhelmed—when an experiment fails, a mistake sets me back a month, or funding falls through—I make a point of doing things that allow me to feel successful in other ways. I learn how to play a new song on the piano. I go for a run. I volunteer for an organization that I care deeply about, performing basic tasks such as stapling papers and shredding documents. The simplicity of these activities brings a peace of mind that I never find in academia. They help clear my head, preparing me to dive back into the graduate work that both excites and exhausts me.

I don't think I'll ever be a professional barback. But I'll never forget the lessons I learned that night. Graduate school takes a lot of work and skill, but it doesn't exercise all the muscles of your brain, body, or spirit. Sometimes it's OK—even necessary—to find other, decidedly unscientific, ways to fill your cup.
