https://openalex.org/W2753714006,"Objectives The current study investigates which foods may be most implicated in addictive-like eating by examining how nutritionally diverse foods relate to loss of control consumption and various subjective effect reports. Subjective effect reports assess the abuse liabilities of substances and may similarly provide insight into which foods may be reinforcing in a manner that triggers an addictive-like response for some individuals. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Online community. Participants 507 participants (n = 501 used in analyses) recruited through Amazon MTurk. Measurements Participants (n = 501) self-reported how likely they were to experience a loss of control over their consumption of 30 nutritionally diverse foods and rated each food on five subjective effect report questions that assess the abuse liability of substances (liking, pleasure, craving, averseness, intensity). Hierarchical cluster analytic techniques were used to examine how foods grouped together based on each question. Results Highly processed foods, with added fats and/or refined carbohydrates, clustered together and were associated with greater loss of control, liking, pleasure, and craving. The clusters yielded from the subjective effect reports assessing liking, pleasure, and craving were most similar to clusters formed based on loss of control over consumption, whereas the clusters yielded from averseness and intensity did not meaningfully differentiate food items. Conclusion The present work applies methodology used to assess the abuse liability of substances to understand whether foods may vary in their potential to be associated with addictive-like consumption. Highly processed foods (e.g., pizza, chocolate) appear to be most related to an indicator of addictive-like eating (loss of control) and several subjective effect reports (liking, pleasure, craving). Thus, these foods may be particularly reinforcing and capable of triggering an addictive-like response in some individuals. Future research is warranted to understand whether highly processed foods are related to these indicators of abuse liability at a similar magnitude as addictive substances."
https://openalex.org/W2752866458,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a severe disorder with an increasing incidence worldwide. An early detection may help to prevent its progression and to minimize the risk of cardiovascular diseases as one of the major comorbidities. Recently, extracellular miRNAs like urinary exosomal miRNAs became of great interest as non-invasive biomarkers which can be determined by RT-qPCR. But until now, there is no consensus regarding the normalization of miRNAs isolated from body fluids. The present study analyzed the miRNAs miR-16, miR-92a, miR-21, miR-124a and the small nuclear RNA RNU6B for their applicability as an endogenous reference gene in expression studies of exosomal miRNAs isolated from CKD patients. For this purpose, miRNA expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR after the isolation of urinary exosomes from 33 CKD patients and from 5 healthy controls. Expression data was analyzed with the normalization determination software NormFinder, BestKeeper, GeNorm and DeltaCt. Our results revealed an abundant expression of the four candidate miRNAs in urinary exosomes and no detectable expression of RNU6B. We identified miR-16 as the most stable endogenous reference gene in our data set, making it a suitable endogenous reference gene for miRNA studies of urinary exosomes derived from CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2752884126,"Methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) are the major cause of infectious diseases because of their potential ability to form biofilm and colonize the community or hospital environments. This study was designed to investigate the biofilm producing ability, and the presence of mecA, icaAD, bap and fnbA genes in MR-CoNS isolates. The MR-CoNS used in this study were isolated from various samples of community environment and five wards of hospital environments, using mannitol salt agar (MSA) supplemented with 4 Î¼g/ml of oxacillin. The specie level of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus warneri was identified by specific primers of groESL (S. haemolyticus), rdr (S. epidermidis) and nuc (S. hominis and S. warneri). The remainder isolates were identified by tuf gene sequencing. Biofilm production was determined using Congo red agar (CRA) and Microtiter plate (MTP) assay. The mecA and biofilm associated genes (icaAD, fnbA and bap) were detected using PCR method. From the 558 samples from community and hospital environments, 292 MR-CoNS were isolated (41 from community environments, and 251 from hospital environments). S. haemolyticus (41.1%) and S. epidermidis (30.1%) were the predominant species in this study. Biofilm production was detected in 265 (90.7%) isolates by CRA, and 260 (88.6%) isolates were detected by MTP assay. The staphylococci isolates derived from hospital environments were more associated with biofilm production than the community-derived isolates. Overall, the icaAD and bap genes were detected in 74 (29.5%) and 14 (5.6%) of all isolates from hospital environments. When tested by MTP, the icaAD gene from hospital environment isolates was associated with biofilm biomass. No association was found between bap gene and biofilm formation. The MR-CoNS isolates obtained from community environments did not harbor the icaAD and bap genes. Conversely, fnbA gene presented in MR-CoNS isolated from both community and hospital environments. The high prevalence of biofilm producing MR-CoNS strains demonstrated in this study indicates the persisting ability in environments, and is useful in developing prevention strategies countering the spread of MR-CoNS."
https://openalex.org/W2751375640,"Phagocytosis after myocardial infarction (MI) is a prerequisite to cardiac repair. Recruited monocytes clear necrotic cardiomyocytes and differentiate into cardiac macrophages. Some studies have linked apoptotic cell receptors on cardiac macrophages to tissue repair; however, the contribution of precursor monocyte phagocytic receptors, which are the first to interact with the cardiac parenchyma, is unclear. The scavenger receptor cluster of differentiation (CD)36 protein was detected on cardiac Ly6cHI monocytes, and bone marrow-derived Cd36 was essential for both early phagocytosis of dying cardiomyocytes and for smaller infarct sizes in female and male mice after permanent coronary ligation. Cd36 deficiency led to reduced expression of phagocytosis receptor Mertk and nuclear receptor Nr4a1 in cardiac macrophages, the latter previously shown to be required for phagocyte survival. Nr4a1 was required for phagocytosis-induced Mertk expression, and Nr4a1 protein directly bound to Mertk gene regulatory elements. To test the overall contribution of the Cd36-Mertk axis, MI was induced in Cd36-/- Mertk-/- double-knockout mice and led to increases in myocardial rupture. These data implicate monocyte CD36 in the mitigation of early infarct size and transition to Mertk-dependent macrophage function. Increased myocardial rupture in the absence of both Cd36 and Mertk underscore the physiologic significance of phagocytosis during tissue injury.-Dehn, S., Thorp, E. B. Myeloid receptor CD36 is required for early phagocytosis of myocardial infarcts and induction of Nr4a1-dependent mechanisms of cardiac repair."
https://openalex.org/W2750962393,"Ovarian cancer's poor progression is closely associated with overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which belongs to the class of enzymes believed to be involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix. However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of MMP-9 are not completely understood. STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) family of transcription factors is well known to be engaged in diverse cellular functions. Activation of STAT3 has been observed in a number of cancers, promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis via transcriptional activation of its target genes. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that STAT3 regulates MMP-9 gene expression in epithelial ovarian cancer. Using epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines as in vitro model, we show an abundance of phosphorylated STAT3 at Tyr705 (p-STAT3) in SKOV3 cell line. We further show that MMP-9 gene promoter was significantly enriched by p-STAT3, and IL-6 treatment led to a significant increase of MMP-9 at mRNA and protein levels, in addition to an association of p-STAT3 with MMP-9 gene. By using luciferase reporter assay, we determined that the STAT3 DNA responsive element of MMP-9 was sufficient to regulate transcriptional activity of a heterologous promoter. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of STAT3 regulates MMP-9 production in ovarian cancer, which might be responsible for its invasiveness and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2753762261,"Purpose To determine peripapillary vessel density in eyes with perimetric glaucoma (PG) or preperimetric glaucoma (PPG) compared to normal controls using optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A). Methods We recruited 13 patients with unilateral perimetric normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and fellow preperimetric NTG showing only inferotemporal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defect in red-free RNFL photography in both eyes. We also enrolled 9 healthy controls. Using OCT-A, radial peripapillary capillary densities at inferotemporal and superotemporal regions were evaluated. Paired comparison of peripapillary vessel density was performed for PG eye, PPG eye, and normal eye. Results A total of 26 eyes of the 13 patients with unilateral PG and fellow PPG eyes and 18 eyes of 9 normal controls were analyzed. Vessel densities at the whole peripapillary region and inferotemporal region in PG eyes were significantly lower than those in PPG eyes (P = 0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Comparison between PPG and normal eyes showed no significant difference in the whole peripapillary region or the inferotemporal region (P = 0.654, P = 0.174, respectively). There was no significant (P = 0.288) difference in vessel density at superotemporal region among the three types of eyes (PG eye, PPG eye, and normal eye). Conclusion PPG eyes and normal eyes were found to have the similar densities of peripapillary microvasculature at the area with nerve fiber layer defect, whereas in PG eye, there was a significant decrease in vessel density at the area of RNFL thinning. This provides evidence that microvascular compromise in the retina might be a secondary change to nerve fiber layer degeneration in the pathogenesis of NTG."
https://openalex.org/W2751831735,"Mouse models provide a valuable tool for exploring pathogenic mechanisms underlying inherited human disease. Here, we describe seven mouse models identified through the Translational Vision Research Models (TVRM) program, each carrying a new allele of a gene previously linked to retinal developmental and/or degenerative disease. The mutations include four alleles of three genes linked to human nonsyndromic ocular diseases (Aipl1tvrm119, Aipl1tvrm127, Rpgrip1tvrm111, RhoTvrm334) and three alleles of genes associated with human syndromic diseases that exhibit ocular phentoypes (Alms1tvrm102, Clcn2nmf289, Fkrptvrm53). Phenotypic characterization of each model is provided in the context of existing literature, in some cases refining our current understanding of specific disease attributes. These murine models, on fixed genetic backgrounds, are available for distribution upon request and may be useful for understanding the function of the gene in the retina, the pathological mechanisms induced by its disruption, and for testing experimental approaches to treat the corresponding human ocular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2751417891,"To determine whether multiple repeated administrations of gadolinium-based macrocyclic ionic MR contrast agent (MICA) are associated with intracranial gadolinium deposition and identify the predisposing factors for deposition in various clinical situations.In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study, 385 consecutive patients who underwent MICA-enhanced MR imaging were enrolled. The dentate nucleus-to-pons (DN/P) and globus pallidus-to-thalamus (GP/Th) signal intensity (SI) ratios on unenhanced T1-weighted images were recorded by 2 independent readers and averaged. The mean DN/P and GP/Th SI ratio difference between the last and the first examinations were tested using the one-sample t-test. Student's t-test and stepwise regression analysis were used to identify the predisposing factors for deposition based on the number of administrations, time interval, hepatic and renal function, magnetic field strength, and chemo- or radiation therapy.The mean DN/P SI ratio difference was not different from zero (P = .697), even in patients with â¥20 administrations (n = 33). Only patients with abnormal renal function showed an increase in the mean DN/P SI ratio difference (P = .019). The mean DN/P SI ratio difference was not associated with any predisposing factors. However, the mean GP/Th SI ratio difference showed decrease (P < .001), which was associated with age (P = .007), number of administrations (P = .01) and number of radiation therapy sessions (P = .022) on multivariate analysis.Multiple repeated administrations of MICA were not associated with increased T1 signal intensity in deep brain nuclei suggestive of Gd deposition in patients with normal renal function."
https://openalex.org/W2751880618,"Antibiotic resistant bacterial infections are a significant problem in the healthcare setting, in many cases requiring the rapid administration of appropriate and effective antibiotic therapy. Diagnostic assays capable of quickly and accurately determining the pathogen resistance profile are therefore crucial to initiate or modify care. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) is a standard method for species identification in many clinical microbiology laboratories and is well positioned to be applied towards antimicrobial susceptibility testing. One recently reported approach utilizes semi-quantitative MALDI-TOF MS for growth rate analysis to provide a resistance profile independent of resistance mechanism. This method was previously successfully applied to Gram-negative pathogens and mycobacteria; here, we evaluated this method with the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Specifically, we used 35 strains of S. aureus and four antibiotics to optimize and test the assay, resulting in an overall accuracy rate of 95%. Application of the optimized assay also successfully determined susceptibility from mock blood cultures, allowing both species identification and resistance determination for all four antibiotics within 3 hours of blood culture positivity."
https://openalex.org/W2179138756,"During the last years the number of cities that have installed and started operating shared bike systems has significantly increased. These systems provide an alternative and sustainable mean of transportation to the city dwellers. Apart from the energy sustainability benefits, shared bike systems can have a positive effect on residentsâ health, air quality and the overall condition of the currently crumbling road network infrastructure. Anecdotal stories and survey studies have also identified that bike lanes have a positive impact on local businesses. In this study, driven by the rapid adoption of shared bike systems by city governments and their potential positive effects on a number of urban life facets we opt to study and quantify the value of these systems. We focus on a specific aspect of this value and use evidence from the real estate market in the city of Pittsburgh to analyze the effect on dwellersâ properties of the shared bike system installed in the city in June 2015. We use quasi-experimental techniques and find that the shared bike system led to an increase in the housing prices (both sales and rental prices) in the zip codes where shared bike stations were installed. We further bring into the light potential negative consequences of this impact (i.e., gentrification) and discuss/propose two public policies that can exploit the impact of the system for the benefit of both the local government as well as the city dwellers."

https://openalex.org/W2751368365,"Biomarkers of heart failure in adults have been extensively studied. However, biomarkers to monitor the progression of heart failure in children with univentricular physiology are less well understood. We proposed that as mediators of diverse pathophysiology, miRNAs contained within circulating microvesicles could serve as biomarkers for the presence and progression of heart failure in univentricular patients. To test this, we studied the association of heart failure with elevations in specific miRNAs isolated from circulating microvesicles in a cohort of children with univentricular heart disease and heart failure. We conducted a single site cross-sectional observational study of 71 children aged 1 month-7 years with univentricular heart disease and heart failure. We demonstrated that levels of miR129-5p isolated from plasma microvesicles were inversely related to the degree of clinical heart failure as assessed by Ross score. We then showed that miR129-5p levels are downregulated in HL1 cells and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes exposed to oxidative stress. We demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2, which has been implicated in the development of pulmonary vascular disease, is a target of miR129-5p, and conversely regulated in response to oxidative stress in cell culture. Levels of miR129-5p were inversely related to the degree of clinical heart failure in patients with univentricular heart disease. This study demonstrates that miR129-5p is a sensitive and specific biomarker for heart failure in univentricular heart disease independent of ventricular morphology or stage of palliation. Further study is warranted to understand the targets affected by miR129-5p with the development of heart failure in patients with univentricular physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2753623620,"Background We previously showed an association between low vitamin D levels and high opioid doses to alleviate pain in palliative cancer patients. The aim of this case-controlled study was to investigate if vitamin D supplementation could improve pain management, quality of life (QoL) and decrease infections in palliative cancer patients. Methods Thirty-nine palliative cancer patients with levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 75 nmol/L were supplemented with vitamin D 4000 IE/day, and were compared to 39 untreated, matched âcontrolâ-patients from a previous study at the same ward. Opioid doses, antibiotic consumption and QoL-scores measured with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were monitored. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline after 1 and 3 months compared between the groups using linear regression with adjustment for a potential cofounding factor. Results After 1 month the vitamin D treated group had a significantly decreased fentanyl dose compared to the untreated group with a difference of 46 Î¼g/h; 95% CI 24â78, which increased further at 3 months to 91 Î¼g/h; 95% CI 56â140 Î¼g/h. The ESAS QoL-score improved in the Vitamin D group the first month; -1.4; 95% CI -2.6 - (-0.21). The vitamin D-treated group had significantly lower consumption of antibiotics after 3 months compared to the untreated group, the difference was -26%; 95%CI -0.41%â(-0.12%). Vitamin D was well tolerated by all patients and no adverse events were reported. Conclusion Vitamin D supplementation to palliative cancer patients is safe and improvement in pain management is noted as early as 1 month after treatment. Decreased infections are noted 3 months after vitamin D treatment. The results from this pilot-study have been used for the power-calculation of a future randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study called âPalliative-Dâ that will start in Nov 2017 and will include 254 palliative cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2751227353,"The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of general anesthesia on neonatal brain activity using amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG).A prospective cohort study of neonates (January 2013-December 2015), who underwent major neonatal surgery for non-cardiac congenital anomalies. Anesthesia was administered at the discretion of the anesthetist. aEEG monitoring was started six hours preoperatively until 24 hours after surgery. Analysis of classes of aEEG background patterns, ranging from continuous normal voltage to flat trace in six classes, and quantitative EEG-measures, using spontaneous activity transients (SATs) and interSATintervals (ISI), was performed.In total, 111 neonates were included (36 preterm/75 full-term), age at time of surgery was (median (range) 2 (0-32) days. During anesthesia depression of brain activity was seen, with background patterns ranging from flat trace to discontinuous normal voltage. In most patients brain activity was two background pattern classes lower during anesthesia. After cessation of anesthesia, recovery to preoperative brain activity occurred within 24 hours in 86% of the preterm and 96% of the term infants. Gestational age and the dose of sevoflurane were significantly associated with SAT-rate (F(2,68) = 9.288, p < 0.001) and ISI- durations during surgery (F(3,71) = 12.96, p < 0.001). Background pattern and quantitative EEG-values were not associated with brain lesions (Ï2(4) = 2.086, ns).aEEG shows a variable reduction of brain activity in response to anesthesia in neonates with noncardiac congenital anomalies, with fast recovery after cessation of anesthesia. This reduction is related to gestational age and the dose of sevoflurane. The aEEG offers the opportunity to monitor the depth of anesthesia in the neonate."
https://openalex.org/W2752676576,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) profoundly affect quality of life and have been gradually increasing in incidence, prevalence and severity in many areas of the world, and in children in particular. Patients with suspected IBD require careful history and clinical examination, while definitive diagnosis relies on endoscopic and histological findings. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the alveolar air of pediatric patients with IBD presents a specific volatile organic compoundsâ (VOCs) pattern when compared to controls. Patients 10â17 years of age, were divided into four groups: Crohnâs disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), controls with gastrointestinal symptomatology, and surgical controls with no evidence of gastrointestinal problems. Alveolar breath was analyzed by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry. Four models were built starting from 81 molecules plus the age of subjects as independent variables, adopting a penalizing LASSO logistic regression approach: 1) IBDs vs. controls, finally based on 18 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 95%, specificity = 69%, AUC = 0.925); 2) CD vs. UC, finally based on 13 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 76%, AUC = 0.934); 3) IBDs vs. gastroenterological controls, finally based on 15 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 65%, AUC = 0.918); 4) IBDs vs. controls, built starting from the 21 directly or indirectly calibrated molecules only, and finally based on 12 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 71%, AUC = 0.888). The molecules identified by the models were carefully studied in relation to the concerned outcomes. This study, with the creation of models based on VOCs profiles, precise instrumentation and advanced statistical methods, can contribute to the development of new nonâinvasive, fast and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tools, with high sensitivity and specificity. It also represents a crucial step towards gaining further insights on the etiology of IBD through the analysis of specific molecules which are the expression of the particular metabolism that characterizes these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2753511041,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-mediated tissue engineering represents a promising strategy to address adipose tissue defects. MSCs derived from Whartonâs jelly of the umbilical cord (WJCMSCs) may serve as an ideal source for adipose tissue engineering due to their abundance, safety profile, and accessibility. How to activate the directed differentiation potentials of WJCMSCs is the core point for their clinical applications. A thorough investigation of mechanisms involved in WJCMSC adipogenic differentiation is necessary to support their application in adipose tissue engineering and address shortcomings. Previous study showed, compared with periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), WJCMSCs had a weakened adipogenic differentiation potentials and lower expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2). IGFBP2 may be involved in the adipogenesis of MSCs. Generally, IGFBP2 is involved in regulating biological activity of insulin-like growth factors, however, its functions in human MSCs are unclear. Here, we found IGFBP2 expression was upregulated upon adipogenic induction, and that IGFBP2 enhanced adipogenic differentiation of WJCMSCs and BMSCs. Moreover, IGFBP2 increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) and p-Akt, and activated JNK or Akt signaling significantly promoted adipogenic differentiation of MSCs. Furthermore, inhibitor-mediated blockage of either JNK or Akt signaling dramatically reduced IGFBP2-mediated adipogenic differentiation. And the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 markedly blocked IGFBP2-mediated Akt activation. Moreover, IGFBP2 was negatively regulated by BCOR, which inhibited adipogenic differentiation of WJCMSCs. Overall, our results reveal a new function of IGFBP2, providing a novel insight into the mechanism of adipogenic differentiation and identifying a potential target mediator for improving adipose tissue engineering based on WJCMSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2753807221,"To investigate the incidence and risk factors for retinal detachment (RD) after cataract surgery or refractive lens exchange (RLE) in patients aged below 61 years.Retrospective medical chart review of 7,886 patients (13,925 eyes) who underwent cataract surgery or RLE. Patients aged below 61 years were selected. Age, gender, axial length, follow-up times, and the occurrence of RD were recorded. Additional characteristics documented for RD cases were: history of RD, preexisting retinal findings, laser capsulotomy, status of macula at RD, date and details of RD.From a total of 421 patients (677 eyes) aged below 61 years 24 cases of RD were identified, resulting in an overall cumulative incidence per eyes of 3.55%. The mean follow-up time was 45 Â± 32.8 months. Ninety-two % of all RDs occurred within 3.6 years from surgery. Axial length had a significant effect on the risk of RD after cataract/ RLE surgery (HR = 1.42, P = 0.0001, 95% CI 1.19-1.69). The highest incidence of RD occurred in the subgroup of 25 to 28.9 mm axial length (10.2%). With an increase in age of ten years, the hazard of postoperative RD was not significantly increased by a factor of 1.50 (P = 0.286, 95% CI 0.71-3.15). The highest incidence of RD occurred in patients aged 50-54 years (5.39%). Compared to females, males had an almost twofold not significant risk of postoperative RD (HR = 1.96, P = 0.123, 95% CI 0.83-4.63). None of the RD cases had a history of RD.Axial length is a significant risk factor for pseudophakic RD. The need for cataract surgery or RLE should be carefully considered in patients with axial lengths between 25 and 29 mm, aged 50-54 years, in males, and in case of preexisting retinal findings."
https://openalex.org/W2751360441,"Although the King-Devick (K-D) test has been used frequently in assessing sports related concussion early after injury, its characteristics over time after injury and in patients with prolonged persistent symptoms are unknown. The purpose of this paper was to: evaluate the ability of the K-D Test to distinguish patients seen early after concussion from those with symptoms persisting more than 3 months compared to controls, assess changes in the K-D test times over time after concussion, and determine the relationship of K-D times to the Stroop Color and Word Test scores. We performed cross-sectional comparisons of patients with recent concussive brain injury (acute group) and those with symptoms persisting more than 3 months to healthy controls on the K-D test, the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3), and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Longitudinal comparisons of the acute group over time within the first month after injury were also made. Post-concussive syndrome (PCS) patients had significantly higher K-D times compared to controls (p = 0.01), while the acute group did not differ from controls(p = 0.33). K-D times at the second visit for the acute group were similar to those of controls (54.7 vs. 49.6, p = 0.31). While SCAT3 scores improved over time in the acute group, the K-D scores did not change between the first and second visit (55.2 vs. 54.7, p = 0.94). K-D scores correlated significantly with the Stroop scores for all three participant groups. The K-D test is likely useful very early after concussion in conjunction with baseline scores, and while scores in PCS patients remain elevated, they can be confounded by factors such as pre-morbid depression and medication use. High correlations with Stroop scores also suggest that performance on the K-D test can by proxy provide additional insight about cognitive function and predict performance on more cognitively demanding tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2753266295,"In recent years, image databases are growing at exponential rates, making their management, indexing, and retrieval, very challenging. Typical image retrieval systems rely on sample images as queries. However, in the absence of sample query images, hand-drawn sketches are also used. The recent adoption of touch screen input devices makes it very convenient to quickly draw shaded sketches of objects to be used for querying image databases. This paper presents a mechanism to provide access to visual information based on usersâ hand-drawn partially colored sketches using touch screen devices. A key challenge for sketch-based image retrieval systems is to cope with the inherent ambiguity in sketches due to the lack of colors, textures, shading, and drawing imperfections. To cope with these issues, we propose to fine-tune a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using augmented dataset to extract features from partially colored hand-drawn sketches for query specification in a sketch-based image retrieval framework. The large augmented dataset contains natural images, edge maps, hand-drawn sketches, de-colorized, and de-texturized images which allow CNN to effectively model visual contents presented to it in a variety of forms. The deep features extracted from CNN allow retrieval of images using both sketches and full color images as queries. We also evaluated the role of partial coloring or shading in sketches to improve the retrieval performance. The proposed method is tested on two large datasets for sketch recognition and sketch-based image retrieval and achieved better classification and retrieval performance than many existing methods."

https://openalex.org/W2751154014,"One potent lactic acid bacterial strain C14 with strong antifungal activity was isolated from homemade curd. Based on morphological as well as biochemical characters and 16S rDNA sequence homology the strain was identified as Lactobacillus fermentum. It displayed a wide antimicrobial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, and also against number of food spoilage, plant and human pathogenic fungi. The cell free supernatant (CFS) of the strain C14 was also effective against the fungi tested. Inhibition of radial growth of Penicillium digitatum, Trichophyton rubrum and Mucor sp. was noticed in the presence of CFS of C14 even at low concentration (1%). More than 94.3 Â± 1.6% and 91.5 Â± 2.2% inhibition of conidial germination of P. digitatum and Mucor sp. were noticed in the presence of 10-fold-concentrated CFS of C14. Massive deformation of the fungal mycelia was observed by SEM studies, and losses of cellular proteins and DNA are also evident upon its treatment with C14. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of phenyl lactic acid, lactic acid along with some unidentified compounds in the antifungal extract. Challenge experiment showed immense potential of the strain C14 in preventing the spoilage of bread samples caused by Mucor sp. and Bacillus subtilis. The bread samples remained fresh upto 25 days even after inoculation with Mucor sp. (3.7 Ã 104 spores /ml) and B. subtilis (4.6 Ã 104 CFU /ml). Along with the antifungal properties, the isolated lactic acid bacterial strain also showed very good antioxidant activities. Unchanged level of liver enzymes serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in albino mice upon feeding with C14 also suggested non-toxic nature of the bacterial isolate."

Some foods and supplements can compensate for this deficiency; thus, they can aid in the prevention or treatment of diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Cyclocarya paliurus extract (CPE) on insulin signaling and its capacity to correct hyperglycemia in the absence of insulin. To investigate the hypoglycemic effects of CPE, C2C12 cells were exposed to CPE (50 and 100 Î¼g/mL). CPE promoted 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2NBDG) uptake into the cells via translocation of glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) to the plasma membrane. In addition, CPE enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate and activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B (Akt) via sirtuin1 in C2C12 cells. Moreover, we found that oral administration of CPE (1 g/kg) to streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mice produced a progressive decrease in plasma glucose levels at 1 h after single dosing. At that point, CPE significantly increased the expression of skeletal muscle membrane Glut4 and enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt. These results suggest that CPE exerts antidiabetic effects similar to those of insulin, and may be an oral therapeutic alternative for the management of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2753261897,"The ability of Baboons (papio papio) to distinguish between English words and nonwords has been modeled using a deep learning convolutional network model that simulates a ventral pathway in which lexical representations of different granularity develop. However, given that pigeons (columba livia), whose brain morphology is drastically different, can also be trained to distinguish between English words and nonwords, it appears that a less species-specific learning algorithm may be required to explain this behavior. Accordingly, we examined whether the learning model of Rescorla and Wagner, which has proved to be amazingly fruitful in understanding animal and human learning could account for these data. We show that a discrimination learning network using gradient orientation features as input units and word and nonword units as outputs succeeds in predicting baboon lexical decision behaviorâincluding key lexical similarity effects and the ups and downs in accuracy as learning unfoldsâwith surprising precision. The models performance, in which words are not explicitly represented, is remarkable because it is usually assumed that lexicality decisions, including the decisions made by baboons and pigeons, are mediated by explicit lexical representations. By contrast, our results suggest that in learning to perform lexical decision tasks, baboons and pigeons do not construct a hierarchy of lexical units. Rather, they make optimal use of low-level information obtained through the massively parallel processing of gradient orientation features. Accordingly, we suggest that reading in humans first involves initially learning a high-level system building on letter representations acquired from explicit instruction in literacy, which is then integrated into a conventionalized oral communication system, and that like the latter, fluent reading involves the massively parallel processing of the low-level features encoding semantic contrasts."
https://openalex.org/W2752407839,"Depression is under-diagnosed and under-treated in most areas of the US. New York City is currently looking to close gaps in identifying and treating depression through the adoption of a screening and collaborative care model deployed throughout the city.We examine the cost-effectiveness of universal two-stage screening with the 2- and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) in New York City followed by collaborative care for those who screen positive. We conducted microsimulations on hypothetical adult participants between ages 20 and 70.The incremental cost-effectiveness of the interventions over the average lifespan of a 20-year-old adult in NYC is approximately $1,726/QALY gained (95% plausible interval: cost-saving, $10,594/QALY gained).Two-stage screening coupled with collaborative care for depression in the clinical setting appears to be significantly less expensive than most clinical preventive interventions, such as HIV screening in high-risk patients. However, effectiveness is dependent on the city's ability to manage scale up of collaborative care models."
https://openalex.org/W2751494359,"Background Stress is a significant factor in the etiology of depression. Stellate ganglion block (SGB) has been shown to maintain the stability of the autonomic system and to affect the neuroendocrine system, including the hypothalamicâpituitaryâadrenal (HPA) axis. The objective of this study was to determine the antidepressant-like effects of SGB on the autonomic system and the HPA axis, apoptosis-related proteins, related spatial learning and memory impairment, and sensorimotor dysfunction. Methods Forty-eight Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to four experimental groups: control + saline (sham group), control + SGB (SGB group), unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) + saline (UCMS group), and UCMS + SGB (UCSG group). Stress-induced effects and the function of SGB were assessed using measures of body weight, coat state, sucrose consumption, and behavior in open-field and Y-maze tests. Neuronal damage was assessed histologically using the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining method, while western blotting was used to investigate changes in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Plasma corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT), noradrenaline and adrenaline were measured to evaluate changes in the autonomic system and HPA axis. Results SGB treatment significantly improved sensorimotor dysfunction and spatial learning and memory impairment following UCMS. Moreover, UCMS significantly decreased body weight, sucrose preference and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and increased scores on measures of coat state, adrenal gland weight, levels of CORT, CRF, ACTH, noradrenaline and adrenaline, as well as increased neuronal loss, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. These symptoms were attenuated by treatment with SGB. Conclusions These findings suggest that SGB can attenuate depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. These protective effects appear to be due to an anti-apoptotic mechanism of two stress pathwaysâthe autonomic system and the HPA axis."
https://openalex.org/W2753352465,"Prognostic factors and therapeutic targets are needed for the patients with cervical adenocarcinoma because they have a poor prognosis. Recently, co-expression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has been found to be associated with aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis of several types of malignancy. To evaluate the significance of the expression of multiple RTKs in uterine cervical cancers, we examined the expression profile of RTKs (EGFR, HER2 and c-Met) and the correlation of their expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with cervical adenocarcinomas. AIS and adenocarcinoma showed strong expression of a single RTK (EGFR, HER2 or c-Met) on the cell membrane in 41 (77.4%) of 53 cases. Twenty (46%) of the 43 adenocarcinoma cases were positive for double or triple RTKs (P = 0.034). Positivity for EGFR and double positivity for EGFR and HER2 (EGFR+/HER2+/c-Met+ and EGFR+/HER2+/c-Met-) were significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.010 for single and P = 0.013 for double) and UICC stage (P = 0.021 for single and P = 0.007 for double). Positivity for HER2 was significantly correlated with tumor size (P = 0.029). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly shorter in patients who were double positive for EGFR and HER2. Our results suggest that EGFR and HER2 are potential therapeutic targets and that their co-expression is a prognostic factor for cervical adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2753253536,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) manifests as chronic abdominal pain. One pathophysiological theory states that the brain-gut axis is responsible for pain control in the intestine. Although several studies have discussed the structural changes in the brain of IBS patients, most of these studies have been conducted in Western populations. Different cultures and sexes experience different pain sensations and have different pain responses. Accordingly, we aimed to identify the specific changes in the cortical thickness of Asian women with IBS and to compare these data to those of non-Asian women with IBS.Thirty Asian female IBS patients (IBS group) and 39 healthy individuals (control group) were included in this study. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed. We used FreeSurfer to analyze the differences in the cortical thickness and their correlations with patient characteristics.The left cuneus, left rostral middle frontal cortex, left supramarginal cortex, right caudal anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral insula exhibited cortical thinning in the IBS group compared with those in the controls. Furthermore, the brain cortical thickness correlated negatively the severity as well as duration of abdominal pain.Some of our findings differ from those of Western studies. In our study, all of the significant brain regions in the IBS group exhibited cortical thinning compared with those in the controls. The differences in cortical thickness between the IBS patients and controls may provide useful information to facilitate regulating abdominal pain in IBS patients. These findings offer insights into the association of different cultures and sexes with differences in cortical thinning in patients with IBS."
https://openalex.org/W2753730548,"Environmental stochasticity and climate affect outcomes in evolutionary games, which can thereby affect biological diversity. Our maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of replicator dynamics for morph frequency data from control (25 years) and three experimentally perturbed populations (14 years) of side-blotched lizards yield a 3 Ã 3 payoff matrix in the generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors family; it has intransitive best replies, and each strategy is its own worst reply. ML estimates indicate significant interactive effects of density and temperature on morph frequency. Implied dynamics feature a powerful interior attractor and recover (for the first time) observed 4-5 year oscillations. Our evolutionary experiment on morph frequency confirms that oscillations are driven by frequency dependent selection, but climate entrains the cycles across the perturbed and control populations within 10 generations. Applying the model across the species range, we find that climate also accounts for morph fixation and mating system diversity, suggesting climate may similarly impact ecosystem diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2753275353,"The main structural component of connective tissues is fibrillar, cross-linked collagen whose fibrillogenesis can be modulated by Small Leucine-Rich Proteins/Proteoglycans (SLRPs). Not all SLRPsâ effects on collagen and extracellular matrix in vivo have been elucidated; one of the less investigated SLRPs is asporin. Here we describe the successful generation of an Aspn-/- mouse model and the investigation of the Aspn-/- skin phenotype. Functionally, Aspn-/- mice had an increased skin mechanical toughness, although there were no structural changes present on histology or immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy analyses showed 7% thinner collagen fibrils in Aspn-/- mice (not statistically significant). Several matrix genes were upregulated, including collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1), matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp2, Mmp3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl2), while lysyl hydroxylase (Plod2) was downregulated. Intriguingly no differences were observed in collagen protein content or in collagen cross-linking-related lysine oxidation or hydroxylation. The glycosaminoglycan content and structure in Aspn-/- skin was profoundly altered: chondroitin/dermatan sulfate was more than doubled and had an altered composition, while heparan sulfate was halved and had a decreased sulfation. Also, decorin and biglycan were doubled in Aspn-/- skin. Overall, asporin deficiency changes skin glycosaminoglycan composition, and decorin and biglycan content, which may explain the changes in skin mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2750975849,"Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) play critical roles in reducing water loss and chemical communication. Species-specific CHC profiles have been used increasingly as an excellent character for species classification. However, considerably less is known about their potential for population delimitation within species. The aims of this study were to develop a solid-phase microextraction (SPME)-based CHC collection method and to investigate whether CHC profiles could serve as potential chemotaxonomic tools for intraspecific delimitation in Acyrthosiphon pisum. Optimization of fibers for SPME sampling revealed that 7 Î¼m polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) demonstrated the most efficient adsorption of CHCs among five different tested fibers. SPME sampling showed good reproducibility with repeated collections of CHCs from a single aphid. Validation of SPME was performed by comparing CHC profiles with those from conventional hexane extractions. The two methods showed no qualitative differences in CHCs, although SPME appeared to extract relatively fewer short-chained CHCs. While CHC profiles of a given population differed among developmental stages, wing dimorphism types, and host plants, wingless adult aphids showed very low variance in relative proportions of individual CHC components. Reproducibility of CHC profiles was explored further to classify wingless adult morphs of A. pisum from five different geographic regions that showed no variation in mitochondrial COI gene sequences. Our results demonstrate that CHC profiles are useful in intraspecific delimitation in the field of insect chemotaxonomy."
https://openalex.org/W2752234659,"Accumulating evidence indicates that cannabinoid CB1 receptor ligands play a pivotal role in seizures, not only in preclinical studies on animals, but also in clinical settings. This study was aimed at characterizing the influence of arachidonyl-2â²-chloroethylamide (ACEAâa selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist) co-administered with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) on the anticonvulsant potency of various antiepileptic drugs (clobazam, lacosamide, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, tiagabine and valproate) in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation model. Psychomotor seizures in male albino Swiss mice were evoked by a current (32 mA, 6 Hz, 3 s stimulus duration) delivered via corneal electrodes. Potential adverse effects produced by the antiepileptic drugs in combination with ACEA+PMSF were assessed using the chimney test (motor performance), passive avoidance task (remembering and acquisition of learning), and grip-strength test (muscular strength). Brain concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were measured by HPLC to exclude any pharmacokinetic contribution to the observed effect. ACEA (5 mg/kg, i.p.) + PMSF (30 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly potentiated the anticonvulsant potency of levetiracetam (P<0.05), but not that of clobazam, lacosamide, phenobarbital, tiagabine or valproate in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation model. Moreover, ACEA+PMSF did not significantly affect total brain concentrations of levetiracetam in mice. No behavioral side effects were observed in animals receiving combinations of the studied antiepileptic drugs with ACEA+PMSF. In conclusion, the combined administration of ACEA+PMSF with levetiracetam is associated with beneficial anticonvulsant pharmacodynamic interaction in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation model. The selective activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the brain may enhance levetiracetam-related suppression of seizures in epilepsy patients, contributing to the efficacious treatment of epilepsy in future."

However, the clonality of this organism in the male population and infertile couples in China is largely unknown. In this study, 96 (53 U. parvum and 43 U. urealyticum) of 103 Ureaplasma spp. strains recovered from genital specimens from male patients and 15 pairs of infertile couples were analyzed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST)/expanded multilocus sequence typing (eMLST) schemes. A total of 39 sequence types (STs) and 53 expanded sequence types (eSTs) were identified, with three predominant STs (ST1, ST9 and ST22) and eSTs (eST16, eST41 and eST82). Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct clusters that were highly congruent with the taxonomic differences between the two Ureaplasma species. We found significant differences in the distributions of both clusters and sub-groups between the male and female patients (P < 0.001). Moreover, 66.7% and 40.0% of the male and female partners of the infertile couples tested positive for Ureaplasma spp. The present study also attained excellent agreement of the identification of both Ureaplasma species between paired urine and semen specimens from the male partners (k > 0.80). However, this concordance was observed only for the detection of U. urealyticum within the infertile couples. In conclusion, the distributions of the clusters and sub-groups significantly differed between the male and female patients. U. urealyticum is more likely to transmit between infertile couples and be associated with clinical manifestations by the specific epidemic clonal lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2751813940,"The effects of poaching on wildlife have been widely studied in conservation biology and can be heterogeneous, particularly on ungulates. These effects can be estimated through different methodologies whose use depends on several conditions such as Flight-initiation distance (FID). Our objectives were: 1- to evaluate whether poaching affects the FID and group structure of a guanaco (Lama guanicoe) population in a high cold desert in San Juan (Argentina); 2- to assess whether habitat structure (slope and vegetation cover) influences FID and group structure in this population. The study area included a site with poaching (unprotected area), and a site without poaching (protected area). We recorded 100 groups of guanacos: 70 in the protected and 30 in the unprotected area. FID and group size were greater in the unprotected than in the protected area, whereas proportions of group categories (with offspring, without offspring and solitary) were similar between areas. Besides, in relation to habitat structure, FID increased when vegetation cover decreased. On the other hand, FID and group size were not affected by slope. Our study shows that guanacos respond to poaching pressure as do other ungulate species, and that other factors such as vegetation cover also affect this behavior. Managers should be aware when interpreting FID due to its relation to habitat structure; the guanaco appears to assume greater risk (lower FID) in areas with high vegetation cover."
https://openalex.org/W2752113874,"Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a naturally occurring ectopeptidase present in mammalian semen. Previous studies have demonstrated that APN adversely affects male fertility through the alteration of sperm motility. This enzyme constitutes 0.5 to 1% of the seminal plasma proteins, which can be transferred from the prostasomes to sperms by a fusion process. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of action of APN and its role in regulating sperm functions and male fertility. In this in vitro study, epididymal mouse spermatozoa were incubated in a capacitating media (pH 7) containing 20 ng/mL of recombinant mouse APN for 90 min. Our results demonstrated that the supplementation of recombinant APN in sperm culture medium significantly increased APN activity, and subsequently altered motility, hyperactivated motility, rapid and medium swimming speeds, viability, and the acrosome reaction of mouse spermatozoa. These effects were potentially caused by increased toxicity in the spermatozoa. Further, altered APN activity in sperm culture medium affected early embryonic development. Interestingly, the effect of elevated APN activity in sperm culture medium was independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and protein kinase A activity. On the basis of these results, we concluded that APN plays a significant role in the regulation of several sperm functions and early embryonic development. In addition, increased APN activity could potentially lead to several adverse consequences related to male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2753737444,"The Sortase family of transpeptidases are found in numerous gram-positive bacteria and involved in divergent physiological processes including anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall as well as pili assembly. As essential proteins, sortase enzymes have been the focus of considerable interest for the development of novel anti-microbials, however, more recently their function as unique transpeptidases has been exploited for the synthesis of novel bio-conjugates. Yet, for synthetic purposes, SrtA-mediated conjugation suffers from the enzymeâs inherently poor catalytic efficiency. Therefore, to identify SrtA variants with improved catalytic efficiency, we used directed evolution to select a catalytically enhanced SrtA enzyme. An analysis of improved SrtA variants in the context of sequence conservation, NMR and x-ray crystal structures, and kinetic data suggests a novel mechanism for catalysis involving large conformational changes that delivers substrate to the active site pocket. Indeed, using DEER-EPR spectroscopy, we reveal that upon substrate binding, SrtA undergoes a large scissors-like conformational change that simultaneously translates the sort-tag substrate to the active site in addition to repositioning key catalytic residues for esterification. A better understanding of Sortase dynamics will significantly enhance future engineering and drug discovery efforts."

We evaluated the occurrence of radiation-related side effects on the anterior and posterior segment of the eye. The influence of patient, tumor and treatment parameters on outcome was analyzed by multivariate time to event analysis considering competing risks.The median overall follow-up was 37.9 months. After treatment, the estimated risk at 12, 24 and 48 months for developing anterior segment complications was 25.3%, 37.5% and 50.3% for cataract formation and 5.4%, 6.4% and 8.1% for secondary glaucoma, respectively. The estimated risk for the occurrence of posterior segment complications 12, 24 and 48 months after treatment was 3.1%, 6.7% and 18.3% for radiation retinopathy, 18.3%, 27.1% and 42.6% for radiation maculopathy and 16.5%, 21.0% and 32.8% for radiation neuropathy, respectively. The risk of an increase in retinal detachment after treatment was 14.7%, 14.7% and 17.4% at 12, 24 and 48 months, respectively. The risk of vitreous hemorrhage occurring after treatment was 6.2%, 8.1% and 12.7%, and the risk of tumor vasculopathy was 15.4%, 17.4% and 19.0%. Scleral necrosis was observed in one patient.Radiation-related side effects and complications are common among patients treated with ruthenium brachytherapy for uveal melanoma. However, the risk for those largely depends on individual tumor parameters. Before treatment, patients should be informed of their specific risks to develop various side effects. Patient information before treatment should cover not only general information about the treatment and possible complications and side effects but should also give details on the specific risks of the patient in her individual situation. This also includes elucidating the patient's individual resources and expectations and her willingness for long-term regular follow-up examinations and secondary adjunct treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2752848729,"In the current study, we evaluate the equivalent stiffness of peritubular reinforcement effect (PRE) of porous dentine optimized by the thickness of peritubular dentine (PTD). Few studies to date have evaluated or quantitated the effect of PRE on composite dentine. The miscrostructure of porous dentine is captured by scanning electron microscope images, and then finite element modeling is used to quantitate the deformation and stiffness of the porous dentine structure. By optimizing the radius of PTD and dentine tubule (DT), the proposed FE model is able to demonstrate the effect of peritubular reinforcement on porous dentine stiffness. It is concluded that the dentinal equivalent stiffness is reduced and degraded with the increase of the radius of DT (i.e., porosity) in the certain ratio value of Ep/Ei and certain radius of PTD, where Ep is the PTD modulus and Ei is the intertubular dentine modulus. So in order to ensure the whole dentinal equivalent stiffness is not loss, the porosity should get some value while the Ep/Ei is certain. Thus, PTD prevents the stress concentration around DTs and reduces the risk of DTs failure. Mechanically, the overall role of PTD appears to enhance the stiffness of the dentine composite structure. These results provide some new and significant insights into the biological evolution of the optimal design for the porous dentine microstructure. These findings on the biological microstructure design of dentine materials are applicable to other engineering structural designs aimed at increasing the overall structural strength."

There is only limited genetic proof that the studbook records of female lines of Egyptian Arabian pedigrees are reliable. This study characterized the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) signatures of 126 horses representing 14 matrilines in the Egyptian Agricultural Organization (EAO) horse-breeding program.Analysis of the whole D-loop sequence yielded additional information compared to hypervariable region-1 (HVR1) analysis alone, with 42 polymorphic sites representing ten haplotypes compared to 16 polymorphic sites representing nine haplotypes, respectively. Most EAO haplotypes belonged to ancient haplogroups, suggesting origin from a wide geographical area over many thousands of years, although one haplotype was novel.Historical families share haplotypes and some individuals from different strains belonged to the same haplogroup: the classical EAO strain designation is not equivalent to modern monophyletic matrilineal groups. Phylogenetic inference showed that the foundation mares of the historical haplotypes were highly likely to have the same haplotypes as the animals studied (p > 0.998 in all cases), confirming the reliability of EAO studbook records and providing the opportunity for breeders to confirm the ancestry of their horses."

The use of progeny generated from inter-specific hybridization and backcrossing has been developed as a novel model system to explore gene expression divergence. The present study investigated the analysis of gene expression and miRNA regulation in backcrossed introgression lines constructed from cultivated and wild rice. High-throughput sequencing was used to compare gene and miRNA expression profiles in three progeny lines (L1710, L1817 and L1730), with different plant heights resulting from the backcrossing of introgression lines (BC2F12) and their parents (O. sativa and O. longistaminata). A total of 25,387 to 26,139 mRNAs and 379 to 419 miRNAs were obtained in these rice lines. More differentially expressed genes and miRNAs were detected in progeny/O. longistaminata comparison groups than in progeny/O. sativa comparison groups. Approximately 80% of the genes and miRNAs showed expression level dominance to O. sativa, indicating that three progeny lines were closer to the recurrent parent, which might be influenced by their parental genome dosage. Approximately 16% to 64% of the differentially expressed miRNAs possessing coherent target genes were predicted, and many of these miRNAs regulated multiple target genes. Most genes were up-regulated in progeny lines compared with their parents, but down-regulated in the higher plant height line in the comparison groups among the three progeny lines. Moreover, certain genes related to cell walls and plant hormones might play crucial roles in the plant height variations of the three progeny lines. Taken together, these results provided valuable information on the molecular mechanisms of hybrid backcrossing and plant height variations based on the gene and miRNA expression levels in the three progeny lines."

The role of fractalkine in anti-viral (type 1) and pathogenic (type 2) responses to rhinovirus infection in allergic asthma is unknown. To determine whether (1) fractalkine is produced in airway cells and in peripheral blood leucocytes, (2) rhinovirus infection increases production of fractalkine and (3) levels of fractalkine differ in asthmatic compared to non-asthmatic subjects. Fractalkine protein and mRNA levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-asthmatic controls (n = 15) and mild allergic asthmatic (n = 15) subjects. Protein levels of fractalkine were also measured in macrophages polarised ex vivo to give M1 (type 1) and M2 (type 2) macrophages and in BAL fluid obtained from mild (n = 11) and moderate (n = 14) allergic asthmatic and non-asthmatic control (n = 10) subjects pre and post in vivo rhinovirus infection. BAL cells produced significantly greater levels of fractalkine than PBMCs. Rhinovirus infection increased production of fractalkine by BAL cells from non-asthmatic controls (P<0.01) and in M1-polarised macrophages (P<0.05), but not in BAL cells from mild asthmatics or in M2 polarised macrophages. Rhinovirus induced fractalkine in PBMCs from asthmatic (P<0.001) and healthy control subjects (P<0.05). Trends towards induction of fractalkine in moderate asthmatic subjects during in vivo rhinovirus infection failed to reach statistical significance. Fractalkine may be involved in both immunopathological and anti-viral immune responses to rhinovirus infection. Further investigation into how fractalkine is regulated across different cell types and into the effect of stimulation including rhinovirus infection is warranted to better understand the precise role of this unique dual adhesion factor and chemokine in immune cell recruitment."

Peptides were designed targeting sGCÎ±1 to block its pro-cancer functions and one peptide is discussed here. Peptide B-8R killed both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells that expressed sGCÎ±1, but not cells that do not express this gene. Peptide B-8R induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Importantly, Peptide B-8R does not affect nor its cytotoxicity depend on NO signaling, despite the fact that it associates with sGCÎ±1, which dimerizes with sGCÎ²1 to form the sGC enzyme. Just as with a previously studied Peptide A-8R, Peptide B-8R induced elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in prostate cancer cells, but using a ROS-sequestering agent showed that ROS was not responsible the cytotoxic activity of Peptide B-8R. Interestingly, Peptide B-8R induced elevated levels of p53 and phosphorylated p38, but neither of these changes is the cause of the peptideâs cytotoxicity. Additional drugs were used to alter levels of iron levels in cells and these studies showed that Peptide B-8R activity does not depend on Ferroptosis. Thus, future work will be directed at defining the mechanism of cytotoxic action of Peptide B-8R against prostate cancer cells."

The S. aureus strain Wood 46 has been variously reported as protein A-deficient and/or spa negative and used as a control in animal models of staphylococcal infections. The results of this study indicate that Wood 46 has normal spa expression but transcribes very low levels of the srtA gene which encodes the sortase A (SrtA) enzyme. This is consistent with unique mutations in the srtA promoter. In this study, a low level of sortase A explains deficient anchoring of proteins with an LPXTG motif, such as protein A, fibrinogen-binding protein and fibronectin-binding proteins A and B on to the peptidoglycan cell wall. The activity of secreted protein A is an important consideration for use of Wood 46 in functional experiments and animal models."
https://openalex.org/W2751900772,"Metabolic stress evoked by myocardial ischemia leads to impairment of cardiac excitation and contractility. We studied the mechanisms by which metabolic inhibition affects the activity of L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) in frog ventricular myocytes. Metabolic inhibition induced by the protonophore FCCP (as well as by 2,4- dinitrophenol, sodium azide or antimycin A) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of LTCC current (ICa,L) which was more pronounced during Î²-adrenergic stimulation with isoprenaline. ICa,L was still reduced by metabolic inhibition even in the presence of 3 mM intracellular ATP, or when the cell was dialysed with cAMP or ATP-Î³-S to induce irreversible thiophosphorylation of LTCCs, indicating that reduction in ICa,L is not due to ATP depletion and/or reduced phosphorylation of the channels. However, the effect of metabolic inhibition on ICa,L was strongly attenuated when the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP-synthase was blocked by oligomycin or when the cells were dialysed with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PCP. Moreover, increasing the intracellular pH buffering capacity or intracellular dialysis of the myocytes with an alkaline solution strongly attenuated the inhibitory effect of FCCP on ICa,L. Thus, our data demonstrate that metabolic inhibition leads to excessive ATP hydrolysis by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP-synthase operating in the reverse mode and this results in intracellular acidosis causing the suppression of ICa,L. Limiting ATP break-down by F1F0-ATP-synthase and the consecutive development of intracellular acidosis might thus represent a potential therapeutic approach for maintaining a normal cardiac function during ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2752403812,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is the second most common cutaneous malignancy. Despite various available treatment methods and advances in noninvasive diagnostic techniques, the incidence of metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is rising. Deficiency in effective preventive or treatment methods of transformed keratinocytes leads to necessity of searching for new anticancer agents. The present study aims to evaluate the possibility of using wool hydrolysates as such agents. Commercially available compounds such as 5-fluorouracil, ingenol mebutate, diclofenac sodium salt were also used in this study. The process of wool degradation was based on chemical pre-activation and enzymatic digestion of wool. The effect of mentioned compounds on cell viability of squamous carcinoma cell line and healthy keratinocytes was evaluated. The obtained data show a significantly stronger effect of selected wool hydrolysates compared to commercial compounds (p<0.05) on viability of cells. The wool hydrolysates decreased squamous cell carcinoma cells viability by up to 67% comparing to untreated cells. These results indicate bioactive properties of wool hydrolysates, which affect the viability of squamous carcinoma cells and decrease their number. We hypothesize that these agents may be used topically for treatment of transformed keratinocytes in actinic keratosis and invasive squamous skin cancer in humans."

The mechanisms for how acidosis facilitates kidney injury are not fully understood. To investigate whether low pH directly affects the expression of genes controlling local homeostasis in renal tubules, we performed transcription start site sequencing (TSS-Seq) using IN-IC cells, a cell line derived from rat renal collecting duct intercalated cells, with acid loading for 24 h. Peak calling identified 651 up-regulated and 128 down-regulated TSSs at pH 7.0 compared with those at pH 7.4. Among them, 424 and 38 TSSs were â¥ 1.0 and â¤ -1.0 in Log2 fold change, which were annotated to 193 up-regulated and 34 down-regulated genes, respectively. We used gene ontology analysis and manual curation to profile the up-regulated genes. The analysis revealed that many up-regulated genes are involved in renal fibrosis, implying potential molecular mechanisms induced by metabolic acidosis. To verify the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a candidate pathway activated by acidosis, we examined the expression of proteins from cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. The expression of ubiquitinated proteins was greater at pH 7.0 than at pH 7.4, suggesting that low pH activates the UPS. The in vivo study demonstrated that acid loading increased the expression of ubiquitin proteins in the collecting duct cells in mouse kidneys. Motif analysis revealed Egr1, the mRNA expression of which was increased at low pH, as a candidate factor that possibly stimulates gene expression in response to low pH. In conclusion, metabolic acidosis can facilitate renal injury and fibrosis during kidney disease by locally activating various pathways in the renal tubules."

These forecasts are being used as support for the government's proposed pension reform that plans to radically change the Brazilian Constitution insofar as Social Security is concerned. However, the reliability of official results is uncertain since no systematic evaluation of these forecasts has ever been published by the Brazilian government or anyone else. This paper aims to present a study of the accuracy and methodology of the instruments used by the Brazilian government to carry out long-term actuarial forecasts. We base our research on an empirical and probabilistic analysis of the official models. Our empirical analysis shows that the long-term Social Security forecasts are systematically biased in the short term and have significant errors that render them meaningless in the long run. Moreover, the low level of transparency in the methods impaired the replication of results published by the Brazilian Government and the use of outdated data compromises forecast results. In the theoretical analysis, based on a mathematical modeling approach, we discuss the complexity and limitations of the macroeconomic forecast through the computation of confidence intervals. We demonstrate the problems related to error measurement inherent to any forecasting process. We then extend this exercise to the computation of confidence intervals for Social Security forecasts. This mathematical exercise raises questions about the degree of reliability of the Social Security forecasts."

C35 is over-expressed in many invasive breast cancer endogenously, and functions as an oncogene in breast cancer cell lines.The current study aims to investigate effects of C35 on cell viability and migration of HER2-positive breast tumor cells and explore possible mechanisms. The protein expression of C35 in BT-474 breast ductal carcinoma cells was interfered by siRNAs. MTT assay was utilized to detect the viability of BT474 breast ductal carcinoma cells after transfection. The migration of BT474 breast ductal carcinoma cells was examined by cell wound scratch assay.In addition, the protein expression of C35, HER2, AKT and p-AKT in breast ductal carcinoma cells were detected by Western Blot. The protein expression of C35 was weaker in siRNA1 and siRNA2 groups compared with the control group. The relative expression ratio of C35 to Î²-actin decreased significantly in siRNA2 and siRNA1 groups. When C35 expression was interfered by siRNA1 and siRNA2 for 48 h, the viability of BT474 breast ductal carcinoma cells decreased compared with the control group. In addition, the migration of breast ductal carcinoma cells decreased when C35 expression was interfered by siRNA1 for 24 h, and interfered by siRNA1 and siRNA2 for 48 h."
