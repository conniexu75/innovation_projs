https://openalex.org/W1990717355,"To study the potential effects of increased biofuel use, we evaluated six representative analyses of fuel ethanol. Studies that reported negative net energy incorrectly ignored coproducts and used some obsolete data. All studies indicated that current corn ethanol technologies are much less petroleum-intensive than gasoline but have greenhouse gas emissions similar to those of gasoline. However, many important environmental effects of biofuel production are poorly understood. New metrics that measure specific resource inputs are developed, but further research into environmental metrics is needed. Nonetheless, it is already clear that large-scale use of ethanol for fuel will almost certainly require cellulosic technology."

Nacre-a structure found in many molluscan shells-and bone are frequently used as examples for how nature achieves this through hybrid organic-inorganic composites. Unfortunately, it has proven extremely difficult to transcribe nacre-like clever designs into synthetic materials, partly because their intricate structures need to be replicated at several length scales. We demonstrate how the physics of ice formation can be used to develop sophisticated porous and layered-hybrid materials, including artificial bone, ceramic/metal composites, and porous scaffolds for osseous tissue regeneration with strengths up to four times higher than those currently used for implantation."

We report here genomic analyses of planktonic microbial communities in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, from the ocean's surface to near–sea floor depths. Sequence variation in microbial community genes reflected vertical zonation of taxonomic groups, functional gene repertoires, and metabolic potential. The distributional patterns of microbial genes suggested depth-variable community trends in carbon and energy metabolism, attachment and motility, gene mobility, and host-viral interactions. Comparative genomic analyses of stratified microbial communities have the potential to provide significant insight into higher-order community organization and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1966108258,"Despite long study, a molecular picture of the mechanism of water reorientation is still lacking. Using numerical simulations, we find support for a pathway in which the rotating water molecule breaks a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with an overcoordinated first-shell neighbor to form an H-bond with an undercoordinated second-shell neighbor. The H-bond cleavage and the molecular reorientation occur concertedly and not successively as usually considered. This water reorientation mechanism involves large-amplitude angular jumps, rather than the commonly accepted sequence of small diffusive steps, and therefore calls for reinterpretation of many experimental data wherein water rotational relaxation is assumed to be diffusive."

In spite of their substantial threat to human health, remarkably little AIV whole-genome information is available. We report here a preliminary analysis of the first large-scale sequencing of AIVs, including 2196 AIV genes and 169 complete genomes. We combine this new information with public AIV data to identify new gene alleles, persistent genotypes, compensatory mutations, and a potential virulence determinant."

https://openalex.org/W2070204715,"Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a sporadic developmental disorder involving characteristic craniofacial features, cardiac defects, ectodermal abnormalities, and developmental delay. We demonstrate that heterogeneous de novo missense mutations in three genes within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway cause CFC syndrome. The majority of cases (18 out of 23) are caused by mutations in BRAF , a gene frequently mutated in cancer. Of the 11 mutations identified, two result in amino acid substitutions that occur in tumors, but most are unique and suggest previously unknown mechanisms of B-Raf activation. Furthermore, three of five individuals without BRAF mutations had missense mutations in either MEK1 or MEK2 , downstream effectors of B-Raf. Our findings highlight the involvement of the MAPK pathway in human development and will provide a molecular diagnosis of CFC syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2106678312,"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a bile acid (BA)-activated nuclear receptor that plays a major role in the regulation of BA and lipid metabolism. Recently, several studies have suggested a potential role of FXR in the control of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, but its contribution to the maintenance of peripheral glucose homeostasis remains to be established. FXR-deficient mice display decreased adipose tissue mass, lower serum leptin concentrations, and elevated plasma free fatty acid levels. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed that FXR deficiency is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Moreover, whole-body glucose disposal during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp is decreased in FXR-deficient mice. In parallel, FXR deficiency alters distal insulin signaling, as reflected by decreased insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation in both white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Whereas FXR is not expressed in skeletal muscle, it was detected at a low level in white adipose tissue in vivo and induced during adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Moreover, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from FXR-deficient mice displayed impaired adipocyte differentiation, identifying a direct role for FXR in adipocyte function. Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the FXR-specific synthetic agonist GW4064 enhanced insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Finally, treatment with GW4064 improved insulin resistance in genetically obese ob/ob mice in vivo. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be unraveled, these results clearly identify a novel role of FXR in the regulation of peripheral insulin sensitivity and adipocyte function.

(NR1H4) is a nuclear receptor that is activated by bile acids (BAs) (1Kuipers F. Claudel T. Sturm E. Staels B. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2004; 5: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A major physiological role of FXR is to protect liver cells from the deleterious effect of BA overload by decreasing their endogenous production and by accelerating BA biotransformation and excretion (1Kuipers F. Claudel T. Sturm E. Staels B. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2004; 5: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, the generation and characterization of FXR-deficient (FXR-/-) mice has also established a critical role of FXR in lipid metabolism, since these mice display elevated serum levels of triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (2Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have suggested that FXR might also regulate hepatic carbohydrate metabolism (3Cariou B. Duran-Sandoval D. Kuipers F. Staels B. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The first indication came from the observation that hepatic FXR expression is reduced in several rodent models of diabetes (4Duran-Sandoval D. Mautino G. Martin G. Percevault F. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). FXR expression also varies in mouse liver during nutritional changes, being increased during fasting and decreased upon refeeding (5Zhang Y. Castellani L.W. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A.

Moreover, FXR activation by BAs or the synthetic nonsteroidal specific agonist GW4064 (7Maloney P.R. Parks D.J. Haffner C.D. Fivush A.M. Chandra G. Plunket K.D. Creech K.L. Moore L.B. Wilson J.G.

A recent study, using FXR-/- mice, highlighted also a role of FXR in regulating the kinetics of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism during the fasting-refeeding transition phase. Indeed, FXR appears to modulate glycolytic and lipogenic pathways by interfering directly with the transcription of glucose-regulated genes, such as liver pyruvate kinase (6Duran-Sandoval D. Cariou B. Percevault F. Hennuyer N. Grefhorst A. van Dijk T.H. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29971-29979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FXR also controls the adaptive response to fasting, since FXR-/- mice exhibit transient hypoglycemia upon fasting (11Cariou B. van Harmelen K. Duran-Sandoval D. van Dijk T. Grefhorst A. Bouchaert E. Fruchart J.C. Gonzalez F.J. Kuipers F. Staels B. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of FXR in whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity by performing glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies in FXR-/- mice. Interestingly, a decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity was observed in these mice. In vitro studies indicated that FXR directly modulates adipocyte function. Furthermore, we found that treatment with the specific FXR agonist GW4064 improved insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice. These findings provide new evidence to support an important role of FXR in the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Materials—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma France, GW4064 from Genfit SA (Loos, France). Rabbit polyclonal anti-IRβ antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85, and anti-IRS-1 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-PDK1 (Ser241), and anti-PDK1 antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Different kits were used to determine plasma concentrations of various metabolites: insulin (Mercodia AB), leptin and adiponectin (R&D systems), triglycerides, total, and HDL cholesterol (Roche Applied Science), and FFAs (WAKO). Fat content in feces was measured as previously described (12Kok T. Hulzebos C.V. Wolters H. Havinga R. Agellon L.B. Stellaard F. Shan B. Schwarz M. Kuipers F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41930-41937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Animals—Homozygous FXR-/- male mice of 18-20 weeks of age and sex- and age-matched wild type mice (FXR+/+) bred on the C57BL/6N genetic background (2Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) were housed with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free access to water and a standard laboratory chow diet (UAR A03, Villemoison/Orge, France). Ob/Ob mice of 20 weeks of age were treated with the FXR agonist GW4064 (30 mg/kg of body weight/day) or with its vehicle (corn oil) for 10 days via intraperitoneal injection. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—Mice were fasted for 6 h with free access to water. For the glucose tolerance test (GTT), glucose (1 g/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, and blood glucose was measured with the Accu-Check active® (Roche Applied Science) at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. For ITT, recombinant human insulin (Actrapid®, Novo Nordisk) was administered intraperitoneally (FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice, 0.75 units/kg; ob/ob mice, 2 units/kg), and blood glucose was measured at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after insulin injection. Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp Study—These experiments were performed in chronically catheterized, freely moving animals, exactly as described before (13van Dijk T.H. Boer T.S. Havinga R. Stellaard F. Kuipers F. Reijngoud D.J. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In Vivo Insulin Stimulation—After an overnight fast, insulin (0.1 IU/kg) or saline was injected into the inferior venae cavae of anesthetized mice. After 5 min, epididymal fat pads and quadriceps muscle were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method and isolated from 3T3-L1 cells and MEFs using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), as previously described (4Duran-Sandoval D. Mautino G. Martin G. Percevault F. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The complete table of primers can be found in the supplemental data. Western Blot Analysis—Tissue or cell proteins were extracted in lysis buffer, as described previously (6Duran-Sandoval D. Cariou B. Percevault F. Hennuyer N. Grefhorst A. van Dijk T.H. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29971-29979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies in the presence of protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoreactive bands were revealed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Adipocyte Size Determination—The samples from epididymal adipose tissue were fixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut into 7-μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin. Cell size was determined using the computer-assisted Quips image analysis system (Leica Mikroskopic und System GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells were cultured in growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% calf serum. The cells were differentiated by the method of Bernlohr et al. (14Bernlohr D.A. Angus C.W. Lane M.D. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5468-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The fully differentiated adipocytes were cultured in postdifferentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μm insulin) with or without GW4064 (5 μm) before experiments. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from 13.5-day wild-type and FXR-/- embryos. Adipocyte differentiation was initiated after 2 days at confluence. MEFs were differentiated with AmnioMAX-C100 medium (Invitrogen), 7.5% AmnioMAX-C100 supplement, 7.5% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 5 μm insulin. From day 3 to 8, cells were incubated with the same AmnioMAX-C100 medium with 5 μm insulin. At days 0, 4, and 8, cells were lysed and homogenized for RNA isolation or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Oil Red O. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Glucose Uptake—Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved overnight and thereafter incubated in PBS with or without human recombinant insulin for 30 min. During the last 6 min, 0.5 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[2,6-3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose were added. The reaction was ended by adding ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg/ml cytochalasin B. Cells were lysed with ice-cold 1 m NaOH, the radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter, and the data were expressed in dpm/min/mg of protein. Results were corrected for the GLUT-nonspecific uptake by removing uptake values obtained in the presence of 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was analyzed using the unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance for clamp experiments. All values are reported as means ± S.E. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. FXR-deficient Mice Exhibit Reduced Adipose Tissue Mass, Hypoleptinemia, and Increased Circulating FFA Levels—Body and organ weights as well as several plasma parameters were determined in chow-fed male wild-type (FXR+/+) and FXR-deficient (FXR-/-) mice under basal conditions (Table 1). Whereas total body weights were similar, organ weights varied between the two genotypes. FXR-/- mice showed a significant decrease in both epididymal (65%) and inguinal (35%) fat pads, whereas liver weight was increased (45%). The weight variations appeared to be restricted to these organs, since heart and kidney weights did not differ between the two genotypes. The reduction in adipose tissue mass was associated with a 35% reduction in adipocyte volume in FXR-/- compared with FXR+/+ mice (Fig. 1). Total weight and fat content of feces, as well as food intake, were similar in FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice (Table 1). Thus, FXR deficiency is not associated with impaired fat absorption under chow-fed conditions.TABLE 1Morphometric and metabolic parameters in FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice 18-20-week-old male FXR+/+ (n = 22) and FXR-/- (n = 21) mice were sacrificed after 6 h of fasting, body and organs were weighed, and plasma samples were collected to measure metabolite parameters.

Duran-Sandoval D. van Dijk T. Grefhorst A. Bouchaert E. Fruchart J.C. Gonzalez F.J. Kuipers F. Staels B. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Plasma insulin levels were decreased in FXR-/- mice, probably reflecting an adaptive response to the relative hypoglycemia. Whereas adiponectin concentrations did not differ between both genotypes, plasma leptin concentrations were drastically decreased in FXR-/- mice, presumably reflecting the decrease in adipose tissue mass. As expected (2Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), cholesterol and triglyceride levels were increased in FXR-/- mice. Moreover, FFA plasma levels were also increased in FXR-/- mice. A similar phenotype was observed in female mice as well as in another FXR-deficient mouse model on a different genetic background (12Kok T. Hulzebos C.V. Wolters H. Havinga R. Agellon L.B. Stellaard F. Shan B. Schwarz M. Kuipers F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41930-41937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (data not shown). FXR Deficiency Leads to Peripheral Insulin Resistance—The ability of FXR-/- mice to respond to a glucose challenge was investigated. After a single intraperitoneal bolus injection of glucose, FXR-/- mice displayed a more pronounced plasma glucose excursion than the FXR+/+ mice, with a significantly larger area under the curve (+263%, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). The decreased clearance of plasma glucose could result from either an impaired insulin secretion, a peripheral insulin resistance or an increased hepatic glucose production. In view of our earlier studies (6Duran-Sandoval D. Cariou B. Percevault F. Hennuyer N. Grefhorst A. van Dijk T.H. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29971-29979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Cariou B. van Harmelen K. Duran-Sandoval D. van Dijk T. Grefhorst A. Bouchaert E. Fruchart J.C. Gonzalez F.J. Kuipers F. Staels B. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the latter possibility can be excluded. To address the remaining options, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) were performed. The insulin-mediated decrease of plasma glucose was less pronounced in FXR-/- than in FXR+/+ mice, as indicated by the lower integrated area under the curve (-65%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that FXR deficiency alters insulin sensitivity. To directly evaluate the effect of FXR deficiency on whole-body insulin sensitivity, a 6-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed in awake, 9-h-fasted, male FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice. The glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia was ∼22% lower in FXR-/- than in wild-type mice, indicative of the existence of whole-body insulin resistance. Endogenous blood glucose production rate, which mainly reflects hepatic glucose production, was suppressed to similar values by insulin infusion in both genotypes, indicating the absence of hepatic insulin resistance in FXR-/- mice. In contrast, the insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate and metabolic clearance rate of glucose were reduced by ∼20% in FXR-/- mice (Fig. 2C). These results show that FXR deficiency results in peripheral insulin resistance. FXR Modulates Insulin Signaling at the Level of Akt in Peripheral Insulin-sensitive Tissues—To investigate whether alteration in insulin receptor (IR)-mediated signaling occurs in peripheral insulin-sensitive tissues, in vivo insulin stimulation was performed in FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice. Both insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and insulin substrate receptor 1 (IRS-1), as well as the recruitment of the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase to IRS-1 were similar between both genotypes in skeletal muscle and WAT (Fig. 3A). However, FXR deficiency altered the level of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B on serine 473 in WAT and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3B). The protein expression level of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which plays a central role in activating Akt (15Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not altered by FXR deficiency. Furthermore, the level of serine 241 phosphorylation of PDK1 that is esssential for its catalytic activity did not differ between the two genotypes (16Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). As previously described (16Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

FXR deficiency did not alter the expression of several upstream negative regulators of insulin signaling, such as PTEN (18Tang X. Powelka A.M. Soriano N.A. Czech M.P. Guilherme A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (19Gum R.J. Gaede L.L. Koterski S.L. Heindel M. Clampit J.E.

Taken together, these results suggest that FXR may act directly at the level of Akt. Since Akt plays a key role in the regulation of the metabolic effects of insulin (21Whiteman E.L. Cho H.

Metab. 2002; 13: 444-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), defective Akt activation may contribute to the whole-body insulin resistance observed in FXR-/- mice.TABLE 2Expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue of FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice The indicated mRNA levels were measured in muscle (top) and WAT (bottom) of FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice after 6 h of fasting. Values are normalized relative to 28 S RNA (for skeletal muscle) and cyclophilin mRNA levels (for WAT) and are expressed (means ± S.E.) relative to those of FXR+/+ mice, which are arbitrarily set at 1 (n = 7 mice/group).

Pircher P.C. Schulman I.G. Westin S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7427-7434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Y. Kast-Woelbern H.R. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In accordance with this hypothesis, both FXR mRNA and protein levels increased during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, FXR mRNA levels were also induced during adipogenesis of MEFs, with a peak 4 days after the induction of differentiation (Fig. 4B). FXR is expressed at low levels in WAT (∼50-fold lower than in liver), whereas FXR mRNA levels were undetectable in skeletal muscle in mice (Fig. 4C). Nevertheless, FXR gene expression was reduced in WAT of C57Bl/6J mice upon high fat feeding (Fig. 4D) as well as in WAT of ob/ob mice (Fig. 4E), strengthening the hypothesis of a functional role of FXR in this insulin-sensitive tissue. FXR Activation Improves Insulin Signaling in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—The effect of FXR activation with the synthetic agonist GW4064 on insulin signaling was then measured in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As observed in WAT of FXR-/- mice, alteration of FXR activity did not alter proximal insulin signaling (Fig. 5A). However, GW4064 treatment increased the level of serine 473 Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation and enhanced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes upon insulin stimulation (Fig. 5, B and C). Taken together, these results suggest that FXR directly modulates insulin signaling in the adipocyte. FXR Deficiency Directly Alters Adipocyte Differentiation in Vitro—To further assess a direct role for FXR in the adipocyte, the adipogenic process in MEFs derived from FXR-/- mice was investigated in vitro. Interestingly, FXR deficiency altered the kinetics of the adipogenic program in MEFs. Indeed, the induction of several transcription factors acting as critical adipogenic regulators was delayed in FXR-/- mice (Fig. 6A). Notably, mRNA levels of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (c-EBPα) were significantly lower 4 days after the initiation of the differentiation in MEFs derived from FXR-/- compared with FXR+/+ mice. In addition, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (c-EBPβ), a marker of early adipocyte differentiation, was less induced at day 2 in FXR-/- MEFs. The expression of the adipocyte-specific marker aP2 was also lower in MEFs from FXR-/- mice. Moreover, the expression of both leptin and the glucose transporter GLUT4 was significantly decreased at day 8 in MEFs from FXR-/- mice, reflecting an impaired adipogenic process. The effect of FXR deficiency on adipocyte differentiation was further investigated using Oil Red O staining to assess triglyceride accumulation in MEFs induced to differentiate (Fig. 6, B and C). In accordance with the gene expression results, there was a decrease in triglyceride accumulation in MEFs derived from FXR-/- mice, with a reduced number of lipid droplets at day 4. In addition, there was a striking difference in the morphology of the lipid droplets between both genotypes (see magnification × 40; Fig. 6C). Indeed, the size of lipid droplets was drastically reduced in MEFs from FXR-/- mice, indicating that FXR directly interferes with the lipid storage process. Altogether, these results suggest that FXR plays a role in adipocyte differentiation and function. The PPARα-β/δ Gene Regulatory Pathways Are Activated in Skeletal Muscle of FXR-deficient Mi"

The SWNT band-gap fluorescence undergoes a red shift when an encapsulating 30-nucleotide oligomer is exposed to counter ions that screen the charged backbone. The transition is thermodynamically identical for DNA on and off the nanotube, except that the propagation length of the former is shorter by five-sixths. The magnitude of the energy shift is described by using an effective medium model and the DNA geometry on the nanotube sidewall. We demonstrate the detection of the B-Z change in whole blood, tissue, and from within living mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2144856878,"Recently, the field of tissue engineering has progressed rapidly, but poor vascularization remains a major obstacle in bioengineering cell-dense tissues, limiting the viable size of constructs due to hypoxia, nutrient insufficiency, and waste accumulation. Therefore, new technologies for fabricating functional tissues with a well-organized vasculature are required. In the present study, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were harvested as intact sheets from temperature-responsive culture dishes and stacked into cell-dense myocardial tissues. However, the thickness limit for layered cell sheets in subcutaneous tissue was approximately 80 microm (3 layers). To overcome this limitation, repeated transplantation of triple-layer grafts was performed at 1, 2, or 3 day intervals. The two overlaid grafts completely synchronized and the whole tissues survived without necrosis in the 1 or 2 day interval cases. Multistep transplantation also created approximately 1 mm thick myocardium with a well-organized microvascular network. Furthermore, functional multilayer grafts fabricated over a surgically connectable artery and vein revealed complete graft perfusion via the vessels and ectopic transplantation of the grafts was successfully performed using direct vessel anastomoses. These cultured cell sheet integration methods overcome long-standing barriers to producing thick, vascularized tissues, revealing a possible solution for the clinical repair of various damaged organs, including the impaired myocardium."

We use this approach to show that the Altiplano plateau in the Bolivian Andes rose at an average rate of 1.03 +/- 0.12 millimeters per year between approximately 10.3 and approximately 6.7 million years ago. This rate is consistent with the removal of dense lower crust and/or lithospheric mantle as the cause of elevation gain."

https://openalex.org/W2005759199,"One of the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the accumulation of paired helical filaments (PHFs) of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein Tau. Tandem mass spectrometry was employed to examine PHF-Tau post-translational modifications, in particular protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination, to shed light on their role in the early stages of Alzheimer disease. PHF-Tau from Alzheimer disease brain was affinity-purified by MC1 monoclonal antibody to isolate a soluble fraction of PHF-Tau in a conformation unique to human AD brain. A large number of phosphorylation sites were identified by employing a data-dependent neutral loss algorithm to trigger MS3 scans of phosphopeptides. It was found that soluble PHF-Tau is ubiquitinated at its microtubule-binding domain at residues Lys-254, Lys-311, and Lys-353, suggesting that ubiquitination of PHF-Tau may be an earlier pathological event than previously thought and that ubiquitination could play a regulatory role in modulating the integrity of microtubules during the course of AD. Tandem mass spectrometry data for ubiquitin itself indicate that PHF-Tau is modified by three polyubiquitin linkages, at Lys-6, Lys-11, and Lys-48. Relative quantitative analysis indicates that Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination is the primary form of polyubiquitination with a minor portion of ubiquitin linked at Lys-6 and Lys-11. Because modification by Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains is known to serve as the essential means of targeting proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and it has been reported that modification at Lys-6 inhibits ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, a failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system could play a role in initiating the formation of degradation-resistant PHF tangles."

Here, we report a strategy to change the catalytic activity of an existing protein scaffold. This was achieved by simultaneous incorporation and adjustment of functional elements through insertion, deletion, and substitution of several active site loops, followed by point mutations to fine-tune the activity. Using this approach, we were able to introduce beta-lactamase activity into the alphabeta/betaalpha metallohydrolase scaffold of glyoxalase II. The resulting enzyme, evMBL8 (evolved metallo beta-lactamase 8), completely lost its original activity and, instead, catalyzed the hydrolysis of cefotaxime with a (kcat/Km)app of 1.8 x 10(2) (mole/liter)(-1) second(-1), thus increasing resistance to Escherichia coli growth on cefotaxime by a factor of about 100."

Although mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis-inducing factor translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus have been suggested to play very important roles in PARP-1-mediated cell death, the signaling events downstream of PARP-1 activation in initiating mitochondria dysfunction are not clear. Here we used the DNA alkylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, a potent PARP-1 activator, to study PARP-1 activation-mediated cell death.

We reveal that receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), are upstream of JNK in PARP-1 hyperactivated cells, because PARP-1-induced JNK activation was attenuated in RIP1-/- and TRAF2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.

Biochem. 1994; 138: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); however, in several pathological situations that involve massive DNA damage, extensive activation of PARP-1 depletes cellular NAD+ and its precursor ATP, leading to irreversible cellular energy failure and necrotic cell death (3Berger N.A.

Apoptosis and necrosis are two major forms of cell death with distinct morphological features. Apoptosis is an ordered and regulated process in which the cell actively destroys itself while maintaining plasma membrane integrity, thus permitting non-inflammatory phagocytosis of the dying cell. Necrosis, on the other hand, has traditionally been regarded as a passive and unregulated form of cell death with morphology of cell swelling, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and the release of cellular contents into the extracellular environment, thus triggering an inflammatory response (11Kanduc D. Mittelman A. Serpico R. Sinigaglia E. Sinha A.A. Natale C. Santacroce R. Di Corcia M.G. Lucchese A. Dini L. Pani P. Santacroce S. Simone S. Bucci R. Farber E. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 21: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). PARP-1-mediated cell death is caspase-independent and lacks many morphological features of classic apoptosis considered as necrosis (4Ha H.C.

Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). However, unlike “accidental” necrosis, it has recently been reported to be a regulated necrosis, in which the cell actively initiates its death program after PARP-1 hyperactivation (13Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Despite its pathophysiological importance, the cell death signaling pathway induced by PARP-1 activation is still not clear. It has been reported that PARP-1 hyperactivation prompts mitochondria dysfunction, which in turn releases apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nucleus (14Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, 15Alano C.C. Ying W. Swanson R.A. J.

Blockage of these events dramatically prevents cell death induced by PARP-1 activation, suggesting that mitochondria change is a key event of cell death downstream of PARP-1 hyperactivation. However, the mechanism by which PARP-1 activation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and release of AIF is largely unknown. c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) are a group of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that have recently been demonstrated to be involved in necrosis by several groups of investigators (16Ventura J.J.

However, whether JNK, RIP1, and TRAF2 are involved in PARP-1-mediated necrotic cell death has not been studied. N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) is known to activate PARP-1, and the activated PARP-1 causes cell death in a variety of different cell types. To investigate the signaling pathway downstream of PARP-1 in mediating mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined the involvement of different MAPKs, as well as RIP1 and TRAF2, in MNNG-treated MEF cells. We found that JNK, RIP1, and TRAF2 all participated in PARP-1-mediated mitochondria dysfunction and subsequent cell death. Our data showed that MNNG-induced cell death requires the following signal pathway: PARP-1 > RIP1/TRAF2 > JNK1 > mitochondrial dysfunction. Reagents and Plasmids—Anti-phospho-JNK1/2, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and phospho-p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling. Anti-FLAG (M2) and actin antibodies were bought from Sigma. Anti-PAR, RIP1, and TRAF2 were purchased from Pharmingen. AIF antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The mammalian expression plasmids for TRAF2 and RIP were gifts from Dr. Zheng-gang Liu. P38 inhibitor SB203580, JNK inhibitor SP600125, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem.

JNK1-/-, JNK2-/-, and WT cells from the same background (C57BL/6J) as the knockouts were obtained from Dr. M. Karin. These cells had been immortalized when we received them and passed for 3-4 generations in our laboratory. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells with the same passage number were used for each experiment. For MNNG treatment, cells were treated with MNNG for 10 min. Cells were washed and fed with fresh medium with no MNNG and cultured for the indicated periods of time. For transfection, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reconstituted cell lines were selected with hygromycin. Cell Viability Assay—Plasma membrane integrity was assessed by determining the ability of the cells to exclude propidium iodide (PI; Sigma). Cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 1 μg of PI/ml. The level of PI incorporation was quantified by flow cytometry on a FACScan flow cytometer. Cell size was evaluated by forward-angle light scattering. PI-negative cells with normal size were considered to be live cells. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Cells were treated with different combinations of chemicals and 5 μm 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl carbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes) were added 30 min before collecting cells. The stained cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences), and the data were processed with the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). For morphological analysis, cells were cultured on cover slides; after treatment, they were viewed under a fluorescence microscope. For analysis with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Molecular Probes), after treatment the cells were resuspended in growth medium and stained with 100 nm TMRM for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, the fluorescence was measured with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur), and the data were processed with the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—Cells after treatment were washed twice with ice-cold PBS before fixation with ice-cold methanol. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were incubated with the primary antibody against AIF for 1 h. Cells were washed with blocking solution three times and incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with PI (Sigma) for 2 min after secondary antibody incubation and two rinses with PBS. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides and the slides were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. Nuclear and Mitochondrial Fractionations—The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in an isotonic homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 60 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, the unbroken cells were removed by centrifuging at 30 × g for 10 min. The nuclei and mitochondria fractions were fractionated at 1,000 × g for 10 min and 14,000 × g for 20 min, respectively. The nuclear fractions were washed and suspended in PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Western Blot Analysis—After treatment with different reagents as described in the figure legends, cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate.). 50 μg of the cell lysate from each sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), according to the manufacturer's (Amersham Biosciences) instruction. JNK Is Required for PARP-1-mediated Cell Death—We treated MEF cells with MNNG, a DNA alkylating agent widely used to activate PARP-1 in studying PARP-1-mediated cell death (4Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 14Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1a, MNNG treatment induces massive cell death within 24 h and pretreatment of cells with the PARP-1 inhibitors DPQ and 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (DHIQ) significantly blocks MNNG-induced cell death, thus confirming that PARP-1 activation is mainly responsible for the cytotoxicity of MNNG. We chose MEF cells to study PARP-1-mediated cell death because this enabled us to utilize gene knock-out cells. First, we tested whether PARP-1 hyperactivation led to non-apoptotic cell death in MEF cells as in other cells (3Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 4Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 12Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). We treated MEF cells with MNNG and found that no caspase 3 or caspase 8 activation was detected following MNNG treatment (data not shown). Caspase inhibitors (benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD and benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD) were also unable to block PARP-1-mediated cell death (Fig. 1b). We also did not observe classical apoptosis features such as membrane blebbing and chromatin condensation after MNNG treatment (data not shown). Collectively, our data confirm that PARP-1-induced cell death in MEF cell is non-apoptotic. MAPKs play a very important role in the stress response (23Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1c, stimulation of cells with MNNG resulted in a very rapid and persistent activation of the p38 and JNK pathways as determined by the detection of activating phosphorylation of these kinases. To test whether MAPKs play any role in PARP-1-mediated caspase-independent cell death, we pretreated wild type mouse fibroblast cells with a specific set of MAPK inhibitors and followed with MNNG treatment. As shown in Fig. 1d, the pretreatment of cells with compounds SB203580 and U0126, inhibitors of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, respectively, did not alter the sensitivity of cells to MNNG-induced cell death when compared with control Me2SO pretreatment. By contrast, pretreatment with SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, caused significant resistance to MNNG-induced cell death. To confirm the requirement of JNK in MNNG-induced cell death, we compared MNNG-induced cell death in WT and either p38-/-, JNK1-/-, or JNK2-/- MEF cells. JNK1-/- cells were found to be resistant to MNNG killing when compared with WT MEF cells. JNK2-/- cells were also resistant to MNNG cytotoxicity but to a lesser extent. (Fig. 1e). By contrast, p38-/-cells were even a little more sensitive to MNNG-induced cell death than WT cells. Therefore, JNK activation plays an important role in MNNG-induced caspase-independent cell death. JNK Is Downstream of PARP-1 Activation—The requirement of JNK for MNNG-induced cell death indicates that JNK may either be involved in PARP-1 activation upon MNNG stimulation or it may function downstream of PARP-1 activation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we first compared PARP-1 activation by detecting poly(ADP-ribose) formation in WT MEF and JNK1-/- MEF cells. We found that there was no difference between these two cell lines (Fig. 2a), excluding the possibility that JNK1 is required for PARP-1 activation. Moreover, JNK activation by MNNG treatment was impaired when specific PARP-1 inhibitors were applied, suggesting that JNK activation is downstream of PARP-1 activation (Fig. 2b). Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization Is Required for PARP-1-mediated MEF Cell Death—It has been reported previously that PARP-1 hyperactivation leads to mitochondrial membrane depolarization and that this depolarization is required for PARP-1-mediated cell death (15Alano C.C. Ying W. Swanson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18895-18902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To determine whether PARP-1 activation induces Δψm depolarization in MEF cells, we stained cells with TMRM, a cell-permeable fluorescent dye that accumulates in mitochondria proportionally with Δψm (24Lee Y.I. Hwang J.M. Im J.H. Lee Y.I. Kim N.S. Kim D.G. Yu D.Y. Moon H.B. Park S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15460-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Scaduto Jr., R.C. Grotyohann L.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3a, MNNG treatment led to a decrease in TMRM fluorescence indicative of Δψm depolarization and this Δψm depolarization was PARP-1-mediated, because pretreatment of cells with the PARP-1 inhibitor DPQ significantly attenuated depolarization. Next, we tested whether Δψm depolarization is required for PARP-1-induced cell death. We first treated cells with the potent mitochondria permeability transition inhibitor CsA (26Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), followed by treatment with MNNG. CsA dramatically inhibited the mitochondrial membrane depolarization induced by MNNG, and it also efficiently suppressed MNNG-induced cell death (Fig. 3, a and b). CsA did not inhibit PAR formation (Fig. 3c), thereby excluding the possibility that CsA blocks PARP-1-mediated death by inhibiting PARP-1 activity. Together, these results indicate that mitochondrial membrane depolarization is an essential step in PARP-1-mediated cell death in MEF cells. Because our experiments involved long incubation times, we could not include TMRM during the entire duration of our experiments. As a result, the mitochondrial membrane potential measured may not be absolutely accurate. Δψm Depolarization by PARP-1 Activation Requires JNK Activity—We then examined whether MNNG-induced Δψm depolarization requires the presence of JNK by using the JNK inhibitor, SP600125. Δψm was monitored using the fluorescent dye JC-1 (27Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). JC-1 stains mitochondria differentially in accordance with their Δψm. Active mitochondria with high Δψm accumulate red JC-1 aggregates, whereas mitochondria with low Δψm (inactive) display the green monomeric form of JC-1. As shown in Fig. 4a, MNNG treatment induced a marked reduction in the ratio of red to green fluorescence, indicating a fall in Δψm. Interestingly, this mitochondrial membrane depolarization was efficiently blocked by SP600125. To further confirm the important role of JNK in MNNG-induced Δψm depolarization, we compared MNNG-induced Δψm changes in WT and JNK1-/- MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 4b, MNNG treatment led to a significant decrease in the ratio of red to green fluorescence in WT MEF cells, whereas this decrease was reduced in JNK1-/- MEF cells. As a control, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, was applied to MEF cells. Both JNK1-/- and WT MEF cells showed comparable mitochondrial depolarization, suggesting that JNK1-/- cells are not inherently resistant to Δψm depolarization. Fig. 4c shows representative images captured 12 h after MNNG treatment. After MNNG treatment, mitochondria showed an increase in monomer green fluorescence and a decrease in JC-1 aggregated red fluorescence, indicating Δψm depolarization. This change was not observed in JNK1-/- MEF cells or the WT cells treated with the PARP-1 inhibitor DPQ. Together, these results demonstrate that JNK is crucial to PARP-1-induced mitochondria membrane depolarization. JNK Is Required for AIF Translocation—The mitochondria-localized flavoprotein AIF is known as a mediator for PARP-1-induced cell death (14Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, 28Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). In response to PARP-1 hyperactivation, AIF is released from the mitochondria and subsequently translocates into the nucleus. Blockage of AIF translocation has been shown to inhibit PARP-1-mediated cell death, suggesting that AIF translocation is an essential step in the cell death process (14Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether JNK was also required for AIF translocation. Co-labeling of AIF with PI, which stains the nucleus, after 12 h of MNNG treatment showed that AIF translocated to the nucleus after PARP-1 activation and this translocation was blocked by the PARP-1 inhibitor (Fig. 5a). AIF translocation was also prevented in cells treated with CsA, indicating that AIF translocation requires Δψm depolarization. More importantly, AIF translocation was not observed in JNK1-/- MEF cells, suggesting that JNK activation is required for AIF translocation after MNNG exposure. This view was further confirmed by subcellular fractionation studies. As shown in Fig. 5b, AIF was redistributed from the mitochondria to the nucleus after MNNG treatment of MEF cells but not in cells pretreated with the JNK inhibitor. MNNG-induced Cell Death Requires RIP1 and TRAF2—To better understand how PARP-1 activation induces cell death, we thought that it necessary to know what other signaling regulators are involved in PARP-1-mediated JNK activation. RIP1 and TRAF2 are known downstream effectors of the TNF receptor and are required for TNF-induced JNK activation (19Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 20Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). RIP1 and TRAF2 are also known to play an essential role in some cases of necrotic cell death (21Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 22Lin Y. Choksi S. Shen H.M. Yang Q.F. Hur G.M. Kim Y.S. Tran J.H. Nedospasov S.A. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10822-10828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 29Bajenova O. Tang B.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5914-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We felt that RIP1 and TRAF2 may be associated with PARP-1-induced JNK activation and/or cell death. To examine whether RIP1 and TRAF2 participate in PARP-1-mediated cell death, we compared MNNG-induced cell death in WT and RIP1-/- or TRAF2-/- cells. RIP1-/- and TRAF2-/- cells are resistant to MNNG-induced cell death in comparison with WT MEF cells, suggesting that RIP1 and TRAF2 are required for MNNG-induced cell death (Fig. 6a). Because PARP-1 activation by MNNG is equal in knock-out and WT cells, the resistance of RIP1-/- and TRAF2-/- cells to MNNG killing cannot be because of impaired PARP-1 activation (Fig. 6b). Because RIP1 and TRAF2 are downstream effectors of the TNF receptor, it is possible that MNNG induces TNF through RIP1 and TRAF2 to trigger cell death. To investigate this possibility, we examined the sensitivity of TNFR1-/- MEF cells to MNNG treatment and found that it is comparable with that of WT MEF cells (Fig. 6c). As expected, TNFR1-/- MEF cells are resistant to TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 6c). These results exclude the possibility that RIP1 and TRAF2 function in the TNF signaling pathway in MNNG-treated cells. To unambiguously determine that RIP1 and TRAF2 are required for MNNG-induced cell death, we generated stable cell lines from RIP1-/- and TRAF2-/-cells by ectopically expressing RIP1 and TRAF2 in their corresponding knock-out cells (Fig. 6d) and examined the susceptibility of each reconstituted cell line to MNNG-induced cell death (Fig. 6e). The reconstituted RIP1-/- and TRAF2-/- cells showed restored sensitivity to MNNG-induced cell death (Fig. 6e), confirming that RIP1 and TRAF2 are indeed required for MNNG-induced cell death. Because RIP1 and TRAF2 have no effect on PARP-1 activation and they are required for MNNG-induced cell death, we concluded that RIP1 and TRAF2 are either downstream of, or parallel with, PARP-1 activation in MNNG-treated MEF cells. Δψm Depolarization and AIF Translocation by PARP-1 Activation Require RIP1 and TRAF2—As shown above, Δψm depolarization is a key event leading to cell death induced by PARP-1 activation. Next, we sought to examine whether RIP1 and TRAF2 participate in Δψm changes. As expected, activation of PARP-1 led to a decrease in the ratio of JC-1 590/535 in WT cells, indicating depolarization. By contrast, this Δψm depolarization was inhibited in RIP1-/- and TRAF2-/- cells (Fig. 7a). Fig. 7b shows representative JC-1 images captured after MNNG treatment. In WT cells, a dramatic decrease of J-aggregate fluorescence was observed after MNNG induction. However, J-aggregate fluorescence was not affected by MNNG stimulation in RIP1-/- and TRAF2-/- cells, suggesting that mitochondria remained intact in these two knock-out cells. AIF translocation following PARP-1 activation was also investigated using a fluorescence microscope. As shown in Fig. 7c, after MNNG treatment AIF was translocated from the mitochondria to the nucleus in WT cells,"
https://openalex.org/W2063694826,"The induction of apoptosis by p53 in response to cellular stress is its most conserved function and crucial for p53 tumor suppression. We recently reported that p53 directly induces oligomerization of the BH1,2,3 effector protein Bak, leading to outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (OMMP) with release of apoptotic activator proteins. One important mechanism by which p53 achieves OMMP is by forming an inhibitory complex with the anti-apoptotic BclXL protein. In contrast, the p53 complex with the Bcl2 homolog has not been interrogated. Here we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the p53-Bcl2 interaction using structural, biophysical, and mutational analyses. We have identified the p53 DNA binding domain as the binding interface for Bcl2 using solution NMR. The affinity of the p53-Bcl2 complex was determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore) to have a dominant component KD 535 ± 24 nm. Moreover, in contrast to wild type p53, endogenous missense mutants of p53 are unable to form complexes with endogenous Bcl2 in human cancer cells. Functionally, these mutants are all completely or strongly compromised in mediating OMMP, as measured by cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. These data implicate p53-Bcl2 complexes in contributing to the direct mitochondrial p53 pathway of apoptosis and further support the notion that the DNA binding domain of p53 is a dual function domain, mediating both its transactivation function and its direct mitochondrial apoptotic function. The induction of apoptosis by p53 in response to cellular stress is its most conserved function and crucial for p53 tumor suppression.

A major function of the p53 tumor suppressor is the induction of an apoptotic program in response to a broad variety of cell stresses. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which p53 executes cell death pathways is of considerable importance in cancer biology. The basis for the powerful apoptotic and tumor suppressor activity of p53 lies in its pleiotropism, which includes transcription-dependent and transcription-independent functions (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar, 2Schuler M. Green D.R. Biochem. Soc.

Some notable p53 target genes such as the BH3-only proteins PUMA, Noxa, Bax, and p53AIP1 reside and/or act at the mitochondria (3Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol.

We previously showed that in response to a death stimulus such as DNA damage or hypoxia, a fraction of stabilized p53 rapidly translocates to mitochondria in primary, immortal, and transformed cells (8Erster S. Mihara M. Kim R.H. Petrenko O. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6728-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of this phenomenon were revealed by targeting exogenous p53 to mitochondria in p53 null cells. Mitochondrially targeted p53 was sufficient to launch apoptosis and suppress colony formation directly from the mitochondrial platform in a transcription-independent fashion (9Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol.

Translocated endogenous mitochondrial p53 interacts with anti-apoptotic BclXL and Bcl2 proteins and blocks their functions. Purified p53 protein induces oligomerization of Bak and permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and strongly promotes cytochrome c release from healthy unstressed mitochondria (10Mihara M.

Using computational and mutational analyses, we previously reported that the p53 DNA binding domain (p53 DBD) 2The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA binding domain; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA binding domain; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid; WT, wild type. mediates the p53-BclXL interaction. Conversely, all tested tumor-derived and transactivation-deficient missense mutants of p53 concomitantly lose or severely compromise their ability to interact with BclXL and to promote outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Thus, tumor-derived p53 mutations may represent “double hits,” eliminating the transcriptional as well as the direct mitochondrial functions of p53 (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). In vivo, mice treated with 5 grays of γ-irradiation or a single clinical dose of etoposide showed a rapid first wave of mitochondrial translocation of p53 in radiosensitive, but not in radioresistant, organs that correlated with early effector caspase activation and apoptosis of a subpopulation of cells. This first wave preceded the earliest detectable transcriptional response, e.g. PUMA in thymus, which then led to further caspase activation and cell death. Thus, mitochondrial p53 triggers a rapid apoptotic response that “jump-starts” and amplifies the slower transcription-based response (8Erster S. Mihara M. Kim R.H. Petrenko O. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6728-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Erster S. Moll U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Bcl2 and BclXL are the closest homologues in the Bcl2 family with 45% sequence identity and 56% sequence similarity. The two proteins have similar anti-apoptotic functions at mitochondria, and their expression levels are interrelated, i.e. the overexpression of one represses the other (13Arriola E.L. Rodriguez-Lopez A.M. Hickman J.A. Chresta C.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1457-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, biological differences between the two exist. Overexpression of Bcl2 is associated with cell cycle arrest in G1 and cellular senescence (14Chen Q.M. Liu J. Merrett J.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 347 (Pt. 2): 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 15Schmitt C.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), whereas BclXL overexpression suppresses tumor necrosis-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis (16Keogh S.A. Walczak H. Bouchier-Hayes L. Martin S.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Bcl2-associated cycle arrest is mediated by the inhibition of Cdk2 and p27Kip1 (17Sasaki M. Kumazaki T. Takano H. Nishiyama M. Mitsui Y. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, a prognostic difference exists in certain cancers. In breast and small cell lung cancer patients, higher Bcl2 expression is paradoxically associated with better prognosis and, accordingly, tumor grade is inversely correlated with Bcl2 levels (18Berardo M.D. Elledge R.M. de Moor C. Clark G.M. Osborne C.K. Allred D.C. Cancer. 1998; 82: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Athanassiadou P. Dosios T. Petrakakou E. Liossi A. Zerva C. Athanassiades P. Diagn. Cytopathol. 1998; 19: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, BclXL expression correlates with higher tumor grade and increased number of nodal metastases in breast cancer (20Olopade O.I. Adeyanju M.O. Safa A.R. Hagos F. Mick R. Thompson C.B. Recant W.M. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 1997; 3: 230-237PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, gene targeting studies in mice also reveal significant functional differences between BclXL and Bcl2, emphasizing the notion that interaction results of BclXL cannot be blindly extrapolated to Bcl2 but need independent study. First, in myeloid progenitors cytokines selectively regulate BclXL, but not Bcl2, and apoptosis by a Jak2 kinase-dependent pathway (21Packham G. White E.L. Eischen C.M. Yang H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Grillot D.A. Zambetti G.P. Nunez G. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Second, loss of BclXL in mice results in high levels of apoptosis in embryonic hematopoietic cells (22Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), whereas Bcl2-deficient mice display profound apoptosis of mature lymphocytes, which disappear by 4–6 weeks of age (23Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Kuida K. Sawa H. Loh D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3700-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 24Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of great interest to understand to what extent Bcl2 and BclXL share overlapping functions and interact with the same set of protein partners. Mutational, structural, and biophysical investigations of the p53 complex with BclXL and Bcl2 help us understand what drives complex formation and how tumor-derived p53 mutations affect these interactions. Recently, an NMR study confirmed our previous mutational and functional studies and showed that the DNA contact region of p53, where most of the tumor-derived mutations are concentrated, forms the interface with BclXL (10Mihara M.

Here we report that p53 utilizes the same DNA contact region to interact with Bcl2. Complex formation neutralizes the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2 and induces mitochondrial permeabilization with cytochrome c release. Mitochondrial Purification and Protein Complex Characterization— The human tumor cell lines ML-1 (WT p53), MDA 231 (p53 R280K), MDA 468 (p53 R273H), T47D (p53 L194F), and SKBr3 (p53 R175H) were grown in RPMI (ML-1) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Mitochondria were prepared by discontinuous sucrose density gradients (9Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol.

The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation: monoclonal DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or polyclonal CM-1 (Vector) for p53, mt hsp70 (Affinity Bioreagents); PCNA (Santa Cruz), cytochrome c (Pharmingen), and cytochrome Oxidase IV (Molecular Probes); VDAC (Calbiochem); Bcl2 (Transduction Labs, monoclonal clone 7); and Bax (Neomarker). For endogenous complexes, mitochondria were solubilized in CHAPS buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates (1 mg) from camptothecin-treated cells were diluted to 0.5% CHAPS buffer and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of antibody. Beads were washed three times with SNNTE (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 5% sucrose, 1% Nonidet P-40) and then twice with radioimmune precipitation assay (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) and subjected to an initial Western blot for quantitation. Loading of the definitive blot was normalized for equal amounts of immunoprecipitated p53 and then blotted for Bcl2. For co-purification using glycerol gradients, purified mitochondria from ML-1 cells stressed with 5 μm camptothecin for 3.5 h were lysed in CHAPS buffer B (6 mm CHAPS (a non-denaturing concentration that preserves complexes), 150 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol), loaded onto a 40–15% glycerol gradient diluted in lysis buffer, and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 14 h. Equal volume fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and immunoblotted as indicated. For immunoaffinity columns, 200 μg of mitochondrial lysates made with CHAPS buffer A were incubated with 20 μl of a 1:1 mixture of agarose beads covalently coupled to monoclonal p53 antibodies DO-1 and PAb1801 for 2 h, followed by extensive washing and elution with a 100-mm glycine buffer, pH 3.6. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—Residues 94–312 of the human p53DBD were subcloned into a modified pQE40 vector under the control of a T5 promoter (Qiagen) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) co-transfected with the repressor plasmid pUBS520 (30Klein C.

Schwaiger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49020-49027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unlabeled and uniformly 15N-labeled p53DBD proteins were prepared as previously described (30Klein C. Hesse F. Dehner A. Engh R.A. Schwaiger M. Hansen S. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 32Klein C. Georges G. Kunkele K.P. Huber R. Engh R.A. Hansen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37390-37401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Bcl2ΔTM (residues 1–218, isoform 2 with Thr-96 and Arg-110 and without the transmembrane domain) was subcloned into pET30b (Novagen), and the large flexible loop of Bcl2 was replaced with the shorter loop of BclXL at the equivalent position as previously described (33Petros A. Medek A. Nettesheim D. Kim D. Yoon H. Swift K. Matayoshi E. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3012-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In contrast to native Bcl2ΔTM, which was insoluble, this chimeric construct of Bcl2 was soluble and also retained its native biological functions (33Petros A. Medek A. Nettesheim D. Kim D. Yoon H. Swift K. Matayoshi E. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3012-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was purified via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), the His tag was cleaved off by thrombin digestion, and free Bcl2ΔTM was further purified by ion exchange and size exclusion columns as described (33Petros A. Medek A. Nettesheim D. Kim D. Yoon H. Swift K. Matayoshi E. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3012-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Two recombinant BclXL proteins were overexpressed from pET (Novagen) expression vectors with an N-terminal His tag. In these constructs the putative C-terminal membrane-anchoring region (residues 214–237) was removed (BclXLΔTM). In a second version, the large flexible loop was also shortened by removing residues 49–88 (BclXLΔLPΔTM). This loop was previously shown to be dispensable for the anti-apoptotic activity of the protein (34Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified as for Bcl2. As a measure of quality control, recombinant BclXLΔLPΔTM, BclXLΔTM, and Bcl2ΔTM proteins bound to the 16-mer Bak peptide with similar affinities as the commercial BclXL and Bcl2 proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the fluorescence polarization assay (33Petros A. Medek A. Nettesheim D. Kim D. Yoon H. Swift K. Matayoshi E. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3012-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). For cytochrome c release assays, full-length p53s with missense mutations in the DNA binding domain were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and sequence confirmed. Constructs were cloned into pET15b and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Wild type and mutant proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Protein purity and integrity was assessed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels and DO1 immunoblotting. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra for 15N-labeled p53DBD complexed with unlabeled Bcl2 were acquired at 293 K in sample buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) on Avance Bruker spectrometers (500 and 750 MHz 1H frequency) equipped with a triple-resonance and xyz-gradient probe. All experiments were processed and analyzed by nmrPipe and nmrDraw software (35Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar). ∼200 μm 15N-labeled protein was titrated with 0–200 μm unlabeled protein. The 21-mer fluorescein-tagged Bid peptide (fluorescein-QEDIIRNIARHLAQVGDSMDR) had a KD of 15.7 nm to Bcl2, as determined by fluorescent polarization assay (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.01% bovine γ-globulin at room temperature). For NMR, untagged Bid 21-mer peptide was used, and the final concentration of each component was p53DBD to Bcl2 to Bid, 130 to 70 to 30 μm. Cytochrome c Release Assay—Freshly harvested livers of 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were used to prepare isolated mitochondria by discontinuous sucrose gradient. Cytochrome c release assays with mutant and wild type p53 proteins were performed as described (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Purified p53 proteins were dialyzed against Hepes buffer (15 mm Hepes/NaOH, 125 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 μm rotenon (Sigma), 5 mm succinate, pH 7.4). Mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were incubated with proteins for 30 min at 30 °C in 70 μl of Hepes buffer and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mitochondrial supernatants and corresponding washed pellets (5 μg of total protein) were immunoblotted for released and retained cytochrome c (Pharmingen), respectively. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—Biacore 1000 (Biacore AB) for surface plasmon resonance measurements and Scrubber (v 1.1g; Center for Biomolecular Interaction Analysis, University of Utah) were used for surface plasmon resonance analysis; BIAeval (v 4.1; Biacore AB) software was used for kinetic analysis. The surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed by immobilizing the various Bcl proteins on a CM-5 sensor chip (research grade; Biacore AB). An unrelated protein, recombinant human Fibroblast Growth Factor-2, that does not interact with Bcl proteins (Invitrogen) was used as a base-line control for bulk refractive index correction. Then, in a series of eight dilutions starting from 10 to 0.025 μm in HBS (0.01 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl at 25 °C), we sequentially injected WT p53DBD as an analyte to all flow cells. Dissociation constants (KD1 and KD2) were calculated from the kinetic analysis of the data using a model for two parallel heterogeneous ligand reactions from the BIAeval software. This model gave a significantly better representation of the experimental kinetics and a better fitting (χ2 4.22 for Bcl2) than the simple (Langmuir) model that considers a single p53-Bcl2 binding reaction with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We previously co-immunoprecipitated specific endogenous complexes between WT p53 and Bcl2 from human cells (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). To verify that p53 and Bcl2 interact at mitochondria, we performed glycerol gradient centrifugation on solubilized proteins from purified mitochondria of ML-1 cells that had been briefly subjected to DNA damage (5 μm camptothecin for 3.5 h) and looked for co-migration of endogenous p53 and Bcl2. When proteins were extracted from purified mitochondria by 6 mm CHAPS (a non-denaturing zwitterionic detergent that preserves protein complexes) and resolved on a 40–15% glycerol gradient, p53 and Bcl2 proteins co-migrated in fractions 9 and 10 (Fig. 1A), supporting complex formation. To further confirm complex formation, the proteins extracted from CHAPS-solubilized mitochondria were subjected to p53 immunoaffinity chromatography. A mixture of p53-specific monoclonal antibodies covalently coupled to agarose beads was used to capture endogenous protein complexes. After extensive washing, p53 and Bcl2 co-eluted from the column (Fig. 1B). Together, these data confirmed our previous detection of an endogenous p53-Bcl2 complex, isolated from Nonidet P-40-solubilized purified mitochondria (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). To gain structural insight into the p53-Bcl2 interaction and to localize the protein-protein interface, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (30Klein C. Hesse F. Dehner A. Engh R.A. Schwaiger M. Hansen S. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our NMR data identify the DNA contact surface of the p53DBD as the binding site for Bcl2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Upon titration of unlabeled Bcl2ΔTM to uniformly 15N-labeled p53DBD, Bcl2ΔTM induced chemical shift perturbations in the 15N HSQC spectra of p53DBD. This indicates that Bcl2ΔTM directly binds to p53 and that the interaction is specific. We did not observe large global chemical shift perturbations, suggesting that binding of Bcl2ΔTM does not induce major conformational rearrangements of p53DBD. Some signals corresponding to the interacting p53 residues disappeared instead of shifting. (Fig. 2A), which implies that the p53-Bcl2 complex formation is in the intermediate exchange regime on the NMR chemical shift time scale (in the millisecond range). The affected residues were Gln-136, Ala-138, Ala-161, Tyr-163, Arg-175, Cys-176, Ile-195, Arg-196, Tyr-236, Met-237, Asn-239, Ser-240, Gly-244, and Thr-253. Thus, they localize on the DNA contact interface of the p53DBD (Fig. 2B). These data align with the recent NMR study of the p53-BclXL complex by Petros et al. (25Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Xu N. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 28073: 1-4Google Scholar) that determined chemical shift perturbations in p53DBD upon addition of BclXL. We were able to reproduce their results (data not shown). Neither p53 nor BclXL undergoes a major conformational change upon binding. The chemical shift changes caused by the BclXL interaction were at residues Arg-280, Cys-277, Ser-241, Cys-238, Cys-182 and Val-173. Thus, as had been predicted by mutational and modeling studies (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), residues within the DNA binding interface of p53 form the contact site with the acidic”underside“of BclXL, comprised of the C-terminal end of the BH4 domain and the two loops between the α3 and α4 helix and the α5 and α6 helix (25Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Xu N. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 28073: 1-4Google Scholar). This region is distinct from the hydrophobic binding pocket for BH3 domain-containing proteins. Direct physical interaction between Bcl2 and WT p53 was also verified by surface plasmon resonance. Quantitative analysis of experimental BIAcore data indicated that there were fast and slow components in the sensorgram. We therefore used a model of two parallel heterogeneous ligand reactions in the kinetic analysis to separate the two components in the surface plasmon resonance data. Bcl2ΔTM interacted with WT p53DBD with a KD1 535 ± 24 nm for the dominant fast component and a KD2 16.9 ± 0.40 μm for the minor slow component (Fig. 3). (Because KD2 is ∼30-fold larger than KD1, we can safely neglect this still measurable but small component in the system). This level of affinity between Bcl2ΔTM and p53, i.e. a KD1 in the hundred-nm range, is consistent with an immunoprecipitable endogenous p53-Bcl2 complex and with our NMR result, where the peaks in the p53 spectra affected by Bcl2 underwent exchange broadening and some peak intensities were weakened beyond the limits of detection. We could confirm a slightly stronger affinity between BclXLΔTM and WT p53DBD (data not shown), which was recently reported to have a KD 164 ± 54 nm for full-length WT p53 and His6-BclXLΔTM (28Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Science. 2005; 309: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even though the large flexible loop in BclXL is very close to the p53 binding site, we found that the presence or absence of the loop did not significantly alter the BclXL affinity to p53 (data not shown). We next tested whether a BH3 peptide that binds to Bcl2 with a higher affinity than p53 affects the interaction between p53 and Bcl2. We used the 21-mer BH3 domain peptide of Bid. This peptide bound to Bcl2ΔTM with a KD of 15.7 nm in our fluorescence polarization assay. First, the p53-Bcl2 complex was preformed as above by adding unlabeled Bcl2ΔTM to 15N-labeled p53DBD. After titrating in the Bid peptide to the p53-Bcl2 complex, the missing or shifted peaks of p53 were gradually restored toward their original intensities and positions (e.g. A1a-138 and Tyr-163; Fig. 2C), indicating that the Bid peptide can induce the dissociation of Bcl2 from p53 because of its stronger interaction with Bcl2. We next determined the functional consequences of the p53-Bcl2 interaction at the mitochondria and the impact of cancer-associated p53 mutations. Of note, in contrast to stress-induced WT p53, tumor-derived p53 mutants, despite drastically elevated levels of mutant protein for most mutants, were incapable of undergoing the p53-Bcl2 complex formation irrespective of the absence or presence of DNA damage (Fig. 4, top, and data not shown). To this end, p53-harboring ML-1 cells or mutant p53-harboring breast cancer cells (MDA 231, MDA 468, T47D, and SKBr3), representing various naturally occurring missense mutations including the hot spot structural and contact p53 mutants, were stressed with 5 μm camptothecin for 3.5 h. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated for p53. After normalization, equal amounts of immunoprecipitated p53 from these various sources were blotted for Bcl2. As shown in Fig. 4, top, mutant p53 R280K, R273H, R175H, and L194F were all completely defective in this interaction despite comparable levels of endogenous Bcl2 protein expressed in all cell lines, including ML-1 (Fig. 4, bottom). To gain functional insight into the p53-Bcl2 complex, we undertook permeabilization studies on freshly isolated mouse liver mitochondria using purified recombinant p53 proteins at increasing concentrations. As expected, WT p53 induced a dose-dependent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 5). In sharp contrast, p53 R175H was completely inactive for the cytochrome c release and p53 R273H was severely suppressed in this activity (data not shown). Moreover, p53 L194F and R280K, as well as four additional mutants not previously tested (G245S, R248W, R249S, and R282W), were all completely or strongly compromised in mediating outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. These results confirm and extend our previous observation on p53 R175H and p53 R273H (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Thus, in summary, a complete correlation existed between the inability of mutant p53s to engage in Bcl2 complexes (see Fig. 4) and the concomitant inability to induce outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release, supporting the physiologic importance of p53-Bcl2 complex formation. Concerning the p53 R175H mutant, it is worth noting that in our earliest study we had found that the ectopically expressed L-version of the p53 mutant R175H, consisting of a fusion of p53R175H with the mitochondrial import leader signal sequence from ornithine transcarbamylase, was able to induce apoptosis in SaOs2 p53 null cells (9Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). We since showed that this was an aberrant result due to supra-physiological expression levels. This fusion protein, which was only one of many mutants tested since, expresses at exceedingly high levels in cells, much higher than endogenous mutants do. As a result, L-p53 R175H forms aberrant nonspecific complexes with BclXL, explaining its aberrant apoptosis in SaOs2 cells (9Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, the apoptosis observed with this L-version of the 175 mutant disagreed with all our subsequent results, where the same R175H mutant was tested in a physiological setting in several different assays. In contrast to WT p53, (i) the naturally occurring (non-targeted) Rl75H mutant in the breast cancer cell line SKBr3 lacked apoptotic activity and was unable to form a BclXL (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) and Bcl2 complex (Fig. 4); (ii) the nuclear R175H mutant, transfected into H1299 p53 null cells, also lacked apoptotic activity and was unable to form a BclXL complex (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar); and (iii) purified baculoviral R175H mutant p53 protein failed to release cytochrome c (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Thus, as summarized in Table 1, all eight tumor-derived p53 mutant proteins tested to date have lost the ability to promote cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Four of these mutants were already shown to be doubly defective in BclXL and Bcl2 complex formation (Ref. 10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar and Fig. 4). An additional mutant (p53 R248T) was unable to form a BclXL complex. Thus, structural information from NMR spectroscopy is in complete agreement with this data, because the mutated residues all lie within or are located proximal to the binding interface of the complex. This direct link is very compelling, because it strongly argues that p53 mutations selected during tumorigenesis lose both the nuclear and mitochondrial apoptotic function of p53.TABLE 1Concomitant loss of mitochondrial permeabilization and Bcl2/BclXL binding by tumor-derived p53 proteins Empty entries, not determined.p53 Missense mutantCytochrome c releaseBclXL bindingBcl2 bindingR175H–––L194F–––G245S–R248W–R248T–R249S–R273H–––R280K–––R282W– Open table in a new tab This structure/function analysis shows that p53 engages in a complex that neutralizes the death-protective function of Bcl2. It identifies the p53DBD as the binding interface for Bcl2, using solution NMR. In contrast to wild type p53, tumor-derived missense mutants of p53 are unable to form complexes with endogenous Bcl2 in human cancer cells. Functionally, all p53 mutants are either completely or strongly compromised in mediating outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. These data implicate that both p53-Bcl2 and p53-BclXL complexes contribute to the direct mitochondrial p53 pathway of apoptosis. Moreover, it further supports the notion that the DNA binding domain of p53 is a dual function domain, mediating both its transactivation function and its direct mitochondrial apoptotic function."

Because meat consumption is the most likely means of exposure, it is important to determine whether skeletal muscle of diseased cervids contains prion infectivity. Here bioassays in transgenic mice expressing cervid prion protein revealed the presence of infectious prions in skeletal muscles of CWD-infected deer, demonstrating that humans consuming or handling meat from CWD-infected deer are at risk to prion exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2103176682,"I n research universities and colleges, mentoring is one of the most important skills for faculty because it affects both research productivity and the quality of training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. Moreover, the diversity of science is dependent on the quality of mentored research, because this experience is a key to attracting underrepresented groups to science (1–5). In the past, many faculty learned skills such as mentoring on the job. In recent years, various organizations have developed training programs to help prospective and new faculty learn skills such as grant writing, laboratory management, and classroom teaching, but mentoring has been largely absent. In response to this need, we developed and evaluated a mentor-training seminar. The seminar is intended to improve mentors’ skills and to enhance the research experiences of undergraduate students. In research universities, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers often serve as the primary mentors for undergraduate researchers (see photograph, this page). This arrangement provides undergraduates with guidance from a person who is accessible and whose primary focus is laboratory work. It also provides graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with experience as mentors. Therefore, our seminar focused on training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers as mentors, but it is also suitable for developing mentoring skills of faculty."
https://openalex.org/W2161538543,"An ecological community's species diversity tends to erode through time as a result of stochastic extinction, competitive exclusion, and unstable host-enemy dynamics. This erosion of diversity can be prevented over the short term if recruits are highly diverse as a result of preferential recruitment of rare species or, alternatively, if rare species survive preferentially, which increases diversity as the ages of the individuals increase. Here, we present census data from seven New and Old World tropical forest dynamics plots that all show the latter pattern. Within local areas, the trees that survived were as a group more diverse than those that were recruited or those that died. The larger (and therefore on average older) survivors were more diverse within local areas than the smaller survivors.

A fundamental concept in neuroscience states that neural signals, termed corollary discharges or efference copies, are forwarded from motor to sensory areas. Neurons mediating these signals have proved difficult to identify. We show that a single, multisegmental interneuron is responsible for the pre- and postsynaptic inhibition of auditory neurons in singing crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Therefore, this neuron represents a corollary discharge interneuron that provides a neuronal basis for the central control of sensory responses."

Here, we demonstrate that a fast-evolving virus (feline immunodeficiency virus, FIV) can reveal details of the contemporary population structure and recent demographic history of its natural wildlife host ( Puma concolor ) that were not apparent from host genetic data and would be impossible to obtain by other means. We suggest that rapidly evolving pathogens may provide a complementary tool for studying population dynamics of their hosts in “shallow” time."
https://openalex.org/W2123381928,"Interactions between arrestins and phosphoinositides have been reported to regulate multiple membrane-associated signaling and trafficking events including clathrin-mediated endocytosis and light adaptation in Drosophila. Arrestins have been proposed to have nuclear and cytosolic functions as well, although the ligand dependence of these functions has not been investigated. Here we characterize the structural, molecular, and cellular interactions between arrestin-2 and inositol hexakisphosphate (inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6)). The crystal structure of the arrestin-2·IP6 complex was solved to 2.9 Å with crystal lattice contacts suggesting two sites on a protein monomer mediating IP6 binding. Mutagenesis coupled to isothermal titration calorimetry and tritiated IP6 binding assays confirmed two-site binding with a low affinity IP6-binding site in the N-domain and a high affinity site in the C-domain. Native gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated the ability of IP6 to promote arrestin-2 oligomerization via the two crystallographically defined ligand-binding locations. In addition, analysis in mammalian cells revealed that arrestin-2 not only undergoes homo-oligomerization, but it can also hetero-oligomerize with arrestin-3 in a manner that depends on IP6-binding sites. Mutation of either IP6-binding site in arrestin-2 disrupted oligomerization while interactions with known binding partners including clathrin, AP-2, and ERK2 were maintained. Subcellular localization studies showed that arrestin-2 oligomers are primarily cytoplasmic, whereas arrestin-2 monomers displayed increased nuclear localization. Thus, by promoting cytosolic oligomerization, IP6 binding is proposed to be a negative regulator of interactions of arrestin with plasma membrane and nuclear signaling proteins.

VOLUME 281 (2006) PAGES 9812-9823Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 281Issue 30PreviewPAGE 9814: Full-Text PDF Open Access Arrestins are a family of proteins classically known for their roles in desensitizing G protein-coupled receptors (1Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). They bind activated and phosphorylated receptors rendering them refractory to extracellular stimuli. Arrestins can be subdivided into two classes: visual and nonvisual. Visual arrestins (arrestin-1 and arrestin-4) are localized in retinal rod and cone cells, respectively, and regulate phototransduction. Nonvisual arrestins (arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, also called β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2) are ubiquitously expressed and regulate multiple cellular processes. For example, nonvisual arrestins function as adaptor proteins interacting with endocytic components and protein kinases including phosphoinositides (2Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L.

These diverse molecules bind to arrestins forming multiprotein assemblies, which participate in clathrin-dependent endocytosis and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (7Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Recently, however, the role of nonvisual arrestins in forming scaffolding complexes that link activated transmembrane receptors to signaling events within the cytosol and nucleus has become a central focus (7Lefkowitz R.J.

The expanded role of nonvisual arrestins functioning as adaptor proteins in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is intimately related to their interactions with the endocytic machinery including phosphoinositides. Phosphoinositides are recognized as important intermediates in cellular signaling and trafficking events (11Roth M.G. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). They regulate endocytosis by modulating AP-2 self-association, AP-2 binding to clathrin, and arrestin-dependent recruitment of G protein-coupled receptors into coated pits (2Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4442-4447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, phosphoinositides regulate light-dependent trafficking of visual arrestins in photoreceptor cells mediating light adaptation in Drosophila (13Lee S.J. Xu H. Kang L.W. Amzel L.M. Montell C. Neuron. 2003; 39: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both Drosophila visual arrestin and mammalian nonvisual arrestins contain a highly electropositive patch of residues located within their C-terminal domains involved in phosphoinositide binding (2Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13Lee S.J. Xu H. Kang L.W. Amzel L.M. Montell C. Neuron. 2003; 39: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate are the proposed physiological ligands for arrestins at the plasma membrane. Interestingly the soluble inositol polyphosphate inositol hexakisphosphate (inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6)) displays a higher binding affinity for nonvisual arrestins than either phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (2Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). IP6 is abundant in cells with concentrations ranging between 15 and 100 μm and has been proposed to participate in numerous and functionally diverse biological functions ranging from metal ion chelation to DNA repair (14Shears S.B. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Sasakawa N. Sharif M. Hanley M.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Intriguingly IP6 regulates both receptor endocytosis and receptor signaling. It binds with high affinity to AP-2, inhibiting clathrin coat assembly, and blocks arrestin binding to receptors and ion channels preventing signal inactivation (2Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R.

To understand the interactions between arrestin and IP6 in greater detail we solved the crystal structure of arrestin-2 in complex with IP6. The refined model at 2.9 Å provides novel structural and functional insights. The structural data not only define the location and the residues of arrestin-2 involved in IP6 binding but also suggest a second IP6-binding site with the potential for promoting IP6-dependent arrestin oligomerization. The structural model was tested using biochemical and protein analytical techniques. Mutagenesis and biophysical assays established that arrestin-2 interacts with IP6 at two sites and that IP6 is capable of inducing arrestin-2 oligomerization via those sites. Arrestin-2 and -3 were also found to homo- and hetero-oligomerize in mammalian cells with data implicating IP6 in mediating the association. Finally differences in the subcellular localization of arrestin-2 oligomers and monomers were investigated. Arrestin-2 oligomers were found to be primarily localized in the cytoplasm, whereas arrestin-2 monomers populated the nucleus. These data support a novel role for IP6 in regulating receptor signaling and nuclear trafficking through arrestin oligomerization. Arrestin Plasmid Construction—pTrcHisB-arrestin-2, pcDNA3-arrestin-2, pcDNA3-HA-arrestin-2, pcDNA3-FLAG-arrestin-2, and arrestin-2-GFP plasmids were described previously (4Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J.

Purified arrestin-3 was generously provided by Dr. Vsevolod Gurevich. pGEX-arrestin-2 was made by inserting arrestin-2 cDNA from the pTrcHisB-arrestin-2 plasmid into XmaI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-2. The arrestin-2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using 5′-cgcgcgcccgggatgggcgacaaagggacgc-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-cgcgcgctcgagggggggccccc-3′ as the antisense primer. pGEX-arrestin-2 K157Q, K160Q,R161Q (ND mutant) and pcDNA3-arrestin-2 K232Q,R236Q, K250Q,K324Q,K326Q (CD mutant) were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The mutagenic primers with mutagenic codons in bold used were: K157Q, 5′-aacctggaggagcagatccaccagcag-3′; K160Q/R161Q, 5′-gagaagatccaccagcagaattctgtgcgc-3′; K232Q/R236Q, 5′-aagaagatccagatctcggtgcagcagtatg-3′; K250Q, 5′-aacacagcccagtaccagtgccctgtg-3′; and K324Q/L326Q, 5′-ctacaaagtgcaagtgcagctggtggtg-3′. pcDNA3-arrestin-2 ND and arrestin-2-GFP ND mutants were made by subcloning cDNA fragments of arrestin-2 from pGEX-arrestin-2 ND mutant into the Bsu36I/S-acII and PstI/SacII sites of pcDNA3 and pEGFP-N, respectively. Arrestin-2-GFP CD and arrestin-2-GFP NDCD mutants were created by ligating the EcoRI/SacII arrestin-2 cDNA fragment from pcDNA3-arrestin-2 CD mutant into EcoRI/SacII-digested arrestin-2-GFP and arrestin-2-GFP ND mutant, respectively. pcDNA3-arrestin-2 NDCD mutant was generated by inserting the Bsu36I/SacII arrestin-2 cDNA fragment from arrestin-2-GFP NDCD mutant into the Bsu36I/SacII sites of pcDNA-arrestin-2. pcDNA3-HA-arrestin2 ND, CD, and NDCD mutants were created by subcloning the Bsu36I/SacII arrestin-2 cDNA fragment from arrestin-2-GFP ND, CD, and NDCD mutants, respectively, into Bsu36I/SacII-digested pcDNA3-HA-arrestin-2. pTrcHisB-arrestin-2 ND and NDCD mutants were constructed by inserting the Bsu36I/SacII arrestin-2 cDNA fragments from arrestin-2-GFP ND and NDCD mutants, respectively, into the Bsu-36I/SacII sites of pTrcHisB-arrestin-2. pTrcHisB-arrestin-2 CD mutant was made by subcloning the EcoRI/SacII arrestin-2 cDNA fragment from pcDNA3-arrestin-2 CD mutant into EcoRI/SacII-digested pTrcHisB-arrestin-2. All constructs were verified by dideoxy dye termination sequencing. Expression and Purification of Arrestin-2—Recombinant wild type arrestin-2 was expressed in BL21(DE3)-lysS bacterial cells using the pTrcHisB-arrestin-2 expression vector. Wild type arrestin-2 was purified as described previously (20Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Protein purity was >99% based on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, and typical yields were 5-10 mg of purified arrestin-2/liter of culture. Arrestin-2 N-domain mutant (K157Q,K160Q,R161Q) and C-domain mutant (K232Q,R236Q,K250Q, K324Q,K326Q) proteins were purified according to the wild type arrestin-2 procedure, although the mutant proteins failed to interact with the SP-Sepharose high performance resin and eluted in the flow-through and wash. Protein purity was >99% based on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The N-domain mutant yielded 2.6 mg of purified protein, whereas the C-domain mutant yielded 0.4 mg of purified protein/liter of culture. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Drops consisted of 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 125 mm NaCl) and 0.5 μl of 40% polypropylene glycol P 400 plus 2 μl of 150 mm magnesium formate and were equilibrated against 1 ml of 150 mm magnesium formate for 10 days. The dimensions of a typical crystal were 0.2 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm. The arrestin-2 crystals were soaked for 10 min with 0.5 mm IP6 in 200 mm magnesium formate; cryoprotected in 200 mm magnesium formate, 0.5 mm IP6, and 25% glycerol; and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source on beamline X25 at a crystal to detector distance of 220 mm with 1.5 ° oscillations. Structure Determination and Refinement—Data were indexed and scaled using the HKL package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The IP6-soaked arrestin-2 crystals were isomorphous to the native arrestin-2 crystals, possessing the symmetry of space group P3221 and containing an arrestin monomer with one molecule of IP6 in the asymmetric unit. Refinement and building were performed using the programs CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

A Fo-Fc difference electron density map calculated using observed structure factor amplitudes and structure factor phases from the arrestin-2 native structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1JSY) clearly showed density for IP6. IP6 from Protein Data Bank entry 1GW5 was used for building into the omit density. Data from 50-2.8 Å were used to generate electron density maps to manually rebuild the model and place main chain and side chains into density. After energy minimization and grouped B-factor refinement, the final atomic model was refined to 2.9 Å with Rwork = 25% and Rfree = 26%. The model contains 354 amino acids, 93 water molecules, 1 IP6 molecule, and 1 Mg2+. As shown in Table 1, the stereochemical parameters for the model calculated with PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—The binding of IP6 to purified arrestin-2 was investigated by ITC using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter from MicroCal. The experiments were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl at 10 °C. The sample cell contained 10 μm arrestin-2, and the syringe held 100 μm IP6. The ligand was injected into the cell until a 1.5-2-fold molar excess of ligand to protein was achieved. In a typical experiment, 6 μl of IP6 was injected into 1.43 ml of protein solution for up to 45 injections spaced 210 s apart. The heat of dilution of the ligand was subtracted from the data before fitting the curve in ORIGIN. After initial data refinement, the stoichiometry was fixed for each site to achieve the best overall fit to a two sets of sites model. The Kd was determined by Kb-1. Tritiated IP6 Binding Assay—The binding of [3H]IP6 to purified arrestins and its competition by unlabeled IP6 were performed using a procedure described previously (16Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Protein samples were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine γ-globulin, 0.01 μCi of [3H]IP6, and various concentrations of unlabeled IP6. The samples were then mixed with ice-cold 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 to yield a final concentration of 20% and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm, the supernatants were aspirated leaving a white pellet. The tubes were centrifuged again for 2 min, and the residual supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 1% SDS, transferred into scintillation vials containing 10 ml of BCS scintillation fluid (Fisher), and counted using a scintillation counter. The level of nonspecific binding was determined using 1 mm unlabeled IP6. Gel Filtration—A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column was equilibrated in buffer D (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) and calibrated using aldolase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and chymotrypsinogen A. Purified arrestin-2 wild type (20 μm) or a domain mutant mixture (10 μm ND + 10 μm CD) was loaded onto the column and eluted in buffer D. The column was then equilibrated in buffer D containing 50 μm IP6. Purified arrestin-2 wild type (20 μm) or a domain mutant mixture (10 μm ND + 10 μm CD) incubated with IP6 (50 μm) was loaded onto the column and eluted in buffer D containing 50 μm IP6. Native Gel Electrophoresis—Purified arrestin (10-15 μm) proteins in the presence or absence of 100 μm inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5), and IP6 were loaded on 5-25% gradient gels with native buffer strips and analyzed using the pHast system from Amersham Biosciences. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation studies were performed on a Beckman Proteomelab XL-A with an AN-60 rotor. Sedimentation velocity runs were conducted on various concentrations of arrestin-2 in the presence or absence of IP6. The samples were diluted in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl (buffer C) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm at 20 °C. Samples were also diluted in buffer C with 1 mm MgCl2, which behaved similarly to buffer C alone. Protein absorbance was monitored every minute by continuous scans at either 234 or 278 nm at 0.003-cm steps. Protein partial specific volume, buffer viscosity, and buffer density were determined using the program Sednterp. 4D. Hayer and T. Laue, unpublished data. Scans 1-200 were analyzed using Sedfit87. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-1 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Analysis of Arrestin-2/3 Homo- and Heteroassociations by Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-arrestin-2 and various pcDNA3-HA-arrestin constructs were lysed in 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 5-10 μg of polyclonal anti-HA epitope antibody (Covance) for 1 h followed by incubation with protein A-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged proteins. The immunocomplexes were washed three times in co-immunoprecipitation buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. FLAG-arrestin-2 was detected by monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibody at 1:2000 dilution. Analysis of Arrestin-2 Interactions with Additional Proteins—COS-1 cells transiently transfected with various pcDNA3-HA-arrestin-2 constructs were lysed in 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 5-10 μg of polyclonal anti-HA epitope antibody (Covance) for 1 h followed by incubation with protein A-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged proteins. The immunocomplexes were washed three times in co-immunoprecipitation buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for clathrin using a monoclonal anti-clathrin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) at 1:1000 dilution, for β2-adaptin using a monoclonal anti-β2-adaptin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) at 1:1000 dilution, and for ERK2 using a monoclonal anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:500 dilution. Subcellular Localization Analysis—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with various arrestin-2-GFP constructs in a 6-well plate. Twenty-four hours later the cells were split and plated onto another 6-well plate containing glass coverslips. After another 24 h the cells (∼50-60% confluent) were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1 μg/ml) was then added to the fixed cells for 5 min to stain the nucleus. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides containing 10 μl of Prolong Anti-Fade reagent (Molecular Probes). The slides were visualized on an Olympus BX-61 microscope with an ORCA-ER (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) cooled charge-coupled device camera controlled by Slidebook version 4.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) and on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope system. Arrestin-2 Has Two Crystallographically Defined IP6-binding Sites—On the basis of our crystal structure of arrestin-2, we hypothesized that residues Lys-232, Arg-236, Lys-250, Lys-324, and Lys-326 would be involved in interactions with phosphoinositide head groups (20Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To test this model and to determine how arrestin-2 binds to the abundant cytosolic inositol polyphosphate IP6, we soaked IP6 into arrestin-2 crystals and solved the liganded structure (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Arrestin-2 crystals have a monomer in the asymmetric unit and a well refined binding site for IP6 in the predicted location (Fig. 1C). Indeed IP6 binds to a highly electropositive region within the C-terminal domain of arrestin-2 with Lys-232, Arg-236, Lys-250, Lys-324, and Lys-326 contributing to the overall binding of the ligand (Fig. 1, B and E). As in the case of clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM) and α-adaptin, IP6 binds to arrestin-2 through interactions at the polar termini of Lys and Arg side chains rather than binding in a pocket or groove (27Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 28Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Residues Lys-232, Arg-236, and Lys-250 correspond to the residues in arrestin-3 (Lys-233, Arg-237, and Lys-251) that were previously shown to bind phosphoinositides and regulate G protein-coupled receptor trafficking (2Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows two additional basic residues with binding contacts, Lys-324 and Lys-326. In fact, Lys-326 along with Arg-236 can form the greatest number of hydrogen bonds with IP6. Lys-324 is in a position to make two hydrogen bond contacts with IP6 while Lys-250 makes one apparent hydrogen bond. Although Lys-232 appears to have the weakest interaction with the ligand, it contributes to the overall electropositive surface (Fig. 1, D and E). A superposition of IP6-bound and unbound arrestin-2 structures shows no significant global conformational changes or rearrangements resulting from ligand binding (supplemental Fig. 1A). A close-up view of the IP6-binding domains, however, shows side chain differences. The side chains of the arrestin-2·IP6-bound structure have moved toward the ligand, especially Arg-236 and Lys-326 in the C-domain and Arg-161 in the N-domain (supplemental Fig. 1B).FIGURE 1The structure of arrestin-2·IP6 complex.

The catalytic process (initiated by hydrogen peroxide) is the same as in classical peroxidases, with the involvement of 2 oxidizing equivalents and the formation of the so-called Compound I. This latter state contains an oxoferryl center and an organic cation radical that can be located on either the porphyrin ring or a protein residue. In this study, a radical intermediate in the reaction of versatile peroxidase from the ligninolytic fungus Pleurotus eryngii with H2O2 has been characterized by multifrequency (9.4 and 94 GHz) EPR and assigned to a tryptophan residue. Comparison of experimental data and density functional theory theoretical results strongly suggests the assignment to a tryptophan neutral radical, excluding the assignment to a tryptophan cation radical or a histidine radical. Based on the experimentally determined side chain orientation and comparison with a high resolution crystal structure, the tryptophan neutral radical can be assigned to Trp164 as the site involved in long-range electron transfer for aromatic substrate oxidation.

Different heme peroxidases are considered to be involved in the lignin biodegradation process, a key step for carbon recycling in terrestrial ecosystems. These are lignin peroxidase (LiP) 4The abbreviations used are: LiP, lignin peroxidase from P. chrysosporium; MnP, manganese peroxidase from P. chrysosporium; VP, versatile peroxidase; LRET, long-range electron transfer; ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance; DFT, density functional theory; hf, hyperfine; VP*, recombinant versatile peroxidase; mT, milliteslas; mW, milliwatts. and manganese peroxidase (MnP), first described in Phanerochaete chrysosporium (1Glenn J.K.

VP is characterized by combining catalytic properties of the other two ligninolytic peroxidases, MnP and LiP. This enzyme is able to oxidize Mn2+ to Mn3+ and also exhibits manganese-independent activity toward veratryl alcohol and p-dimethoxybenzene. Furthermore, it oxidizes hydroquinones and substituted phenols that are not efficiently oxidized by LiP or MnP in the absence of veratryl alcohol and Mn2+, respectively. VP is even able to degrade directly high redox potential dyes, which can be eventually oxidized by LiP only in the presence of veratryl alcohol (9Heinfling A. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J.

Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2788-2793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two genes encoding VP isoenzymes VPL and VPS1, expressed in liquid- and solid-state fermentation cultures, respectively, have been cloned from Pleurotus eryngii (11Camarero S. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Sarkar S. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 191: 37-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences for both isoenzymes were used to build molecular models by homology modeling, taking advantage of sequence identity to P. chrysosporium LiP and MnP and Coprinopsis cinerea (synonym Coprinus cinereus) peroxidase (13Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Camarero S. Perez-Boada M. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Very recently, the crystal structure of recombinant P. eryngii VP expressed in Escherichia coli and activated in vitro (14Pérez-Boada M. Doyle W.A. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Smith A.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 30: 518-524Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) has been determined at 1.33-Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code 2BOQ). Catalytically, VP would follow the classical heme peroxidase cycle, in which hydrogen peroxide is the final electron acceptor, acting as a 2-electron oxidizing substrate for the resting enzyme, which results in the formation of Compound I (15Martínez A.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 30: 425-444Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 16Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar, 17Sivaraja M. Goodin D.B. Smith M. Hoffman B.M. Science. 1989; 245: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Compound I is reduced back by the substrate in a two-step reaction that involves the formation of Compound II (a 1-electron oxidized form) and then the closure of the catalytic cycle to the resting state. It is known that H2O2 attains the distal side of the heme through the access channel present in all peroxidases. However, identification of sites involved in substrate oxidation has been successful only on a few occasions (18Henriksen A. Schuller D.J. Meno K. Welinder K.G. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8054-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 19Itakura H. Oda Y. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Pelletier H. Kraut J. Science. 1992; 258: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In ligninolytic peroxidases, only the manganese interaction site in MnP, situated near the internal propionate of the heme, has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray diffraction of MnP·Mn2+ complexes (21Kishi K. Kusters-van Someren M. Mayfield M.B. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8986-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Kusters-van Someren M. Kishi K. Lundell T. Gold M.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17574-17580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A putative manganese-binding site similar to that of MnP has been identified in P. eryngii VP isoenzymes (12Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Substitution of one of the residues from the putative manganese interaction site in VPL yields an enzyme with its Mn2+ oxidation ability strongly impaired (25Banci L. Camarero S. Martínez A.T. Martínez M.J. Pérez-Boada M. Pierattelli R. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such a binding site is not present in LiP according to its lack of activity with this divalent cation. In the case of LiP, there is no x-ray structure with any of its substrates available, and structure-function studies have been based on techniques that led to the indirect characterization of the substrate interaction sites. The veratryl alcohol molecule was initially modeled at the heme access channel (26Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the residues hypothetically involved are conserved also in the isoenzyme VPS1 of P. eryngii, which has a main heme access channel remarkably similar to that of LiP (24Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Apart from the possibility of direct electron transfer to the heme from some substrates, long-range electron transfer (LRET) should be considered to justify the capacity of VP and LiP to oxidize high molecular size substrates that do not fit into the heme access channel. The first suggested LRET pathway involved the LiP distal histidine and started at His82 (27Schoemaker H.E. Lundell T.K. Floris R. Glumoff T. Winterhalter K.H. Piontek K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1994; 2: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This pathway does not exist in MnP and in the isoenzyme VPL of P. eryngii, but it has been identified in VPS1. Two additional pathways have been proposed in LiP. One starts at the second exposed histidine (LiP His239) to the proximal histidine and is absent in MnP and VPS1 and present in VPL (His232). The second pathway starts from an exposed tryptophan (Trp171) present in LiP and proceeds to the porphyrin ring. Its involvement in veratryl alcohol and non-phenolic lignin model compound oxidation has been confirmed in LiP, and Trp171 has been revealed to be a redox-active residue (28Blodig W. Doyle W.A. Smith A.T. Winterhalter K. Choinowski T.H. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8832-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Blodig W. Smith A.T. Doyle W.A. Piontek K. J. Mol.

Biophys. 1999; 370: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Multisequence alignment revealed that the above-mentioned tryptophan residue is conserved in all LiP sequences as well as in Pleurotus VP and is absent in the typical MnP (15Martínez A.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 30: 425-444Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The involvement of a surface tryptophan as a catalytic site in LiP was also inferred in a study on the S168W variant of MnP (33Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, a putative electron transfer pathway from the exposed tryptophan residue was identified in P. eryngii isoenzymes VPL (Trp164) and VPS1 (Trp170) (12Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Camarero S. Perez-Boada M. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It is interesting to point out that VPs, as all other ligninolytic enzymes described until now, have no Tyr residues in their sequences (15Martínez A.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 30: 425-444Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the results from multifrequency (9.4 GHz, X-band; and 94 GHz, W-band) EPR studies on a freeze-quenched radical intermediate in the reaction of P. eryngii VP with H2O2. Comparison of the EPR and pulse electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experimental data with theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT), in particular for the hyperfine (hf) tensor values, excludes assignment to a tryptophan cation radical or a histidine radical, but strongly suggests assignment to a tryptophan neutral radical. It has been shown in earlier studies on tryptophan radicals in ribonucleotide reductase variants that evaluation of the hf-tensors of the side chain methylene protons enables determination of the side chain geometry, which can be used for site-specific assignment (34Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F. Bittl R. Fiege R. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Lubitz W. Lassmann G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8111-8120Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Sahlin M.

Based on the side chain orientation deduced from the experimental hyperfine data of these protons, the observed tryptophan neutral radical can be assigned to Trp164, which is proposed as the surface site involved in LRET in VPL of P. eryngii. Chemicals and Protein Preparation—Potassium hydrogen phthalate and H2O2 were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Recombinant VP (VP*) was obtained by E. coli expression (14Pérez-Boada M. Doyle W.A. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Smith A.T. Enzyme Microb.

Transformed cells were grown for 3 h in Terrific Broth (36Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar), induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 4 h. The apoenzyme accumulated in inclusion bodies was recovered using 8 m urea. Subsequent in vitro folding was performed using 0.15 m urea, 5 mm Ca2+, 20 μm hemin, oxidized glutathione/dithiothreitol (5:1), and 0.1 mg/ml protein at pH 9.5 (14Pérez-Boada M. Doyle W.A. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Smith A.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 30: 518-524Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Active enzyme was purified by Mono Q chromatography using a 0-0.5 m NaCl gradient in 10 mm sodium tartrate (pH 5.5) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. UV-visible and EPR Measurements—UV-visible measurements of 6 μm VP* in 0.1 m phthalate buffer (pH 4.5) were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 spectrophotometer at 24 °C before and after the addition of 8 eq of H2O2. EPR solutions were prepared with a final concentration of 0.16 mm enzyme and 1.3 mm H2O2 in the same buffer, and the reaction was stopped by rapid immersion of the EPR tube in liquid nitrogen after 10 s. Continuous wave X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR measurements were carried out with a Bruker eleXsys E500 series using the Bruker ER4122 SHQE cavity and an Oxford ESR900 helium continuous flow cryostat. X-band pulse ENDOR experiments were performed on a Bruker E580 pulse EPR/ENDOR spectrometer using a Bruker EN4118X-MD4-W1 resonator equipped with a helium immersion cryostat. Spin quantification was performed by double integration of the experimental EPR radical signal compared with the iron signal. EPR saturation data were collected by measuring the EPR absorption derivative signal intensity as a function of microwave power at different temperatures. The saturation data were fit to Equation 1 S/√P=1/(1+(P/P1/2))b/2(Eq. 1) where S is the EPR derivative signal intensity, P is the microwave power, P½ is the half-saturation power, and b is the inhomogeneity parameter. A nonlinear least-squares fit to Equation 1 yielded P½ and b values for each particular temperature (37Brudvig G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 536-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 38Beinert H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Ehrenberg A. Malmstrom B.J. Vanngard T. Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems.

Acta. 1978; 537: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 94 GHz high-field EPR experiments were performed on a Bruker eleXsys E680 spectrometer. Spectra were recorded at 40 K. Low microwave power, typically only a few microwatts, was used to avoid saturation effects. For determination of precise g-tensor components, the microwave frequency was measured using a frequency counter, which was integrated in the spectrometer. The magnetic field was calibrated with a g-tensor standard (lithium in LiF, g = 2.002293 (2Kuwahara M. Glenn J.K. Morgan M.A. Gold M.H. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 247-250Crossref Scopus (674) Google Scholar)) (40Stesmans A. van Gorp G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2949-2952Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) at two different frequencies (typically, 93.8 and 94.2 GHz). All spectra were recorded in the “persistent mode” of the superconducting magnet, using the room temperature coils for the field sweep to ensure high linearity and stability of the field (maximum sweep width of 800 G). The modulation amplitude was kept at 0.2 millitesla (mT) to avoid modulation broadening. The 94 GHz EPR microwave resonator is a fundamental mode cylindrical cavity that has a high filling factor (compared with a transmission line set up or a Fabry-Perot resonator) and a small sample volume (0.7-mm diameter and ∼1.5-mm height), thereby assuring high sensitivity and high homogeneity of the field over the active sample volume (>5 ppm). This enables the measurement of very accurate g-tensor values with an instrumental limit for the absolute g-tensor resolution obtained for the narrow signal of the g-tensor standard of ±0.000005 (lithium in LiF, approximate line width of 0.01 mT). Simulation of the EPR Spectra—The EPR spectra were analyzed using a software for simulating and fitting EPR spectra for S = 1/2 systems with anisotropic g- and hf-tensors (34Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F. Bittl R. Fiege R. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Lubitz W. Lassmann G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8111-8120Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thereby, the spectra are simulated by computing the resonant field position correct to second order at the given microwave frequency, dependent on the orientation of the g- and hf-tensors with respect to the external magnetic field (41Rieger P.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 50: 485-489Google Scholar, 42Mombourquette H.J. Weil J.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 37-44Google Scholar). No restriction for the relative orientation of the principal axes of the different tensors is applied (34Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F. Bittl R. Fiege R. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A.

Geometry optimizations were done using a contracted basis set augmented with polarization functions (6-31G**) (43Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Montgomery Jr., J.A. Vreven T. Kudin K.N. Burant J.C. Gaussian 03, Revision B.04. Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA2003Google Scholar). Magnetic properties (g-tensor, spin densities, and hyperfine couplings) were calculated on the geometry-optimized structure in a second step using the TZVP basis set, which is included in the program. The resulting output was fed into the program MOLDEN for visualization of the spin density distribution in the molecule (44Schaftenaar G. Noordik J.H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2003; 14: 123-134Crossref Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). UV-visible Spectroscopy—Fig. 1 shows the electronic absorption spectrum of P. eryngii VP* (expressed in E. coli and folded in vitro) at pH 4.5 before and after H2O2 addition. The spectrum is characterized by the presence of the Soret band at 409 nm and the two charge transfer bands at 505 and 638 nm. The 600-650-nm wavelength region is sensitive to the heme pocket environment (45Smulevich G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: S3-S17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This band (638 nm), observed only in the high spin state, has been assigned to a charge transfer transition from the porphyrin to the iron. In the inset of Fig. 1, the EPR spectrum of the resting state enzyme confirms the presence of the dominant contribution of the high spin iron species (g⊥ = 6.00 and g∥ = 2.00). In the UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 1) recorded 10 s after the addition of 8 eq of H2O2, the Soret absorption band is broadened, and its intensity is reduced with respect to the native enzyme. The visible region shows a broad absorption with peaks at 583 and 652 nm, suggesting the formation of Compound I (17Sivaraja M. Goodin D.B. Smith M. Hoffman B.M. Science. 1989; 245: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 46Marquez L. Wariishi H. Dunford H.B. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10549-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced absorption of the Soret region of Compound I compared with native VP* and the characteristic absorption band at 652 nm suggest that this compound contains 2 oxidizing eq over the native enzyme (47Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1626-1631Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The first oxidizing equivalent is contained in the ferryl state of the iron. The second equivalent can be on the porphyrin ring, as for horse-radish peroxidase, or on an amino acid side chain of the protein, as for cytochrome c peroxidase (16Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar, 17Sivaraja M. Goodin D.B. Smith M. Hoffman B.M. Science. 1989; 245: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Through EPR measurements, it is possible to distinguish the oxidizing equivalent location and to assign the nature of the organic radical formed. 9.4 GHz EPR Spectroscopy—In Fig. 2, the EPR signal obtained after the addition of 8 eq of H2O2 and rapid cooling is shown. The strong decrease in the EPR signal of the ferric high spin species and the formation of an intense radical signal corresponding to a protein radical species are evident. The yield of the radical signal is ∼0.25 spin/heme. The isotropic EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 2A is characterized by a doublet, centered at g = 2.0027. It seems that the reaction of the heme porphyrin ring and H2O2 proceeds to the formation of an amino acid radical, considering the absence of the characteristic signal of the ferryl porphyrin intermediate at 10 s of freezing time (48Ivancich A. Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 49Ivancich A. Mazza G. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6860-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2B, the intensity of the radical signal against temperature is plotted. The curve shows a strong temperature dependence especially at low temperature, as reported for cytochrome c (50Villegas J.A. Mauk A.G. Vazquez-Duhalt R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 237-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 represents log(S/√P) ([mW½]/mW½) against log P ([mW]/mW), and the values of P½ and b (Equation 1) can be calculated for all different temperatures. At 20 K, the b value obtained from the fitting is equal to 0.9. This is typical for protein radicals with a weak coupling to a paramagnetic ion. The P½ value is in good agreement with those reported for similar organic radicals that coupled to the ferryl heme iron in other peroxidase systems (51Schünemann V. Lendzian F. Jung C. Contzen J.

An expansion of the well resolved 9.4 GHz (X-band) EPR spectrum of the radical is shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum is dominated by a large doublet splitting, showing well resolved subsplittings on each of the two components. The overall shape of the spectrum is very symmetric, which is expected in the case of very small g-tensor anisotropy. The upper trace shows a best simulation and fit of the spectrum based on one nitrogen and two anisotropic ring proton hf-tensors, typical for a tryptophan radical (34Lendzian F. Sahlin M.

The simulation shows that the 9.5 GHz EPR spectrum is fully consistent with the proton and nitrogen hf-tensor values, typical for a tryptophan neutral radical (Scheme 1). The g-tensor values obtained from the 94 GHz EPR spectrum were used in the simulation shown in Fig. 4 (see below and Table 1). At 9.5 GHz, the EPR simulation is very sensitive for the hf-tensor values, but less sensitive for the g-tensor values in the case of such small g-tensor anisotropy.

https://openalex.org/W1990215671,"IL-13 is an important stimulator of inflammation and tissue remodeling at sites of Th2 inflammation, which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of a variety of human disorders. We hypothesized that the ubiquitous transcription factor, early growth response-1 (Egr-1), plays a key role in IL-13-induced tissue responses. To test this hypothesis we compared the expression of Egr-1 and related moieties in lungs from wild type mice and transgenic mice in which IL-13 was overexpressed in a lung-specific fashion. We simultaneously characterized the effects of a null mutation of Egr-1 on the tissue effects of transgenic IL-13. These studies demonstrate that IL-13 stimulates Egr-1 via an Erk1/2-independent Stat6-dependent pathway(s). They also demonstrate that IL-13 is a potent stimulator of eosinophil- and mononuclear cell-rich inflammation, alveolar remodeling, and tissue fibrosis in mice with wild type Egr-1 loci and that these alterations are ameliorated in the absence of Egr-1. Lastly, they provide insights into the mechanisms of these processes by demonstrating that IL-13 stimulates select CC and CXC chemokines (MIP-1α/CCL-3, MIP-1β/CCL-4, MIP-2/CXCL2/3, MCP-1/CCL-2, MCP-2/CCL-8, MCP-3/CCL-7, MCP-5/CCL-12, KC/CXCL-1, and Lix/CXCL-5), matrix metalloproteinase-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and apoptosis regulators (caspase-3, -6, -8, and -9 and Bax) and activates transforming growth factor-β1 and pulmonary caspases via Egr-1-dependent pathways.

Surprisingly, the regulation of Egr-1 by Th2 tissue responses and the role of Egr-1 in the pathogenesis of Th2-induced inflammation and remodeling have not been assessed.We hypothesized that Egr-1 is a critical mediator of IL-13 induced tissue responses. To test this hypothesis we characterized the expression of Egr-1 and related moieties in lungs from wild type mice and mice in which IL-13 was overexpressed in a lung-specific fashion. We also characterized the effects of a null mutation of Egr-1 on the tissue effects of transgenic IL-13. These studies demonstrate that IL-13 is a potent stimulator of Egr-1. They also demonstrate that Egr-1 plays a key role in IL-13-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and alveolar remodeling. Lastly, they provide insights into the mechanisms of these processes by demonstrating that IL-13 stimulates chemokines, MMPs, and antiproteases, activates TGF-β1, and induces cell death via Egr-1-dependent pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODSOverexpression Transgenic Mice—CC10-IL-13 transgenic mice were generated in our laboratory, bred onto a C57BL/6 background, and used in these studies.

The number and types of cells in the cell pellet were determined with light microscopy. The supernatants were stored at -20 °C until used.Lung Volume and Morphometric Assessments—Animals were anesthetized, the trachea was cannulated, and the lungs were removed and inflated with phosphate-buffered saline at 25 cm. The size of each lung was evaluated via volume displacement, and alveolar size was estimated from the mean chord length of the airspace as previously described by our laboratory (6Zheng T. Zhu Z.

Chord length increases with alveolar enlargement.Histologic Evaluation—Animals were sacrificed, a median sternotomy was performed, and right heart perfusion was accomplished with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline. The heart and lungs were then removed en bloc inflated at 25 cm pressure with neutral buffered 10% formalin, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained. Hematoxylin and eosin, Mallory's trichrome, and periodic acid-Schiff with diastase stains were performed in the Research Histology Laboratory of the Department of Pathology at Yale University School of Medicine.mRNA Analysis—mRNA levels were evaluated by conventional reverse transcription PCR analysis as described previously (6Zheng T.

For each cytokine, the optimal numbers of cycles that will produce a quantity of cytokine product that is directly proportional to the quantity of input mRNA was determined experimentally. β-Actin was used as an internal standard. Amplified PCR products were detected using ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis, quantitated electronically, and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. In selected experiments, real time reverse transcription PCR was used as previously described (28He C.H. Waxman A.B. Lee C.G. Link H. Rabach M.E. Ma B. Chen Q. Zhu Z. Zhong M. Nakayama K.

Homer R.J. Zhu Z. Lanone S. Wang X. Koteliansky V. Shipley J.M. Gotwals P. Noble P.W. Senior R.M. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The data are expressed as the collagen content of the entire right lung.TUNEL Evaluations—End labeling of exposed 3′-OH ends of DNA fragments was undertaken with the TUNEL in situ cell death detection kit AP (Roche Diagnostics) as described by the manufacturer. After staining, 20 fields of alveoli were randomly chosen for examination. The labeled cells were expressed as a percentage of total nuclei.Immunoblott Analysis—Lung lysates were prepared, and Western analysis was undertaken with antibodies that reacted selectively with Egr-1, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) as previously described (30Lee C.G.

Data that were not normally distributed were assessed for significance using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTSIL-13 Regulation of Egr-1—To begin to understand the importance of Egr-1 in the pathogenesis of IL-13-induced tissue alterations, studies were undertaken to determine whether IL-13 regulated the expression and/or production of Egr-1 and related moieties. These experiments demonstrate that transgenic IL-13 is a potent stimulator of Egr-1 mRNA (Fig. 1A) and Egr-1 protein (Fig. 1B). These effects were not specific for Egr-1 because Egr-2 and Egr-3 are similarly regulated. However, the Egr-1-binding proteins NAB-1 and NAB-2 were not similarly altered (Fig. 1A).Role of Stat6 and Erk1/2 in IL-13 Stimulation of Egr-1—The signaling pathways that mediate the stimulatory effects of IL-13 were also evaluated. In these experiments we initially evaluated the role of Stat6, the canonical signaling pathway for IL-13. This was done by comparing the effects of transgenic IL-13 in mice with wild type and null Stat6 loci. Because Egr-1 expression can also be regulated via Erk1/2-dependent pathways (31De Sousa L.P. Brasil B.S. Silva B.M. Freitas M.H. Nogueira S.V. Ferreira P.C. Kroon E.G. Bonjardim C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Jones N.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we also evaluated the role of Erk1/2 signaling in the stimulation of Egr-1 in IL-13 transgenic mice (Tg). This was done by crossing IL-13 Tg mice with mice in which a dominant-negative MEK-1 construct was overexpressed in a lung-specific fashion. As previously reported by our laboratory (34Lee P.J. Zhang X. Shan P. Ma B. Lee C.G. Homer R.J. Zhu Z. Rincon M. Mossman B.T. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 116: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) these mice have a defect in Erk1/2 activation and significant alterations in IL-13 effector pathway activation. These results were compared with the results that were obtained with the specific pharmacologic Erk inhibitor (PD98059). IL-13 induction of Egr-1 was not significantly altered in IL-13 Tg mice in which dominant-negative MEK-1 was expressed (Fig. 1C). PD98059 treatment also did not alter IL-13 stimulation of Egr-1 when compared with vehicle-treated Tg (+) animals (Fig. 1C). In contrast, IL-13 stimulation of EGR-1 was completely abrogated by the null mutation of Stat6 (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that IL-13 induces Egr-1 via an Erk1/2-independent and Stat6-dependent pathway(s).Role of Egr-1 on IL-13-induced Inflammation—Studies were next undertaken to define the role of Egr-1 plays in IL-13-induced inflammation. In these experiments we compared the BAL and tissue inflammatory responses in transgene(Tg) (-) and Tg (+) mice with wild type (+/+) and null mutant (-/-) Egr-1 loci. As previously reported, transgenic IL-13 caused BAL and tissue inflammation with enhanced total cell, eosinophil, and lymphocyte responses (Fig. 2, A and B, data not shown). Egr-1 appeared to play an important role in these responses because tissue (Fig. 2A) and BAL inflammation were all significantly diminished in Tg (+) mice with null mutant Egr-1 loci (Fig. 2B). These studies demonstrate that Egr-1 plays a critical role in IL-13-induced pulmonary inflammation.FIGURE 2Role of Egr-1 in IL-13-induced inflammation. 2-month-old Tg (+) and TG (-) littermate controls with (+/+) and (-/-) Egr-1 loci were generated. The histologic appearance of their lungs on hematoxylin and eosin evaluations (A, 10× original magnification) and BAL cell recovery (B) are compared.

Investig. 2003; 111: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), studies were undertaken to define the role of Egr-1 in the IL-13-induced fibrotic response. In these studies we used trichrome evaluations and lung collagen assessments to characterize the fibrotic response in Tg (-) and Tg (+) mice with (+/+) and (-/-) Egr-1 loci. As previously reported by our laboratory (5Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P. Wang J. Zhang Y. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar), transgenic IL-13 caused peribronchial and interstitial fibrosis in Tg (+) mice with (+/+) Egr-1 loci (Fig. 3A). This induction was readily appreciated in trichrome evaluations (Fig. 3A) and biochemical assays (Fig. 3B). This fibrotic response was Egr-1-dependent because trichrome and biochemical assays demonstrated marked decreases in collagen accumulation in Tg (+) mice with null mutant versus (+/+) Egr-1 loci (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, IL-13-induced tissue fibrosis is mediated via a mechanism that is, at least in part, Egr-1-dependent.FIGURE 3Role of Egr-1 in IL-13-induced fibrosis. The collagen content of lungs from 3-month-old IL-13 Tg (-) and (+) mice with (+/+) and (-/-) Egr-1 loci were compared using Mallory's trichrome (A) and sircol (B) collagen evaluations.

Thus, studies were undertaken to define the role of Egr-1 in these responses. In accord with our previous observations in Egr-1-sufficient mice (6Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B. Riese R. Chapman H. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), transgenic IL-13 caused impressive increases in pulmonary compliance and alveolar enlargement after pressure fixation (Fig. 4). Egr-1 played an important role in these responses because IL-13-induced alveolar remodeling (Fig. 4A) and alveolar enlargement (Fig. 4, A and B) were diminished in Tg (+) mice with null mutant Egr-1 loci. These studies demonstrate that IL-13 induces alveolar remodeling via a mechanism that is, at least in part, Egr-1-dependent.FIGURE 4Role of Egr-1 in IL-13-induced alveolar remodeling. Lungs were obtained from Tg (-) and Tg (+) mice with (+/+) and (-/-) Egr-1 loci, fixed to pressure and hematoxylin and eosin histologic stains (A, 20× original magnification) and chord length (B) assessments were undertaken.

To differentiate among these options, we compared the levels of BAL IL-13 in Tg (-) and Tg (+) mice with wild type and null mutant Egr-1 loci. IL-13 was not readily apparent in BAL fluids from Tg (-) mice with wild type or null mutant Egr-1 loci. In contrast, significant levels of BAL of IL-13 were noted in doxycycline-treated Tg (+) animals. These levels, however, were similar in Tg (+) mice with wild type and null mutant Egr-1 loci (data not shown). This demonstrates that the ablation of Egr-1 alters the IL-13 phenotype by modifying IL-1"

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of EMMPRIN are not fully understood. In this study we sought to determine whether EMMPRIN contributes to the malignant phenotype of breast cancer by inhibiting anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by loss or alteration of cell-cell or cell-matrix anchorage, and to explore the signaling pathways involved. We found that in the absence of attachment, human breast carcinoma cells expressing high levels of EMMPRIN formed less compact aggregates with larger surface area and less fibronectin matrix assembly, had higher viability, and were resistant to anoikis. Knockdown of EMMPRIN expression by RNA interference (small interfering RNA or short hairpin RNA) sensitized cancer cells to anoikis, as demonstrated by activation of caspase-3, increased DNA fragmentation, and decreased cellular viability. Furthermore, we observed that the accumulation of Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein, was reduced in EMMPRIN-expressing cells and that silencing of EMMPRIN expression elevated Bim protein levels and enhanced cellular sensitivity to anoikis. Treatment of cells with a MEK inhibitor (U0126) or proteasome inhibitor (epoxomicin) also up-regulated Bim accumulation and rendered cells more sensitive to anoikis. These results indicated that expression of EMMPRIN protects cancer cells from anoikis and that this effect is mediated at least in part by a MAP kinase-dependent reduction of Bim. Because anoikis deficiency is a key feature of neoplastic transformation and invasive growth of epithelial cancer cells, our study on the role of EMMPRIN in anoikis resistance and the mechanism involved underscores the potential of EMMPRIN expression as a prognostic marker and novel target for cancer therapy.

(also known as CD147, basigin, M6, and tumor cell-derived collagenase stimulatory factor) is a glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is enriched on the plasma membrane of many human cancer cells.

In recently reported clinical studies, high levels of EMMPRIN were found on ∼90% of micrometastatic cells in the bone marrow of breast cancer patients (7Reimers N. Zafrakas K. Assmann V. Egen C.

Also, significantly higher expression of EMMPRIN was found in malignant effusions than in primary tumors in patients with breast cancer (11Davidson B. Konstantinovsky S. Nielsen S. Dong H.P.

Our laboratory previously identified the up-regulation of EMMPRIN in multidrug-resistant cancers cells and its role in stimulating several matrix metalloproteinases (12Yang J.M. Xu Z. Wu H. Zhu H.

Marieb et al. (14Marieb E.A. Zoltan-Jones A. Li R. Misra S. Ghatak S. Cao J. Zucker S. Toole B.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) found that EMMPRIN promotes anchorage-independent growth of human breast carcinoma cells in a hyaluronan-dependent manner. These studies suggest a role of EMMPRIN in regulating survival of cancer cells, which may favor their growth and dissemination and resistance to treatment. Yet, the mechanism underlying the survival-promoting function of EMMPRIN remains unclear. In the present study, we found that expression of EMMPRIN in human breast carcinoma cells rendered them resistant to anoikis, a form of apoptosis triggered by a lack of or improper cell-matrix interactions. We also demonstrated that the suppression of anoikis by EMMPRIN was mediated by down-regulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein, Bim, through a MAP kinase-dependent pathway. Cell Lines and Culture—EMMPRIN sense- and antisense-transfected MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines were generated and cultured as previously described (15Tang Y. Kesavan P. Nakada M.T. Yan L.

These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, 95% air. All cultures were monitored routinely and found to be free of contamination by mycoplasma or fungi. All cell lines were discarded after 3 months, and new lines were propagated from frozen stocks.

Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar). The siRNA duplex with the following sense and antisense sequences was used: 5′-GUACAAGAUCACUGACUCUUU (sense) and 5′-AGAGUCAGUGAUCUUGUACUU (antisense). The DNA hairpin oligonucleotides were synthesized using Ambion's shRNA design center and their default loop sequence. Oligonucleotides were cloned into Ambion's pSilencer 2.1 vectors according to the manufacturer's instructions. Large scale preparations of the vectors were made using HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced to confirm the presence of the correct shRNA sequence. pSilencer vectors were linearized with the AflIII restriction endonuclease prior to transfection. The day before transfection, MDA-MB-231 cells (3 × 106 cells/dish) were seeded into 100-mm2 dishes. siRNA, the shRNA expression vector, or control vector was transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To select the cells expressing shRNA, cells were harvested and reseeded into 100-mm2 dishes at 10- and 100-fold dilutions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing hygromycin B (250 mg/ml). Clones were grown under antibiotic selection, expanded to 6-well plates, and then screened for EMMPRIN expression by staining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-EMMPRIN antibody (1:10 dilution) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Hanging Drop Assay—The hanging drop assay was performed as described previously (17Robinson E.E. Foty R.A. Corbett S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), with minor modification. Briefly, cells were removed from confluent 10-cm plates with trypsin-EDTA, washed, counted, and resuspended at a concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium. Twelve-μl aliquots of this suspension were deposited on the underside of a 10-cm tissue culture dish lid. The lid was then inverted over 8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline to create hanging drops on the upper lid. Drops were incubated under tissue culture conditions for 2-3 days. Aggregate compaction was measured as follows. High contrast aggregate images were captured and digitized. Image analysis was performed using IP Lab imaging software (Slanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA). Each image was adjusted for optimum contrast. Aggregates were then assigned as false color, and the outlines were automatically traced. The number of pixels underlying the outline was calculated by the imaging software. Assay of Fibronectin Matrix Assembly—The assembly of high molecular weight fibronectin multimers was determined by a previously described method (17Robinson E.E. Foty R.A. Corbett S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell aggregates were lysed in DOC lysis buffer (2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm iodoacetic acid, and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide), passed through a 26-gauge needle, and the DOC-soluble components and DOC-insoluble components were separated. DOC-insoluble components were solubilized using SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm iodoacetic acid, and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide). Reduced lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with an anti-fibronectin antibody. Under reducing conditions, high molecular mass fibronectin multimers resolve at 220 kDa. Anoikis Assay—Cells (5 × 105 cells/2 ml/well) were plated onto standard 6-well tissue culture plates or poly-HEMA-coated plates (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) to prohibit attachment (18Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). After a 24- or 48-h incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, 95% air, the viability of cells was measured using trypan blue exclusion on a ViCell cell viability analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Apoptosis was measured by the TUNEL assay and Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3. In the TUNEL assay, APO-BRDU™ kit (BioSource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA) was used to label and stain cells according to manufacturer's protocol, and the samples were analyzed on a FC500 Beckman-Coulter flow cytometer. Active caspase-3, which is present in cells undergoing apoptosis, was detected by Western blot using polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody that recognizes the cleaved, active caspase-3. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared in TNT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was performed by the method of Towbin et al. (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated in blocking solution consisting of 5% milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h and then immunoblotted with the respective antibodies. Detection by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (ECL) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Generation and Characterization of EMMPRIN-targeted siRNA or shRNA Transfectants—To assess the role of EMMPRIN in protecting cells from detachment-induced programmed cell death or anoikis, we utilized human breast cancer cell lines with different levels of EMMPRIN expression modulated by methods of overexpression, antisense, or RNA interference. EMMPRIN transfectants and antisense-transfected cells were described previously (6Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Rollo E.E. Mann R. Conner C.E. Cao J. Foda H.D. Tompkins D.C. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1921-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 15Tang Y. Kesavan P. Nakada M.T. Yan L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells treated with siRNA showed a 80-90% reduction in EMMPRIN expression 72 h after transfection, as compared with the cells transfected with a non-targeting RNA (Fig. 1A). We also constructed a vector that expressed an EMMPRIN-targeted shRNA and isolated stable transfected clones. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, in shRNA-expressing MDA-MB-231 cell line, EMMPRIN expression was decreased by greater than 80%, as determined by Western blot and flow cytometry. Effect of EMMPRIN on Cell Aggregate Formation—We evaluated the effect of EMMPRIN on formation of cellular aggregates, the type of intercellular contacts known to affect sensitivity to anoikis (20Zhang Y. Lu H. Dazin P. Kapila Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48342-48349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Valentinis B. Reiss K. Baserga R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 648-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In hanging drop cultures, we observed that breast carcinoma cells expressing different amounts of EMMPRIN formed multicellular aggregates with different degrees of compaction and size of surface areas (Fig. 2, A and B). Aggregates of cells with higher levels of EMMPRIN (parental or control vector-transfected MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells) had larger surface areas than those of the cells with lower levels of the protein (antisense- or shRNA-transfected cells) (Fig. 2B). Aggregates with larger surface areas contained more viable cells than those with smaller surface areas (Fig. 2C). These results imply a correlation between EMMPRIN expression, aggregate compaction, and cell survival. It was previously reported that cells cultured in “hanging drops” assembled a fibronectin matrix to support aggregate compaction (17Robinson E.E. Foty R.A. Corbett S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism of EMMPRIN-induced alterations of aggregate compaction, we assessed the effect of EMMPRIN expression on the assembly of fibronectin multimers by measuring insoluble fibronectin using a differential solubilization/Western blot analysis. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, high molecular weight, insoluble fibronectin increased in hanging drop aggregates of cells with silenced EMMPRIN expression. These cells also formed more compact aggregates as compared with the controls that expressed high level of EMMPRIN and formed less compact aggregates. These results indicate that EMMPRIN might affect aggregate compaction by regulating assembly of a fibronectin matrix.FIGURE 3Knockdown of EMMPRIN expression increases fibronectin matrix assembly. Cells were cultured in “hanging drops” as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Aggregates were then harvested, and the assembly of high molecular weight fibronectin multimers (insoluble fibronectin) was assayed as using differential solubilization/Western blot analysis, as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, Western blot analysis of insoluble fibronectin. B, quantification of insoluble fibronectin triplicate bands from two similar experiments using NIH Image J software. *, p = 0.015 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of EMMPRIN on Cell Viability in the Absence of Attachment— To ascertain whether EMMPRIN affects survival of carcinoma cells in the absence of matrix attachment, we determined the effect of EMMPRIN expression on the viability of breast cancer cells grown as monolayers attached to plastic or grown in suspension on poly-HEMA. Fig. 4 shows that knockdown of EMMPRIN expression by siRNA or shRNA decreased viability of cells cultured in suspension as compared with scrambled RNA or control vector-transfected controls (Fig. 4, D and E), but had little effect on the viability of cells grown attached to a matrix (Fig. 4, A and B). Because the breast cancer cells have a high basal level of EMMPRIN expression, transfection of EMMPRIN into these cells had no further effect on their viability (Fig. 4, C and F). These results demonstrate that expression of EMMPRIN favors survival of breast cancer cells in the absence of attachment. Expression of EMMPRIN Confers Resistance to Anoikis—To determine whether the survival-promoting function of EMMPRIN was through inhibition of anoikis, we compared the apoptotic properties of cell lines expressing different amounts of EMMPRIN. We found that the expression of EMMPRIN indeed decreased susceptibility of breast cancer cells to detachment-induced apoptosis as measured by caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, knockdown of EMMPRIN by either siRNA or shRNA resulted in activation of caspase-3 in MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in suspension on poly-HEMA but had no detectable effect on cells grown as monolayers attached to plastic. In contrast, when EMMPRIN was overexpressed by transfection, cleaved caspase-3 was barely detected when cells were cultured in suspension (Fig. 5C). The TUNEL assay also demonstrated that when cultured in suspension on poly-HEMA, there was a marked increase in DNA fragmentation in cells expressing EMMPRIN-targeted shRNA, as compared with parental or control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5D). Similar to the results shown in Fig. 5, A and B, silencing of EMMPRIN expression did not cause apoptosis in the cells grown attached (Fig. 5D). These results indicate a specific role for EMMPRIN in inhibiting anoikis, the onset of apoptosis caused by loss of matrix attachment. Down-regulation of Bim Mediates Resistance to Anoikis Conferred by EMMPRIN—We next explored the mechanism(s) involved in anoikis resistance provided by EMMPRIN. Toole and co-workers (13Misra S. Ghatak S. Zoltan-Jones A. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25285-25288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 14Marieb E.A. Zoltan-Jones A. Li R. Misra S. Ghatak S. Cao J. Zucker S. Toole B.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have shown that the MAP kinase (ERK1/2) pathway can be stimulated by EMMPRIN. Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein that plays a crucial role in regulating anoikis (22Reginato M.J. Mills K.R. Paulus J.K. Lynch D.K. Sgroi D.C. Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), is phosphorylated by ERK1/2, and phosphorylation of Bim leads to its proteasomal degradation (23Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether resistance to anoikis in EMMPRIN-expressing breast carcinoma cells was associated with Bim down-regulation. We first compared the level of Bim in cells expressing different levels of EMMPRIN. As shown in Fig. 6A, Bim (Bim-EL, Bim-L, and Bim-S) levels were reduced, whereas phospho-ERK1/2 levels were increased, in EMMPRIN-transfected MDA-MB-436 cells grown as attached or suspended cultures, in comparison with the cells transfected with a control vector. In contrast, silencing of EMMPRIN expression led to an increase in accumulation of Bim and a decrease in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 6B). To directly assess the role of Bim in resistance to anoikis induced by EMMPRIN, we used siRNA to repress the expression of Bim in cells whose EMMPRIN was silenced (Fig. 7A). Knockdown of Bim decreased the ability of cells with depleted EMMPRIN expression to undergo detachment-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7B) and increased cell viability when cultured in suspension on poly-HEMA but did not affect cells grown attached to plastic (Fig. 7C).FIGURE 7Bim-siRNA decreases anoikis and increases viability in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing EMMPRIN-shRNA. A, MDA-MB-231/EMMPRIN-shRNA or empty vector control cells were transfected with a Bim siRNA (100 nm) or scrambled RNA. Forty-eight h later, cell lysates were prepared from the transfected cells, and equal amounts (50 μg) of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and Bim was detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-Bim antibody. β-Actin was used as a loading control. B, MDA-MB-231/EMMPRIN-shRNA or empty vector control cells were transfected with Bim siRNA (100 nm) or a scrambled RNA for 24 h, then plated onto standard 6-well tissue culture plates or poly-HEMA-coated plates and incubated for another 24 h. Apoptosis was measured by DNA fragmentation using TUNEL assay. FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. C, MDA-MB-231/EMMPRIN-shRNA or empty vector control cells transfected with Bim-siRNA were plated on poly-HEMA-coated plates and incubated for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. Results are representative of two similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MAP Kinase or Proteasome Inhibition Increases Bim Accumulation and Sensitivity to Anoikis—If EMMPRIN down-regulated Bim through the MAP kinase pathway, we reasoned that U0126, a selective MEK inhibitor, should block the effect. Fig. 8 shows that treatment of EMMPRIN transfectants grown in suspension with U0126 (50 μm) resulted in an increase in the accumulation of Bim proteins (Bim-EL, Bim-L, and Bim-S) in control cells and EMMPRIN transfectants. To corroborate that down-regulation of Bim in EMMPRIN-expressing cells was because of proteasomal degradation, we next treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor, epoxomicin. Fig. 8 shows that treatment of EMMPRIN transfectants grown in suspension with epoxomicin (100 nm) also increased Bim accumulation. Furthermore, the elevation of Bim by U0126 or epoxomicin was accompanied by an increased sensitivity to anoikis in control cells and EMMPRIN transfectants, as manifested by increased amounts of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 8). EMMPRIN is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is abundant in various types of tumors and known to possess multiple functions, such as stimulating matrix metalloproteinase production (2Toole B.P. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), regulating calcium movement (4Jiang J.L. Zhou Q. Yu M.K. Ho L.S. Chen Z.N. Chan H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46870-46877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), inducing the expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (24Tang Y. Nakada M.T. Kesavan P. McCabe F. Millar H. Rafferty P. Bugelski P. Yan L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), mediating cyclophilin activity (5Yurchenko V. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Guo H. Toole B. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 786-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and modulating the expression of lactate transporters (3Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The pathophysiological roles associated with those functions have also been reported. For example, overexpression of EMMPRIN was shown to promote tumorigenicity, invasion, and metastasis of malignant cells (6Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Rollo E.E. Mann R. Conner C.E. Cao J. Foda H.D. Tompkins D.C. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1921-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Recently, EMMPRIN was found to enhance tumor angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (24Tang Y. Nakada M.T. Kesavan P. McCabe F. Millar H. Rafferty P. Bugelski P. Yan L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we report a mechanism by which EMMPRIN provides resistance of cancer cells to anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by loss of matrix or cellular attachment and often defective in tumor cells that are of epithelial origin. We demonstrate in human breast cancer cells that expression of EMMPRIN diminishes anoikis (Figs. 5, 7, and 8), thereby increasing cell viability when anchorage is lost (Figs. 2 and 4). In addition, we show that the effect of EMMPRIN appears to result from MAP kinase-mediated down-regulation of a BH3-only proapoptotic protein, Bim (Figs. 6, 7, 8). Early evidence for a role of EMMPRIN in promoting tumor cell growth and invasion and metastasis was provided by Zucker et al. (6Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Rollo E.E. Mann R. Conner C.E. Cao J. Foda H.D. Tompkins D.C. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1921-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) through the use of EMMPRIN-transfected human breast cancer cells. These oncogenic and metastatic activities could be attributed to the recently demonstrated effects of EMMPRIN on hyaluronan and vascular endothelial growth factor production as well as its induction of matrix metalloproteinases (13Misra S. Ghatak S. Zoltan-Jones A. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25285-25288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 14Marieb E.A. Zoltan-Jones A. Li R. Misra S. Ghatak S. Cao J. Zucker S. Toole B.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Tang Y. Nakada M.T. Kesavan P. McCabe F. Millar H. Rafferty P. Bugelski P. Yan L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we show that expression of EMMPRIN in cancer cells not only alters cell-cell interaction by modulating the assembly of fibronectin multimers (Figs. 2 and 3) but also blocks anoikis (Figs. 4 and 5). In the absence of anchorage, breast cancer cells expressing higher levels of EMMPRIN form multicellular aggregates with larger surface areas (Fig. 2), have higher viability (Fig. 4) and lower rates of apoptosis (Fig. 5), whereas knockdown of EMMPRIN expression produces the opposite effects (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). These data indicate that EMMPRIN may promote cancer cell survival by regulating intercellular contacts and inhibiting anoikis. The more pronounced effect of EMMPRIN knockdown on detachment-induced apoptosis measured by TUNEL assay of DNA fragments compared with caspase-3 activation likely reflects the fact that activation of caspase-3 is transient and that the cleaved product is turned over during apoptosis, whereas apoptotic cells with fragmented DNA persist for longer periods of time (25Zhivotovsky B. Essays Biochem. 2003; 39: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Nagata S. Nagase H. Kawane K. Mukae N. Fukuyama H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Tumor cells forming multicellular aggregates in suspension culture on poly-HEMA were reported to become more resistant to anoikis than single cells (20Zhang Y. Lu H. Dazin P. Kapila Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48342-48349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the surface area of hanging drop cellular aggregates is a phenotypic marker of cancer cells that are relatively resistant to anoikis, as cells that form larger and less compact aggregates are more resistant to anoikis than cells that form smaller and more compact aggregates. In addition, we demonstrate that larger, less compact aggregates in hanging drop cultures have decreased assembly of a fibronectin matrix than smaller, more compact aggregates (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with previous work that found that fibronectin matrix assembly correlates with aggregate compaction and cohesion (17Robinson E.E. Foty R.A. Corbett S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Decreased ERK phosphorylation has previously been shown to result in increased fibronectin matrix assembly (27Brenner K.A. Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3156-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We also found that the silencing of EMMPRIN decreases ERK activity (Fig. 6B), consistent with the observed effects on fibronectin assembly. Recently, EMMPRIN has been reported to promote cytoskeletal rearrangements and affect cellular architecture in insect cells, and these effects are metalloproteinase-independent (28Curtin K.D. Meinertzhagen I.A. Wyman R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2649-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). EMMPRIN can stimulate several survival pathways through action of hyaluronan. These pathways include AKT, focal adhesion kinase, and ERK (13Misra S. Ghatak S. Zoltan-Jones A. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25285-25288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 14Marieb E.A. Zoltan-Jones A. Li R. Misra S. Ghatak S. Cao J. Zucker S. Toole B.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In this study we identified Bim as a downstream effector of the EMMPRIN-MAP kinase pathway in suppressing anoikis. Bim, a BH3-only proapoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family, plays a critical role in triggering anoikis. For example, inhibition of Bim induction has been found to be the mechanism of anoikis deficiency caused by G1/S cell cycle arrest (29Collins N.L. Reginato M.J. Paulus J.K. Sgroi D.C. Labaer J. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5282-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, Bim has also been shown to be a tumor suppressor and a key determinant of paclitaxel sensitivity in epithelial tumors (30Tan T.T. Degenhardt K. Nelson D.A. Beaudoin B. Nieves-Neira W. Bouillet P. Villunger A. Adams J.M. White E. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate a converse relationship between EMMPRIN expression and Bim accumulation, i.e. Bim is reduced in cells with high expression of EMMPRIN and suppression of EMMPRIN up-regulates Bim (Fig. 6). Our results also provide more direct evidence for a role for Bim in EMMPRIN-induced resistance to anoikis, as knockdown of Bim expression decreases detachment-triggered apoptosis and increases viability in cells whose expression of EMMPRIN is silenced by shRNA (Fig. 7). Bim is known to be phosphorylated by MAP kinase (ERK1/2), and phosphorylation of Bim results in its proteasomal degradation (23Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Indeed, our results show that the activity of ERK1/2 in EMMPRIN-overexpressing cells is increased (Fig. 5), suggesting that the inhibition of Bim accumulation by EMMPRIN is because of phosphorylation of Bim by the MAP kinase pathway and degradation of the protein by the proteasome. This hypothesis is further supported by the use of a MEK inhibitor (U0126) and a proteasome inhibitor (epoxomicin), both of which can elevate Bim levels and enhance anoikis in EMMPRIN-expressing cells (Fig. 8). The decreases in phospho-ERK1/2 in cells treated with epoxomicin (Fig. 8) is likely because of the induction of MAP kinase phosphatases by the proteasome inhibitor, as previously observed by others (31Orlowski R.Z. Small G.W. Shi Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27864-27871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Small G.W. Shi Y.Y. Edmund N.A. Somasundaram S. Moore D.T. Orlowski R.Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1478-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the down-regulation of Bim may account for anoikis resistance seen in EMMPRIN-expressing cells. How EMMPRIN stimulates the MAP kinase pathway remains an area of active investigation. The acquisition of resistance to anoikis is thought to be a crucial step in neoplastic or metastatic transformation (33Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 34Douma S. Van Laar T. Zevenhoven J. Meuwissen R. Van Garderen E. Peeper D.S. Nature. 2004; 430: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in anoikis resistance are not well understood. Recently, alterations of death receptors, Src, laminins, and phosphoinositide-3 kinase signaling have been implicated (33Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 35Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 36Wei L. Yang Y. Zhang X.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4710-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The present study, which identified EMMPRIN as a suppressor of anoikis, reveals a new pathway to regulate anoikis (Fig. 9). Whether the EMMPRIN-initiated pathway is impinged upon by other signaling pathways requires further investigation. Because the ability of tumor cells to invade/metastasize and to develop resistance to treatment represents two critically important malignant characteristics, and defective anoikis likely contributes to both of these features, re-establishing anoikis sensitivity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for cancers. The findings by us and others (14Marieb E.A. Zoltan-Jones A. Li R. Misra S. Ghatak S. Cao J. Zucker S. Toole B.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) that EMMPRIN acts as an anoikis suppressor provides further evidence that this protein may be a novel target for cancer therapy.

Stanley Zucker and Jian Cao (Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Northport, NY) for the generous gifts of EMMPRIN-transfected MDA-MB-436 cells and Dr. Eileen White for helpful discussions."

We have found that mitogenic stimuli, including treatment with phorbol myristate (PMA), increase LRH-1 transactivation. This response maps to the hinge and ligand binding domains of LRH-1 and is blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126.

LRH-1 is closely related to the orphan receptor SF-1, which also binds DNA as a monomer and has important functions in the development and differentiation of steroidogenic tissues and in steroidogenesis and sexual determination (15Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 145: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). LRH-1 and SF-1 have more than 95% amino acid sequence identity in their DNA binding domains and recognize the same DNA sequences. These and other NR5A subfamily members contain a distinctive 26-amino acid motif, called the Fushi Tarazu-Factor1 domain, which is located just C-terminal to the conserved zinc finger DNA binding domain and contacts the upstream motif in the binding site (16Ueda H. Sun G.C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Nuclear hormone receptors are typically ligand-dependent transcription factors. The ligand binding domain adopts a three-layer α-helical structure and upon ligand binding the C-terminal helix 12 is held in close proximity to the ligand binding pocket, forming a surface recognized by transcriptional coactivators (17Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 18Darimont B.D.

An initial crystal structure of the mouse LRH-1 ligand binding domain revealed that, unlike most other superfamily members, the LBD can form a stable active monomeric structure in the absence of ligand, coactivator peptide, or heterodimeric receptor partner, suggesting that LRH-1 may function as a constitutive activator (19Sablin E.P.

In contrast, several groups have recently shown by x-ray crystallography that the ligand binding pocket of bacterially expressed human LRH-1 is occupied by distinct phospholipids, including phosphatidlyethanolamine (20Ortlund E.A.

However, the functional roles of phosphoinositides and other potential phospholipid ligands as physiologic modulators of LRH-1 or SF-1 transactivation remain to be elucidated. LRH-1 is an important regulator of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene expression (7Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CYP7A1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and is a key target for the negative feedback regulatory effects of bile acids on their own synthesis (25Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 26Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 27Chiang J.Y. J.

LRH-1 also regulates expression of other genes involved in cholesterol and bile acids homeostasis, such as cholesterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), mouse apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), and human apolipoprotein AI, indicating that LRH-1 is an important regulator of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism (8del Castillo-Olivares A.

Several other physiological potential roles of LRH-1 have been suggested in recent studies. These include regulation of estrogen production by activation of aromatase gene expression (11Clyne C.D.

Unfortunately, the analysis of LRH-1 function using the knock-out approach, which has been so successful for other nuclear receptors, is precluded by the fact that homozygous loss of LRH-1 function results in very early embryonic lethality (13Botrugno O.A.

This highlights the importance of alternative strategies to identify potential functional roles of this orphan and the pathways that may modulate them. We have examined the potential impact of mitogenic stimuli on LRH-1 transactivation. We find that that LRH-1 hinge and ligand binding domains are sufficient to confer strong stimulatory effects of phorbol esters on LRH-1 transactivation in HeLa cells. ERK phosphorylates LRH-1 at at least two hinge domain serine residues, Ser-238 and Ser-243. Surprisingly, these phosphorylation sites do not correspond to the stimulatory site identified previously in SF-1 (33Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Mutation of both LRH-1 residues to alanine largely eliminates PMA-dependent phosphorylation of LRH-1 in cells and decreases PMA-dependent transactivation, while mutations to positively charged aspartate residues that mimic phosphorylation increase basal activity. These results identify a novel response of LRH-1 to proliferative signals that could contribute to its reported stimulatory effects on cell cycle. Materials and Plasmids—The reagents were obtained from the following sources: mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, PD 98059, and SB 202190 were from CalBiochem; SP 600125 was a kind gift from Dr. Karin at University of California, San Diego; PMA, anti-FLAG antibody (M2), anti-FLAG M2-agarose were from Sigma; rhEGF and rhTNFα were from R&D systems; and U0126 was from Promega. CDM8His-Flag-hLRH-1 was created by PCR amplification of hLRH-1-(1–541) insert in pCI vector (from Dr. Belanger). All deletion and point mutation constructs were created using a PCR-based method. pCMX hLXRα and a luciferase reporter containing a 3.6-kb rat Cyp7A promoter (rat Cyp7Aluc) were kind gifts from Dr. J. Chiang of Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine. Transient Transfection—HeLa and HepG2 cells were used for transfection assays. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate-mediated method as described (34Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2463-2467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were plated into 24-well plates with a 1:4 ratio 1 day before transfection. Approximately 16 h after transfection, cells were replenished with fresh DMEM and, if needed, treated with PMA or EGF. For treatment of MAPK inhibitors, these inhibitors were added 30 min before PMA or EGF treatment. Cells were harvested after 24-h incubation for luciferase assays. Actin-β-galactosidase plasmids or TKGH were cotransfected for transfection normalization by quantitation of β-galactosidase or GH activities as described previously. Metabolic Labeling—HeLa cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 8 μg of CDM8flag-hLRH-1 or CDM8flag-mSHP plasmids using calcium phosphate method. After overnight incubation, media were replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1 or 10% FBS as indicated. 24 h later, cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM and replenished with 1 ml of serum-free DMEM for cells maintained in 1% FBS or DMEM containing 1% dialyzed FBS for cells maintained in 10% FBS. After 1-h incubation, cells were labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. PMA induction was performed during the last 1 h of the labeling. For HepG2 cells, cells were transfected with 10 μg of CDM8flag-hLRH-1 plasmids and maintained with DMEM containing 10% FBS. During the labeling with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h 20 min, one plate was treated with 20 μm U0126 simultaneously to inhibit MAPK activity as indicated in Fig. 6B. PMA induction was performed during the last 20 min of the labeling. Then, cells were lysed in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and proteinase inhibitors). The cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG-conjugated protein G-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, and the bound proteins were subjected to Western analysis using anti-FLAG antibodies. The same membrane was subjected to autoradiography to detect phosphorylated proteins. In Vitro Phosphorylation—Bacterially expressed GST fusions were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Corp.). Bead-bound GST fusions were incubated with 0.5 μl of ERK2 (New England Biolabs) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 μl of the manufacturer's buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Stimulation of LRH-1 Transcriptional Activity by PMA and EGF—CYP7A1 encodes the first and rate-limiting step of the classical pathway in bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol, and its expression is tightly controlled by several nuclear hormone receptors including LRH-1 (25Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 26Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 27Chiang J.Y. J. Hepatol. 2004; 40: 539-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors and AP-1 often show mutually antagonistic interactions, and a reported inhibitory effect of PMA on CYP7A1 promoter activity was mapped to a potential AP-1 site in the rat promoter (36Crestani M. Sadeghpour A. Stroup D. Galli G. Chiang J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that overlaps with a potential LRH-1 binding site. Thus, the role of LRH-1 and other nuclear receptors in responses to PMA and other stimuli was examined in transient transfections of HeLa cells. In agreement with the previous conclusion that LRH-1 functions in this context as a competence factor to promote responses to LXR and other factors (23Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), cotransfection with LRH-1 alone had no effect on CYP7A1 promoter activity (Fig. 1A). Also consistent with previous results, LXRα had a negative effect on promoter activity in the absence of oxysterols (37Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar), and TNFα repressed promoter activity regardless of coexpressed LXR or LRH-1 (38Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast to earlier studies, however, PMA strongly stimulated CYP7A1 promoter activity in an LRH-1-dependent manner. To examine the role of LRH-1 in this response, a reporter construct containing five SF-1/LRH-1 binding sites (CAAAGGTCA) from the basal 21-hydroxylase promoter (40Wilson T.E. Mouw A.R. Weaver C.A. Milbrandt J. Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), was used (34Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2463-2467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Consistent with our earlier results, this construct was modestly activated by LRH-1 alone. Much more dramatically and in agreement with the CYP7A1 promoter results, it was strongly stimulated by PMA in the presence of LRH-1 (Fig. 1B). This effect was largely dependent on LRH-1 cotransfection, although PMA alone had a modest stimulatory effect in some experiments (data not shown). EGF alone had a more modest positive effect on LRH-1 transactivation. Transactivation directed by a fusion of the LRH-1 hinge and ligand binding domain (amino acids 185–541) to the heterologous Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-LRH-1(L)) was also stimulated upon PMA treatment (Fig. 1C). Thus, LRH-1 residues C-terminal to 184 are sufficient to confer PMA responsiveness in the absence of CYP7A1 promoter-specific factors or the LRH-1 N terminus and DNA binding domain. PMA is a well known protein kinase C activator that strongly stimulates the MAPK pathway (41Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 42Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar), which includes ERK, JNK, and p38 kinases (43Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Thus, several specific kinase inhibitors were used to examine the roles of these MAPKs in the PMA stimulation of LRH-1 activity. HeLa cells were transfected with the SF-1luc reporter and hLRH-1 expression vector and were treated with various MAPK inhibitors 30 min prior to PMA treatment. SP60012, a specific inhibitor for JNK, failed to block PMA stimulation, the p38-specific inhibitor SB202190 modestly decreased PMA stimulation, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 had a stronger effect (Fig. 2A). This was confirmed with the potent MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, which completely blocked PMA- and EGF-mediated stimulation of LRH-1 activity (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the ERK pathway mediates the stimulation of LRH-1 transcriptional activity by PMA or EGF in HeLa cells. LRH-1 Is a Phosphoprotein in Vivo and in Vitro—Thus far, it is clear that transcriptional activity of LRH-1 is up-regulated by kinase signaling pathways, but it is unclear whether this is associated with direct LRH-1 phosphorylation. To determine whether mitogenic signals affect LRH-1 phosphorylation, HeLa cells expressing epitope-tagged LRH-1, or SHP for comparison, were in vivo labeled using [32P]orthophosphate in the presence or absence of PMA. Immunoprecipitation and autoradiography revealed that both receptors are phosphoproteins and that LRH-1 phosphorylation was markedly increased by 1 h of PMA treatment (Fig. 3). The ability of the specific MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 to block the stimulation of LRH-1 activity by PMA is consistent with the fact that many previously identified nuclear receptor phosphorylation sites are targeted by MAPKs and also the more specific observation that ERK phosphorylation of serine 203 of SF-1, the closest relative of LRH-1, potently activates its transactivation (33Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the ability of purified ERK to phosphorylate LRH-1 in vitro. Several fragments of LRH-1 fused to GST depicted in Fig. 4A were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were incubated with purified ERK2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or autoradiography. As expected, the full-length LRH-1 GST fusion (F) was phosphorylated by ERK (Fig. 4B, lane 5). Among the fragments tested, only Δ2 and the hinge plus ligand binding domain (L) were efficiently labeled (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 6), indicating that ERK phosphorylation sites reside between residues 185 and 386. Role of Serines 238 and 243 in ERK Phosphorylation and PMA Stimulation—Inspection of this region identified four proline-directed serine residues, i.e. potential MAPK phosphorylation sites, at positions 238, 243, 280, and 297. Since fragment Δ2 contains only three of these four residues, mutations were introduced into the slightly larger GST-LRH-1 Δ3 fragment. Individual S238A and S243A mutants showed reduced ERK phosphorylation, and mutation of both residues completely abolished in vitro labeling (Fig. 5A, upper panels). This result was somewhat surprising, since Ser-280 corresponds much more closely to the SF-1 ERK target Ser-203 (33Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). The role of the two more proximal sites was more critically tested by introducing the same mutations individually or together into the full-length GST-LRH-1. As observed with the Δ3 fragment, each single mutation strongly decreased phosphorylation, and it was abolished by the double mutation (Fig. 5A, lower panels).FIGURE 7ERK phosphorylation sites of LRH-1 are conserved among different species but not conserved with SF-1.

By comparison to the PMA stimulated labeling of full-length wild type LRH-1 in HeLa cells, labeling of the S238A, S243A double mutant was markedly reduced (Fig. 5B). Thus, these sites are required for the majority of the PMA-dependent phosphorylation of LRH-1 in these cells. These results clearly predict that the S238A and S243A mutations should inhibit PMA stimulation of LRH-1 transactivation, while complementary phospho-mimic mutations to negatively charged aspartate residues should increase basal transactivation. Thus, wild type LRH-1 and S238A, S243A and S238D, S243D double mutants were transfected into HeLa cells. To minimize any effect of growth factors present in serum, transfected cells were maintained in serum-free medium with or without PMA treatment. As expected, the PMA response of the S238A, S243A double mutant was significantly decreased relative to wild type LRH-1, while the basal activity of the S238D, S243D double mutant was increased (Fig. 5, C and D). The introduction of an Ser to Ala mutation at residue 280 of LRH-1 failed to change any transcriptional activity (data not shown). In the context of the Gal4-LRH-1 hinge and ligand binding domain fusion, the Ser to Ala double mutant had a more dramatic negative effect on transactivation, while the effect of the Ser to Asp double mutant was more modest (Fig. 5E). Serines 238 and 243 Are Functional in ERK Phosphorylation and PMA Stimulation in a Human Liver Cell Line, HepG2—Since liver is a primary site for LRH-1 function, we tested the PMA inducibility of LRH-1 transcriptional activity in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. As in HeLa cells, LRH-1 activity was increased by PMA treatment, and this response was not affected by the JNK inhibitor SP60012 but was greatly hampered by pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 6A). To test the phosphorylation of the Ser-238 and Ser-243 residues in HepG2 cells, metabolic labeling was performed with FLAG-tagged wild type and S238A, S243A double mutant LRH-1 plasmids. As observed in HeLa cells, LRH-1 phosphorylation was strongly increased in response to PMA treatment, and this was blocked by both pretreatment with U0126 and the double S238A, S243A mutation (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the modulation of LRH-1 transactivation by PMA is regulated through similar pathways in the HeLa and HepG2 cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that the Ser-238 and Ser-243 residues of the LRH-1 hinge are required for effective in vitro phosphorylation by ERK and also for PMA-dependent in vivo phosphorylation. Preventing Ser-238 and Ser-243 phosphorylation blunts but does not eliminate the stimulatory effect of PMA on LRH-1 transactivation, while the S238D, S243D double phosphomimic mutant shows an ∼2 fold increase in transactivation that is comparable to phosphorylation dependent effects on other receptors. For example, ERα transactivation is increased 1.8 fold by overexpression of Ras in COS cells (44Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar), and the S305E mutant of ERα exhibits only 30% higher transactivation in a human breast cancer cell line (45Balasenthil S. Barnes C.J. Rayala S.K. Kumar R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We conclude that PMA dependent direct phosphorylation at these two positions stimulates LRH-1 transactivation in, at least, HeLa and HepG2 cells. The functional role of this hinge region is strongly supported by a recent report that the segment between 186 and 219 in a human LRH-1 isoform, which corresponds to 236–265 of in the full-length human LRH-1 numbering used here, contains an additional activation function of LRH-1 (46Xu P.L. Liu Y.Q. Shan S.F. Kong Y.Y. Zhou Q. Li M. Ding J.P. Xie Y.H. Wang Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1887-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the contrast between the residual PMA responsiveness of the S238A, S243A double mutant and the complete blockade by U0126 indicates that additional targets of the ERK pathway contribute to the increased transactivation. The relatively modest residual in vivo phosphorylation of the S238A, S243A double mutant (Fig. 5B) suggests that additional LRH-1 sites could be involved in HeLa cells. However, recent results emphasize the potential role of phosphorylation of other targets, particularly the p160 coactivators that can be activated by ERK and other pathways (47Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 48Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 15: 937-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that cofactor activation could also contribute to the stimulation of LRH-1 transcriptional activity. The results with LRH-1 are also generally consistent with the characterization of a similar phosphorylation-dependent activation of its close relative, SF-1. Surprisingly, however, the specific phosphorylation targets differ in the two receptors. The human LRH-1 sites identified here are not found in SF-1 (Fig. 7A) but are conserved in rodent LRH-1 sequences (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the region surrounding LRH-1 Ser-280 is conserved in SF-1, but this LRH-1 residue does not align the phosphorylated serine in SF-1 but with the adjacent proline (Fig. 7B). The discrepancy in hinge phosphorylation targets in the two receptors is not due to different cell contexts, since both were studied in HeLa cells, which are commonly used to characterize such signaling responses. However, it remains possible that additional pathways targeting LRH-1 Ser-280 or other potential sites will be identified in other contexts. The current results identify a PMA-dependent pathway for stimulation of LRH-1 transactivation and raise the important question of the impact of this pathway on normal LRH-1 function, including its role in the intriguing potential responses to phospholipid or other ligands. Since ERK activation is generally a proliferative stimulus, it is an attractive possibility that phosphorylation of Ser-238 and Ser-243 may support the proposed role of LRH-1 as a proliferative factor (13Botrugno O.A. Fayard E. Annicotte J.S. Haby C. Brennan T. Wendling O. Tanaka T. Kodama T. Thomas W. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It will be necessary to develop appropriate phospho-specific antisera to test the prediction that mitogenic stimuli increase Ser-238 and Ser-243 phosphorylation in vivo. In contrast, activation of stress-activated protein kinase pathways is associated with inhibitory effects on the hepatic LRH-1 target CYP7A1 (52Stroup D. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1678-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study indicates that the p38 MAPK pathway is involved in LRH-1 protein expression in rat ovarian granulosa cells (3Yu F.Q. Han C.S. Yang W. Jin X. Hu Z.Y. Liu Y.X. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 186: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to test whether p38 or other stress-activated kinases directly target the LRH-1 protein for phosphorylation or regulates LRH-1 expression or activity at other levels. As with other nuclear receptors, the impact of diverse signaling pathways on LRH-1 function is likely to be complex. The results described here provide both a firm rationale for such studies of LRH-1 and a good starting point for further exploration."

Here, we report for the first time a complete solution thermodynamic study using isothermal titration calorimetry supported by spectroscopic studies to elucidate the conformational flexibility of CYP2B4 in binding imidazole inhibitors with different ring chemistry and side chains: 4-CPI, 1-benzylimidazole (1-BI), 1-CPI, 4-phenylimidazole (4-PI), 1-(2-(benzyloxy)ethyl)imidazole (BEI), and 1-PI. Each of the inhibitors induced type II spectral changes, and IC50 values for enzyme inhibition ranged from 0.1 to 2.4 μm, following the order 1-BI < 4-CPI < 1-CPI < 4-PI < BEI < 1-PI. Calorimetric titrations using monomeric enzyme yielded a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, with the associated KD values ranging from 0.3 to 4.8 μm and following the same rank order as the IC50 values. Changes in enthalpy at 25 °C ranged from -6.5 to -8.8 kcal mol-1.

Cytochromes P450 are a superfamily of enzymes with cysteine thiolate ligation of the catalytic heme center and perform regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous organic molecules (1Coon M.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). An appreciable number of P450 crystal structures of both bacterial and mammalian origins are now available and show a conserved fold among enzymes with greatly varying primary structures (2Poulos T.L.

A major challenge has been to understand the ability of these proteins to accommodate ligands of varied size and shape. In addition, since the first P450 crystal structure was determined, scientists have continued to struggle to explain how substrates gain access to the deeply buried active site (2Poulos T.L.

Molecular modeling and simulation studies emerging from the crystal structures have also demonstrated the flexibility of the substrate access channels (9Winn P.J. Ludemann S.K. Gauges R. Lounnas V.

The largest conformational rearrangement observed to date occurs in mammalian CYP2B4; the wide open binding pocket (Protein Data Bank code 1PO5) undergoes a dramatic change to tether around 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole (4-CPI 2The abbreviations used are: 4-CPI, 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; 1-BI, 1-benzylimidazole; 1-CPI, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole; 4-PI, 4-phenylimidazole; 1-PI, 1-phenylimidazole; BEI, 1-(2-(benzyloxy)ethyl)imidazole. 2The abbreviations used are: 4-CPI, 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; 1-BI, 1-benzylimidazole; 1-CPI, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole; 4-PI, 4-phenylimidazole; 1-PI, 1-phenylimidazole; BEI, 1-(2-(benzyloxy)ethyl)imidazole.; code 1SUO), one of the smallest ligands to be characterized in a P450 active site (12Scott E.E.

The spatial orientation of the dynamic structural elements between these two forms is depicted in Fig. 1. The major structural changes are limited to the lid domain of helices F and G; helices I, C, and B′; and the β1-4 region, with little rearrangement at the secondary structural level. These changes are consistent with similar but smaller changes observed for bacterial P450 BM3 (14Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and thermophilic CYP119 (5Yano J.K. Koo L.S. Schuller D.J. Li H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol.

The significant movement of helix C may be the structural mechanism for coordination of redox partner and substrate binding, as charge pairing between helix C and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase or cytochrome b5 is thought to be the driving force for this interaction (12Scott E.E.

Although such an open/closed mechanism may explain the entry of diverse substrates, it cannot explain enzyme specificity. Interestingly, significant conformational changes in the region of helices F and G and the B′-C loop have also been shown to contribute to substrate recognition and binding in CYP2C5 (7Wester M.R.

Here, changes in the hydration network of the active site were shown to be a decisive factor in binding ligands of different size in an adaptive fit manner. In the case of CYP2B enzymes, a wealth of site-directed mutagenesis data is available to provide insight into the structural basis of regio- and stereospecific oxidation of various substrates (16Scott E.E. He Y.Q. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Spatzenegger M. Wang Q. He Y.Q. Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Halpert J.R. Mol.

Many of the active-site residues inferred from these studies are in the 4-CPI-binding site in the closed conformation of the enzyme. Sequentially, there may be additional structural rearrangement in the active site and the substrate access channel before the open structure adopts the closed conformation. Interestingly, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 structures show no such major structural changes upon ligand binding and may need larger ligands near the heme pocket for such changes to be manifested (15Wester M.R.

Because the crystal structures reveal one snapshot of a minimum energy conformation, they may be influenced significantly by the crystallization conditions, and ligand-induced conformational changes may be masked. Alternatively, some P450 enzymes may not undergo marked conformational changes upon ligand binding. Hence, it is of great interest to correlate structural changes observed by crystallography to solution dynamics and also to study structurally similar inhibitors, for which CYP2B4 was the obvious choice for our studies. In solution, structure-function relationships of P450 have been studied using a wide array of spectroscopic techniques, and many of the fundamental concepts, including redox partner recognition (23Bridges A.

Solution thermodynamics of P450-ligand interactions is an important complement to crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational tools in understanding structure-function relationships and in the rational design of better P450 enzymes and structure-based drug design. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is the method of choice to examine the complete thermodynamics of protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions in solution (27Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr.

This method is being extensively and successfully used in combination with structural information as a major tool in drug discovery research in a variety of systems (27Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr.

The recent advances in calorimetric sensitivity and data analysis have enabled innovative solution conditions to be applied to the protein-ligand system (32Ohtaka H. Velazquez-Compoy A. Xie D.

A single ITC experiment yields a complete thermodynamic picture of the interaction, including binding stoichiometry, affinity, and changes in enthalpy and entropy. To our knowledge, ITC has not been utilized to study P450-ligand interactions. In the case of mammalian P450 enzymes, this may be because of the protein aggregation that tends to occur at the high concentrations required to conduct ITC experiments and also to the use of water-insoluble ligands. Surprisingly, however, there have not been any ITC studies reported with the more soluble bacterial P450 enzymes either, except for a single report on P450cam using ITC to study protein-protein interactions (36Aoki M. Ishimori K. Fukuda H. Takahashi K. Morishima I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we used ITC in combination with spectroscopic and molecular modeling methods to characterize the interaction thermodynamics of six imidazole inhibitors with CYP2B4 to elucidate the basis of inhibitor potency and to monitor the conformational flexibility of the protein in solution. Solution conditions were standardized to maintain the protein in a monomeric form. Each of the compounds (1-benzylimidazole (1-BI), 4-CPI, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole (1-CPI), 4-phenylimidazole (4-PI), 1-phenylimidazole (1-PI), and 1-(2-(benzyloxy)ethyl)-imidazole (BEI)) binds with a perfect 1:1 stoichiometry through an enthalpically driven hydrophobic interaction, but with distinct differences in the thermodynamic signatures. Strikingly, the addition of a single chlorine atom (4-CPI versus 4-PI) or the repositioning of an imidazole nitrogen (4-CPI versus 1-CPI) makes a major difference in the entropy-enthalpy compensation, which is derived mainly from the plasticity of the enzymes, because the structural flexibility of these inhibitors is limited. The large changes in entropy (+ΔS) and heat capacity (-ΔCp) associated with 4-CPI binding were attributed to the burial of the large water-accessible apolar surface area ensuing from a conformational change in the protein. The binding of 4-CPI greatly decreases the accessibility of Trp121, indicating a large movement of helix C. Strikingly, helix C is unperturbed upon binding to the other five inhibitors. The thermodynamic signatures correlate nicely with the spectral dissociation constants and IC50 values. These results clearly demonstrate that the tightly closed structure of 4-CPI-bound CYP2B4 deduced from the crystal structure may represent only one of many possible ligand-bound conformations of the enzyme. Materials—Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1-BI, 1-PI, 4-PI, BEI, and glycerol (Sigma); CYMAL-5 (cyclohexylpentyl β-d-maltoside; Anatrace, Inc., Maumee, OH); 4-CPI (Maybridge Chemical Co., Cornwall, UK); and 1-CPI (Lancaster Synthesis, Pelham, NH) were used as obtained. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Protein Expression and Purification—2B4dH(H226Y), generated from the wild-type protein by truncation of the N-terminal domain (residues 3-21) and attachment of a C-terminal His4 tag as described (13Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Stout D. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), was used in all studies with minor modifications in the protein purification protocol as described below. Protein ligated to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was extensively washed with buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, and 4.8 mm CYMAL-5 at 4 °C. Protein-bound nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was washed twice with the above buffer containing 30 mm histidine. P450 was eluted with 80-100 mm histidine, and the fractions were pooled according to homogeneity on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein was extensively dialyzed against buffer A. Dialyzed samples were passed through a 0.22-μm sterile filter, concentrated using a centrifugal device, and stored on ice (never frozen) for further experiments. The P450 concentration was measured by reduced CO difference spectra using an extinction coefficient of 91 mm-1 cm-1. This value is ∼10% lower than the total hemoprotein concentration determined by fitting the absolute oxidized spectrum to a series of low spin P450, high spin P450, and P420 standards as described previously for CYP2B4 (37Renaud J.-P. Davydov D.R. Heirwegh K.P.M. Mansuy D. Hui Bon Hoa G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All data presented here were reproduced at least once with a different batch of enzyme. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiments—Sedimentation velocity runs were performed using a Beckman Coulter Model XLA analytical ultracentrifuge at 60,000 rpm and 20 °C. The inhibitor-free and inhibitor-bound forms of 2B4dH(H226Y) were loaded into two different 3-mm double-sector quartz cells with a respective blank sector containing buffer and an equal concentration of inhibitor. Samples were spun at 60,000 rpm and monitored at 417 nm. A 60 μm protein concentration and a 2-fold molar excess of inhibitor were used in buffer A containing 2% ethanol. An additional experiment was carried out for 4-CPI-bound 2B4dH(H226Y) in the presence of 1 mm CYMAL-5. Experiments were also conducted for the inhibitor-titrated samples of 2B4dH(H226Y) immediately after ITC experiments. Partial specific volumes, solvent density, and viscosity were calculated using the SEDNTERP program (38Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). A continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution model (c(s)), a grid size of 1000, and a resolution of 150 were used for analysis with SEDFIT Version 8.7 software (38Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Inhibitor Binding by Difference Spectral Titration—Difference spectra were recorded using 1 μm 2B4dH(H226Y) on a Shimadzu 2600 spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Protein and inhibitor samples were prepared in buffer A containing 1 mm CYMAL-5 and 2% ethanol. Protein sample (3 ml) was divided into two matched quartz cuvettes, and a base line was recorded between 350 and 500 nm. Difference spectra were recorded following the addition of a series of 5-μl aliquots of inhibitor (100 μm)to the sample cuvette and the same amount of buffer A (containing 1 mm CYMAL-5 and 2% ethanol) to the reference cuvette. Differential absorbance maxima (ΔAmax of 431 - 400 nm) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) were determined by a fit to the plot of ΔA versus [I0] by nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 1, 2ΔA[E0=ΔAmax([E0]+[I0]+KD-(([E0]+[I0]+KD)2-4[E0][I0])1/2)(Eq. 1) where ΔA and ΔAmax are differential absorption at a particular ([I0]) and saturating inhibitor concentration, respectively (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software). Enzyme Inhibition Assay—Inhibition of 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin oxidation was measured fluorometrically (Cary Eclipse, Varian Inc.) as described previously (17Spatzenegger M. Wang Q. He Y.Q. Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Halpert J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A typical 100-μl assay mixture consisted of 10 pmol of P450, 40 pmol of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, 20 pmol of cytochrome b5, and 150 μm 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin in the presence of 0-30 μm inhibitor with a constant 2% ethanol concentration. The activities were plotted against inhibitor concentration, and the data were fit to a four-parameter logistic function by linear regression analysis (KaleidaGraph) to derive the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. ITC Experiments and Data Analysis—ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC calorimeter interfaced with a computer for data acquisition and analysis using Origin Version 7 software (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA). Freshly prepared 2B4dH(H226Y) was dialyzed extensively against degassed buffer A, passed through a 0.22-μm sterile filter, and stored on ice at all times. A protein concentration of 60 μm was used in all experiments. Cold ethanol was added to the protein to a final concentration of 2% just prior to the temperature equilibration, and the sample was loaded into the calorimetric cell. Inhibitor stock solutions were prepared in 100% ethanol and were carefully diluted to 2 mm using 0.22-μm filtered dialysate with a 2% final ethanol concentration. Extreme care was taken to prevent evaporation of alcohol from each of the solutions. Prior to sample loading, the calorimeter cell and syringes were thoroughly rinsed with dialysate containing 2% ethanol to prevent any subtle heat changes due to a buffer mismatch between the solutions in the calorimetric cell and the titration syringe. The stability and CO binding properties of the protein were not altered in the buffer containing 2% ethanol and 1 mm CYMAL-5 for the duration of the ITC experiments (∼2 h for each titration). Protein and inhibitor samples were quickly preincubated to the required temperature using a ThermoVac (MicroCal, LLC) and loaded into the calorimetric cell and titration syringe, respectively. A typical titration schedule included the addition of 4 μl of inhibitor/injection with 20-25 injections spaced at 5-min intervals. The titration cell was continuously stirred at 305 rpm. For the first injection only, 1 μl of inhibitor was added, and the corresponding data point was deleted from the analysis. Reference titrations were carried out by injecting each inhibitor into buffer alone in the calorimetric cell, and heat of dilution was subtracted from the inhibitor-protein titration data. There was no change in the pH of the protein or buffer samples after titration with inhibitor. The binding isotherms were best fit to a one-set binding site model by Marquardt nonlinear least-squares analysis to obtain the binding stoichiometry (N), association constant (Ka), and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction using Origin Version 7.0 software. Calorimetric titrations were carried out at 20, 25, 30, and 37 °C, and the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) associated with the binding reaction was determined by the relationship ΔCp = dΔH/dT. The thermodynamic parameters are derived from the total ligand concentration and are thus independent of whether P450 or total hemoprotein is used in the data analysis (39Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Acrylamide Quenching—The accessibility of the sole tryptophan (Trp121) in the inhibitor-free and inhibitor-bound forms of 2B4dH(H226Y) was probed by acrylamide quenching experiments in buffer A containing 2% ethanol and 1 mm CYMAL-5. Protein (5 μm) was incubated for1hat25 °C with different inhibitors at a molar ratio of 1:2 prior to measuring the tryptophan fluorescence using a Fluorolog-3 Model FL3-22 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) with dual grating monochromators on both the excitation and emission pathways. The tryptophan was excited at 295 nm, and emission was measured between 310 and 400 nm. Collisional quenching is described by the Stern-Volmer equation (Equation 2), F0/F=1+kqτ0[Q]=I+KSV[Q](Eq. 2) where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of acrylamide, respectively; kq is the bimolecular quenching constant; τ0 is the lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of quencher; [Q] is the concentration of acrylamide; and KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant. Molecular Modeling Studies—Molecular docking of the inhibitors was performed using AutoDock Version 3.05 to search for the minimum energy conformations and the inhibitor orientations according to the Lemarckian genetic algorithm (40Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Bellew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8851) Google Scholar). Kollman united atom charges were assigned to the protein using AutoDockTools, and the charges for the heme were assigned as described previously (41Helms V. Wade R.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 810-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For the closed structure, a 60 × 58 × 60-point grid with a spacing of 0.375 Å centered at -18.8, 90.0, and 4.6 Å around the 4-CPI-binding site was used. For the open structure, a larger 120 × 120 × 120-point grid with a spacing of 0.375 Å centered at 20.9, 48.8, and 51.9 Å around the putative binding pocket at the distal end of the heme was used. A total of 10 unique minimum energy ensembles that exhibited <1 Å root mean square deviation were generated in each case, and the first two lowest energy ensembles were used for the analysis. Residue side chains within 5 Å of the docked position were mapped. Two tautomeric forms of 4-CPI and 4-PI were considered for docking, yielding similar results. Inhibitors were designed, and the charges were assigned using the PRODRG server (available at davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/programs/prodrg/) (42van Aalten D.M. Bywater R. Findlay J.B. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Spectral Studies of Inhibitor Binding and Enzyme Inhibition Assay—The experiments in this study were performed with 2B4dH(H226Y) because the 4-CPI-bound Tyr mutant was more amenable to x-ray crystallography and showed unaltered catalytic properties relative to 2B4dH (13Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Stout D. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Spectral titrations of 2B4dH(H226Y) were carried out with 4-CPI (Fig. 2A), 1-BI (Fig. 2B), 1-CPI (Fig. 2C), 4-PI (Fig. 2D), 1-PI (Fig. 2E), and BEI (Fig. 2F), whose chemical structures are shown as insets. Both 4-CPI and 4-PI have a dissociable proton and can exist in two tautomeric forms. The imidazole nitrogen linked to the side chain in 1-BI, 1-CPI, 1-PI, and BEI allow"
https://openalex.org/W2038087250,"Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are two major de novo DNA methyltransferases essential for embryonic development in mammals. It has been shown that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b have distinct substrate preferences for certain genomic loci, including major and minor satellite repeats. However, the exact target CpG sites where Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b catalyze DNA methylation remains largely unknown. To identify a CpG site that is specifically methylated by Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, we screened methylated genomic loci by methylation sensitive restriction fingerprinting using genomic DNA from wild-type, Dnmt3a null, Dnmt3b null, and Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells. Interestingly, one of the CpG sites was preferentially methylated in wild-type and Dnmt3b null ES cells but not in Dnmt3a null or Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells, suggesting that the site-specific methylation was Dnmt3a-dependent. Sequencing results revealed that the isolated CpG site is located within the 1st exon of the G isoform of fibroblast growth factor (Fgf-1.G) on mouse chromosome 18. Exogenous expression of Dnmt3a but not Dnmt3b in the double null ES cells restored DNA methylation of this CpG site. When we examined alternative transcription initiation sites, we determined that another CpG site in the 5′-flanking region of the Fgf-1.A isoform was also methylated specifically by Dnmt3a. Using chimeric constructs between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, we further determined that the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of Dnmt3a was responsible for establishing its substrate specificity. These results indicate that certain CpG sites within the Fgf-1 gene locus are preferentially methylated by Dnmt3a but not by Dnmt3b. Selective methylation by a specific member of Dnmt3 may therefore play a role in the orchestration of gene expression during embryonic development.

Selective methylation by a specific member of Dnmt3 may therefore play a role in the orchestration of gene expression during embryonic development. In mammals, global DNA methylation is catalyzed mainly by three DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b. Dnmt1 has a high preference for hemimethylated DNA and is essential for maintaining methylation patterns during DNA replication (1Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 2Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b have a preference for both unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA (3Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 4Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and are responsible for de novo methylation during early development. Although Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b contain highly conserved amino acid sequences in their PWWP domains, cysteine-rich domains, and carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains, the overall homology of these proteins is relatively low (3Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 5Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M. Li Y. He W.W. Okumura K. Li E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Gene disruption studies revealed that Dnmt3a null mice and Dnmt3b null mice showed different developmental defects (6Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). Conditional knock-outs of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b in germ cells also exhibited distinct phenotypes (7Kaneda M. Okano M. Hata K. Sado T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Sasaki H. Nature. 2004; 429: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a disruption in male germ cells showed impaired spermatogenesis, while offspring from the Dnmt3a conditional mutant females died in utero. In both cases, Dnmt3a null cells displayed a lack of methylation at imprinting loci (7Kaneda M. Okano M. Hata K. Sado T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Sasaki H. Nature. 2004; 429: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In contrast, no apparent phenotype was observed in germ cell development when Dnmt3b was conditionally disrupted (7Kaneda M. Okano M. Hata K. Sado T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Sasaki H. Nature. 2004; 429: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In in vitro cell culture, a disruption of Dnmt3b, but not Dnmt3a, resulted in a partial loss of DNA methylation on endogenous C-type retroviral DNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (8Dodge J.E. Okano M. Dick F. Tsujimoto N. Chen T. Wang S. Ueda Y. Dyson N. Li E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17986-17991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b have different target sites for DNA methylation depending on the cell types and the stage of development. It is known that the minor satellite DNA regions of the genome, which consist of 50,000–100,000 of DNA repeats at the centromeric region, are specifically methylated by Dnmt3b but not by Dnmt3a (6Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar, 9Chen T. Ueda Y. Dodge J.E. Wang Z. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5594-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In contrast, major satellite repeats, located in the pericentromeric region, are preferentially methylated by Dnmt3a (9Chen T. Ueda Y. Dodge J.E. Wang Z. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5594-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a CpG site in the Xist promoter region is revealed as a Dnmt3a-specific site of DNA methylation (9Chen T. Ueda Y. Dodge J.E. Wang Z. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5594-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsieh (10Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) found that the cloned EBNA region of the Epstein-Barr virus genome on the episome was a better substrate for Dnmt3a than the control luciferase coding region, suggesting that there is a substrate preference for the enzyme regardless of its chromosomal location or structure. In fact, it has been demonstrated that purified Dnmt3a protein has a DNA sequence preference when either a plasmid or an oligonucleotide is used as the methylation substrate in vitro (11Handa V. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Lin I.G. Han L. Taghva A. O'Brien L.E. Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 704-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempted to identify the genomic DNA loci that are preferentially methylated by Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b in vivo. This was initially accomplished using methylation-sensitive restriction fingerprinting (MSRF), 2The abbreviations used are: MSRF, methylation-sensitive restriction fingerprinting; EB, embryoid body; COBRA, combined bisulfite restriction analysis; RT, reverse transcriptase. which has been successfully utilized for the identification of differentially methylated genes in cancer cells (13Huang T.H. Laux D.E. Hamlin B.C. Tran P. Tran H. Lubahn D.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1030-1034PubMed Google Scholar) or during ES cell differentiation (14Rodic N. Oka M. Hamazaki T. Murawski M.R. Jorgensen M. Maatouk D.M. Resnick J.L. Li E. Terada N. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Using the MSRF method, we identified a CpG site in the G isoform of the fibroblast growth factor 1 (Fgf-1) gene locus that is preferentially methylated by Dnmt3a. This paper will further discuss the prospect that the flanking DNA sequence surrounding the CpG sites may play a role in this selective methylation by Dnmt3a. In Vitro ES Cell Differentiation—ES cells (J1, Dnmt3a null, Dnmt3b null, Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b null) were maintained on gelatin-coated dishes in ES cell maintenance medium containing 1000 units/ml recombinant mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (ESGRO; Chemicon International) as described previously (15Oka M. Meacham A.M. Hamazaki T. Rodic N. Chang L.J. Terada N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3091-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ES cells were differentiated using a hanging drop method as described (15Oka M. Meacham A.M. Hamazaki T. Rodic N. Chang L.J. Terada N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3091-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After 48 h, embryoid bodies (EBs) were collected and attached to tissue culture plates. Medium was then replaced every other day. MSRF—The MSRF method was performed as described previously (14Rodic N. Oka M. Hamazaki T. Murawski M.R. Jorgensen M. Maatouk D.M. Resnick J.L. Li E. Terada N. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, ES cells and differentiated EBs were harvested, and genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). Extracted DNA was digested with MseI alone (New England Biolabs), or in combination with BstUI (New England Biolabs), at 10 units per 1 μg of DNA for each enzyme. The PCR reaction was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 100 ng of digested genomic DNA, 0.4 μm primers, 1.25 units of HotMasterTaq DNA polymerase (Eppendorf), 200 μm dNTP, 1 mCi/μl [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 1× reaction buffer. The primers used in this study were as follows: Bs-1, 5′-AGCGGCCGCG-3′); Bs-2, 5′-GCCCCCGCGA-3′; Bs-3, 5′-CGGGGCGCGA-3′; Bs-4, 5′-ACCCCACCCG-3′. The PCR reaction consisted of an initial denaturing step for 5 min at 94 °C and 30 cycles of the following temperature and times: 94 °C for 2 min, 40 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. As a final step, the reaction was incubated at 72 °C for 8 min. Each sample was then separated in a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Wet gels were laid on Whatman 3MM filter paper, wrapped with plastic wrap, and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at –80 °C. After developing the film, the DNA bands of interest were excised from the polyacrylamide gels and eluted by incubation of the gel fragments in 50 μl of sterile deionized water for 10 min at 100 °C. Eluted DNA was re-amplified by the identical primers and PCR conditions. Re-amplified DNA fragments were excised from the gel, ligated into a TA-cloning vector using pCRII-Topo cloning kit (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Using Bs-1 and Bs-4 primers, we identified the band that is reduced in Dnmt3a null ES cells compared with wild-type and Dnmt3b null ES cells. Sequencing results showed that the fragment contains Fgf-1.G 1st exon sequence. Bisulfite Sequencing and Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA)—DNA was extracted from ES cells, EBs, and adult tissues using the DNA Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). A bisulfite reaction was performed using the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research). Two μg of genomic DNA were used for conversion with bisulfite. Approximately 80 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA were used as a template for each PCR analysis. Primers used for COBRA analysis and bisulfite sequencing were as follows: for Fgf-1.G, 5′-TAGAAGGTAGGTTTGTAGAGGATAT-3′ and 5′-ACCACACACACCAAATCAAATATTA-3′; for Fgf-1.B, 5′-TATAGTTTTTTGGGATTGGTATGGT-3′ and 5′-AAAAACTCTCTTCACTCCACTTTATC-3′; for Fgf-1.A, 5′-GTTGGATAGTTGTTAGGTGAAAGGA-3′ and 5′-TATTCAATAAAACCCCACAAAAAAA-3′. For bisulfite sequencing, the PCR fragments were cloned into pCRII-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), and individual clones were sequenced. Lentiviral Vector Construction and Infection—Lentiviral vector, pTYF-EF-FLAG-Dnmt3a2, and FLAG-Dnmt3b1 that contains Dnmt3 under the control of the EF1-α promoter were described previously (15Oka M. Meacham A.M. Hamazaki T. Rodic N. Chang L.J. Terada N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3091-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To express the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b chimeric protein, the plasmid was made as follows. Briefly, the amino terminus coding region of Dnmt3a (amino acid sequence 1–393) was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers containing BamHI and EcoRI sites, respectively. The carboxyl terminus region of Dnmt3b (amino acid sequence 544–893) was PCR amplified using primers contain EcoRI and SpeI, respectively. The amplified fragments were digested with the restriction enzyme and gel-purified, and both of the fragments were inserted into the BamHI-SpeI site of pTYF-EF-FLAG vector (15Oka M. Meacham A.M.

Virol. 2002; 76: 7209-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to create an amino-terminally FLAG-tagged Dnmt3a-3b chimeric protein expression vector. A Dnmt3b-3a chimeric protein expression vector was similarly made using the amino-terminal Dnmt3b fragment (amino acid sequence 1–543) and the carboxyl-terminal fragment of Dnmt3a (amino acid sequence 394–689). The constructed plasmid was packaged into lentivirus by co-transfection with pNHP (a helper plasmid) and pHEF-VSVG (an envelope coding plasmid) (17Iwakuma T. Cui Y. Chang L.J. Virology. 1999; 261: 120-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Transduction of the viral vectors was performed as described previously (17Iwakuma T. Cui Y. Chang L.J. Virology. 1999; 261: 120-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Expression of the FLAG-tagged proteins was confirmed by both immunoblotting and immunostaining. Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from adult mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Two μg of RNA were used as a template for RT reactions using SuperScript synthesis for the first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Sequences of forward and reverse primer pairs were as follows: Fgf-1.G (5′-CTAGGAAGTAGAAGGCAGGTT-3′, 5′-ACAGCTCCCGTTCTTCTTGA-3′), Fgf-1.B (5′-GTCTTGTGATAAAGTGGAGTGA-3′, 5′-ACAGCTCCCGTTCTTCTTGA-3′), Fgf-1.A (5′-GCCAAGAAGCCACCTGTTAA-3′, 5′-ACAGCTCCCGTTCTTCTTGA-3′). Southern Blotting—DNA from wild-type ES cells, Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b null ES cells, and lentivirus-infected Dnnmt3a-Dnmt3b null ES cells were isolated using the DNA Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). Fifteen μg of DNA were digested with HpyCH4IV or HpaII (New England Biolabs), separated on 1% agarose gel, and analyzed by Southern hybridization. Probes were amplified by PCR using the following primers: for major satellite, 5′-CTGTAGGACGTGGAATATGGC-3′ and 5′-CCGTGATTTTCAGTTTTCTCGC-3′; for minor satellite, 5′-TTCGAAATCGGCATTGTAGA-3′ and 5′-CGGTTTCCAACGAATGTGT-3′. Amplified DNA was cloned into pCRII-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. Identification of a CpG-rich DNA Sequence That Undergoes de Novo DNA Methylation by Dnmt3a during ES Cell Differentiation—To isolate a DNA locus that is specifically methylated by Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, we utilized MSRF using genomic DNA from wild-type, Dnmt3a null, Dnmt3b null, and Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells as the substrate. Isolated DNA was digested by a combination of methylation-sensitive (BstUI) and -insensitive (MseI) restriction enzymes and amplified by PCR. Using various combinations of four different 10-mer primers, we identified a band that is amplified less in Dnmt3a null ES cells and Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells (Fig. 1A). The bands were excised from the gels, and the sequences were determined. Nine out of 14 clones had the same sequence, which mapped to the first exon of the Fgf-1.G isoform on mouse chromosome 18 (Chr18:39090252–39090501) and contained the BstUI site (Fig. 1B). We confirmed the results using COBRA (Fig. 2A). Bisulfite treatment converts unmethylated cytosines to thymidine residues. Therefore, both CpG sites within the BstUI recognition site (CGCG) must be methylated to be digested by BstUI in COBRA. As a template for the bisulfite-PCR, we used genomic DNA from undifferentiated ES cells or from differentiated EBs (for 2 or 4 days). Differentiation of ES cells was confirmed by monitoring the expression of marker genes, as described previously (Ref. 18Oka M. Tagoku K. Russell T.L. Nakano Y. Hamazaki T. Meyer E.M. Yokota T. Terada N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and data not shown). It has been reported that the global level of DNA methylation increased after ES cell differentiation (19Lee J.H. Hart S.R. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which supposedly reflects the wave of de novo methylation during early embryogenesis (20Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Digestion of the bisulfite-treated PCR fragment with BstUI showed that Dnmt3a null and Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells had only slight DNA methylation in the Fgf-1.G-BstUI locus when they were either undifferentiated or differentiated. In contrast, wild-type and Dnmt3b null ES cells showed substantial DNA methylation when they were undifferentiated, and their methylation level was further increased after cell differentiation. We further examined more detailed DNA methylation patterns by bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 2B). As expected from the COBRA results, two CpG sequences within the BstUI site in the first exon of Fgf-1.G (+276 and +278) were methylated in wild-type cells. Similarly, both CpG sites in the BstUI site were highly methylated in Dnmt3b null ES cells. In contrast, a significant decrease in methylation of CpG within the BstUI site was observed in Dnmt3a null ES cells. Interestingly, the second CpG site within the BstUI site (+278) was more dominantly hypomethylated (87.5% of clones) than the first CpG (+276, 50% of clones) in Dnmt3a null ES cells. In COBRA, BstUI could digest bisulfite-treated PCR products only if both of the CpG sites are methylated. Therefore, only 6% of the fragments for Dnmt3a null ES cells are expected to be digested with BstUI, which appears consistent with the COBRA data above (Fig. 2A). In Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells, CpG sites were totally unmethylated. We then analyzed the CpG sites neighboring the BstUI site. As shown in Fig. 2B, two CpG sites upstream of the BstUI site (+232 and +247) were highly methylated in wild-type cells. These upstream CpG sites were relatively highly methylated in Dnmt3a null ES cells. These results suggest that some CpG sites within the Fgf-1 gene are preferentially methylated by Dnmt3a in vivo. DNA Methylation in Other Isoforms of Fgf-1 Gene during ES Cell Differentiation—Since the murine Fgf-1 gene has multiple isoforms resulting from different transcription initiation sites (21Chiu I.M. Touhalisky K. Baran C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 155-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed CpG methylation within other Fgf-1 gene isoforms using COBRA (Fig. 1). The Fgf-1.A isoform is predominantly expressed in the heart, and the Fgf-1.B isoform is mainly expressed in the brain (21Chiu I.M. Touhalisky K. Baran C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 155-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A HpyCH4IV site within the 5′-upstream region of Fgf-1.A isoform (Fgf-1.A-HpyCH4IV: Chr18:39153367–39153370) and a HinfI site within the first exon of Fgf-1.B isoform (Fgf-1.B-HinfI: Chr18:39142391–39142395) were identified as sites suitable for COBRA. Interestingly, the Fgf-1.A-HpyCH4IV site was also hypomethylated in Dnmt3a null ES cells as well as the Fgf-1.G-BstUI site. In contrast, methylation of the Fgf-1.B-HinfI site was slightly higher in Dnmt3a null ES cells when compared with Dnmt3b null ES cells (Fig. 2A). Fgf-1 DNA Methylation Patterns in Adult Tissues—We also examined the gene expression and DNA methylation status of Fgf-1 isoforms in mouse adult tissues (Fig. 3, A and B), since DNA methylation is generally associated with gene inactivation. The RT-PCR results revealed that the Fgf-1.G gene was highly expressed in liver and moderately expressed in kidney, as reported previously (22Zhang Y. Madiai F. Hackshaw K.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1521: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). DNA methylation analysis by COBRA showed that the Fgf-1.G-BstUI site was hypomethylated in liver, where Fgf-1.G gene expression was high. In kidney, the Fgf-1.G-BstUI site methylation was lower than in other tissues that do not express Fgf-1.G. Bisulfite sequencing further confirmed the COBRA data (Fig. 3C). Overall, there was a tendency for DNA methylation levels to be higher in tissues where the Fgf-1.G gene was not expressed. Similarly, the Fgf-1.A-HpyCH4IV site was hypomethylated in heart and kidney, where the Fgf-1.A gene was expressed. The correlation was less clear with Fgf-1.B. The Fgf-1.B-HinfI locus was highly methylated in testis and only slightly methylated in other somatic organs. Reconstitution of DNA Methylation by Ectopic Expression of Dnmt3a—To further demonstrate that Dnmt3a is responsible for site-specific DNA methylation within the Fgf-1 gene, we reconstituted the expression of Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells and looked for a recovery in methylation (Fig. 4A). To do this, we created stable clones expressing either Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b in Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells. We confirmed that these clones could be maintained as undifferentiated ES cells and could differentiate as EBs (data not shown). The status of DNA methylation in the ES cell clones was then analyzed by COBRA. As expected, DNA methylation of the Fgf-1.G-BstUI site and the Fgf-1.A-HpyCH4IV site was preferentially restored by ectopic expression of Dnmt3a but not Dnmt3b. The Fgf-1.G-BstUI site DNA methylation was not observed when transduced ES cells were maintained in the undifferentiated condition. In contrast to these two sites, the DNA methylation of the Fgf-1.B-HinfI site was increased by the ectopic expression of either Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b. To rule out the possibility that the expressed Dnmt3b is not or less functional, we examined DNA methylation of minor satellite repeats in those clones (Fig. 4B). Methylation of minor satellite repeats in double null ES cells was more efficiently restored by Dnmt3b than Dnmt3a reconstitution. Therefore, we conclude that both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b used in this study are functional and exhibit distinct substrate specificity. The Regulatory Domain of Dnmt3a Is Important for the Site-specific DNA Methylation—Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b each contain a highly conserved catalytic domain at their carboxyl termini. In contrast, the amino-terminal halves of the proteins are more divergent and show low homology. To examine which domain is more important to the substrate specificity, we made a chimeric construct of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, namely, Dnmt3a-3b, which contains the Dnmt3a regulatory domain with the Dnmt3b catalytic domain, and Dnmt3b-3a, which contains the Dnmt3b regulatory domain with the Dnmt3a catalytic domain (Fig. 5A). These chimeric genes were ectopically expressed in Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells using lentiviral vectors, and their DNA methylation activity was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5B, DNA methylation in major satellite DNA repeats was preferentially recovered by ectopic expression of Dnmt3a as reported previously (9Chen T. Ueda Y. Dodge J.E. Wang Z. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5594-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a-3b, but not Dnmt3b-3a, partially recovered DNA methylation in major satellite DNA. Therefore, the regulatory domain of Dnmt3a is more important than the catalytic domain to determine the substrate specificity of Dnmt3a to major satellite repeats. Using these constructs, we examined the DNA methylation of Fgf-1 sites (Fig. 5C). The Fgf-1.A-HpyCH4IV site was methylated by the transduction of Dnmt3a-3b in Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells regardless of differentiation status. In contrast, Dnmt3b-3a expression did not restore DNA methylation. These results suggest that the regulatory domain, rather than the catalytic domain, of Dnmt3a is important for the site-specific DNA methylation at the Fgf-1.A site. It should be noted that methylation of the Fgf-1.G-BstUI site was not observed by the expression of either one of the chimeric constructs. Fgf-1.B-HinfI site was similarly methylated by Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3a-3b (data not shown). Using MSRF, we have identified a BstUI recognition site within the first exon of the Fgf-1.G gene locus as a CpG site that is methylated preferentially by Dnmt3a. Similarly, we found that a HpyCH4IV site in the 5′-flanking region of the Fgf-1.A gene was predominantly methylated by Dnmt3a. Furthermore, reconstitution of Dnmt3a in double null ES cells restored the methylation of these sites, whereas the expression of Dnmt3b did not. These results demonstrated that these CpG sites in the Fgf-1 gene are specific target sites for Dnmt3a. Genome-wide methylation analysis by restriction landmark genomic scanning, using the NotI restriction enzyme, suggested that methylation patterns at CpG islands are quite similar between wild-type, Dnmt3a null, and Dnmt3b null ES cells (23Hattori N. Abe T. Suzuki M. Matsuyama T. Yoshida S. Li E. Shiota K. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1733-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, by MSRF screening, we identified the genomic locus that is specifically methylated by Dnmt3a. Even though genome-wide screening has a clear merit, restriction landmark genomic scanning restricts its analysis for the CpG sites located within the recognition site of the restriction enzyme used. In contrast, MSRF screening could be useful for the analysis of CpG methylation, regardless of flanking sequences. It remains undetermined how Dnmt3a catalyzes DNA methylation of the specific target sites in the genome. One hypothesis is that Dnmt3a binds to the sequence-specific DNA binding molecules, which brings the complex to the specific genomic locus. In fact, Dnmt3a has been shown to bind to a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (24Di Croce L. Raker V.A. Corsaro M. Fazi F. Fanelli M. Faretta M. Fuks F. Coco F. Lo Kouzarides T. Nervi C.

Kouzarides T. de Launoit Y. Di Croce L. Fuks F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and act as a co-repressor (25Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Godin N. Kasai M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 26Brenner C. Deplus R. Didelot C. Loriot A. Vire E. De Smet C. Gutierrez A. Danovi D. Bernard D. Boon T. Pelicci P.G. Amati B. Kouzarides T. de Launoit Y. Di Croce L. Fuks F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), although it has not been demonstrated whether Dnmt3a did actually catalyze DNA methylation at this specific site. The other hypothesis is that Dnmt3a itself possesses a substrate DNA sequence preference. It has been reported that the cloned EBNA region of the Epstein-Barr virus genome on the episome was a better substrate in vivo for Dnmt3a than a control luciferase coding region on the same episome (10Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Handa et al. (11Handa V. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported that there is a preference for the flanking sequence surrounding methylated CpG sites for Dnmt3a when they analyzed DNA methylation in vitro using a purified Dnmt3a and oligonucleotide DNA substrates. According to the study, the RCGY consensus sequence was a more preferred substrate for methylation by Dnmt3a. In contrast, YCGR was not a preferred substrate for Dnmt3a. It should be noted that, however, the study has not demonstrated a differential sequence preference between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. In our study, all the sites preferentially methylated by Dnmt3a, namely, two CpG sites within Fgf-1.G-BstUI site and one at the Fgf-1.A-HpyCH4IV site, contain RCGY sequences. Furthermore, the Fgf-1.B-HinfI site, which was not selectively methylated by Dnmt3a, contains the YCGR sequence. Thus, our results support the previous in vitro studies that Dnmt3a may possess a substrate preference to RCGY even in vivo. Of interest, the Fgf-1.B-HinfI YCGR site was more highly methylated in Dnmt3a null ES cells than in Dnmt3b null ES cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, Dnmt3b reconstitution caused a slightly higher degree of DNA methylation at the Fgf-1.B-HinfI YCGR site than Dnmt3a (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the YCGR site might be a preferred substrate for Dnmt3b in vivo. In fact, Dnmt3b is known to be highly expressed in adult testis (3Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 5Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M. Li Y. He W.W. Okumura K. Li E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), where the methylation level of Fgf-1.B-HinfI site was very high (Fig. 3B). The major satellite repeats selectively methylated by Dnmt3a (Fig. 5) include ACGT (HpyCH4IV or MaeII recognition site), which consists of a RCGY sequence. The minor satellite repeats, which are known to be selectively methylated by Dnmt3b, on the other hand, contain a YCGR sequence. Taken together, these data suggest that the substrate preference of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b may play an important role in determining which genomic loci are differentially methylated in vivo. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b each consist of an NH2-terminal regulatory domain, which contains the PWWP domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and a COOH-terminal catalytic domain (3Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 5Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M. Li Y. He W.W. Okumura K. Li E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of either Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b by itself has been shown to possess a similar substrate preference as a full-length Dnmt3a in vitro (11Handa V. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, the catalytic domain may not be critical to determine the substrate specificity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in vivo. Indeed, our experiments using chimeric Dnmt3 constructs between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b revealed that the amino-terminal regulatory domain of Dnmt3a was more important for the site-specific methylation of major satellite repeats and the Fgf-1.A-HpyCH4IV locus (Fig. 5, B and C). The PWWP domain has been shown to have a high affinity for DNA (27Qiu C. Sawada K. Zhang X. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 217-224PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ge Y.Z. Pu M.T. Gowher H. Wu H.P.

Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and is required for the methylation of the major satellite repeats (29Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, considering the non-sequence-specific binding property of the Dnmt3 PWWP domain (29Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), it may be difficult to assume that this domain is directly involved in enzyme targeting to specific DNA loci, such as the Fgf-1 gene. FGF-1 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which possesses broad mitogenic activities, and is involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival (30Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3639-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Davis J.B. Stroobant P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 32Unsicker K.

Physiol. 1994; 158: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Fgf-1 gene contains multiple promoters associated with distinct first exons, which result in multiple transcript isoforms containing common sequences except for the first exons (36Myers R.L. Payson R.A. Chotani M.A. Deaven L.L. Chiu I.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar). These promoters are regulated in a tissue-dependent manner both in mouse and human (21Chiu I.M. Touhalisky K. Baran C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 155-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since ectopic expression of Fgf-1 induces intimal hyperplasia in vivo (37Nabel E.G. Yang Z.Y. Plautz G. Forough R. Zhan X. Haudenschild C.C. Maciag T. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 844-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), their strict gene regulation appears to be important in normal embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. In this paper, we also showed that the degree of DNA methylation inversely correlates with their expression pattern in adult mouse tissues. DNA methylation may be one of the mechanisms involved in the silencing of gene expression by preventing the access of transcription factors. Our data imply that a particular Dnmt3 member might play a role in the regulation of isoform determination of the Fgf-1 gene during embryonic development. In conclusion, we have identified CpG sites preferentially methylated by Dnmt3a in vivo. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this selective methylation remain undetermined, the regulatory domain of Dnmt3a likely plays a predominant role. Further, common flanking sequences (RCGY) around CpG may be involved in this selective methylation by Dnmt3a in vivo. Site-specific methylation by a specific member of Dnmt3 may play a role in the orchestration of gene expression during embryonic development. We thank En Li for providing us with Dnmt null ES cells and Keith Robertson, Amy Meacham, Sarah Kehoe, Jeffrey Brower, and Catherine Ketcham for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."

Consistent with these findings, the lack of mK3 expression by the virus results in the detection of more virus-immune CD8 T cells and a lower level of latency (4Stevenson P.G. May J.S. Smith X.G.

Comparisons of coding sequences revealed that mK3 is highly homologous to both kK3 and kK5 gene products of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (1Virgin H.W. Latreille P. Wamsley P.

The kK3, kK5, and mK3 proteins share a common topology including a highly conserved, N-terminal RING-CH domain, followed by two predicted transmembrane segments and a C-terminal domain varying in sequence and length (3Boname J.M.

Cellular K3 homologs have also been detected, suggesting appropriation of the viral K3 homologs from their eukaryotic host (10Bartee E. Mansouri M. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Gouveia K. Fruh K. J.

Despite similar domain organization, mK3 appears to be unique among the K3 homologs in terms of its subcellular site of degradation. More specifically, kK3, kK5, and the other K3 family members defined thus far target their respective substrates for endocytosis at the plasma membrane resulting in degradation in the lysosome (9Mansouri M.

By contrast, mK3 targets newly synthesized HC in the ER leading to their degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Defining differences in the host proteins recruited by mK3 versus kK3/kK5 will provide key insights into disparate pathways of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. Although molecular details of how mK3 induces rapid degradation of HC are incompletely understood, intriguing features have been recently defined. For example, mK3 induces the polyubiquitination of glycosylated, membrane-bound HC. More specifically, the mK3-targeted HC are associated with the transmembrane proteins TAP and tapasin, two ER proteins involved in peptide binding by class I proteins (15Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M.R. Virgin H.W. Hansen T.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, lysine to arginine mutations in HC tails did not alter the mK3-induced polyubiquitination pattern of HC or its rapid degradation (16Wang X. Connors R. Harris M.R. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4099-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cysteine residues in the HC tail are also not required for mK3 down-regulation of HC, 3X. Wang, unpublished data. as they are required for kK3 regulation of HC (17Cadwell K. Coscoy L. Science. 2005; 309: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Thus, ubiquitination of the HC tail is not the initiating event for mK3-induced ERAD. Alternatively these findings support the model that mK3 induces partial dislocation of ER membrane-bound HC to the cytosol prior to mK3-induced ubiquitination (18Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M. Hansen T.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar to our findings, tail lysines are also dispensable for ERAD of HC induced by human cytomegalovirus immune evasion proteins US2 and US11 as well as other ERAD substrates (19Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Furman M.H. Loureiro J. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Like mK3, US2 and US11 induce rapid degradation of nascent class I molecules through ubiquitination-dependent proteasome proteolysis (22Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 23Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Yet, distinct from mK3, US2 and US11 are type I membrane proteins with their major domains located in the ER lumen, and they are not E3 ligases (22Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 23Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Furthermore, US2, and presumably US11, bind directly to class I molecules and induce their dislocation from the ER (24Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 25Story C.M. Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8516-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite functional and predicted structural homology, US2 and US11 appear to utilize different mechanisms to dislocate HC into the cytosol. For example, the cytoplasmic tail of US2, but not US11, is required for ERAD of HC (26Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 126-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been recently reported that Derlin1 (mammalian homolog of yeast Der1p) is essential for the degradation of class I HC catalyzed by US11 but not by US2 (27Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The interaction of US11 with Derlin-1 and VIMP (a novel Derlin1-associated ER membrane protein) recruits the p97 AAA-ATPase together with cofactors Ufd1 and Npl4 (27Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 28Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that this p97 complex “pulls” HC into the cytosol in an ATP-dependent manner by interacting with segments of the HC backbone as well as attached polyubiquitin chains (29Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Whether US2 function depends on p97 has not been reported. The disparity between the US2-versus US11-recruited cellular proteins for dislocation suggests that there may be multiple pathways by which ER proteins are dislocated to the cytosol. More specifically, these multiple ERAD pathways in mammals could involve several distinct dislocation channels associated with disparate ATPases and E3 ligases. Here we investigate whether the Derlin1/p97 pathway is involved in mK3-mediated HC degradation and surface down-regulation. We now show that mK3, while interacting with class I, is physically associated with Derlin1 and p97. Furthermore, using dominant negative forms of p97 known to ablate ATP binding or hydrolysis, HC down-regulation by mK3 was found to be p97-dependent, whereas kK5-mediated substrate degradation was p97-independent. Cell Lines—Murine B6/WT3 (WT3, H-2b) and L cell (H-2k) fibroblasts as well as their transductants (Ld, human B7.2, mK3, and kK5) have been described previously (8Wang X. Lybarger L. Connors R.

All cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), as described (15Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M.R.

Cells transduced by pMIP-containing virus were enriched by puromycin selection, while GFP+ cells from pMIG transduced lines were enriched by cell sorting. Where indicated, cells were cultured for 24 h with 125 units/ml mouse γ interferon (γIFN, BIOSOURCE, Sunnyvale, CA) and for 4 h with 30 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA). DNA Constructs—Mouse Derlin1 (NCBI ID: NP_77169) and mouse VIMP (NCBI ID: NP_077759) cDNA were amplified from total cDNA of L cells by PCR. The necessary flanking restriction endonuclease sites on each end of the cDNA were incorporated into the primers. Retroviral expression constructs pMIP.mDerlin1-HA or pMIP.myc-mVIMP that express C-terminal HA-tagged mouse Derlin1 or N-terminal myc-tagged mouse VIMP, respectively, were created by subclonning mouse Derlin1 or VIMP cDNA together with the sequence encoding HA or myc epitope tag into a pMSCV.IRES.Puro (pMIP) retroviral expression vector (gift of Dr. L. Lybarger, University of Arizona). The retroviral constructs pMSCV.IRES.GFP (pMIG).HA-mK3, pMIG.HA-mK3 RING (mK3 C48G/C51G mutant which abolishes the E3 ligase activity of mK3), and pMIG.myc-mK3 were generated by inserting a HA or myc tag sequence in front of mK3 in the corresponding constructs as described previously (8Wang X. Lybarger L. Connors R. Harris M.R. Hansen T.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8673-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The correct sequences for all of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. p97 Adenoviruses and Cell Infection—Recombinant adenoviruses that express RGS-His tagged wild type (WT), ATP binding mutant K524A (KA), and ATP-hydrolysis mutant E305Q/E578Q (QQ) p97 under the control of tetracycline (tet-off) have been described previously by Dr. Lencer and colleagues (31Kothe M.

Cells were co-infected with p97 and tet-transactivator tTA adenoviruses. The amount of each virus applied to B6/WT3 or L cells was determined empirically by establishing equivalent viral p97 expression while not causing cytopathic effects. Where indicated, 1–2 ng/ml doxycycline was added 4 h postinfection to specifically suppress viral p97 expression. Cells were collected for analysis after incubation with viruses for 24 h for B6/WT3 cells or 48–72 h for L cells. Antibodies—Rabbit antisera to Derlin1 and VIMP were described previously by Ye et al. (28Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mK3, hamster anti-tapasin, ubiquitin antibodies, and mAbs to MHC class I including 30-5-7, 64-3-7 to Ld, 15-5-5 to Dk, and B8-24-3 to Kb have been described previously (15Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M.R. Virgin H.W. Hansen T.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RGS-His antibodies, p97 antibodies (58.13.3), and β-actin (AC-74) antibodies were purchased from Qiagen, Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ), and Sigma, respectively. Antibodies to HA (16B12), myc (9E10), and GFP (B34) were obtained from Covance Research Products (Berkeley, CA). Rabbit antibodies to calreticulin (SPA600) and Sec61α were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Flow Cytometry and Immunofluorescence Staining—All flow cytometric analyses were performed as described previously (15Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M.R. Virgin H.W. Hansen T.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For immumofluorescence microscopy, cells were plated into 24-well plates and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% saponin and 3% bovine serum albumin, fixed cells were then incubated with mAb to RGS-His (0.1 μg/ml, Qiagen) and Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (6.5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) sequentially. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—For co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% digitonin (Wako, Richmond, VA), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (Complete mini, Roche). Postnuclear lysates were then incubated with immobilized anti-HA or anti-myc beads (ProFound c-Myc tag/HA tag co-IP kit, Pierce) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Beads were washed four times with 0.05% Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and proteins were eluted with an excess of HA.11 peptide (Covance Research Products) for anti-HA beads or by boiling in non-reducing sample buffer (Pierce) for anti-myc beads. For immunoblots of cell lysates, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, TBS (pH 7.4). Postnuclear lysates were mixed with LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and 2-mercaptoethanal was added to a final concentration of 2%. Immunoblotting was performed following SDS-PAGE separation of precipitated proteins or cell lysates as described previously (2Yu Y.Y. Harris M.R. Lybarger L. Kimpler L.A. Myers N.B. Virgin H.W. Hansen T.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Specific proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-Chase—After 30 min of preincubation in cysteine- and methionine-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum), cells were pulse labeled with Express [35S]Cys/Met labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 150 μCi/ml for 10–15 min. Chase was initiated by the addition of an excess of unlabeled Cys/Met (5 mm each). Immunoprecipitation and endoglycosidase H (Endo H; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) treatment were performed as described (32Miley M.J. Truscott S.M. Yu Y.Y. Gilfillan S. Fremont D.H. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to BioMax-MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). p97 ATPase Is Required for mK3-induced Degradation and Surface Down-regulation of MHC Class I HC—To test whether p97 ATPase function is required by mK3-mediated degradation of HC, dominant negative forms of p97 were employed. Previous studies have shown that p97 mutants QQ (E305Q/E578Q) or KA (K524A) do not affect the binding of substrates and cofactors but significantly reduce the ATPase activity by either blocking ATP hydrolysis or ATP binding (29Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Since endogenous p97 proteins are very abundant, representing about 1% of the total proteins in the cell (33Dalal S. Hanson P.I. Cell. 2001; 104: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a tet-off adenoviral expression system was used to overexpress RGS-His-tagged p97 mutants. To probe p97 involvement in mK3-induced turnover of HC, mouse WT3-Ld fibroblasts carrying empty vector (WT3+V) or mK3 (WT3+mK3) were infected with adenovirus expressing WT or dominant negative (QQ or KA) forms of p97. Twenty-four hours postinfection, the total level of p97 protein detected by Western blotting increased ∼2-fold compared with non-infected cells (Fig. 1A). To monitor MHC class I HC turnover, infected cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Cys/Met and chased for 0, 30, 60, and 90 min. Class I HC (Kb) was immunoprecipitated, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1B). In the cells without mK3, expression of p97 QQ had no significant effect on oligosaccharide maturation or turnover of HC compared with p97 WT. Indeed, in cells lacking mK3 the majority of HC acquired mature (Endo H-resistant (r)) oligosaccharides by 60 min in the presence of either WT or QQ p97 (Fig. 1B, upper left panel). By contrast in cells expressing mK3, HC turned over more rapidly in the presence of WT p97 with a half-life of less than 60 min; and as expected, the majority of HC retained immature (Endo H-sensitive (s)) oligosaccharides, consistent with their ER residency. Dominant negative p97 was found to prolong the half-life (>90 min) of HC in mK3-expressing cells and increase the detection of HC with matured oligosaccharides (Fig. 1B, lower right and upper right panels). A similar reversal of mK3 function by dominant negative forms of p97 was observed monitoring the turnover of Ld HC expressed by these cells (data not shown). Furthermore, this kinetic data were corroborated by comparisons of surface expression of MHC class I by these cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, expression of WT p97 did not interfere with the ability of mK3 to down-regulate surface Kb expression to about 7% of that of cells without mK3. By contrast, expression of dominant negative forms of p97 resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in class I expression as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained using either the KA or QQ dominant negative forms of p97 (Fig. 1C) and monitoring surface expression of Kb (Fig. 1C) or Ld (data not shown). Thus, dominant negative forms of p97 clearly impair the ability of mK3 to rapidly degrade class I HC and thereby decrease surface class I expression. These findings indicated mK3 regulation of class I HC is functionally dependent upon p97, thus providing additional evidence that mK3 exploits a physiological ERAD pathway. The p97 Dependence of mK3 Does Not Extend to the Highly Homologous kK5 Immune Evasion Protein of KSHV—To characterize the specificity of the interaction of mK3 with p97, we also tested whether kK5 is functionally dependent upon p97. The kK5 protein of KSHV is highly homologous to mK3 including a RING-CH domain and two transmembrance segments (6Sanchez D.J. Coscoy L. Ganem D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6124-6130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Despite this homology to mK3, kK5 does not induce ERAD but acts at the cell surface to accelerate endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of its substrates (12Ishido S. Wang C. Lee B.S. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 13Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 14Coscoy L. Sanchez D.J. Ganem D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In human cells, kK5 substrates include HC and other immune regulatory receptors such as the T cell co-stimulation protein B7.2 (CD86). However, importantly for these experiments, kK5 down-regulates B7.2 but not mouse class I HC in mouse cells (Fig. 2C, panels a and b). By contrast mK3 down-regulates class I but not B7.2 (Fig. 2C, panels c and d). This reciprocal substrate specificity allowed us to directly compare the p97 dependence of substrate down-regulation by mK3 versus kK5 in the same cell type. For these experiments, mouse fibroblast L cell lines co-expressing human B7.2 (huB7.2) and mK3 or kK5 were used. Because these cells were found to be relatively resistant to cytopathic effects of adenovirus infection, we expressed different doses of dominant negative forms of p97 (data for the QQ p97 mutant are shown, but comparable results were also obtained with the KA mutant (data not shown)). As visualized by immunofluorescence using an antibody to the His tag, the number of cells with high levels of expression of His-p97 protein increased commensurately with increases in adenovirus infection (Fig. 2A). In agreement with the cell staining, the protein levels of p97 in whole lysates from cells infected with increasing doses of dominant negative p97 also showed ∼2-, 3-, and 4-fold enhancement over the level of endogenous p97 (Fig. 2B, p97 blot, lanes 2–4 and 6–8 compared with lanes 1 and 5). It should be noted that the steady-state levels of mK3 protein in cells infected with different doses of dominant negative p97 were unchanged, demonstrating that mK3 turnover is p97-independent (Fig. 2B, mK3 blot). To compare the p97 dependences of the substrate interactions of mK3 versus kK5, we monitored surface expression of huB7.2 and mouse class I in the aforementioned L cell lines (Fig. 2). For surface expression of MHC class I, we tested both Kk and Dk proteins, and similar results were obtained. Thus, only Dk expression is shown. As expected, expression of mK3 or kK5 induced a profound (>10-fold) down-regulation of their respective substrates class I (Fig. 2C, panel d) and huB7.2 (Fig. 2C, panel a). However, expression of dominant negative forms of p97 affected only substrate down-regulation by mK3 and not kK5. Indeed, compared with normal levels of class I (i.e. no mK3), the percentage of down-regulation increased from 24 to 72% as the dose of p97 QQ was raised from 1 to 3 (Fig. 2C, panel d, and Fig. 2D). By contrast kK5-induced down-regulation of huB7.2 remained unchanged in the presence of dominant negative p97 (Fig. 2C, panel a). Furthermore, the effect of dominant negative p97 on mK3 down-regulation of HC was reversed by treatment with doxycycline during p97 adenovirus infection (Fig. 3B), which correlated with the complete shut down of virally expressed His-p97 protein (Fig. 3A). This control establishes that the effects seen with dominant negative p97 are not secondarily caused by the adenovirus infection. Thus dominant negative forms of p97 specifically interfere with ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent class I down-regulation by mK3 but not ubiquitin-lysosome-dependent B7.2 down-regulation by kK5. This indicates that substrate down-regulation by mK3 and not kK5 is dependent upon p97 ATPase activity.

https://openalex.org/W1994862178,"Cytokine transcription is usually regulated by transcription factor binding and chromatin remodeling following an inducing signal. By contrast, these data showed the interleukin (IL)-1β promoter assembles into a “poised” structure, as evidenced by nuclease accessibility and loss of core histones immediately surrounding the transcription start site. Strikingly, these properties do not change upon transcriptional activation by lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, association of two key transcriptional activators, PU.1 and C/EBPβ, is robust pre- and post-stimulation indicating the IL-1β promoter is packaged into a nontranscribed but poised promoter architecture in cells capable of rapidly inducing IL-1β. Monocyte stimulation causes recruitment of a third factor, IRF-4, to the IL-1β enhancer. PU.1 phosphorylation at a CK2 kinase consensus element is required for this recruitment. We showed that CK2 phosphorylates PU.1, CK2 inhibitors abrogate IL-1β induction, and CK2 inducibly associates with the IL-1β enhancer. Taken together, these data indicate a novel two-step mechanism for IL-1β transcription: 1) formation of a poised chromatin architecture, and 2) phosphorylation of an enhancer-bound factor that recruits other activators. We propose that this poised structure may generally characterize rapidly activated genes.

Processes regulating the first step of IL-1β production, transcription, have been studied in detail by transient transfection and DNA binding assays. These analyses have putatively identified transcription factors and regulatory elements playing nonredundant roles in IL-1β transcription in response to endotoxin stimulation. IL-1β transcription is regulated by a proximal promoter and an enhancer located at about 3 kb upstream of transcription start. Inducible transcriptional activation has been localized to both promoter and enhancer elements and appears to be regulated similarly in mouse and human (1Shirakawa F. Saito K. Bonagura C.A.

Bellone C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 112-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Classical reporter and in vitro DNA binding assays have demonstrated that PU.1, C/EBPβ, and NF-κB can activate the IL-1β promoter (2Zhang Y. Rom W.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3831-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar, 6Monks B.G. Martell B.A. Buras J.A. Fenton M.J. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The IL-1β enhancer is activated by PU.1, C/EBPβ, AP-1 (Fos/Jun), and a novel STAT transcription factor dubbed LIL-STAT (7Tsukada J. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2183-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family also activate IL-1β transcription (8Marecki S. Riendeau C.J. Liang M.D. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6829-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, activation by any of the enhancer-binding proteins is minimal in the absence of intact PU.1 promoter site(s) (8Marecki S. Riendeau C.J. Liang M.D. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6829-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Importantly, ectopic PU.1 expression in nonhematopoietic cells results in IL-1β transcription from the endogenous (i.e. chromatinized) locus, further emphasizing the role PU.1 plays in this process (8Marecki S. Riendeau C.J. Liang M.D. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6829-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Work herein therefore focuses on the critical role PU.1 plays in inducible IL-1β transcription. Monocytic cells activate IL-1β transcription rapidly (i.e. within minutes) following stimulation with the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The mechanisms driving inducible IL-1β transcription appear to hinge on PU.1 phosphorylation at serine residue 148. Mutation of serine 148, located within a protein kinase CK2 consensus element, substantially blunts PU.1-mediated transcriptional activation of an IL-1β-regulated reporter gene (9Lodie T.A. Savedra Jr., R. Golenbock D.T. Van Beveren C.P. Maki R.A. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1848-1856PubMed Google Scholar). Because CK2 has been shown to be activated by LPS, and CK2 can target PU.1 serine 148 in cells (10Pongubala J.M.R. Beveren C.V. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1622-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), it is likely that CK2-mediated PU.1 phosphorylation leads to IL-1β transcription in monocyte lineage cells. Furthermore, PU.1 phosphorylation is required for transcriptional activation via recruitment of IRF-4 to an ETS/IRF composite element, found in both the κ3′ and IL-1β enhancers (9Lodie T.A. Savedra Jr., R. Golenbock D.T. Van Beveren C.P. Maki R.A. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1848-1856PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pongubala J.M.R. Beveren C.V. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1622-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This model of PU.1-activated transcription via IRF-4 recruitment has not been tested in the context of a chromatinized gene. Most analyses aimed at understanding the role PU.1 or other transcription factors play in inducible IL-1β transcription were completed before the importance of the potential regulatory context of cellular chromatin was fully realized. The lone exception is the demonstration that PU.1 overexpression can activate IL-1β transcription from the endogenous locus. Whether PU.1 functions through direct (i.e. IL-1β enhancer or promoter association) or indirect mechanisms was not discerned (8Marecki S. Riendeau C.J. Liang M.D. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6829-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Changes in promoter chromatin structure regulate inducible transcription of most cytokine genes tested to date. The typical scenario is that a histone octamer sequestering the transcription start site is remodeled in response to stimulation, resulting in more or less rapid gene transcription. This mechanism was described with variable rigor for the IL-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-4, interferon-γ, IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, IL-13/IL-5, TNF-α, IL-10, MCP-1, and interferon-β promoters (11Rao S.

Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism results in the very rapid induction of IL-1β transcription has not been reported, despite the recent demonstration that modifications of histones packaging the locus change following monocyte stimulation (25Chan C. Li L. McCall C.E. Yoza B.K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have analyzed chromatin structure and protein association at the IL-1β locus in resting and stimulated monocyte lineage cells. Results herein demonstrate that, in resting cells capable of rapid transcriptional activation, the IL-1β promoter is packaged into an accessible, poised chromatin architecture not yet shown at any cytokine locus. Further analyses suggest that phosphorylation of constitutively associated PU.1 by DNA-associated CK2 upon cellular stimulation results in recruitment of IRF-4 to the IL-1β enhancer. RNA polymerase II is concomitantly recruited to the promoter to result in the robust IL-1β transcription characteristic of stimulated monocytes. Overall, the data demonstrate that the IL-1β gene is inducibly transcribed from a poised promoter architecture likely due to post-translational modification of DNA-associated protein. Cell Culture—Mono-Mac-6 (MM6) cells were maintained in RPMI containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and OPI media supplement to a final concentration of 1 mm oxaloacetate, 0.45 mm pyruvate, and 0.2 units/ml insulin. 293 human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. THP-1 and THP-1/CD14 cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. U937 cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. All culture media contained 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin per ml. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were derived from 6- to 8-week-old BALB/cByJ femurs according to Vicente et al. (26Vicente R. Escalada A. Soler C. Grande M. Celada A. Tamkun M.M. Solsona C. Felipe A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Specifically, marrow from femurs and tibias was flushed out with 1–2 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 15% fetal bovine serum using a 30-gauge needle. Viable cells were purified through Lympholyte M. Cells from each mouse were plated in a T75 flask with 20 ml of BMDM media (60% irrigation media, 40% L-929 fibroblast (L cell)-conditioned medium). The nonadherent cells were further cultured in BMDM media. Macrophages were obtained as a homogeneous population of adherent cells after 7 days of culture. Homogeneity of the CD11c– Mac-1+ population was assessed by flow cytometry. Primary splenic B cells were prepared as described (27McDevit D.C. Perkins L. Atchison M.L. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Primary splenic T cells were prepared using the pan-T Macs depletion system according to the manufacturer's protocol. All primary cells were routinely >90% pure. RNA Isolation and Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 105 cells using RNeasy (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared by standard methods. PCRs amplified 10 ng of cDNA, using SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) incorporation for quantitation and the Stratagene Mx3000p Real Time PCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each amplification was performed in triplicate using the following conditions: hot start, 3 min at 95 °C; melting, 15 s at 95 °C and then annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min, for 40 cycles. The primers used for IL-1β transcript were as follows: sense, 5′-ACGAATCTCCGACCACCACT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCATGGCCACAACAACTGAC-3′. PCRs conducted in parallel using β2-microglobulin (β2m) primers (sense, 5′-CTCCGTGGCCTTAGCTGTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-TTTGGAGTACGCTGGATAGCCT-3′) were used to normalize for differences in cDNA synthesis and RNA input. mRNA copy number was calculated according to the equation: copies = 10(Ct–40)/(–3.32). Nuclease Probing of Chromatin Accessibility Assayed on Southern Blots—Nuclease probing of chromatin accessibility was performed as described (28Nikolajczyk B.S. Sanchez J.A. Sen R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2 × 107 cells were used for each condition. For the accessibility cut, 100 units of HindIII were added, and the nuclei were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with agitation. Ten μg of purified genomic DNA was digested to completion with XmaI. Digestion products were separated on agarose gels. The accessibility fragment was detected on Southern blots using a radiolabeled probe specific for the IL-1β promoter (–860 to –352 bp relative to transcription start) and standard methods. Chromatin Accessibility by Real Time (CHART) PCR—Accessibility of DNA to digestion with MNase was analyzed using CHART-PCR as published (29Rao S. Procko E. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4494-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) using 105–106 cells. 5–10 ng of DNA was analyzed by SYBR Green incorporation during quantitative PCR. All products were run on acrylamide gels to verify product size and displayed a single optimum on melt curve analysis. Apparent negative accessibility is a mathematical artifact likely due to error in DNA quantitation and is neither reproducible nor biologically significant. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIPs were performed as published previously (27McDevit D.C. Perkins L. Atchison M.L. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30McCarthy K.M. McDevit D.C. Andreucci A. Reeves R. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol.

Fold enrichment was calculated by 2(Ctinput–CtChIP) after quantitative amplification of equivalent picogram amounts of DNA (31Litt M.D. Simpson M. Recillas-Targa F. Prioleau M.N. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2224-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The appropriate amount of antibody was determined empirically, and the same microgram amount of α-histidine tag antibody was added in the control samples. ChIP-competent antibodies were as follows: α-histidine tag antibody (SC-803; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a nonspecific isotype/species-matched control, α-acetylated histone H3 (06-599; Upstate), rabbit α-PU.1 (SC-352; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-C/EBPβ (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-histone H3 (antibody 1791-100; Abcam), α-CK2α′ (19278-100; Abcam) and α-RNA polymerase II (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Oligonucleotides used for amplifying the precipitated IL-1β promoter region were from promoter primer set –I (Tables 1 and 2). IL-1β enhancer-specific primers were 5′-AGCGGTCTCCTTGGGAAGA-3′ and 5′-ACCATCCCATCCATCTCAGG-3′. β2m promoter primers for control ChlP assays were 5′-CCCAGTCTAGTGCATGCCTTC-3′ and 5′-ACGCAGTGCCAGGTTAGAGAG-3′.TABLE 1Primer sequences and amplicon position along the human IL-1β promoterSetAmpliconPrimer sequences-IX-775 to -685F, ATGGATATTCTTACAGAAACAATATTCCCR, TGAACCAGATCAATGCCAGATG-VIII-673 to -583F, GGCTAGGGTAACAGCACCTGGR, GGTATGCAGGGTTCAGGCTC-VII-597 to -507F, TGAACCCTGCATACCGTATGR, CCTCGGGAGCTCTCTGTC-VI-503 to -413F, GAACAGCACCCAAGGTAGAGACR, CCACTTACAGATGGATAAATGG-V-436 to -346F, TACCCATTTATCCATCTGTAAGTGR, ACACAGATTTATACATGCACATAC-IV-347 to -257F, GTGTCTTCCACTTTGTCCCACR, TTGTGCAGTTGATGTCCAC-III-258 to -168F, AACGATTGTCAGGAAAACAATGR, CTGGTTCATGGAAGGGC-II-199 to -109F, AGTTTGCTACTCCTTGCCCR, GGAAAAGAGTATTGGTGGAAG-I-107 to -17F, CCTTTCCTTTAACTTGATTGTGR, CTCGCTGTTTTTATAGCTTTC+I+1 to +91F, CCAAACCTCTTCGAGGCR, AAGGAAGATTAAAGTCATACTTGAG+II+127 to +217F, CTGCCTCTTTGTGTGTATGCAR, TGCAAAAAGCTGAGAGAGGAG Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Primer sequences and amplicon position along the murine IL-1β promoterSetAmpliconPrimer sequences-V-494 to -403F, GTGTCTCTCCAGAAGCCCCTGR, GCTGAGGGAGCTTTGCAGTT-IV-420 to -328F, TGCAAAGCTCCCTCAGCTTAAR, AGGATGTGCGGAACAAAGGTA-III-338 to -246F, CCGCACATCCTGACTTAAAATGTAR, TTATTTCCCCCTGGACAATTGT-II-245 to -155F, TGCCCATTTCCACCACGR, TGCTACCCTGAAATAATTTCTAATCCC-I-144 to -54F, CCCCTAAGAATTCCCATCAAGCR, GAGCTGTGAAATTTTCCCTTGG+I-76 to +16F, CCCAAGGGAAAATTTCACAGCR, ACCACTGCAGGGTTTGTTGTC Open table in a new tab Recombinant Protein Production and Kinase Assays—Recombinant His-tagged PU.1 production has been described (32Nikolajczyk B.

Recombinant PU.1was incubated in 20 μl of incubation buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate) with 1 μl of CK2 (New England Biolabs) and either 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP or 1 μl of 100 mm ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 4 μl of SDS sample buffer. Western blots were probed with 1:300 rabbit anti-PU.1 (sc-352; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Kinase Inhibitor Analyses—Human Mono Mac-6 monocytes were pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors of various intracellular signaling pathways for 3 h as detailed in Table 3. Alternatively, SP600125 and SB203580 were added 10 min prior to further treatment. LPS was then added to stimulate IL-1β transcription. Transcripts were measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR and SYBR green incorporation as detailed above. Primers approximated >97% efficiency; hence this slope is within experimental error. Values graphed are the ratio of normalized IL-1β copy number in stimulated cells: normalized IL-1β copy number in resting cells for a fold induction.

Specifically, we measured MNase sensitivity of the IL-1β promoter chromatin in multiple cell lines by CHART-PCR. Fig. 1A shows the approximate location of amplicons used to measure MNase-resistant DNA and therefore promoter chromatin packaging. The center position of each amplicon is listed (relative to transcription start) in Fig. 1, B and C. By using this method, we showed that less than 50% of the IL-1β promoters in the cellular population were packaged into an MNase-accessible structure in 293 cells, which cannot produce IL-1β, at all positions tested (Fig. 1B, open bars). Similarly, monocyte IL-1β DNA located 700 to 300 bp upstream of the transcription start site was relatively MNase-resistant (Fig. 1B, black and gray bars). In contrast, DNA positioned from –200 to +100 relative to transcription start was highly accessible to MNase digestion in human Mono-Mac-6 monocytes (up to 80%). Surprisingly, accessibility was indistinguishable in resting versus LPS-stimulated cells (black versus gray bars), despite the demonstration that only stimulated cells produced measurable levels of transcript (Fig. 3A, MM6 S). This CHART-PCR result suggests that the IL-1β promoter is packaged into a relatively accessible chromatin structure in resting monocytes that do not transcribe this gene. Further analyses focused on confirming this “poised” chromatin structure.FIGURE 3Quantitation of human IL-1β transcript normalized toβ2m. A, mRNA levels in resting (open squares) or stimulated (filled squares) Mono-Mac-6 monocytes were measured by real-time PCR. B, mRNA levels were similarly measured in resting (open circle) or stimulated (filled circle) HeLa cells, stimulated THP-1 cells (oval), stimulated THP-1/CD14 cells (open squares) or stimulated U937 cells (filled squares). Results are plotted as copy number of IL-1β transcript divided by copy number of β2m transcript. The x axis shows time of LPS stimulation prior to RNA harvest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To dismiss the trivial possibility that this poised chromatin structure is characteristic of a single cell line, we analyzed the structure of the IL-1β promoter in additional resting human cell lines (Fig. 1C). THP-1 (Fig. 1C, black bars), U937 (gray bars) and HL-60 (stippled bars) monocyte lineage cells package the IL-1β promoter into a highly MNase-accessible structure proximal to the transcription start site as compared with 293 cells (open bars). Taken together, the data strongly indicate the IL-1β promoter is packaged into MNase-accessible chromatin in monotype lineage cells independent of transcriptional status. To confirm further the constitutively accessible promoter structure and to determine its extent, we performed more traditional restriction endonuclease accessibility assays on THP-1 monocytes measuring the appearance of an accessibility fragment on Southern blots (33Boyes J. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2496-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The IL-1β promoter was relatively accessible to restriction endonuclease in THP-1 cells (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 3 and 4; arrow shows accessibility fragment), and the amount of accessibility fragment did not change upon LPS stimulation (lane 3 versus 4), consistent with the interpretation that the promoter is packaged into a poised chromatin structure. In contrast, Fig. 1E demonstrates that accessibility of the IL-1β enhancer, as indicated by the presence of an accessibility fragment (arrow), is approximately equivalent in IL-1β-negative 293 cells (lane 1), and resting and stimulated THP-1 cells (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). These data suggest that the chromatin packaging the IL-1β enhancer, in contrast to the promoter, is similarly accessible in expressing and nonexpressing cell types; hence changes in promoter but not enhancer chromatin structure may regulate the IL-1β gene in monocytes. The Poised Promoter Chromatin Structure of IL-1β Is Monocyte Lineage-specific—Toward understanding how specific the identified poised chromatin structure is among hematopoietic cell types, we measured IL-1β promoter MNase accessibility in primary B and T cells by CHART-PCR. Although both types of cells have been shown to produce IL-1β upon appropriate stimulation (34Wrenshall L.E. Stevens R.B. Cerra F.B. Platt J.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Kim H.Y. Rikihisa Y. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the promoter is MNase-insensitive from approximately –500 to –100 relative to the transcription start site in resting lymphocytes (Fig. 2A, dotted bars). This difference is not because of species differences, because murine RAW 264.7 macrophages package the promoter into an MNase-accessible structure (Fig. 2A, white bars). In contrast, murine 3T3 fibroblasts package the IL-1β promoter into an inaccessible chromatin structure (Fig. 2A, black bars). Overall, the data in Figs. 1 and 2A are consistent with the interpretation that the poised IL-1β promoter chromatin structure uniquely prepares the monocyte for rapid IL-1β production post-stimulation. To test further the novelty of the poised IL-1β promoter in monocytes/macrophages, we analyzed chromatin accessibility at several positions along the TNF-α promoter (TNF1,4,5) in resting and stimulated Mono-Mac-6 monocytes. As shown previously (36Lee J.Y. Kim N.A. Sanford A. Sullivan K.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 862-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), MNase accessibility of DNA proximal to the TNF-α promoter increased by ∼5-fold upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 2B, TNF1). Less dramatic increases in MNase accessibility were detected upstream from transcription start (TNF4 and TNF5). Taken together, data in Fig. 2 show the poised IL-1β promoter structure is both cytokine- and lineage-specific. The IL-1β Promoter Is Packaged into a Unique Poised Chromatin Structure in the Absence of Transcription—Toward ensuring that the various monocyte lines tested for IL-1β promoter structure were capable of inducible IL-1β transcription, we stimulated each line with LPS (100 ng/ml) and quantitated IL-1β transcript normalized to β2m transcript by real time PCR. Mono-Mac-6 monocytes responded rapidly to LPS (Fig. 3A, filled squares). As expected, HeLa cells do not transcribe IL-1β (Fig. 3B, open and filled circles), consistent with results from 293 cells (data not shown). Most surprisingly, THP-1 monocytes did not transcribe IL-1β in response to LPS (Fig. 3B, ovals), demonstrating that promoter accessibility is insufficient for inducible IL-1β transcription. This finding is consistent with our interpretation of a poised promoter. This interpretation is bolstered by identical findings for U937 monocytes (Fig. 3B, filled squares). Stable expression of the LPS co-receptor CD14 in THP-1 enabled the cells to respond to LPS by transcribing IL-1β (open squares), indicating THP-1 cells express many of the additional signaling molecules required for IL-1β transcription in response to LPS. Overall, these results demonstrate that monocytes, even those incapable of transcribing IL-1β in response to LPS, package the IL-1β promoter into an accessible chromatin structure. The Poised IL-1β Promoter Is Not Packaged by Hyperacetylated Histones—Toward further characterizing the poised chromatin structure of the IL-1β promoter, we measured association of hyperacetylated histone H3 (AcH3) with the human promoter in Mono-Mac-6 cells. DNA relatively distal to the IL-1β transcription start site (primer set –VII) associated with AcH3 (Fig. 4A). Both downstream regions tested (primer sets +I and +II) are also packaged by hyperacetylated histones. In contrast, DNA amplified by primer sets –Vto –I lacked hyperacetylated H3 packaging, as indicated by amplification of less than 2-fold over input. AcH3/IL-1β association was not significantly different in stimulated versus resting monocytes. Overall, the pattern of AcH3/IL-1β promoter association is consistent with the proposed poised chromatin structure. α-His control antibody did not precipitate the promoter in any cell tested (data not shown). Decreased AcH3 Packaging Proximal to the IL-1β Transcription Start Site Correlates with Decreased Histone H3 Packaging in the Poised Promoter Structure—The decreased apparent AcH3 association proximal to transcription start could be explain"

Genetic analysis has revealed that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is an indispensable intermediate of LMP1 signaling leading to activation of both NF-κB and JNK. However, the mechanism by which LMP1 engages TRAF6 for activation of NF-κB and JNK is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that TAK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase and TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2), together with TRAF6, are recruited to LMP1 through its N-terminal transmembrane region. The C-terminal cytoplasmic region of LMP1 facilitates the assembly of this complex and enhances activation of JNK. In contrast, IκB kinase γ is recruited through the C-terminal cytoplasmic region and this is essential for activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, we found that ablation of TAK1 resulted in the loss of LMP1-induced activation of JNK but not of NF-κB. These results suggest that an LMP1-associated complex containing TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 plays an essential role in the activation of JNK. However, TAK1 is not an exclusive intermediate for NF-κB activation in LMP1 signaling.

LMP1 is a transmembrane protein of 386 amino acids containing a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 24 amino acids, six transmembrane-spanning domains, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 200 amino acids (Fig. 1A). LMP1 mimics a constitutively activated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-like molecule, in the absence of ligand binding (4Cahir-McFarland E.D. Izumi K.M. Mosialos G.

The transmembrane domains of LMP1 mediate spontaneous autoaggregation within plasma membrane, and this aggregation is a prerequisite for LMP1 function (6Coffin W.F. II I Geiger T.R. Martin J.M. J.

Previous studies have identified two domains in the LMP1 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, called the C-terminal activator regions (CTARs) 1 (amino acids 194–231) and 2 (amino acids 332–386), that are important for the cell transformation activity of LMP1 (4Cahir-McFarland E.D.

Both CTAR1 and CTAR2 participate in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. CTAR1 binds to several TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), TRAF1, -2, -3, and -5, through a consensus TRAF-binding motif, while CTAR2 has been shown to bind to the TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD). However, experiments using gene knock-out and small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment have determined that neither TRAF2, TRAF5, nor TRADD is essential for LMP1 signaling (9Luftig M. Prinarakis E.

In contrast, two independent studies have shown that TRAF6, which was previously established as an essential mediator of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), is also a critical factor for LMP1-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK (9Luftig M. Prinarakis E. Yasui T. Tsichritzis T. Cahir-McFarland E. Inoue J. Nakano H. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Li X. Akira S. Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is still unclear which LMP1 domains are involved in its association with TRAF6. Moreover, the mechanism by which TRAF6 mediates LMP1 signaling has not been well studied.FIGURE 1LMP1 associates with TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6. A, schematic drawing of wild type LMP1 and mutants.

TAK1 is also involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway (12Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Following exposure of cells to IL-1, endogenous TAK1 is recruited to the TRAF6 complex and activated, upon which it stimulates both the JNK and NF-κB pathways. Several lines of evidence indicate that TAK1 is an essential mediator of innate immunity signaling: (i) TAK1 deletion or siRNA targeting TAK1 abolishes IL-1-induced NF-κB activation (13Takaesu G.

Khush R.S. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M. Lemaitre B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have isolated TAB2 and its homologue TAB3, proteins that interact with TAK1. TAB2 and TAB3 are also intermediates in a proinflammatory signaling pathways (17Ishitani T.

Knockdown of both TAB2 and TAB3 by siRNA diminishes IL-1 responses. Although TAB2 and TAB3 have overlapping functions, TAB2 is more directly involved in the TRAF6 pathway. TAB2 directly associates with TRAF6 as well as TAK1, and this interaction facilitates the assembly of a signaling complex consisting of TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 in response to IL-1 and RANK ligand stimulation (18Takaesu G.

Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A recent report has demonstrated that TAK1 is activated by LMP1 and that knockdown of TAK1 expression by siRNA causes a defect in LMP1-induced JNK activation (10Wan J. Sun L. Mendoza J.W. Chui Y.L. Huang D.P. Chen Z.J. Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Yeh W.C. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Liu Z.G. Wu Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This suggests that TAK1 participates in LMP1 signaling. However, the exact connections among LMP1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF-κB, and JNK remain to be established. Here we report that TAK1 and TAB2 are involved in LMP1 signaling. We found that TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 were assembled into a complex with LMP1. Assembly of these factors was capable of activating JNK and was mediated through the transmembrane region of LMP1. In contrast, activation of NF-κB absolutely requires the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of LMP1 where IKK is recruited. Furthermore, we found that TAK1 was essential for LMP1-induced JNK activation but dispensable for LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation. These results suggest that the formation of the TRAF6-TAB2-TAK1 complex with LMP1 mediates activation of JNK, while IKK recruited into the C-terminal region of LMP1 can be activated through multiple pathways that may include TAK1.

To generate pCMV-Flag-LMP1 and pCMV-HA-JNK vectors, a BamHI fragment from pSG5-Flag-LMP1 or pSRα-HA-JNK was subcloned into a pCMV mammalian expression vector. Flag-LMP1-(1–186) and -(25–186) mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into pCMV vectors. The PCR products were verified by sequencing. To generate expression vector of C-terminal Flag-fused transferrin receptor, cDNA were excised from pcD-transferrin receptor (purchased from ATCC) and subcloned into pCMV-C-Flag vector. T7-TAK1 and HA-TRAF6 were also subcloned into pCMV vectors. To knockdown the expression of TAK1, siRNA targeting TAK1 were used. Oligonuclotides corresponded to nucleotides 88–106 of the TAK1 coding region were subcloned into the BS/H1 vector to produce siRNA.

For the transfection studies, 293 cells (5 × 105 cells) were plated in 10-cm-diameter dishes, transfected with a total of 10 μg of DNA containing various expression vectors by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and incubated for 36–48 h. TAK1+/+ and TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs and HeLa S3 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and TransFast™ transfection reagent (Promega).

Anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-HA (HA.11) monoclonal antibody (Babco), anti-HA (Y-11) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen), anti-TRAF2 (H-249) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-JNK1 (FL) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Sigma), and anti-p65 (A) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) was used to detect the phosphorylated forms of JNK. The TAK1 inhibitor, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, has been described previously (15Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kajino T. Ono K. Ohtomo T. Matsumoto M. Shiina M. Mihara M. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol.

Generation of Cell Lines Stably Expressing T7-TAK1—To establish stable cell lines that express wild type TAK1, TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs were transfected with pCMV-T7-TAK1 together with an expression vector for hygromycin resistance. Hygromycin-resistant clones were selected in medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem), and expression of T7-TAK1 was verified by immunoblotting with anti-TAK1. Generation of Cell Lines Stably Expressing siRNA for TAK1—To establish stable cell lines that express siRNA-targeting TAK1, HeLa S3 cells were transfected with pBS/H1-TAK1 siRNA vector together with an expression vector for neomycin resistance. Neomycin-resistant clones were selected in medium containing 500 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and expression of TAK1 was determined by immunoblotting. Reporter Gene Assays—For the reporter gene assays, 293 cells (8 × 104 cells), TAK1+/+ or TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs (3 × 104 cells) were plated into six-well dishes (35 mm), or HeLa S3 cells (1.5 × 104 cells) were plated into 12-well dishes. At 24 h after seeding, cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid and expression vectors as indicated. Some cells were treated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for 36 h. An Ig-κ-firefly luciferase reporter was used to measure NF-κB-dependent gene activation. An AP-1-firefly luciferase reporter was used to measure AP-1-dependent gene activation. Plasmids encoding β-galactosidase under the control of the β-actin promoter or Renilla luciferase under the control of the EF1α promoter were used to normalize transfection efficiency. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100). For co-precipitation assay, cells were lysed in 0.3 ml of RIPA buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3Vo4, 20 μm aprotinin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Proteins from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of various antibodies and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl), once with rinse buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and resuspended in 30 μl of rinse buffer. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Retardation Analysis—293 cells, TAK1+/+, or TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs were either left untreated or treated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for 30 min and harvested and lysed for use in gel retardation assays. 32P-Labeled NF-κB oligonucleotides (Promega) were used. The binding reactions containing the radiolabeled probe, 15 μg of cell extracts, 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 30 μl were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). For supershift assays, 1 μg of control rabbit IgG or anti-p65 were added to the reactions and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before probes were added. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. We have previously demonstrated that TAK1 and its adapter protein TAB2 play important roles in IL-1 and RANKL signaling pathways via complex formation with TRAF6 (18Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A.

Recently, it was shown that TRAF6 is an indispensable intermediate in LMP1 signaling (9Luftig M. Prinarakis E. Yasui T. Tsichritzis T. Cahir-McFarland E. Inoue J. Nakano H. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Li X.

This raised the possibility that TAK1 and TAB2 also participate in LMP1 signaling. To test this possibility, we used co-precipitation assays in human embryonic kidney 293 cells to examine whether LMP1 associates with TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6 (Fig. 1, B–D). 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for Flag-tagged LMP1 (Flag-LMP1), together with HA-tagged TAK1 (HA-TAK1), HA-tagged TAB2 (HA-TAB2), or HA-tagged TRAF6 (HA-TRAF6). Flag-tagged transferrin receptor (Flag-TfR) was used as a control membrane protein. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or anti-HA monoclonal antibody and co-precipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. We found that TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6 were capable of associating with LMP1. The N-terminal transmembrane region of LMP1 mediates autoaggregation, which is a prerequisite for LMP1 activation (6Coffin W.F. II I Geiger T.R. Martin J.M. J.

To determine which domain is involved in the binding of TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6, we utilized several LMP1 mutant constructs (Fig. 1A). The LMP1-AA, -ID, and -DM mutants (kindly provided by Dr. Kieff) have mutations in essential amino acid residues of CTAR1, CTAR2, and both, respectively (21Higuchi M. Izumi K.M. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4675-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, we generated the mutant LMP1-(1–186) and LMP1-(25–186), which lack the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic tail and both the N-terminal and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains, respectively. We transfected expression vectors for these various LMP1 mutants together with HA-TAK1, HA-TAB2, or HA-TRAF6 (Fig. 1B-D). We found that TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6 were co-precipitated with all three types of LMP1 mutations: LMP1-AA, -ID, and -DM. These results suggest that the CTAR1 and CTAR2 domains are not involved in the association of LMP1 with TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6. Furthermore, even LMP1-(1–186) or -(25–186) could co-precipitate TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6, although they seem to associate less efficiently with TAK1 and TRAF6. The reciprocal immunoprecipitation study (Fig. 1, B–D, right panels) confirmed that TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6 could co-precipitate WT LMP1 and LMP1-AA, -ID, -DM, and -(1–186). These results suggest that TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6 interact with LMP1 primarily through the N-terminal transmembrane region. The C-terminal region of LMP1 might stabilize the assembly of the complex. To verify the physiological relevance of these interactions, we next investigated the complexes between LMP1 and endogenous molecules. We transfected 293 cells with expression vectors for various versions of Flag-LMP1 and used anti-Flag antibody to immunoprecipitate complexes. We then attempted to detect co-precipitated endogenous proteins including TRAF2, TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 (Fig. 2A). TRAF2 is known to associate with LMP1 through the CTAR1 domain (22Devergne O. Hatzivassiliou E. Izumi K.M. Kaye K.M. Kleijnen M.F. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7098-7108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, TRAF2 was found to associate with WT LMP1 and the LMP1-ID mutant but not with the LMP1-AA, -DM, or -(1–186) mutants (Fig. 2A). In contrast, we found that TRAF6 was co-precipitated with WT LMP1 and LMP1-AA, -ID, -DM, and -(1–186) mutants. TAB2 and TAK1 were also co-precipitated with WT LMP1 and LMP1-AA, -ID, and -DM, and less efficiently with LMP1-(1–186). This is consistent with the results from overexpression proteins shown above. The reciprocal immunoprecipitation was performed in cell extracts from WT LMP1 and LMP1-(1–186) expressing cells (Fig. 2B). TAK1 could co-precipitate WT LMP1 but less effectively LMP1-(1–186). These results suggest that LMP1 can recruit TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 through its N-terminal transmembrane region and that the C-terminal region functions to stabilize the complex. The N-terminal transmembrane region is essential for the action of LMP1. However, the functional role of the N terminus has not been fully addressed. We therefore examined the effects of LMP1-(1–186) expression on the activation of JNK and NF-κB (Fig. 3). 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for various Flag-LMP1 mutants. Activation of JNK was detected by immunoblotting with phospho-specific JNK antibody. The CTAR domains of LMP1 have been implicated in JNK activation (23Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Young L.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kieser A. Kaiser C. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2511-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that mutations at both CTAR domains and the deletion of the C-terminal region impaired JNK activation (Fig. 3A). However, we found that the N-terminal transmembrane region alone had some ability to activate JNK when it was highly expressed (Fig. 3A, left and right panels). This activation might be correlated with the recruitment of TAK1, TAB2, and TRAF6 into the LMP1 complex, which occur weakly with the LMP1-(1–186) and most strongly with the WT LMP1.FIGURE 3Effect of LMP1 mutations on activation of JNK and NF-κB. A, 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for various versions of Flag-LMP1. Increasing amounts of Flag-LMP1-(1–186) vectors were used. The activated form of JNK was detected with phospho-JNK antibody (P-JNK). B, 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for various versions of Flag-LMP1. The amounts of plasmids were the same as in A. Cell lysates were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using NF-κB DNA probe (top panel). NF-κB binding was confirmed by supershift with anti-p65. The amounts of p65 in the cell lysates and expression levels of LMP1 are also shown. IB, immunoblotting; WCE, whole cell extracts. C, 293 cells were transfected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter and pAct-β-galactosidase plasmids, together with expression vectors for various versions of Flag-LMP1 or Flag-TfR. Increasing amounts of Flag-LMP1-(1–186) vectors were used. Luciferase activity was determined and normalized to the levels of β-galactosidase activity. Stimulation relative to control transfection with empty vector is shown.

WCE, whole cell extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NF-κB activation was examined by employing an NF-κB electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3B) and NF-κB-dependent reporter assay (Fig. 3C). In agreement with earlier studies (22Devergne O. Hatzivassiliou E. Izumi K.M. Kaye K.M. Kleijnen M.F. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7098-7108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Izumi K.M. Kieff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12592-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), disruption of either CTAR1 or CTAR2 (LMP1-AA or -ID mutants) reduced NF-κB binding activity, while the double mutation (LMP1-DM) abolished NF-κB activation (Fig. 3B). The LMP1-(1–186) mutant was completely unable to stimulate NF-κB binding activity. The NF-κB-dependent reporter assay further confirmed that the LMP1-(1–186) mutant could not activate NF-κB (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that formation of a complex containing TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1, assembled through interactions with the LMP1 N-terminal transmembrane region, might directly participate in JNK activation but is not sufficient to mediate NF-κB activation. Lack of NF-κB activation by the LMP1 transmembrane region suggests that the signaling complex formed through the transmembrane region is not sufficient to activate NF-κB. We therefore hypothesized that the downstream effectors may not be recruited in the complex of LMP1 transmembrane region. We examined whether IKK is contained in the LMP1 complex. We transfected expression vectors for IKKγ together with the WT LMP1 and LMP1-AA, -ID, -DM, LMP1-(1–186), or LMP1-(25–186) (Fig. 3D, left panels). We found that IKKγ was precipitated with WT LMP1 and LMP1-AA, -ID, and -DM but not with the C-terminal truncated mutants. This result indicates that the LMP1 recruits IKKγ through its C-terminal region. Therefore, the transmembrane region alone is not sufficient for recruitment of the IKK complex. LMP-DM has ability to recruit IKKγ despite the fact that it does not activate NF-κB. This suggests that any of TRAF2, TRAF5, or TRADD, which is recruited through CTAR domains, is likely to be essential for NF-κB activation. We next looked at relationship between TAK1 and IKKγ in the LMP1 complex. We transfected expression vectors for IKKγ, TAK1, together with the WT LMP1 or LMP1-(1–186) (Fig. 3D, right panels). TAK1 was not co-precipited with IKKγ in the absence of LMP1. Expression of WT LMP1 but not LMP1-(1–186) greatly increased interaction of TAK1 with IKKγ. These results suggest that TAK1 by itself does not interact with IKKγ and that integrity of LMP1 is important for assembly of the signaling complex leading to NF-κB activation. We next asked whether TAK1 is essential for LMP1 signaling by utilizing a selective inhibitor of TAK1, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (Fig. 4). As shown previously (15Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kajino T. Ono K. Ohtomo T. Matsumoto M. Shiina M. Mihara M. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18485-18490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), 10–30 nm 5Z-7-oxozeaenol can inhibit activation of JNK by TNF (Fig. 4A) and IL-1 treatments (data not shown). Cells expressing LMP1 were treated with vehicle or 5Z-7-oxozeaenol every 12 h, and JNK activity was measured. 5Z-7-oxozeaenol completely blocked LMP1-induced JNK activation, to an extent similar to its inhibition of the TNF response (Fig. 4A). We next tested the effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol on LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation using an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (Fig. 4B). As described previously (15Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kajino T. Ono K. Ohtomo T. Matsumoto M. Shiina M. Mihara M. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18485-18490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), 5Z-7-oxozeaenol effectively blocked TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, while overexpression of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) activated NF-κB independently of TAK1. We found that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol had only marginal effect on LMP1-induced NF-κB activation. These results suggest that TAK1 is primarily involved in LMP1 signaling leading to activation of JNK but not of NF-κB. To further define the role of TAK1 in LMP1 signaling, we utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts having a homozygous deletion of the ATP-binding site within the TAK1 kinase domain (amino acids 41–77) (TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs) (Fig. 5A). This cell line was obtained by infecting MEFs containing homozygous TAK1 genes flanked by loxP sites with a Cre-expressing retroviral vector (14Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takewuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The line was subsequently immortalized using the 3T3 protocol. We examined LMP1-induced JNK activation in TAK1+/+ and TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs transfected with HA-tagged JNK. JNK activity was measured by immunoprecipitation of HA-JNK (HA-JNK) followed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-JNK (Fig. 5B). An inhibitor of the peptidyltransferase reaction, anisomycin, can trigger a ribotoxic stress response that strongly activates JNK. We found that anisomycin activated JNK in both TAK1+/+ and TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs. In contrast, LMP1 activated JNK in TAK1+/+ but not in TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs. To verify whether the defect is due to the TAK1 deficiency, we generated TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs stably expressing wild type T7-tagged TAK1 (T7-TAK1) (Fig. 5B, right panels). Expression of TAK1 in TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs could restore LMP1-induced JNK activation. These results confirmed that TAK1 is an essential mediator of LMP1 signaling leading to JNK activation.FIGURE 5TAK1 is essential for LMP1-induced JNK activation. A, schematic drawing of TAK1Δ. B, TAK1+/+, TAK1Δ/Δ, and T7-TAK1-expressing TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs were transfected with expression vectors for HA-JNK and Flag-LMP1. Some cells were treated with anisomycin for 30 min prior to harvest.

Stimulation relative to control transfection with empty vector is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation in TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs (Fig. 5, C and D). An earlier study had shown that deletion of TAK1 causes impaired TNF signaling (13Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 14Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takewuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). As expected, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that TNF-induced NF-κB binding activity was impaired in TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs (Fig. 5C). In contrast, we found that LMP1 was able to activate NF-κB binding activity to a similar or somewhat higher degree in TAK1 Δ/Δ MEFs compared with TAK1+/+ MEFs. We also examined activity of an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (Fig. 5D). We found that LMP1 activated NF-κBin both TAK1+/+ and TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs. TAK1Δ/Δ expresses a truncated version of TAK1 that only lacks the ATP-binding site as described above. Although this mutant TAK1 has no kinase activity, it may be possible that the truncated TAK1 still can promote activation of NF-κB in a manner of independent of kinase activity. To clarify this possibility, we used HeLa S3 cells stably expressing TAK1 siRNA in which expression of TAK1 is significantly decreased (Fig. 5E, left panels). To assess whether lack of TAK1 protein alters LMP1-dependent signaling pathways, we examined LMP-1-induced JNK activation (Fig. 5E, right panels) and activity of AP-1- or NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (Fig. 5F). AP-1-dependent reporter construct was used to assess the downstream events of JNK. LMP1 could not activate JNK in the cells expressing TAK1 siRNA, which is consistent with the results from TAK1 deletion MEFs. Activation of AP-1 was also impaired by TAK1 depletion, while activation of NF-κB was not affected. These results confirm that TAK1 is dispensable for LMP1-induced NF-κB activation. It is likely that TAK1 redundantly functions to activate NF-κB with other kinases in LMP1 pathway. The transmembrane region of LMP1 is essential for LMP1 signaling. Autoaggregation through the LMP1 transmembrane region is thought to trigger downstream signaling (6Coffin W.F. II I Geiger T.R. Martin J.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3749-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Yasui T. Luftig M. Soni V. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of the N-terminal transmembrane region has not been closely examined. Here we demonstrate that TRAF6, TAK1, and its binding protein TAB2 can associate with LMP1 through the LMP1 N-terminal transmembrane region (Figs. 1 and 2). This reveals a novel role of LMP1 transmembrane region in the facilitating assembly of a signaling complex consisting of TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 (Fig. 6). The C-terminal region appears to enhance this assembly as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. We also demonstrated that expression of just the N-terminal transmembrane region of LMP1 has the ability to activate JNK (Fig. 3A). This suggests that an LMP1 transmembrane complex containing TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 can mediate activation of JNK. LMP1 C-terminal region functions to stabilize the complex and enhances JNK activation. The present study also revealed that TAK1 is essential for LMP1-induced activation of JNK (Fig. 4A and 5, B, E, and F). Taken together, assembly of a signaling complex composed of LMP1-TRAF6-TAB2-TAK1 mediates activation of JNK (Fig. 6). In agreement with earlier studies, we demonstrated that the N-terminal transmembrane region alone is completely unable to activate NF-κB (Fig. 3, B and C). This suggests that the LMP1-TRAF6-TAB2-TAK1 signaling complex could not mediate activation of NF-κB. In IL-1 signaling pathway, TAK1, TAB2 and TRAF6 make a signaling complex and activate IKK. However, in this process, not only forming the complex of TRAF6-TAB2-TAK1 but also recruitment of IKKs into this complex is indispensable for IKK activation (26Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, 27Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether LMP1 mutants can recruit IKKs. We found that IKKγ is recruited by WT LMP1 but not by LMP1-(1–186) (Fig. 3D). This result suggests that LMP1 transmembrane region recruits TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 but not the IKK complex resulting in failure of IKK activation. TAK1 is essential for IL-1- and TNF-induced activation both of JNK and of NF-κB (14Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takewuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, we found that TAK1 is dispensable for LMP-1-induced NF-κB activation despite the fact that TAK1 is recruited into the LMP1 complex. This raises possibility that other MAPKKK kinases such as NIK, which can activate NF-κB, may function redundantly with TAK1. NIK is indeed implicated in LMP1 signaling (27Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L.

LMP1 may be able to recruit not only TAK1 but also NIK and transmits the signal leading to activation of JNK and NF-κB. It is worth noting that NIK does not have ability to activate JNK, whereas TAK1 can activate both JNK and NF-κB. TAB2 can bind directly TRAF6 and TAK1 and thereby mediate assembly of a TRAF6-TAB2-TAK1 signaling complex (19Mizukami J. Takaesu G. Akatsuka H. Sakurai H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Sakurai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We show here that TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 are also components of the LMP1 complex. Thus, it is likely that TAB2 facilitates assembly of the LMP1 complex by binding to both TRAF6 and TAK1. This may appear inconsistent with earlier studies showing that TAB2 is dispensable for activation of both JNK and NF-κB in LMP1 signaling (9Luftig M. Prinarakis E. Yasui T. Tsichritzis T.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, we previously reported that a homologue of TAB2, TAB3, plays a redundant role with TAB2 in the IL-1 and TNF signaling pathways (16Vidal S. Khush R.S. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M. Lemaitre B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that in TAB2 knock-out cells, TAB3 might compensate for the function of TAB2 in LMP1 complex assembly. This newly identified LMP1 complex containing TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1 appears to be important for the activity of LMP1. Further studies utilizing TAK1 deletion mice may help revealing the in vivo role of this complex in B-cell transformation. We thank E. Kieff and E. Nishida for materials."

Substrate specificity is a fundamental property that determines the specificity and fidelity of signaling by protein tyrosine kinases. However, how protein tyrosine kinases recognize the protein substrates is not well understood.

PTKs are important mediators of signal transduction and key targets of anticancer drug discovery (2Hunter T. Harvey Lect. 1999; 94: 81-119Google Scholar). They mediate cellular signaling by responding to upstream signals and phosphorylating protein substrates on Tyr residues. To send a regulatory signal to specific protein targets, each PTK phosphorylates only one or a few protein substrates on specific tyrosine residues. Thus, substrate specificity determines signaling specificity and fidelity and distinguishes one PTK from another (3Miller W.T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).One of the best understood PTK regulatory systems is the regulation of Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) by phosphorylation of a Tyr on its C-terminal tail (4Brown M.T.

Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar). There are nine kinases in the Src family, and each one contains, from the N to the C terminus, a myristoylation motif, a unique region, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, a catalytic domain, and a regulatory C-terminal tail. The C-terminal tail contains a Tyr residue (Tyr-527 in avian Src) for phosphorylation by the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) (6Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This exemplifies the largely unanswered question of how PTKs recognize protein substrates in general.Although the Tyr residue for phosphorylation is located on the C-terminal tail of SFKs, SFKs are ∼50,000-fold better substrates than peptides, mimicking the C-terminal tails (kcat/Km ratio comparison) (13Sondhi D. Xu W. Songyang Z. Eck M.J. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutagenic studies confirm that the C-terminal tail does not contain all necessary determinants for Csk recognition (14Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SFKs contain structural motifs located away from the C-terminal tail that are recognized by Csk, and by extension, that Csk contains a SFK recognition site away from the active site. These suggestions would imply that remote docking interactions are a key component of Csk-Src recognition. Since PTK substrate specificity can rarely be accounted for by local amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation site, such a docking-based substrate recognition mechanism may apply to many, if not all, PTKs.We have recently (15Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) determined that the Csk catalytic domain contains a substrate-docking site that is crucial for the recognition and phosphorylation of Src. Four residues located in a region centered on the α-helix D in the peptide-binding lobe are critical for Csk to bind to and phosphorylate Src. Csk mutants carrying multiple mutations at these positions are fully or nearly fully active toward a peptide substrate but unable to bind to, phosphorylate, or regulate Src. Furthermore, a peptide mimicking the sequence of the α-helix D inhibits Csk phosphorylation of Src with a 20-fold higher potency than Csk phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. These results compellingly demonstrate that these residues are key determinants of the Csk substrate-docking site for specifically recognizing Src family kinases.Building on this foundation, the current study identified key residues in Src that are crucial for Csk recognition and examined their interactions with the substrate-docking site of Csk. The results demonstrated a docking-based mechanism for Csk-Src recognition. This finding should facilitate our effort to understand PTK substrate recognition and specificity in general.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Reagents—All reagents used for bacterial culture and protein expression were purchased from Fisher. Chromatographic resins, glutathione-agarose, iminodiacetic acid-agarose, and Sephadex G25 were purchased from Sigma. DNA primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci mol-1) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Recombinant Protein Expression and Site-specific Mutagenesis—Wild type human Csk was expressed in Escherichia coli (DH5α) using pGEX-Csk-st plasmid (16Sun G. Budde R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutants were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The chicken Src mutant devoid of kinase activity (kdSrc) was co-expressed with GroEL and GroES chaperone in BL21(DE3) (14Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Full-length human yes gene was closed from a human fetal cDNA library (17Sun G. Budde R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and inserted into the pRSET-A plasmid for expression of a His6-Yes fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified as described for kdSrc. Yes-TM was generated by QuikChange. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford method and A280 in 6 m urea, and the purity was examined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.Kinase Activity Assays—Kinase activity of Csk and mutants was determined using polyE4Y or kdSrc as the substrate as described previously (15Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylation reactions were performed in 50-μl volumes at 30 °C in the protein kinase assay buffer: 50 mm EPPS (pH 8.0) containing 5% glycerol, 0.005% Triton X-100, and 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol. The standard assay used 3 nm WT Csk, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP ([γ-32P]ATP, 1,000 dpm pmol-1), and 1 mg ml-1 polyE4Y or 10 μm kdSrc. After a 10-min reaction time, 35 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto Whatman filter paper strips (2 × 1 cm), which were washed in 5% trichloroacetic acid at 65 °C three times for 20 min each. The radioactivity incorporated into polyE4Y or kdSrc was determined by liquid scintillation counting. All assays were performed in duplicates and at least three times with reproducible results.To determine the catalytic parameters of Csk using kdSrc as a substrate, 1-20 μm kdSrc was used as the variable substrate. The assays were performed as described above. The reaction minus Csk was used as background controls. The background was under 2,000 cpm, whereas the signals were in the range of 10,000-100,000 cpm. The Km, and kcat values were determined using double reciprocal plot.Csk Inactivation of Yes—The ability of Csk to inactivate Yes and Yes-TM was determined as described previously (18Sun G. Sharma A.K. Budde R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Yes and Yes-TM (250 ng) was incubated with Csk (3 nm) in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP and 12 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 10 min. To determine Yes and Yes-TM phosphorylation, [γ-32P]ATP (10,000 dpm pmol-1) was used in the phosphorylation reaction, and a sample of 10 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn at indicated times. The reaction was mixed right away with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 90 °C for 10 min. The proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. To determine the effect of Csk phosphorylation on Yes kinase activity, non-radioactive ATP was used in the Csk phosphorylation reaction. At different times, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn, and the Yes activity was determined using 0.4 mg/ml RCM-lysozyme and [γ-32P]ATP (1000 dpm pmol-1). Since RCM-lysozyme was preferentially phosphorylated by Yes, the residual Yes activity after the initial incubation could be accurately determined without removing Csk from the incubation. To minimize continued Csk phosphorylation of Yes during the activity assay, the reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 min. The reactions were stopped by spotting onto filter papers and washing with 5% warm trichloroacetic acid. The phosphate incorporated into RCM-lysozyme was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Similar reactions in the absence of Yes were carried out in parallel and used as background.RESULTSAnalysis of Csk-Src Recognition Using a Kinase-defective Src Mutant—A kinase-defective Src mutant (kdSrc, containing the K295M mutation) is well expressed in bacteria (14Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), retains the specificity for phosphorylation by Csk on the C-terminal tail Tyr, and does not autophosphorylate; thus, it serves as a faithful and convenient substrate for kinetic and mutagenic analyses of Src recognition by Csk (15Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To characterize the recognition of Src by Csk, we generated several deletion or site-specific mutants of kdSrc and determined their phosphorylation by Csk (Fig. 1, A-C). Src contains an SH3 and an SH2 domain in addition to the catalytic domain; however, the catalytic domain with the C-terminal tail (cata-kdSrc) is still readily phosphorylated by Csk (kcat/Km ratio of 3.7 × 105 kdSrc versus 9.5 × 105 m-1s- for the catalytic domain) (14Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 1C). Thus, the Src SH3 and SH2 domains do not contain the structural motifs recognized by Csk. To assess the relative contribution of local and remote docking interactions to Src-Csk recognition, two other constructs were generated. The first was a kdSrc mutant in which 3 residues on each side of the tail Tyr (Tyr-527) were mutated to Ala (kdSrc-6A), and the second was a fusion protein between GST and the Src C-terminal tail (GST-Src tail). A previous study demonstrated that the 3 residues on the amino side of Tyr-527 were important for Csk phosphorylation (14Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, kdSrc-6A was still readily phosphorylated by Csk. Initial velocity comparisons indicated that kdSrc-6A retained about 10% of the kdSrc ability to be phosphorylated by Csk. This indicated that remote docking interactions are sufficient for Src to be recognized by Csk, although the local sequences contribute significantly to this recognition. In contrast, Csk phosphorylation of GST-Src tail was non-detectable under identical conditions, consistent with reports that the C-terminal peptides are very poor substrate for Csk (13Sondhi D. Xu W. Songyang Z. Eck M.J. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results confirmed the essential roles of remote docking interactions in Csk-Src recognition and located the docking determinants to the catalytic domain of Src.Ala Scanning Identifies Three Src Residues Crucial for Csk Recognition—The Src catalytic domain is composed of an ATP-binding lobe and a peptide-binding lobe. Because the ATP-binding lobe is highly conserved in structure and function among PTKs, the docking determinants for Csk recognition are likely to be located on the peptide-binding lobe. We used the following criteria to identify the putative residues as potential docking determinants. First, because all SFKs are substrates for Csk, the docking determinants are likely conserved in SFKs but not in other PTKs. Second, the residues that interact with Csk would need to be surface-exposed. Third, because the Csk substrate-docking site is dominated by 3 Arg residues (15Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the Src determinants are likely dominated by residues either negatively charged or otherwise attracted to positively charged residues. We aligned the primary sequences of SFKs and Csk family kinases in the peptide-binding lobe and identified the residues that met these criteria (Fig. 2). In the alignment, the 2 residues with a negative charge, Asp and Glu, were not differentiated. A total of 14 residues met these criteria. Six of the residues were located in the activation loop. Because the function of the activation loop in Src regulation was well defined, the residues from the activation loop were not included for further studies. The other 8 residues were selected for further studies: Asp-365, Asp-489, Glu-504, Glu-505, Glu-510, Tyr-511, Glu-517, and Asp-518.FIGURE 2Amino acid sequence alignment in the peptide-binding lobe for the Csk and Src family kinases.

The ability of the purified mutants to serve as substrates for Csk was determined (Fig. 3A). Three mutants displayed phosphorylation by Csk less than 50% of that for kdSrc: E510A, Y511A, and D518A. All 3 residues are located on the α-helix J immediately preceding the C-terminal tail. Upon identification of the 3 α-helix J residues, we observed that 7 other residues (Glu-470, Asp-473, Glu-476, Glu-486, Asp-493, Gln-497, and Asp-502) located nearby had the potential to interact with the Arg residues of Csk. Although these residues are not strictly uniquely conserved in the Src family, they can also be part of the docking determinants. These were also analyzed by Ala scanning (Fig. 3B), but none of the mutants displayed significantly decreased phosphorylation by Csk. These results suggest that Glu-510, Tyr-511, and Asp-518 are the major determinants in Src for Csk recognition.FIGURE 3Identification of the Src residues crucial for Csk recognition. A and B, Csk phosphorylation of kdSrc mutants. Details of the assay are described under “Materials and Methods.” The assays were performed five times in duplicates.

Mutating each residue did not dramatically alter the kcat but significantly increased the Km, indicating that each mutation significantly affected Csk-Src recognition. The kdSrc-TM had a similar Km to kdSrc but a dramatically decreased kcat. The surprising recovery of the low Km and the dramatic decrease in kcat for kdSrc-TM contradicted the kcat-Km trend for the individual mutations. Currently, we do not have a ready explanation for this observation and continue to investigate the molecular basis for these kinetic observations. Whatever the detailed binding mechanism is for kdSrc-TM, mutation of the 3 residues resulted in a greater than 98% decrease in kdSrc phosphorylation by Csk. These results indicate that Glu-510, Tyr-511, and Asp-518 are the crucial determinants for Csk recognition.Src Family Kinase Yes Uses Corresponding Residues for Csk Recognition—Since kdSrc is not active as a kinase, it has two drawbacks when used for analyzing Src phosphorylation by Csk. First, we cannot assess the effect of a mutation on Src kinase activity to determine whether a mutational effect is specific for Src recognition by Csk. Second, kdSrc cannot be used to determine whether a mutation affects Src inactivation by Csk. To overcome these drawbacks, we used another Src family kinase, Yes, which could be expressed as an active kinase in bacteria, to examine the mutational effects. Like Src, Yes is inactivated by phosphorylation on the C-terminal Tyr and activated by autophosphorylation on a Tyr in the activation loop (17Sun G. Budde R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Sun G. Sharma A.K. Budde R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To remove the interference of Yes autophosphorylation, the autophosphorylation site of Yes was mutated from Tyr to Phe. On this background (referred to as Yes), the 3 corresponding residues, Glu-520, Tyr-521, and Asp-528, were mutated to Ala to generate Yes-TM. Yes and Yes-TM were expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in bacteria and purified. Yes-TM (84.7 nmol min-1 mg-1) had a comparable specific kinase activity as Yes (91.3 nmol min-1 mg-1), indicating that the triple mutation did not disrupt the folding and activity of the enzyme. When incubated with Csk and ATP, Yes was readily phosphorylated by Csk (Fig. 4A, top), whereas the phosphorylation of Yes-TM by Csk was markedly reduced (Fig. 4A, bottom). In the absence of Csk, both Yes and Yes-TM underwent similar levels of autophosphorylation, most likely on the C-terminal tail Tyr (19Osusky M. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25729-25732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The abilities of Csk to phosphorylate and inactivate Yes and Yes-TM were then compared. Upon incubation with ATP and Csk, Yes was rapidly inactivated, losing more than 80% of the initial activity within 1.5 min. However, Yes-TM retained more than 80% of the initial activity after 20 min of incubation with Csk and ATP (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that Glu-520, Tyr-521, and Asp-528 are crucial for Yes recognition and phosphorylation by Csk. Overall, these results and those with kdSrc demonstrate that the mutational effects of the 3 residues are specific for Csk recognition.FIGURE 4Phosphorylation and inactivation of Yes and Yes-TM by Csk.

The mutated Csk residues are key determinants of the Csk substrate-docking site that could interact with the 3 Src docking residues. If 2 residues, one from Csk and the other from kdSrc, interact with each other, the effects of their mutations would not be additive. On the other hand, mutations of 2 residues that do not interact with each other would likely have additive effects. The result of this analysis is shown in Fig. 5A. Most of the mutant combinations were approximately additive with one exception, kdSrc mutant E510A and Csk mutant R283A. E510A exhibited 44% of kdSrc activity as a substrate for WT Csk, whereas Csk R283A was 16% as effective as WT Csk in phosphorylating kdSrc. If the two mutations have additive effects, 6.3% phosphorylation would be expected. However, Csk R283A exhibited almost identical activity as WT Csk in phosphorylating kdSrc-E510A. This indicated that although R283A mutation dramatically decreases the ability of CSK to phosphorylate kdSrc, this mutation has no effect on Csk phosphorylation of kdSrc-E510A. This lack of additivity suggests that Arg-283 of Csk interacts with Glu-510 of kdSrc in Csk-Src recognition.FIGURE 5Characterization of Src residues Glu-510, Tyr-511, and Asp-518 in Src-Csk recognition. A, phosphorylation of a panel of kdSrc mutants by Csk mutants in the substrate-docking site. B, phosphorylation of kdSrc and kdSrc mutant E510A by Csk and Csk variants at position 283. C, phosphorylation of kdSrc variants at position 511 by Csk. D, phosphorylation of kdSrc variants at position 518 by Csk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the possibility of Csk Arg-283 interacting with Src Glu-510, we determined how various combinations of positive and negative charges at these two positions affected Csk phosphorylation of kdSrc (Fig. 5B). Using kdSrc (with Glu at position 510) as a substrate, mutation of Csk Arg-283 to Lys, Ala, and Glu resulted in progressively more severe losses of activity. The least phosphorylation (6% of Csk phosphorylation of kdSrc) was observed when Glu replaced Arg-283 in Csk. However, using kdSrc E510A as a substrate, the activity trend for the Csk mutants was reversed, with WT Csk and Csk R283K displaying the lowest activity. The highest activity was observed with Csk R283E. These comparisons demonstrated that the identity of an optimal residue at Csk 283 depends on what residue is present at position 510 of kdSrc. When kdSrc contains a negatively charged Glu at position 510, a positively charged Arg is optimal for Csk at position 283. On the other hand, when kdSrc contains a positively charged Arg at position 510, a negatively charged Glu is optimal for Csk at position 283. This residue switching experiment confirmed that Glu-510 of Src interacts with Arg-283 of Csk, likely by a salt bridge, in the docking interactions between Csk and Src. More importantly, this identification of an interacting residue pair strengthened our conclusion of Glu-510, Tyr-511, and Asp-518 as the docking determinants of Src.Characterization of Tyr-511 and Asp-518—To determine the structural attributes of Src Tyr-511 that were important for Csk recognition, it was mutated into several other residues sharing various structural similarity to Tyr (Fig. 5C). Both the Phe and the Trp mutants retained ∼80% of WT kdSrc activity as a substrate for Csk, whereas Ala, Ile, or Leu mutants retained 20% or less ability to be phosphorylated by Csk. This result indicated that 1) the hydroxyl group of Tyr is not important and 2) hydrophobicity is not sufficient for the function of Tyr-511. Combination of these two considerations suggests that the aromatic ring is crucial in Src recognition by Csk. One type of interaction that is consistent with all these features is a cation-π interaction, in which the π electron cloud of the aromatic ring is attracted to the positively charged residues of Arg or Lys (20Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 21Lee S. Lin X. McMurray J. Sun G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12107-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This possibility is further strengthened by the fact that the Csk substrate-docking site is dominated by 3 Arg residues. Definitive identification of the interacting partner for Tyr-511 awaits further investigation.To determine the structural attributes of Asp-518 important for its function, it was mutated to Glu, Asn, and Gly. D518E mutant retained the highest activity, at about 30% of that of kdSrc as a substrate for Csk, whereas the other mutants retained 10-20% of kdSrc activity (Fig. 5D). This observation suggests that a negative charge is likely important but not sufficient for the function of this residue.The Substrate-docking Sites Are Different in Csk and MAP Kinases—The MAP kinases, a family of Ser kinases, also use a substrate-docking site for substrate recognition (22Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The substrate-docking site in p38 MAP kinase was revealed by the crystal structure of a complex of the kinase with a docking peptide from its substrate (23Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H.

We have addressed this issue using a point mutant of MutL (MutL-R266E). The biochemical and genetic data suggest that DNA binding by MutL is required for dam methylation-directed mismatch repair. We demonstrate that purified MutL-R266E retains wild-type biochemical properties that do not depend on DNA binding, such as basal ATP hydrolysis in the absence of DNA and the ability to interact with other mismatch repair proteins. However, purified MutL-R266E binds DNA poorly in vitro as compared with MutL, and consistent with this observation, its DNA-dependent biochemical activities, like DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and helicase II stimulation, are severely compromised. In addition, there is a modest effect on stimulation of MutH-catalyzed nicking. Finally, genetic assays show that MutL-R266E has a strong mutator phenotype, demonstrating that the mutant is unable to function in dam methylation-directed mismatch repair in vivo.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1306-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to nick the unmethylated DNA strand, resulting in discrimination of the nascent and parental DNA strands (4Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The use of the nearest hemi-methylated d(GATC) as the site of MutH-directed incision provides MMR with a bidirectional capability since this site could be located on either side of the mismatch. Helicase II (uvrD gene product) is then loaded on the appropriate strand at the nick and translocates in a 3′ to 5′ direction (18Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), unwinding the DNA duplex until the mismatch has been removed (19Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The signal indicating that sufficient DNA has been unwound, to complete the repair process, is not known. One of the several nucleases with an appropriate polarity degrades the nascent DNA strand, and single-stranded DNA-binding protein binds and stabilizes the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) template until DNA polymerase III is recruited to fill the gap. The resulting nick is sealed by DNA ligase, completing the repair process and restoring the integrity of the DNA (13Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The role of MutL protein in MMR remains to be completely defined on a mechanistic level. The protein was originally purified using a biochemical complementation assay as an essential component for partially reconstituted mismatch repair in cell extracts lacking MutL (12Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments demonstrated its interaction with MutS at a mismatch (13Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and the solved crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of MutL demonstrated an ATP binding/hydrolysis fold common to the GHKL group of ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes (21Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Purified MutL catalyzes a slow ATP hydrolysis reaction that is stimulated by the presence of ssDNA and is essential for MMR (20Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 21Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 22Spampinato C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, MutL has been shown to interact with and stimulate the hemi-methylated d(GATC)-directed nicking reaction catalyzed by MutH (15Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1306-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as stimulating the unwinding of duplex DNA catalyzed by UvrD (19Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, MutL has been characterized as the master regulator of MMR in light of its interaction with many of the proteins required for MMR. The stimulation of MutL-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis by the addition of DNA has prompted an investigation of the DNA binding properties of MutL. Several groups have demonstrated that MutL binds to both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (20Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 23Bende S.M. Grafstrom R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1549-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas others report that MutL does not bind DNA (24Drotschmann K. Aronshtam A. Fritz H.J. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, the DNA binding activity of MutL has been suggested to be an artifact of in vitro assays designed to measure DNA binding (25Acharya S. Foster P.L. Brooks P. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Indeed, a current model for MMR postulates that DNA binding by MutL is not required for the MMR process (26Yang W. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using a combination of biochemical and genetic assays, we present evidence to suggest that DNA binding by MutL is a requirement for MMR. These studies take advantage of an mutL point mutant (MutL-R266E), in which the arginine at position 266 has been altered to a glutamic acid. Expression of this protein in a cell strain lacking functional MutL results in a mutator phenotype similar to that observed with a complete deletion of the mutL gene. The purified mutant protein exhibits a weak ssDNA binding affinity, no ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity (the basal ATPase activity in intact), and very poor stimulation of UvrD-catalyzed DNA unwinding. Taken as a whole, these data are consistent with a primary DNA binding defect since the purified protein is able to interact with the other MMR proteins as effectively as wild-type MutL protein. We conclude that the DNA binding activity of MutL is required for full functionality of the MMR process. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli BL21(DE3) (F– ompT [lon] hsdSBrB–mB–gal λDE3) was from Novagen. A derivative of the strain, BL21(DE3)uvrD::Tn5 mutL::Tn10, has been described (27Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mutL gene was cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen) by removing the mutL gene from pET3C-MutL (28Mechanic L.E. Frankel B.A. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38337-38346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with BamHI and inserting the gene in pET15b cut with the same restriction enzyme. This plasmid is referred to as pET15b-MutL. The pET15b-MutL-R266E construct was a gift from Peggy Hsieh (National Institutes of Health). Constructs were sequenced to verify the coding sequence of the gene and to ensure the absence of unintended mutations. Protein Purification—MutL and MutL-R266E were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) uvrD::Tn5 mutL::Tn10 cells containing the appropriate MutL expression vector. Two liters of cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8, and protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to 0.5 mm. After an additional 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with cold H2O, suspended in binding buffer (50 mm Na3PO4 (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and frozen at –75 °C for future use. Cells were thawed on ice and lysed by the addition of lysozyme to 200 μg/ml followed by incubation at 0 °C for 60 min. The lysate was sonicated briefly to reduce the viscosity, applied to a TALON metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences; 1 ml of resin/L cells), and extensively washed with binding buffer. To decrease the NaCl concentration before elution, the column was washed with several column volumes of binding buffer containing 225 mm NaCl instead of 500 mm NaCl. The column was eluted using 200 mm imidazole in the low NaCl binding buffer. This step resulted in a substantial purification of MutL, but contaminants were still present. The protein that eluted from the TALON column was diluted 3-fold with Mono Q buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing no NaCl to achieve a final NaCl concentration of ∼75 mm and applied to a Mono Q column equilibrated in Mono Q buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted using a gradient from 75 mm NaCl to 500 mm NaCl in Mono Q buffer. MutL was detected by SDS-PAGE. The protein eluted at ∼180 mm NaCl, and fractions containing MutL were pooled. To achieve greater than 95% purity, the proteins were further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column. The pooled fractions from the Mono Q column were concentrated using solid polyethylene glycol 20,000 and loaded onto a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with Superdex buffer (50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Fractions containing MutL were identified by SDS-PAGE, and MutL eluted at the position expected for a MutL dimer. Final purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1). UvrD was purified as described (27Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) from a strain that contained an insertion in mutL to ensure that purified UvrD was not contaminated with MutL. The protein was greater than 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. MutS and MutH were purified in a manner similar to the purification of MutL. Each protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pET15b-MutS or pET15b-MutH constructs. After the initial TALON metal affinity column, the proteins were further purified using heparin agarose and Superdex 200 as appropriate. The final protein preparations were judged to be >95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. DNA Substrates—The various DNA substrates (ligands) used in DNA binding assays and DNA unwinding assays were prepared using synthetic DNA oligomers. The sequences and sources of the oligomers used in these studies were as follows: 50-mer, 5′-TTT TGG GGC GAA GTT TTA TGG TCT CCT ACC TAG GCC GGC TAT TCA GGG TT-3′ (MWG Biotech); 91-mer, 5′-AGT AGC ACC ATT ACC ATT AGC AAG GCC GGA AAC GTC ACC AAT GAA ACC ATC GAT AGC AGC ACC GTA ATC AGT AGC GAC AGA ATC AAG TTT G-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies); complement to 50-mer, 5′-AAC CCT GAA TAG CCG GCC TAG GTA GGA GAC CAT AAA ACT TCG CCC CAA AA-3′ (MWG Biotech); 3′ overhang 70-mer, 5′-AAC CCT GAA TAG CCG GCC TAG GTA GGA GAC CAT AAA ACT TCG CCC CAA AAT CCC TAA TAA TCC AAT CAA A-3′ (MWG Biotech). To construct DNA binding ligands, 2.3 pmol (molecules) of 50-mer were labeled on the 5′-end using 3.33 μm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using reaction conditions suggested by the supplier. Free nucleotides were removed using a Qiagen nucleotide removal kit. The 50-bp homoduplex and 50/70 3′ overhang duplex DNAs were made by annealing 2.8 pmol of the 50-mer complement or the 3′ overhang 70-mer to the labeled 50-mer in annealing buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl). The DNAs were mixed and heated to 100 °C for 5 min, cooled to 65 °C, incubated for 30 min, cooled to 25 °C, and incubated for 10 min. The substrate DNA was purified from the unannealed 50-mer on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel run in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.3)) at 3.1 V/cm for 12 h. DNA was extracted from the gel slice by electroelution in 1× Tris borate-EDTA. An electric potential of 3.1 V/cm was passed across the gel slice for 8 h at 4°C. The electroeluted DNA was then dialyzed against TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) buffer. The eluted DNA was concentrated using 2-butanol (29Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, J. Wiley, Inc., New York1987: 2.1.4-2.1.5Google Scholar). The 93-bp partial duplex DNA substrate was prepared as described (30Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of M13mp7 ssDNA, 40 ng of 91-mer, annealing buffer, and water were added to a final volume of 50 μl. The mixture was heated to 100 °C for 5 min, cooled to 65 °C, incubated for 30 min, and finally incubated at room temperature for 10 min. [α-32P]dCTP (3.33 μm) and 5 units of DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment, New England Biolabs) were added. The extension reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 25 °C, chased by the addition of 20 nmol of dCTP, and allowed to incubate at 25 °C for an additional 10 min. The volume of the solution was increased to 100 μl with STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA), phenol/CHCl3 was extracted, and free nucleotides were removed using an A5M column (Bio-Rad). The partial duplex substrate eluted in the void volume and was used directly in helicase assays. The concentration of the DNA substrate was estimated at 20 μm DNA-Pi. The 710-bp blunt duplex was prepared by digesting pLitmus28 with ScaI and XbaI (New England Biolabs). The resulting 710-base pair fragment was labeled using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment, New England Biolabs). The reaction contained an 87.7 nm 710-bp DNA fragment (DNA molecules), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm dATP, 200 μm dGTP, 200 μm dTTP, [α-32P]dCTP, and 5 units of DNA polymerase I (Klenow Fragment, New England Biolabs) (30 μl). The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and chased by the addition of 20 nmol of dCTP at 25 °C for 15 min. Free nucleotides were removed using a nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Heteroduplex DNA containing a single G:T mismatch and the corresponding homoduplex DNA were prepared as previously described (15Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1306-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mutator Assays—Nine independent cultures of GE1752, GE1752 mutL::Tn10, GE1752 mutL::Tn10/pET15b, GE1752 mutL::Tn10/pET15b-MutL, and GE1752 mutL::Tn10/pET15b-MutL-R266E were grown to saturation at 37 °C in the presence of appropriate antibiotics. Appropriate dilutions of each cell strain were made, and cells were plated on LB plates containing appropriate antibiotics to determine a cell titer and on LB plates containing rifampicin (100 μg/ml) to measure the number of rifampicin resistant colonies. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and colonies were counted. Mutation frequencies and rates were calculated using the method of the mean as previously described (31Miller J.H.

Small Scale Mutator Assays—Two cultures each of BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)mutL::Tn10, BL21(DE3) mutL::Tn10/pETcoco-2, BL21(DE3) mutL::Tn10/pETcoco-2-MutL, BL21(DE3) mutL::Tn10/pETcoco-2-MutL-R266E, and BL21(DE3) mutL::Tn10/pETcoco-2-MutL-E29A were grown for 15 h and 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics (pETcoco-2 from Novagen). One of the two cultures was grown in the absence of IPTG, whereas the other culture was grown in the presence of 250 μm IPTG. Serial dilutions (0, 10–1, and 10–2) were plated on an LB plate containing rifampicin (100 μg/ml). The plate was incubated at 37 °C overnight and was analyzed qualitatively to determine the mutator phenotype of the particular mutant. To confirm that the appropriate MutL protein was expressed, a Western blot of each of the plated samples was run. Cells (1 ml) were sedimented by centrifugation and suspended in TE buffer according to the following formula to ensure equal loading: resuspension volume of Tris-EDTA buffer = (A600 × 100)/0.5. Cells (12.5 μl) were then lysed in an equal volume of SDS gel loading buffer (32 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 3.2% (w/v) SDS, 1.2 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol) and boiled for 5 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose filter was blocked with 2% (w/v) powdered milk (Carnation) in TTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 60 min while shaking. The nitrocellulose filter was then washed 4 times with TTBS for 15 min while shaking. The filters were subsequently incubated with rabbit anti-MutL antibodies in TTBS (1:25,000) for 2 h. The nitrocellulose filter was washed 4 times with TTBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit antisera conjugated to alkaline phosphatase in TTBS (1:10,000) for 30 min. The filter was washed 4 times with TTBS and then reacted with Western Blue alkaline phosphatase substrate (Promega) until a color reaction was observed (∼5 min). ATP Hydrolysis Assays—Reaction mixtures (120 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm ATP ([γ-32P]ATP). For reaction mixtures containing DNA, the 50-mer was added at concentrations varying from 0 to 4 μm as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were initiated by the addition of purified MutL or MutL-R266E to a final concentration of 1 μm followed by incubation at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were removed at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min and added to 280-μl quench solution (20 mm H3PO4, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5% (w/v) Norit activated charcoal USP). The quenched reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min, and the activated charcoal was sedimented in a microcentrifuge. A 200-μl aliquot of the supernatant was removed, added to 3 ml of scintillation mixture (Ecoscint A, National Diagnostics), and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. DNA Binding Assays—Double filter DNA binding assays were performed as described (35Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) Briefly, nitrocellulose (Millipore) and DEAE (DE81, Whatman) filters (2.5 cm) were prepared as previously described (35Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), with the exception that the filters were incubated at 4 °C with MutL reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) before use. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 or 100 mm NaCl (as indicated), 5 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm AMP-PNP, 1 nm oligonucleotide 50-mer, 1 nm 50 homoduplex, 1 nm 70/50 3′-overhang DNA, or 4 μm 93-bp partial duplex DNA (DNA-Pi) and protein as indicated. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, diluted with 1 ml of MutL reaction buffer, then filtered across treated nitrocellulose and DEAE filters in a vacuum manifold. The filters were washed twice with reaction buffer, dried, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Data were analyzed as previously described (35Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Helicase Unwinding Assays—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml BSA, 3 mm ATP, 93 bp of partial duplex DNA (final concentration of 2 μm DNA-Pi) or 710 bp of blunt duplex DNA (final concentration of 1 nm DNA molecules), 1.25 or 16 nm UvrD, and a titration of MutL or MutL-R266E. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP after pre-warming the reaction solution to 37 °C for 5 min. The reactions were terminated after 10 min for the 93-bp partial duplex or 20 min for the 710-bp blunt duplex by the addition of 10 μl of stop solution (50% (w/v) glycerol, 68 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.022% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.022% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.3% (w/v) SDS, 44.5 mm Tris base, and 44.5 mm boric acid). The reaction products were resolved on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Polyacrylamide gels were imaged using a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using ImageQuant on a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). MutL-stimulated MutH Nicking Assays—Reaction mixtures (16 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml BSA, 3 mm ATP, 50 ng of heteroduplex DNA, 33.8 nm MutS, 1.9 nm MutH, and the indicated concentrations of MutL or MutL-R266E. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MutH, incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 12.5 mm. Samples were resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel run in the presence of ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). To obtain quantitative results, the gel was irradiated with UV light for 30 min, stained with ethidium bromide, and destained. Density in the nicked DNA species and the supercoiled DNA species was determined using an Alpha imager. MutH Affinity Column Chromatography—MutH (560 μg) in MutH affinity chromatography buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) was bound to 1.5 ml Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. The resin was blocked with 100 μl of 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 4°C.The blocked resin was added to a column and washed in MutH affinity chromatography buffer until the flow-through contained no detectable protein (determined by measuring the A280 of the flow-through). MutL (100 μg), MutL-R266E (80 μg), or BSA (100 μg) was loaded onto the column in binding buffer, and the column was washed with four column volumes of binding buffer and eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl. Five fractions (300 μl each) were collected at each NaCl concentration (50 and 200 mm, 1 and 2 m NaCl) in MutH affinity chromatography buffer and analyzed by a Bradford protein assay and SDS-PAGE. The gels were analyzed by densitometry, measuring the density of the protein on the gel relative to a marker protein. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—UvrD (62.5 fmol) or BSA (62.5 fmol) in 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 1.6 mm sulfo N-hydroxysuccinimide were added to each of 16 wells (100 μl/well) on a CovaLink plate (Nunc). To initiate the binding reactions of UvrD or BSA, 6.5 mm N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride was added to each of the wells (50 μl/well). The binding reaction was incubated for 2 h at 25°C. The wells were washed 4 times with 350 μl of wash buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 2% (w/v) BSA (fraction V radioimmunoassay grade)). The wells were blocked with 350 μl of 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed 4 times with 350 μl of wash buffer, and a titration of MutL or MutL-R266E in wash buffer was added to the wells (100 μl/well) as indicated and incubated for 2 h at 25°C. The wells were rinsed 4 times with 350 μl of wash buffer. Rabbit anti-MutL IgG (100 μl; 1:10,000) in wash buffer was added to the wells and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. The wells were washed with 350 μl of wash buffer. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (100 μl; 1:10,000) in wash buffer was added to the wells for 30 min at 25 °C. The wells were washed with 350 μl of wash buffer, and 100 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate alkaline phosphatase substrate (1 m diethanolamine, 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt (Pierce)) were added to the wells for 30 min and quenched with 50 μl of 2 m NaOH. The color reaction was read at A405 using a MicroQuant plate reader. The data were analyzed by subtracting the background MutL or MutL-R266E bound to BSA from the MutL or MutL-R266E bound to UvrD. Since its discovery several years ago, the DNA binding activity of MutL has been investigated in several laboratories with conflicting results (11Junop M.S. Yang W. Funchain P. Clendenin W.

https://openalex.org/W2103785039,"A self-perpetuating conformational conversion of the prion protein (PrP) is believed to underlie pathology and transmission of prion diseases. Here we explore the effects of N-terminal pathogenic mutations (P102L, P105L, A117V) and the residue 129 polymorphism on amyloid fibril formation by the human PrP fragment 23-144, an in vitro conversion model that can reproduce certain characteristics of prion replication such as strains and species barriers. We find that these amino acid substitutions neither affect PrP23-144 amyloidogenicity nor introduce barriers to cross-seeding of soluble protein. However, the polymorphism strongly influences the conformation of the amyloid fibrils, as determined by infrared spectroscopy. Intriguingly, unlike conformational features governed by the critical amyloidogenic region of PrP23-144 (residues 138-139), the structural features distinguishing Met-129 and Val-129 PrP23-144 amyloid fibrils are not transmissible by cross-seeding. While based only on in vitro data, these findings provide fundamental insight into the mechanism of prion-based conformational transmission, indicating that only conformational features controlling seeding specificity (e.g. those in critical intermolecular contact sites of amyloid fibrils) are necessarily transmissible by cross-seeding; conformational traits in other parts of the PrP molecule may not be “heritable” from the amyloid template.

All of these disorders are associated with misfolding and aggregation of the prion protein (PrP), a plasma membrane glyco-protein of unknown function widely expressed in numerous tissues. The self-perpetuating conversion of the monomeric, soluble “cellular” PrP conformer (PrPC) to a polymeric, β-sheet-rich, protease-resistant “scrapie” conformer (PrPSc), often displaying the structural characteristics of an amyloid, is believed to be the critical molecular event in the pathogenesis of TSE disease.

One line of support for the protein-only hypothesis is the existence of familial human prion diseases linked to mutations in the PRNP gene. These mutations, leading to amino acid substitutions or truncations in PrP, result in degenerative pathology with neural deposition of abnormal PrP late in life (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recent data suggest that many of these mutations may promote prion protein conversion by influencing the folding pathway and/or energy landscape of PrPC (12Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P.

However, three PrP mutations, P102L, P105L, and A117V, all associated with familial GSS (11Kitamoto T. Tateishi J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1994; 343: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), map to the unstructured N-terminal region outside the folded domain of PrPC. While the N-terminal PrP region seems to influence TSE pathology and cross-species transmission barriers (15Priola S.A. Adv.

To gain insight into the molecular level relationship between familial mutations and PrP conversion, here we have explored the effect of N-terminal mutations on amyloidogenic properties of the human prion protein variant PrP23-144. This C-truncated protein has the advantage of undergoing very efficient autocatalytic conformational conversion under physiologically relevant buffer conditions (17Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M.

A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); a similar reaction (although with much lower seeding efficiency) for recombinant PrP23-231 or PrP90-231 has been reported only under denaturing conditions (18Lee S.

The simple PrP23-144 model, which was shown to reproduce in vitro certain aspects of mammalian prion propagation (22Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), is especially useful for studying structural perturbations due to point mutations in the N-terminal region; these local effects may be “masked” when probed in the full-length protein. The PrP23-144 model also affords an opportunity to explore the effect of M129V polymorphism on amyloidogenic properties of the N-terminal part of PrP. This polymorphism influences both the phenotype of and susceptibility to human prion diseases (24Baker H.E. Poulter M. Crow T.J. Frith C.D. Lofthouse R. Ridley R.M.

Science. 1992; 258: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar); the under-lying cause of these effects, however, is not known. Here we report that the M129V polymorphism influences the conformation of PrP23-144 amyloid fibrils but does not introduce seeding barriers. Intriguingly, the structural features distinguishing Met-129 and Val-129 fibrils are not transmissible by cross-seeding. In addition to implications for understanding molecular basis of residue 129 polymorphism-dependent effects in prion diseases, these findings provide novel insight into the mechanism of conformational “inheritance” between PrP amyloid fibrils. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—The pRSETB expression vector for wild-type Met-129 huPrP23-144 has been described previously (29Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Wild-type Val-129 huPrP23-144 was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis on the background of Met-129 PrP23-144 cDNA using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). All other proteins were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of these two variants. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (17Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M. Surewicz K.A. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The identity of all proteins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry, and final purity was better than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined from UV absorbance, using a molar extinction coefficient of 42,150 m-1 cm-1 at 276 nm. Thioflavine T Fluorescence—The time course of huPrP23-144 fibrillization was monitored using the fluorometric thioflavine T (ThT) assay described previously (17Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M. Surewicz K.A. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized protein was dissolved in Milli-Q water, to which 1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.4) was added to a final concentration of 50 mm buffer, 400 μm protein (protease inhibitors were included). Samples were incubated in a 25 °C water bath, and 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn and added to 500 μl of 10 μm ThT, mixed well and measured for ThT fluorescence emission at 482 nm (450 nm excitation) on an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer. For seeding experiments, fibrillar protein prepared as above was sonicated on ice to disrupt large aggregates, and 2% (w/w) fibrillar material was added to freshly dissolved protein. Lag phases of PrP23-144 conversion were calculated by linear extrapolation of the growth (increasing) phase of ThT fluorescence plots. As noted previously (22Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), mature fibrils had a tendency to clump into very large aggregates, resulting in some scattering of ThT fluorescence signal. Furthermore, after reaching its maximum, the ThT fluorescence often showed a time-dependent decrease. However, these clumping-induced effects occurred only at late stages of the reaction; they did not affect the accuracy of the measurements of lag phases. All experiments were repeated a minimum of five times. Atomic Force Microscopy—Fibrillar huPrP23-144 samples were visualized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) essentially as described (23Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples displaying a ThT response were diluted with water to ∼1 mg/ml, and 5 μl of diluted solution was applied to freshly peeled mica. This substrate was then rinsed with 150 μl of distilled water and dried in an air stream. Imaging was performed in tapping mode on a Digital Instruments Multimode microscope equipped with a Nano-Scope IV controller and a type E scanner. All samples were imaged under ambient conditions in both height and amplitude modes, using single-beam silicon cantilever probes with a nominal tip radius of 10 nm and a nominal spring constant of 20 newton/m. FTIR Spectroscopy—Samples for FTIR spectroscopy were prepared as described above, except deuterium oxide was used in place of water. Spectra were acquired in transmission mode using a Bruker IFS66 spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector and continuously purged with dry air. For spectrum acquisition, solutions of fibrillar protein (5-7 μl) were placed between CaF2 discs separated by a 50-μm spacer. For each sample, 256 scans were accumulated and averaged at a resolution of 2 cm-1. All spectra were corrected for absorption of buffer by interactively subtracting a blank spectrum to obtain a flat baseline between 1700 and 1850 cm-1. To resolve overlapping components of the conformation-sensitive amide I band, all spectra were Fourier self-deconvoluted in the Opus 4.0 software package, using a Lorentzian line shape and parameters equivalent to a 15 cm-1 half-width and a resolution enhancement factor of 1.6. Pathogenic Mutations and the Residue 129 Polymorphism Do Not Alter PrP23-144 Conversion Kinetics and Seeding Specificity—Since GSS-associated mutations outside the folded domain of PrPC do not affect thermodynamic properties of the protein (12Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 13Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Apetri A.C. Surewicz K. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18008-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), it has been postulated that these mutations may facilitate the PrPC→PrPSc conversion by increasing the amyloidogenic potential of the N-terminal region (14Apetri A.C. Surewicz K. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18008-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously (17Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M. Surewicz K.A. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), human PrP23-144 spontaneously converts to amyloid fibrils through a nucleation-dependent process characterized by distinct lag and growth phases (30Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Mutation-induced increase in the amyloidogenicity of PrP23-144 would result in a decrease of the lag phase (∼3.5 h under present experimental conditions). However, to our surprise, none of the disease-associated mutations studied (P102L, P105L, A117V) substantially affected the kinetics of PrP23-144 conversion (Fig. 1). Very similar results were obtained using PrP23-144 variants possessing valine at position 129; all three mutant proteins converted to amyloid with a nucleation-dependent lag phase similar to that of wild-type Val-129 PrP23-144 (Fig. 1C). On the average, Val-129 variants appeared to convert to amyloid fibrils slightly faster than Met-129 variants; however, these differences are very small, within the error margin of the present experiments. Recently we have shown that substitution of a single amino acid in a critical region encompassing residues 138 and 139 may have a dramatic effect on the properties of PrP23-144 fibrils, resulting in cross-seeding barriers (22Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Prompted by this observation, we asked whether similar effects may result from any of the mutations corresponding to familial prion diseases. We therefore tested the ability of individual mutant PrP23-144 amyloid fibrils to induce (seed) conformational conversion of monomeric wild-type protein. An example of such a cross-seeding experiment, using fibrillar P102L PrP23-144 and soluble wild-type protein, is shown in Fig. 2A. Clearly, addition of a small amount (2% w/w) of preformed fibrillar P102L PrP23-144 effectively seeds the conversion of wild-type PrP23-144 (both Met-129), as evidenced by elimination of the lag phase. Within the resolution limits of the present approach, the efficiency of this seeding is indistinguishable from that of a homologous reaction in which wild-type protein is seeded with wild-type PrP23-144 fibrils (Fig. 1A). An equally effective cross-seeding was observed between monomeric wild-type PrP23-144 and fibrillar P105L and A117V variants (data not shown). Furthermore, identical behavior was observed for Val-129 PrP23-144 proteins; fibrils formed by pathogenic mutants containing valine at residue 129 were capable of seeding wild-type Val-129 PrP23-144 (data not shown for brevity). We next questioned whether the residue 129 polymorphism might itself be sufficient to introduce a seeding barrier, a possibility suggested by the influence of this polymorphism on TSE transmissibility in vivo (27Wadsworth J.D. Asante E.A. Desbruslais M. Linehan J.M. Joiner S. Gowland I. Welch J. Stone L. Lloyd S.E. Hill A.F. Brandner S. Collinge J. Science. 2004; 306: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B, however, shows that preformed fibrils of wild-type Val-129 PrP23-144 are fully capable of seeding wild-type Met-129 PrP23-144. Wild-type Met-129 PrP23-144 fibrils are likewise able to seed the conversion of wild-type Val-129 PrP23-144 (Fig. 2C). These results hold not only for wild-type protein; each pathogenic mutant with methionine at position 129 was able to seed the same mutant with valine at residue 129 and vice versa (data not shown for brevity). Collectively, these data show that neither the residue 129 polymorphism nor GSS-associated mutations alter the amyloidogenic propensity and seeding specificity of PrP23-144. Effect of Residue 129 Polymorphism and Familial Mutations on PrP23-144 Amyloid Conformation—Conformational features of PrP23-144 fibrils were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy, an established technique for probing protein secondary structure (31Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). This method is especially well suited for studying β-sheet structures, with amide I bands associated with these structures depending on factors such as molecular packing of β-strands and the strength of hydrogen bonds (31Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 32Zandomeneghi G. Krebs M.R. McCammon M.G. Fandrich M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 3314-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In the soluble monomeric state, the spectra of both Met-129 and Val-129 PrP23-144 display a single broad amide I band centered at about 1648 cm-1 (17Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M. Surewicz K.A. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), consistent with an unordered structure. In the amyloid state, fibrils display spectra indicative of β-sheet secondary structure (Fig. 3). Fibrils of Met-129 PrP23-144 exhibit closely spaced peaks in the range 1630-1650 cm-1 (Fig. 3A). To resolve these overlapping component peaks, spectra were band-narrowed using Fourier self-deconvolution. The spectrum of Met-129 PrP23-144 fibrils is consistent with our previous studies (17Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M. Surewicz K.A. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), showing major amide I component bands at 1628, 1639, and 1649 cm-1. The bands at 1628 and 1649 cm-1 are characteristic of β-sheet and random coil secondary structure respectively, while the 1639 cm-1 band likely represents β-sheet but may also contain unresolved random coil components (31Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). The spectra of amyloid fibrils formed by P102L, P105L, and A117V mutants are very similar to that of wild-type Met-129 PrP23-144 amyloid (Fig. 3B-E), indicating very similar secondary structure in amyloids of all these proteins. The spectrum of Val-129 PrP23-144 amyloid is substantially different (Fig. 3F). Deconvolution reveals this spectrum consists of major amide I bands at 1628 and 1649 cm-1. The 1639 cm-1 peak, so prominent in the spectrum of Met-129 PrP23-144, is essentially absent (visible as a faint shoulder on the much stronger 1649 cm-1 peak). Val-129 PrP23-144 amyloids also showed a weak but relatively well resolved band at about 1617 cm-1 (the same peak can be seen as a faint shoulder in Met-129 PrP23-144 spectra, Fig. 3, B-E). Moreover, while the 1628 cm-1 band is noticeably weaker than the 1649 cm-1 band in Met-129 PrP23-144 amyloids, the two bands are of comparable intensity in Val-129 PrP23-144 fibrils. As with the Met-129 PrP23-144 mutants, there is no difference in FTIR spectra between wild-type and mutant Val-129 PrP23-144 fibrils. These data indicate that substitution of valine for methionine at position 129 substantially changes the secondary structure of PrP23-144 amyloid fibrils, whereas familial mutations N-terminal to residue 129 have no measurable effect on PrP23-144 amyloid fibril conformation, at least within the resolution limits of the FTIR technique. The morphology of PrP23-144 fibrils was examined by AFM. All PrP23-144 variants formed long (>5 μm) amyloid fibers with heights of ranging from 3-6 nm (Fig. 4A). Similar distributions of fibril thickness were observed for all PrP23-144 variants. Higher magnification images (Fig. 4, B-E) revealed periodic features along the fibril axis, with a mean repeat distance of 30-35 nm, giving the fibrils a segmented or “bead-like” appearance like that observed previously for human and mouse PrP23-144 (17Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M. Surewicz K.A. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Importantly, this fibril morphology was observed for all PrP23-144 mutants studied, including both Met-129 and Val-129 variants. Although globular oligomers were also present in AFM images, no alternate fibril morphologies were observed for any of the PrP23-144 mutants, and in all cases the fibril dimensions and periodicity were virtually identical within the resolution limits of the technique. Conformational Features Differentiating Met-129 and Val-129 PrP23-144 Are Not Transmissible—In a previous study (23Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that species-specific conformational features of PrP23-144 amyloid fibrils are transmitted to PrP23-144 of a different sequence by seeding. Having observed a structural variability associated with residue 129, we questioned whether these amyloid conformations may also be transmissible by seeding. FTIR spectra of PrP23-144 amyloid fibrils seeded with the opposite polymorph are shown in Fig. 5. Clearly, these spectra do not resemble those of the material used as seed. FTIR spectra of second-generation Val-129 PrP23-144 fibrils seeded with Met-129 PrP23-144 amyloid, denoted [V129]M129 as in our previous work (22Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), are identical to those of Val-129 PrP23-144 fibrils formed de novo or by seeding with preformed Val-129 fibrils (Fig. 5A). Likewise, Met-129 PrP23-144 amyloids seeded with Val-129 PrP23-144 fibrils ([M129]V129) displayed FTIR spectra characteristic of self-seeded Met-129 fibrils, in which the 1639 cm-1 band is present (Fig. 5B). These spectral features do not result from a “failure” of the preformed fibers to seed the soluble protein, as all cross-seeded samples (including those prepared in deuterated buffer for FTIR experiments) displayed a steady increase in ThT fluorescence beginning immediately after addition of seed (see Fig. 2). Additionally, this phenomenon was not particular to wild-type PrP23-144; mutant Met-129 PrP23-144 fibrils formed by seeding with Val-129 PrP23-144 fibrils containing the same mutation displayed FTIR spectra consistent with Met-129 PrP23-144 and vice versa. We therefore must conclude that the structural features differentiating Met-129 and Val-129 amyloid fibers, unlike species-specific amyloid conformations dictated by residues 138-139 of PrP23-144 (23Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), are not transmissible by cross-seeding. Pathogenic Mutations and PrP23-144 Fibrillogenesis—While the link between PrP mutations and familial prion diseases provides strong support for the protein-only model, the mechanism by which these mutations facilitate the pathogenic process remains unclear. Especially intriguing in this context are GSS-associated mutations at residues 102, 105, and 117. Because these residues lie within the unstructured region of PrP, their effect cannot be rationalized by a model based on an increase in the population of partially folded intermediates, as proposed for mutations within the C-terminal domain (14Apetri A.C. Surewicz K. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18008-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the pathogenic effect associated with these mutations could be related to an increased amyloidogenic propensity of the unstructured N-terminal region (14Apetri A.C.

However, inappropriate electrical coupling between grafted SMs and host cardiomyocytes may be responsible for the arrhythmias observed in clinical trials of SM transplantation. Whether functional gap junctions occur between the two cell types remains controversial. We have studied the ability of SMs to electrically couple with isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes (CMs) and assessed whether connexin43 (Cx43) overexpression enhanced gap junctional conductance (Gj). C2C12 myoblast lines overexpressing Cx43 were generated by gene transfection and clonal selection. CMs were cocultured with either SMs overexpressing Cx43 (CM-SM(Cx43)) or control SMs (CM-SM(WT)) in vitro. Gj between pairs of SMs and CMs was quantified with dual whole cell patch clamping. Formation of Gj occurred between 22% of CM-SM(WT) pairs (n=73) and 48% of CM-SM(Cx43) pairs (n=71, P<0.001). The Gj of CM-SM(Cx43) pairs (29.7+/-4.3 nS, n=21) was greater than that of CM-SM(WT) pairs (14.8+/-2.0 nS, n=12, P<0.05). The overexpression of Cx43 in SMs increased the formation of electrical communication and the steady-state conductance between SMs and CMs. Enhanced gap junctional conductance may be useful to promote the integration of transplanted SMs into the myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2060566383,"Emp46p and Emp47p are type I membrane proteins, which cycle between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus by vesicles coated with coat protein complexes I and II (COPI and COPII). They are considered to function as cargo receptors for exporting N-linked glycoproteins from the ER. We have determined crystal structures of the carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) of Emp46p and Emp47p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the absence and presence of metal ions. Both proteins fold as a β-sandwich, and resemble that of the mammalian ortholog, p58/ERGIC-53. However, the nature of metal binding is distinct from that of Ca2+-dependent p58/ERGIC-53. Interestingly, the CRD of Emp46p does not bind Ca2+ ion but instead binds K+ ion at the edge of a concave β-sheet whose position is distinct from the corresponding site of the Ca2+ ion in p58/ERGIC-53. Binding of K+ ion to Emp46p appears essential for transport of a subset of glycoproteins because the Y131F mutant of Emp46p, which cannot bind K+ ion fails to rescue the transport in disruptants of EMP46 and EMP47 genes. In contrast the CRD of Emp47p binds no metal ions at all. Furthermore, the CRD of Emp46p binds to glycoproteins carrying high mannosetype glycans and the is promoted by binding not the addition of Ca2+ or K+ ion in These results suggest that Emp46p can be regarded as a Ca2+-independent intracellular lectin at the ER exit sites.

In eukaryotic cells, post-translational modification of secreted proteins and intracellular protein transport between organelles are ubiquitous features. One of the most studied systems is the N-linked glycosylation pathway in the synthesis of secreted glycoproteins (1Fiedler K. Simons K.

The N-linked glycans are subject to diverse modification and transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; COP, coat protein complex; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment; GST, glutathione S-transferase; r.m.s., root mean square; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; SeMet, selenomethionine; PEG, polyethylene glycol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; Endo H, endoglycosidase H. 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; COP, coat protein complex; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment; GST, glutathione S-transferase; r.m.s., root mean square; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; SeMet, selenomethionine; PEG, polyethylene glycol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; Endo H, endoglycosidase H. to the Golgi apparatus in transport vesicles. Incorporation of the glycoproteins (cargo) into the transport vesicles is thought to be mediated by transmembrane cargo receptors, which have been identified as intracellular lectins (non-enzymatic carbohydrate-binding proteins) (5Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, the canine vesicular integral membrane protein of 36 kDa (VIP36) and human ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53 have been identified as cargo receptors in the Golgi apparatus and ERGIC, respectively (5Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The cargo receptors are type I membrane proteins, which have lumenal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The N-terminal lumenal domains of VIP36 and ERGIC-53 share homology with L (leguminous)-type lectins and are thus called carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD). We previously reported that VIP36 has high avidity for high mannose-type glycans containing Manα1→2 Manα1 →2Man residues in Man7-9GlcNAc2 ·Asnpeptides (7Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, Kamiya et al. (8Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi N. Arata Y. Kasai K.I. Ihara Y. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Yamamoto K. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37178-37182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported details of the carbohydrate recognition mechanism of VIP36 using NMR (8Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y.

These observations have implicated that VIP36 is a cargo receptor involved in the intracellular transport of glycoproteins carrying high mannose-type glycans. On the other hand, a chemical cross-link experiment has shown co-isolation of ERGIC-53 with soluble cathepsin-Z-related glycoproteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner (9Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). They form complexes in the ER, and dissociate in the ERGIC fraction. Although the physiological functions of the cathepsin-Z-related protein remain unclear, this finding strongly supports the presence of soluble glycoprotein cargo receptors at the ER exit sites. Genetic studies of ERGIC-53 have shown that its mutations lead to a bleeding disorder known as a combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII in circulation (10Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H.P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32539-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been found that a second protein involved in this disease, MCFD2, an EF-hand protein, is co-purified with ERGIC-53 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (12Zhang B. Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 22022-22025Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the CRD of p58, a rat ortholog of ERGIC-53, in the absence and presence of Ca2+ ions were recently determined, confirming its structural similarity to the L-type lectins (13Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was shown that the putative ligandbinding site of p58/ERGIC-53 is similar to the mannose-binding site of the L-type lectins. However, no complex structures of ligand/receptor have been solved. Thus the structural basis for N-linked glycoprotein transport by cargo receptors still remains largely unknown.Emp47p and Emp46p, yeast orthologs of ERGIC-53, have been proposed as cargo receptors between the ER and the Golgi apparatus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15Schroder S. Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2518-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Emp47p is a receptor for Emp46p responsible for the selective transport of Emp46p from the ER to the Golgi apparatus by forming hetero-oligomerization between the two proteins (17Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The lumenal domain of Emp47p consists of a CRD with homology with ERGIC-53 and VIP36, and a putative coiled-coil domain, which is responsible for the formation of a homo-oligomeric complex of itself and a hetero-oligomeric complex with Emp46p in the ER. As for Emp46p, the lumenal domain consists of a CRD and a putative coiled-coil domain, which is required for forming the complex with Emp47p. On the other hand, the C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of Emp46p and Emp47p both contain binding sites for coat protein complexes I and II (COPI and COPII), which are required for cycling between the ER and Golgi apparatus. Thus, Emp47p and Emp46p apparently play important roles in selective packaging of specific glycoproteins into ER-derived vesicles. Indeed, gene disruption of both EMP47 and EMP46 leads to a marked defect in the secretion of a subset of glycoproteins (16Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2518-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, however, specific cargo proteins for Emp47p and Emp46p have not been identified so far. To investigate the structural basis for the glycoprotein transport by Emp46p and Emp47p, we determined crystal structures of their CRDs and studied their binding affinities against high mannose-type glycoproteins using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The DNA fragments for residues 6-229 of CRD of Emp46p, 7-227 of CRD of Emp47p (Δ1-Emp47p CRD), and 1-254 of CRD of Emp47p of S. cerevisiae were cloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites of the pGEX4T-1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). The native proteins of Emp46p, Δ1-Emp47p, and Emp47p CRDs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were harvested after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (Wako) for 6 h at 20 °C,and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The cell lysate was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were eluted by glutathione (Wako) and cleaved by thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences). The cleaved proteins were passed through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B to remove GST protein, and further purified by benzamidine-Sepharose 4FF column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove thrombin protease. Emp46p and Δ1-Emp47p CRDs were purified by Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. Emp47p CRD was purified by Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. The selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted proteins of Emp46p and Emp47p CRDs were expressed in the E. coli DL41 cell. The SeMet-substituted proteins were purified by the same procedure as native proteins. The purified proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—All of the crystallizations were carried out by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of native and SeMet-substituted Emp46p CRD in its K+-bound forms were obtained in a buffer containing 8 mg ml-1 protein, 20% (w/v) PEG3350, 0.3 m KF, 0.1 m HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, with incubation at 289 K for 4 days. On the other hand, the crystal of the metal-free Emp46p CRD was obtained in a buffer containing 8 mg ml-1 protein, 22% (w/v) PEG1000, 0.1 m HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, with incubation at 289 K for 4 days. These native and SeMet-substituted proteins in the absence and presence of the K+ ion were crystallized in space group P21 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. All data sets of Emp46p CRD were collected under cryogenic conditions with crystals soaked in the reservoir solution.As for Emp47p, crystals of native and SeMet-substituted Emp47p CRD in its metal-free forms were obtained in a buffer containing 28 mg ml-1 protein, 1.2 m NaH2PO4, 0.8 m K2HPO4, 0.2 m Li2SO4, and 0.1 m CAPS (pH 10.5): with a final pH 6.1, with incubation at 277 K for 1 week. Data sets of native and SeMet-substituted Emp47p CRD were collected under cryogenic conditions with crystals soaked in the cryoprotectant buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. Both native and SeMet-substituted proteins were crystallized in space group P43212 with one molecule per asymmetric unit (form 1).To obtain the metal-bound form of Emp47p CRD, we further constructed and crystallized a Δ1-Emp47p CRD. This construct was designed from a structured (visible) region of the form 1 Emp47p CRD structure. Crystals of Δ1-Emp47p CRD were obtained in the following conditions (forms 2-4). Nevertheless, the protein was crystallized as metal-free forms in these conditions. The form 2 crystal was obtained in a buffer containing 3.5 mg ml-1 protein, 20% (w/v) PEG3350, and 0.2 m NH4Cl, with incubation at 283 K for 3 days. The crystal belongs to space group C2 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The form 3 crystal was obtained in a buffer containing 3.5 mg ml-1 protein, 20% (w/v) PEG3350, and 0.2 m CH3COOK, with incubation at 283 K for 3 days. The crystal belongs to space group P21 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The form 4 crystal was obtained in a buffer containing 3.5 mg ml-1 protein, 20% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.2 m CH3COONH4, 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0), and 10 mm CaCl2, with incubation at 283 K for 3 days. The crystal belongs to space group P212121 with four molecules per asymmetric unit. All data sets of Δ1-Emp47p CRD were collected under cryogenic conditions with crystals soaked in the cryoprotectant buffer containing 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The native crystal parameters of Emp46p and (Δ1)-Emp47p CRDs are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

As the electron density maps with the experimental phases were very clear, most residues in the structures could be traced automatically using RESOLVE. The initial molecular models were built automatically using ARP/wARP (21Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of metalfree Emp46p CRD and forms 2-4 of Δ1-Emp47p CRD were solved by the molecular replacement method using the program MOLREP (22Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar) with K+-bound Emp46p CRD and form 1 Emp47p CRD as search models, respectively. The refinement procedures were carried out with CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Stereochemical qualities of the final models were assessed by PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Phasing statistics of Emp46p CRD and Emp47p CRDs are summarized in supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Final refinement statistics of Emp46p CRD and (Δ1)-Emp47p CRDs are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Figures were prepared using the GRASP (29Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar) and PyMOL (30DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar).Mutational Experiments—The mutation (Y131F) was introduced to the Emp46 gene by the PCR method. The amplified DNA fragment with the mutation was cloned into the BamHI and BglII sites of wild-type Emp46p/pGEX4T-1 plasmid. The overexpressed mutant protein was purified and crystallized according to the method used for the wild type. The crystal parameters of Y131F-Emp46p are shown in Table 1. The plasmid construction for yeast overexpression of the mutant and the cell manipulation were carried out as previously described (16Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2518-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).SPR Analysis—SPR measurements were carried out at 25 °C using a Biacore2000 (Biacore) equipped with a CM5 sensor chip. GST-Emp46p CRD (residues 6-229), GST-Y131F-Emp46p CRD-(6-229), and GST-Emp47p CRD-(7-227) were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Each purified protein was immobilized on the flow cell using the amine-coupling method. Glycoproteins carrying high mannose-type glycans (thyroglobulin, ovalbumin, and ribonuclease B; Sigma) in running buffer (10 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween20, 10 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm KCl) were injected over the flow cells at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. As for α1-acid glycoprotein, transferrin, and asialofetuin (Sigma), the measurements were carried out in the HBS-P-Ca buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Surfactant P20, and 10 mm CaCl2). For removal of sugar chains from these glycoproteins, 1 mg of glycoprotein was incubated with 10 milliunits of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) (Seikagaku Kogyo) in running buffer at 37 °C for 90 min.RESULTSStructures of Metal-free and K+-bound Emp46p CRD—Following the conventional notion of Ca2+ dependence of its mammalian orthologs ERGIC-53 and VIP36, we first tried to determine crystal structures of Emp46p CRD in the presence or absence of Ca2+ ion. Despite numerous trials to form Ca2+-bound Emp46p crystals, for example, crystallization in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2,Ca2+ was never found in the crystals. Instead, to our surprise, we found that Emp46p CRD bind another metal ion K+ bound in the crystal structures. Initially, the potassium ion was thought originat from the crystallization condition (0.3 m KF), but, as will be described below, we later confirmed that Emp46p is in the K+-bound form in the physiological conditions. The crystal structure of K+-bound Emp46p CRD was determined using MAD phasing at 1.8-Å (supplementary Table 1). As for metal-free Emp46p, we first prepared a metal-free protein sample whose metal compositions were confirmed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (data not shown). We used this solution for crystallization in the buffer that does not contain any metal ions. The structure of metal-free Emp46p CRD was solved by the molecular replacement method using the K+-bound Emp46p as a search model. The final model of K+-bound Emp46p refined to 20.0-1.52-Å resolution has an R-factor of 18.9% and an Rfree of 21.8%. On the other hand, the final model of metal-free Emp46p refined to 20.0-1.75-Å resolution has an R-factor of 21.0% and an Rfree of 23.7%. Final refinement statistics of the K+-bound and metal-free Emp46p are summarized in Table 1. In both cases, two molecules (A and B) of Emp46p were contained in an asymmetric unit. Emp46p, however, was eluted at positions corresponding to a monomer in gel filtration chromatography (data not shown), and the contact area of the two molecules is very small (319 Å2). Thus we concluded that the crystallographic dimer of Emp46p is non-physiological. In the K+-bound Emp46p, two K+ ions were observed: one is located at the edge of a concave β-sheet of molecule A (the first site), and the other in the dimer interface (the second site). The K+ ion in the second site is considered non-physiological because the K+ ion was replaced by a water molecule (data not shown) in other crystallization conditions with lower K+ ion concentrations, 100-150 mm, which correspond to physiological intracellular conditions (31Schapiro F.B. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21025-21032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Grabe M. Oster G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structure of molecule A is described hereafter as the K+-bound form.The overall structure of the K+-bound form of Emp46p is quite similar to that of the metal-free form with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.30 Å for the Cα atoms of Lys9-Ile225 residues. The CRD of Emp46p has an overall globular shape composed of a β-sandwich of two antiparallel β-sheets and is composed of 14 β-strands, a small α helix, and one turn of a 310 helix (Fig. 1, A and B). The β-sandwich comprises a seven-stranded (β2-β5-β14-β7-β8-β9-β10) concave β-sheet and a five-stranded (β15-β6-β11-β12-β13) convex β-sheet, in a variation of the jellyroll fold. The β-strands are numbered according to the secondary structure of p58/ERGIC-53 CRD (13Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A β-hairpin (strands β3 and β4) is inserted between β2 and β5. A crevice is formed by an 18-residue loop between β7 and β 8, and a 13-residue loop between β9 and β10. Residues Cys150 (strand β10) and Cys184 (strand β13) form a disulfide bond.

Moreover, at λ = 2.0Å, a prominent anomalous signal (∼20 σ) was observed at the corresponding site (Fig. 4A), indicating that it is identified as a metalbinding site. When the structure refined the metal as was with atom Ca2+ either or K+, the B values of the metal after refinement (15.3 or 14.5 Å2, respectively) were similar to those of the coordinating atoms (12.7 Å2 O-η of Tyr131 16.3Å2 for O of Ile141, 18.8 Å2 for O of Glu142 15.5Å for O of Ser144, 15.9 Å2 for O of Wat1, and 14.8 Å2 for O of Wat2). Metal binding in this position has never been observed in L-type lectins (14Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1988830354,"The UV and visible resonance Raman spectra are reported for CooA from Rhodospirillum rubrum, which is a transcriptional regulator activated by growth in a CO atmosphere. CO binding to heme in its sensor domain causes rearrangement of its DNA-binding domain, allowing binding of DNA with a specific sequence. The sensor and DNA-binding domains are linked by a hinge region that follows a long C-helix. UV resonance Raman bands arising from Trp-110 in the C-helix revealed local movement around Trp-110 upon CO binding. The indole side chain of Trp-110, which is exposed to solvent in the CO-free ferrous state, becomes buried in the CO-bound state with a slight change in its orientation but maintains a hydrogen bond with a water molecule at the indole nitrogen. This is the first experimental data supporting a previously proposed model involving displacement of the C-helix and heme sliding. The UV resonance Raman spectra for the CooA-DNA complex indicated that binding of DNA to CooA induces a further displacement of the C-helix in the same direction during transition to the complete active conformation. The Fe-CO and C-O stretching bands showed frequency shifts upon DNA binding, but the Fe-His stretching band did not. Moreover, CO-geminate recombination was more efficient in the DNA-bound state. These results suggest that the C-helix displacement in the DNA-bound form causes the CO binding pocket to narrow and become more negative.

A long α-helix (the C-helix) runs through the length of the protein, and a subsequent hinge region connects the two domains. The dimer interface is formed by the C-helices via a coiled-coil interaction. The two subunits in active (dimeric) CRP are symmetrically bent at the hinge region (15Passner J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc.

In contrast, in inactive CooA, one subunit in the dimer was bent (blue in Fig. 1), whereas the other was extended (red). Recently, a small angle x-ray scattering study suggested a different structure in which both subunits are bent even in the inactive state to yield a more compact overall structure (19Akiyama S.

Previous Raman spectroscopic studies of mutant CooAs revealed that Ile-113, Leu-116, Gly-117, and Leu-120 are close to the bound CO in CO-CooA (27Coyle C.M. Puranik M. Youn H. Nielsen S.B.

These four residues are located on the dimer interface of the C-helix, and at a substantial distance from the heme iron in the inactive ferrous state (Fig. 1b). It was therefore proposed that when CO displaces Pro-2, the CO-bound heme slides to the inner side of the protein with concomitant displacement of the C-helix (27Coyle C.M. Puranik M. Youn H.

In the present study, we applied ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy to elucidate the conformational change in CooA during conversion of its inactive ferrous form to its active CO-bound form. Our UVRR spectra provide the first experimental data that permit evaluation of the proposed models for the movement of the C-helix with heme sliding. Furthermore, we extended the measurements to CooA in complex with a target DNA (CO-CooA-DNA) to investigate the conformational change in CooA evoked by the counteraction from the target DNA. Visible RR spectroscopy was also applied to characterize the structure of the heme pocket in CO-CooA-DNA. The results from these experiments suggest that CO-CooA-DNA holds the effector CO in a narrower space in its binding pocket than CO-CooA. We further discuss the implications of our findings with respect to the protein conformational changes in CooA. Sample Preparation—CooA from R. rubrum was expressed and purified as described previously with slight modifications (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, a (His)6 tag was added at the C terminus of CooA. The His-tagged recombinant CooA was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified using a Ni2+-Sepharose column (HisTrap HP; Amersham Biosciences) and a Q-Sepharose column (HiTrap Q FF; Amersham Biosciences). The buffer of the final purified protein was exchanged to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The protein concentration was determined by absorption spectroscopy (U-3310; Hitachi) on the basis of heme content (23Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and is therefore expressed in terms of monomer units. Ferric CooA was converted to the ferrous form by adding a slight excess of freshly prepared dithionite solution under a nitrogen atmosphere. CO-CooA was generated by introducing gaseous CO into ferrous CooA. CO-CooA-DNA was prepared as follows. Two strands of 26-mer oligonucleotides containing PcooF (5′-ATAACTGTCATCTGGCCGACAGACGG-3′ and 5′-CCGTCTGTCGGCCAGATGACAGTTAT-3′) purified by high performance liquid chromatography were purchased from Operon Biotechnologies and used without further purification. These strands were heated at 80 °C for 5 min and then annealed at room temperature for ∼3 h to form double-stranded DNA. Ferric CooA containing an adequate amount of DNA (at least 2 eq per protein monomer) and in the presence of sufficient MgCl2 (>10 mm) was converted to the CO-bound form as described above for CO-CooA. The CO-CooA-DNA sample was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Because CO-CooA has a KD of 8 nm for the target DNA in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ (29Youn H. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the concentration of target DNA we employed was enough to allow ∼99% of the protein to bind to the target DNA. No additional absorption and Raman spectral changes occurred in the presence of additional DNA. UVRR Spectroscopy—The 206.5-nm excited RR spectra were measured with the Raman instrument as described in detail elsewhere (30Aki M. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 10765-10774Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A CW laser line at 206.5 nm was obtained from an intracavity frequency-doubled krypton ion laser (Innova FreD; Coherent). The laser power at the sample point was adjusted to 100 μW. Sodium perchlorate (0.4 m) was used as the internal intensity standard. The 229-nm excited RR spectra were measured with a new setup. A 0.2-ns laser pulse at 229 nm was generated by frequency quadrupling the output of a Ti:sapphire laser with a repetition rate of 82 MHz (Tsunami 3950C; Spectra Physics) that was pumped by a 532-nm CW intracavity frequency-doubled Nd:YVO4 laser (Millennia 10S; Spectra Physics). The seed pulse from the Ti:sapphire oscillator was amplified at 1 kHz by a regenerative amplifier (Spitfire; Spectra Physics) that was pumped with a 527-nm output of a Q-switched pulsed intracavity frequency-doubled Nd:YLF laser (Evolution-X; Spectra Physics). Raman scattered light was collected with a UV microscope objective lens (Ultrafluar ×10; Zeiss) at 90° geometry and focused with a UV achromatic lens onto the entrance slit of a custom-made prism prefilter (Bunkoh-Keiki) coupled to an 1-m single spectrometer (SPEX 1000M; Jovin Yvon). The prefilter effectively rejected stray background because of Rayleigh scattering and visible fluorescence. The spectrometer was equipped with a 3600 groove/mm holographic grating and a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Spec10:400B/LN; Roper Scientific). The laser power at the sample point was reduced to 0.2 μJ to avoid sample photodamage. The sample cell was rotated at 2000 rpm. Sodium sulfate (0.2 m) was used as the internal intensity standard. Raman cross-sections were calculated as described previously (31Fodor S.P.A. Copeland R.A. Grygon C.A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5509-5518Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). UVRR spectra for ferrous CooA and CO-CooA were measured as follows. After data acquisition for ferrous CooA through ∼10 exposures (the data were accumulated for 1 min in each exposure), the ferrous sample was replaced with a fresh CO-bound sample, and the data for CO-CooA were then acquired through ∼10 exposures. This process was repeated 3 times to yield a final UVRR spectrum as the sum of ∼30 exposures for each CooA sample. The spectrum of cyclohexane was finally measured for calibration of Raman shifts, providing an accuracy of ±1 cm-1 for well defined Raman lines. UVRR measurements for CO-CooA and CO-CooA-DNA were also performed using the same procedure. The wavenumber resolution was ∼1.2 cm-1/CCD pixel and ∼0.9 cm-1/CCD pixel for the 206.5- and 229-nm excited RR spectra, respectively. Visible RR Spectroscopy—Static RR spectra excited at 406.7 and 428.7 nm were measured with a 75-cm single spectrometer (SPEX750M; Jovin Yvon) equipped with a 2400 groove/mm holographic grating and a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Spec10:400B/LN; Roper Scientific). The CW light at 406.7 and 428.7 nm was obtained from a krypton ion laser (BeamLok2060; Spectra Physics) and a diode laser (58-BTLR010; Melles Griot), respectively. To prevent CO photodissociation and sample photodamage, the sample cell was rotated at 2000 rpm, and the laser power at the sample point was reduced to 30 μW for CO-CooA and 300 μW for CO-CooA-DNA. Picosecond time-resolved RR spectra were obtained using a home-made pump/probe system, in which the wavelength of the pump and probe beams were set to 540 and 442 nm, respectively. Details of the apparatus were described previously (32Uesugi Y. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1997; 68: 4001-4008Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Chem. Rec. 2001; 1: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 10992-10999Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The laser power at the sample point was 17 and 0.3 μJ for the pump and probe beams, respectively. The wavenumber resolution was ∼0.5 and ∼0.7 cm-1/CCD pixel for static and time-resolved RR spectra, respectively. The Raman shifts were calibrated within an accuracy of ±1 cm-1 for visible RR spectroscopy. α-Helical Content of Ferrous CooA and CO-CooA—The RR spectra excited around 200 nm are mainly composed of bands arising from the backbone amide modes (amides I, II, and III and Cα-H bending) as well as ring modes for aromatic residues such as Phe, Trp, and Tyr (35Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems. 13. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, United Kingdom1986: 113-175Google Scholar, 36Austin J. Jordan T. Spiro T.G. Clark R.J.H.

John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom2002Google Scholar). The amide bands correlate with the protein secondary structure and can be used to estimate the α-helical content (38Holtz J.S.W. Bormett R.W. Chi Z. Cho N. Chen X.G. Pajcini V. Asher S.A. Spinelli L. Owen P. Arrigoni M. Appl. Spectrosc. 1996; 50: 1459-1468Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Chi Z. Chen X.G. Holtz J.S.

Soc. 2001; 123: 11775-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The RR spectra excited at 206.5 nm for ferrous CooA and CO-CooA and their difference spectrum are shown in Fig. 2, a-c, respectively. The frequencies, intensities, and band shapes of the amide bands in spectra a and b were essentially identical. Therefore, the α-helical content of CooA, which is estimated to be ∼35% in the ferrous form based on the crystal structure (12Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), is changed little by CO binding. Conformational Changes Around Trp and Tyr Induced by CO Binding—Raman bands arising from Trp and Tyr are selectively enhanced upon excitation around 220-250 nm and can be used as the structural probes for their surroundings (35Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems. 13. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, United Kingdom1986: 113-175Google Scholar, 36Austin J. Jordan T. Spiro T.G. Clark R.J.H.

John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom2002Google Scholar). The CooA subunit has one Trp (Trp-110) in the C-helix, two Tyr (Tyr-55 and Tyr-67) in the sensor domain, and two Tyr (Tyr-192 and Tyr-201) in the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1a). Fig. 3, a and b, show the 229-nm excited RR spectra for ferrous CooA and CO-CooA, respectively. The bands arising from Trp and Tyr are marked by W and Y, respectively, and are followed by individual mode numbers (35Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems. 13. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, United Kingdom1986: 113-175Google Scholar, 36Austin J. Jordan T. Spiro T.G. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Biomolecular Spectroscopy, Part A. 20. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 55-127Google Scholar, 37Kitagawa T. Hirota S. Chalmers J.M. Griffiths P.R. Raman Spectroscopy of Proteins. 5. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom2002Google Scholar). The spectra were dominated by the Trp bands (W1, W3, W7 doublet, W16, W17, and W18) and the Tyr bands (Y7a, Y8a, Y8b, and Y9a). The difference spectrum c, which was calculated with the SO42 band at 981 cm-1 as an internal intensity standard, indicates that the intensity of the Trp bands increased upon CO binding, whereas there was no appreciable difference for the Tyr bands. In particular, the increase of the W16 intensity was most pronounced. The UVRR intensity of Trp is sensitive to both the hydrogen-bond strength at the indole nitrogen and the environmental hydrophobicity around the indole ring (41Chi Z. Asher S.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 9595-9602Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 42Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). W17 is a marker of hydrogen bonding at the indole nitrogen (42Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 43Miura T. Takeuchi H. Harada I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The frequency of W17 for ferrous CooA was observed at 878 cm-1, which indicates a medium-strength hydrogen bond, similar to that formed with solvent water. In fact, the indole nitrogen of Trp-110 is exposed to solvent in the crystal structure (12Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). CO-CooA showed the same W17 frequency as ferrous CooA, indicating that the hydrogen bond to a water molecule is maintained after CO binding. Therefore, the increase in intensity of the Trp bands upon CO binding is ascribed to an increase in the hydrophobicity around Trp-110, whose indole ring has one side accessible to solvent in the ferrous state (12Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). W3 is known to serve as a marker for the conformation of Trp. Its frequency correlates well with the torsion angle (χ2,1) about the C2 = C3-Cβ-Cα linkage (42Takeuchi H. Biopolymers. 2003; 72: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 44Miura T. Takeuchi H. Harada I. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1989; 20: 667-671Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which is one of parameters describing the side chain orientation. The χ2,1 angle of Trp-110 in ferrous CooA was estimated from the observed W3 frequency (1554 cm-1) to be 104°, which is the same as that of Trp in water (Fig. 25 in Ref. 36Austin J. Jordan T. Spiro T.G. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Biomolecular Spectroscopy, Part A. 20. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 55-127Google Scholar). Thus, the tension imposed on the side chain of Trp-110 from its surroundings is very small; however, the χ2,1 angle of Trp-110 in the crystal structure was about 87° (12Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which is expected to give a W3 band at 1547 cm-1. The large deviation from our estimation is probably because of the crystal packing force. Upon CO binding, the W3 band was upshifted by ∼1 cm-1 (approximately one CCD pixel) (Fig. 3, inset), whereas the peak positions of the other bands, including the internal intensity standard band, were unchanged within the half of the CCD pixel. Similar results were obtained when the experiments were repeated on different days, with a W3 band shift from 1554 ± 0.4 to 1555 ± 0.5 cm-1. Therefore, we judged that the small upshift in the W3 band is physically meaningful, although the increase in the χ2,1 angle was only ∼2°. Conformational Changes Around Trp and Tyr Induced by Binding of the Target DNA—We also applied UVRR spectroscopy to CO-CooA-DNA. Fig. 4, a and b, show the 229-nm excited RR spectra for CO-CooA-DNA and CO-CooA, respectively. Their difference, shown in spectrum c, contained the bands arising from nucleotide residues of the target DNA (45Wen Z.Q. Thomas Jr., G.J. Biopolymers. 1998; 45: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46Tsuboi M. Benevides J.M. Bondre P. Thomas Jr., G.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4861-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as Trp and Tyr residues of CooA. The spectrum of the target DNA was measured separately and is shown in spectrum d. Thus, the net difference of the Trp and Tyr bands caused by binding of the target DNA, shown in spectrum e, was obtained from the difference between spectra c and d. The double-difference spectrum e resembled the difference spectrum between ferrous CooA and CO-CooA (Fig. 3c). Specifically, the intensity of the Trp bands increased upon binding of the target DNA without a frequency shift in W17, whereas the Tyr bands exhibited no clear change. In addition, W3 was again upshifted very slightly (∼1 cm-1). These results suggest that the transition from CO-CooA to CO-CooA-DNA involves a conformational change around Trp-110 similar to that occurring during the transition from ferrous CooA to CO-CooA. To compare the Trp band intensity among ferrous CooA, CO-CooA, and CO-CooA-DNA, we calculated Raman cross-sections. The Raman cross-section for W16 was 1.5, 1.8, and 2.1 barns/(molecule steradian) for ferrous CooA, CO-CooA, and CO-CooA-DNA, respectively. The magnitude of increase in the Raman cross-section upon binding of the target DNA was comparable with that observed upon CO binding, indicating that the increase in hydrophobicity around Trp-110 induced by binding of the target DNA is as large as that induced by CO binding. Structural Change of the Proximal Heme Pocket Induced by Binding of the Target DNA—The electronic absorption spectra of CO-CooA and CO-CooA-DNA are depicted in Fig. 5. The Soret band was red-shifted by 0.6 nm (34 cm-1) by binding of target DNA, which is indicative of a small structural rearrangement in the vicinity of heme. We next examined the Fe-His stretching mode, ν(Fe-His), to probe the structural change of the heme pocket by a more sensitive method. Because the geminate recombination of CO to CooA is very rapid (discussed below), we observed RR spectra of the immediate five-coordinate photoproducts after the CO photodissociation using a picosecond time-resolved technique. The time-resolved RR spectra of photodissociated CO-CooA are displayed in Fig. 6a. Although we previously reported the ν(Fe-His) of photodissociated CooA to be 211 cm-1 (25Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the current experiments, which had a higher signal to noise ratio, determined the frequency to be 216 cm-1. Binding of the target DNA to CooA did not change the ν(Fe-His) frequency as shown in Fig. 6b.FIGURE 6The 442-nm excited time-resolved RR spectra at the indicated times following CO photodissociation of CO-CooA (a) and CO-CooA-DNA (b) upon pumping at 540 nm. Each spectrum was obtained by subtracting the probe-only spectrum multiplied by an appropriate factor from the pump-probe spectrum. The concentrations of protein and target DNA were 100 and 200 μm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The band intensity of ν(Fe-His) decreased with time because of the CO-geminate recombination. Previous reports indicated that more than ∼90% of the photodissociated CO from CO-CooA recombines geminately with time constants of ∼70 and ∼300 ps (47Kumazaki S. Nakajima H. Sakaguchi T. Nakagawa E.

In the presence of the target DNA, we note that the ν(Fe-His) band for CO-CooA-DNA decayed faster and vanished completely within 1 ns, indicating a higher rate of geminate recombination by CO along with a high quantum yield close to unity in the DNA-bound form. The modulation of CO geminate recombination without a change in the Fe-His bond strength suggests that binding of the target DNA to CooA alters the heme pocket structure on the distal side rather than on the proximal"
https://openalex.org/W1989901734,"Secretory polypeptides are vital for nervous system function, sleep, reproduction, growth, and metabolism. Ribosomes scanning the 5'-end of mRNA usually detect the first AUG site for initiating translation. The nascent propeptide chain is then directed via a signal-peptide into the endoplasmic reticulum, processed through the Golgi stacks, and packaged into secretory vesicles. By expressing prepropeptide-EGFP fusion proteins, we observed unusual destinations, mitochondria, nucleus, and cytoplasm, of neuropeptide Y (NPY), atrial natriuretic peptide, and growth hormone in living murine cardiac cells and hypothalamic slices. Subcellular expression was modulated by Zn++ or mutations of N-terminal prohormone sequences but was not due to overexpression in the trans-Golgi network. Mitochondrial targeting of NPY also occurred without the EGFP tag, was enhanced by site-directed mutagenesis of the first AUG initiation site, and abolished by mutation of the second AUG. Immunological methods indicated the presence of N-terminal truncated NPY in mitochondria. Imaging studies showed depolarization of NPY-containing mitochondria. P-SORT software correctly predicted the secondary intracellular destinations and suggested such destinations for many neuropeptides and peptide hormones known. Thus, mammalian cells may retarget secretory peptides from extracellular to intracellular sites by skipping the first translation-initiation codon and thereby alter mitochondrial function, gene expression, and secretion."
