https://openalex.org/W3216341763,"There has been considerable recent progress in protein structure prediction using deep neural networks to predict inter-residue distances from amino acid sequences1‚Äì3. Here we investigate whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting residue‚Äìresidue distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence) between the inter-residue¬†distance distributions predicted by the network and background distributions averaged over all proteins. Optimization from different random starting points resulted in novel proteins spanning a wide range of sequences and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 of the network-‚Äòhallucinated‚Äô sequences, and expressed and purified the proteins in Escherichia coli; 27 of the proteins yielded monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the three-dimensional¬†structures of three of the hallucinated proteins, two by X-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and these closely matched the hallucinated models. Thus, deep networks trained to predict native protein structures from their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and such networks and methods should contribute alongside traditional physics-based models to the de novo design of proteins with new functions. The trRosetta neural network was used to iteratively optimise model proteins from random 100-amino-acid sequences, resulting in ‚Äòhallucinated‚Äô proteins, which when expressed in bacteria closely resembled the model structures."
https://openalex.org/W3217307638,"CD4 T follicular helper (TFH) cells support B cells, which are critical for germinal center (GC) formation, but the importance of TFH-B cell interactions in cancer is unclear. We found enrichment of TFH cell transcriptional signature correlates with GC B cell signature and with prolonged survival in individuals with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We further developed a murine LUAD model in which tumor cells express B cell- and T cell-recognized neoantigens. Interactions between tumor-specific TFH and GC B cells, as well as interleukin (IL)-21 primarily produced by TFH cells, are necessary for tumor control and effector CD8 T cell function. Development of TFH cells requires B cells and B cell-recognized neoantigens. Thus, tumor neoantigens can regulate the fate of tumor-specific CD4 T cells by facilitating their interactions with tumor-specific B cells, which in turn promote anti-tumor immunity by enhancing CD8 T cell effector functions."
https://openalex.org/W3216692711,"The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain is a canonical component of animal and plant immune systems1,2. In plants, intracellular pathogen sensing by immune receptors triggers their TIR domains to generate a molecule that is a variant of cyclic ADP-ribose3,4. This molecule is hypothesized to mediate plant cell death through a pathway that has yet to be resolved5. TIR domains have also been shown to be involved in a bacterial anti-phage defence system called Thoeris6, but the mechanism of Thoeris defence remained unknown. Here we show that phage infection triggers Thoeris TIR-domain proteins to produce an isomer of cyclic ADP-ribose. This molecular signal activates a second protein, ThsA, which then depletes the cell of the essential molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and leads to abortive infection and cell death. We also show that, similar to eukaryotic innate immune systems, bacterial TIR-domain proteins determine the immunological specificity to the invading pathogen. Our results describe an antiviral signalling pathway in bacteria, and suggest that the generation of intracellular signalling molecules is an ancient immunological function of TIR domains that is conserved in both plant and bacterial immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3215285253,"The practice of mathematics involves discovering patterns and using these to formulate and prove conjectures, resulting in theorems. Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures1, most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture2, a Millennium Prize Problem3. Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning-demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups4. Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning."
https://openalex.org/W3216574369,"Most plant roots have multiple cortex layers that make up the bulk of the organ and play key roles in physiology, such as flood tolerance and symbiosis. However, little is known about the formation of cortical layers outside of the highly reduced anatomy of Arabidopsis. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to rapidly generate a cell-resolution map of the maize root, revealing an alternative configuration of the tissue formative transcription factor SHORT-ROOT (SHR) adjacent to an expanded cortex. We show that maize SHR protein is hypermobile, moving at least eight cell layers into the cortex. Higher-order SHR mutants in both maize and Setaria have reduced numbers of cortical layers, showing that the SHR pathway controls expansion of cortical tissue to elaborate anatomical complexity."
https://openalex.org/W3217609918,"Local circuit architecture facilitates the emergence of feature selectivity in the cerebral cortex1. In the hippocampus, it remains unknown whether local computations supported by specific connectivity motifs2 regulate the spatial receptive fields of pyramidal cells3. Here we developed an in vivo electroporation method for monosynaptic retrograde tracing4 and optogenetics manipulation at single-cell resolution to interrogate the dynamic interaction of place cells with their microcircuitry during navigation. We found a local circuit mechanism in CA1 whereby the spatial tuning of an individual place cell can propagate to a functionally recurrent subnetwork5 to which it belongs. The emergence of place fields in individual neurons led to the development of inverse selectivity in a subset of their presynaptic interneurons, and recruited functionally coupled place cells at that location. Thus, the spatial selectivity of single CA1 neurons is amplified through local circuit plasticity to enable effective multi-neuronal representations that can flexibly scale environmental features locally without degrading the feedforward input structure."

No definitive treatment exists, hence accelerated development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines, offers a unique opportunity for COVID-19 prevention and control. Vaccine hesitancy may limit the success of vaccine distribution in Africa, therefore we assessed the potentials for coronavirus vaccine hesitancy and its determinants among Africans. An online cross-sectional African-wide survey was administered in Arabic, English, and French languages. Questions on demographics, self-reported health status, vaccine literacy, knowledge and perception on vaccines, past experience, behavior, infection risk, willingness to receive and affordability of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine were asked. Data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. A total of 5,416 individuals completed the survey. Approximately, 94% were residents of 34 African countries while the other Africans live in the Diaspora. Only 63% of all participants surveyed were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible and 79% were worried about its side effects. Thirty-nine percent expressed concerns of vaccine-associated infection. The odds of vaccine hesitancy was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.30) among those who believed their risk of infection was very high, compared to those who believed otherwise. The odds of vaccine hesitancy was one-fifth (OR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.28) among those who believed their risk of falling sick was very high, compared to those who believed their risk of falling very sick was very low. The OR of vaccine hesitancy was 2.72 (95% CI: 2.24, 3.31) among those who have previously refused a vaccine for themselves or their child compared to counterparts with no self-reported history of vaccine hesitancy. Participants want the vaccines to be mandatory (40%), provided free of charge (78%) and distributed in homes and offices (44%). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is substantial among Africans based on perceived risk of coronavirus infection and past experiences."
https://openalex.org/W3215169072,"In quantum fluids, the quantization of circulation forbids the diffusion of a vortex swirling flow seen in classical viscous fluids. Yet, accelerating quantum vortices may lose their energy into acoustic radiations1,2, similar to the way electric charges decelerate on emitting photons. The dissipation of vortex energy underlies central problems in quantum hydrodynamics3, such as the decay of quantum turbulence, highly relevant to systems as varied as neutron stars, superfluid helium and atomic condensates4,5. A deep understanding of the elementary mechanisms behind irreversible vortex dynamics has been a goal for decades3,6, but it is complicated by the shortage of conclusive experimental signatures7. Here we address this challenge by realizing a programmable vortex collider in a planar, homogeneous atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable inter-particle interactions. We create on-demand vortex configurations and monitor their evolution, taking advantage of the accessible time and length scales of ultracold Fermi gases8,9. Engineering collisions within and between vortex-antivortex pairs allows us to decouple relaxation of the vortex energy due to sound emission and that due to interactions with normal fluid (that is, mutual friction). We directly visualize how the annihilation of vortex dipoles radiates a sound pulse. Further, our few-vortex experiments extending across different superfluid regimes reveal non-universal dissipative dynamics, suggesting that fermionic quasiparticles localized inside the vortex core contribute significantly to dissipation, thereby opening the route to exploring new pathways for quantum turbulence decay, vortex by vortex."

https://openalex.org/W3216042640,"Mass selection into groups of like-minded individuals may be fragmenting and polarizing online society, particularly with respect to partisan differences1-4. However, our ability to measure the social makeup of online communities and in turn, to understand the social organization of online platforms, is limited by the pseudonymous, unstructured and large-scale nature of digital discussion. Here we develop a neural-embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online communities along social dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 5.1 billion comments made in 10,000 communities over 14 years on Reddit, we measure how the macroscale community structure is organized with respect to age, gender and US political partisanship. Examining political content, we find that Reddit underwent a significant polarization event around the 2016 US presidential election. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, individual-level polarization is rare; the system-level shift in 2016 was disproportionately driven by the arrival of new users. Political polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the platform and is instead temporally aligned with external events. We also observe a stark ideological asymmetry, with the sharp increase in polarization in 2016 being entirely attributable to changes in right-wing activity. This methodology is broadly applicable to the study of online interaction, and our findings have implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the social contexts of online behaviour, and quantifying the dynamics and mechanisms of online polarization."
https://openalex.org/W3215150543,"Pro-inflammatory T cells in the central nervous system (CNS) are causally associated with multiple demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases1-6, but the pathways that control these responses remain unclear. Here we define a population of inflammatory group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) that infiltrate the CNS in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. These ILC3s are derived from the circulation, localize in proximity to infiltrating T cells in the CNS, function as antigen-presenting cells that restimulate myelin-specific T cells, and are increased in individuals with multiple sclerosis. Notably, antigen presentation by inflammatory ILC3s is required to promote T cell responses in the CNS and the development of multiple-sclerosis-like disease in mouse models. By contrast, conventional and tissue-resident ILC3s in the periphery do not appear to contribute to disease induction, but instead limit autoimmune T cell responses and prevent multiple-sclerosis-like disease when experimentally targeted to present myelin antigen. Collectively, our data define a population of inflammatory ILC3s that is essential for directly promoting T-cell-dependent neuroinflammation in the CNS and reveal the potential of harnessing peripheral tissue-resident ILC3s for the prevention of autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W3214039811,"RNA viruses generate defective viral genomes (DVGs) that can interfere with replication of the parental wild-type virus. To examine their therapeutic potential, we created a DVG by deleting the capsid-coding region of poliovirus. Strikingly, intraperitoneal or intranasal administration of this genome, which we termed eTIP1, elicits an antiviral response, inhibits replication, and protects mice from several RNA viruses, including enteroviruses, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. While eTIP1 replication following intranasal administration is limited to the nasal cavity, its antiviral action extends non-cell-autonomously to the lungs. eTIP1 broad-spectrum antiviral effects are mediated by both local and distal type I interferon responses. Importantly, while a single eTIP1 dose protects animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it also stimulates production of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies that afford long-lasting protection from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Thus, eTIP1 is a safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral generating short- and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections in animal models."
https://openalex.org/W3216209897,"The human monoclonal antibody C10 exhibits extraordinary cross-reactivity, potently neutralizing Zika virus (ZIKV) and the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-DENV4). Here we describe a comparative structure-function analysis of C10 bound to the envelope (E) protein dimers of the five viruses it neutralizes. We demonstrate that the C10 Fab has high affinity for ZIKV and DENV1 but not for DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4. We further show that the C10 interaction with the latter viruses requires an E protein conformational landscape that limits binding to only one of the three independent epitopes per virion. This limited affinity is nevertheless counterbalanced by the particle's icosahedral organization, which allows two different dimers to be reached by both Fab arms of a C10 immunoglobulin. The epitopes' geometric distribution thus confers C10 its exceptional neutralization breadth. Our results highlight the importance not only of paratope/epitope complementarity but also the topological distribution for epitope-focused vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W3215195814,"Translation of the genetic code into proteins is realized through repetitions of synchronous translocation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNAs (tRNA) through the ribosome. In eukaryotes translocation is ensured by elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which catalyses the process and actively contributes to its accuracy1. Although numerous studies point to critical roles for both the conserved eukaryotic posttranslational modification diphthamide in eEF2 and tRNA modifications in supporting the accuracy of translocation, detailed molecular mechanisms describing their specific functions are poorly understood. Here we report a high-resolution X-ray structure of the eukaryotic 80S ribosome in a translocation-intermediate state containing mRNA, naturally modified eEF2 and tRNAs. The crystal structure reveals a network of stabilization of codon-anticodon interactions involving diphthamide1 and the hypermodified nucleoside wybutosine at position 37 of phenylalanine tRNA, which is also known to enhance translation accuracy2. The model demonstrates how the decoding centre releases a codon-anticodon duplex, allowing its movement on the ribosome, and emphasizes the function of eEF2 as a 'pawl' defining the directionality of translocation3. This model suggests how eukaryote-specific elements of the 80S ribosome, eEF2 and tRNAs undergo large-scale molecular reorganizations to ensure maintenance of the mRNA reading frame during the complex process of translocation."
https://openalex.org/W3214797131,"Soil salinity is significant abiotic stress that severely limits global crop production. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important grain legume that plays a substantial role in nutritional food security, especially in the developing world. This study used a chickpea population collected from the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Area (ICARDA) genebank using the focused identification of germplasm strategy. The germplasm included 186 genotypes with broad Asian and African origins and genotyped with 1856 DArTseq markers. We conducted phenotyping for salinity in the field (Arish, Sinai, Egypt) and greenhouse hydroponic experiments at 100 mM NaCl concentration. Based on the performance in both hydroponic and field experiments, we identified seven genotypes from Azerbaijan and Pakistan (IGs: 70782, 70430, 70764, 117703, 6057, 8447, and 70249) as potential sources for high salinity tolerance. Multi-trait genome-wide association analysis (mtGWAS) detected one locus on chromosome Ca4 at 10618070 bp associated with salinity tolerance under hydroponic and field conditions. In addition, we located another locus specific to the hydroponic system on chromosome Ca2 at 30537619 bp. Gene annotation analysis revealed the location of rs5825813 within the Embryogenesis-associated protein (EMB8-like), while the location of rs5825939 is within the Ribosomal Protein Large P0 (RPLP0). Utilizing such markers in practical breeding programs can effectively improve the adaptability of current chickpea cultivars in saline soil. Moreover, researchers can use our markers to facilitate the incorporation of new genes into commercial cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W3214898786,"Armoured dinosaurs are well known for their evolution of specialized tail weapons-paired tail spikes in stegosaurs and heavy tail clubs in advanced ankylosaurs1. Armoured dinosaurs from southern Gondwana are rare and enigmatic, but probably include the earliest branches of Ankylosauria2-4. Here we describe a mostly complete, semi-articulated skeleton of a small (approximately 2 m) armoured dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period of Magallanes in southernmost Chile, a region that is biogeographically related to West Antarctica5. Stegouros elengassen gen. et sp. nov. evolved a large tail weapon unlike any dinosaur: a flat, frond-like structure formed by seven pairs of laterally projecting osteoderms encasing the distal half of the tail. Stegouros shows ankylosaurian cranial characters, but a largely ancestral postcranial skeleton, with some stegosaur-like characters. Phylogenetic analyses placed Stegouros in Ankylosauria; specifically, it is related to Kunbarrasaurus from Australia6 and Antarctopelta from Antarctica7, forming a clade of Gondwanan ankylosaurs that split earliest from all other ankylosaurs. The large osteoderms and specialized tail vertebrae in Antarctopelta suggest that it had a tail weapon similar to Stegouros. We propose a new clade, the Parankylosauria, to include the first ancestor of Stegouros-but not Ankylosaurus-and all descendants of that ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W3215646490,"Increased blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and fibrinogen are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. We identified associations between an Amish-enriched missense variant (p.Asn352Ser) in a functional domain of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1) and 13.9 milligrams per deciliter lower LDL-C (P = 4.1 × 10–19) and 29 milligrams per deciliter lower plasma fibrinogen (P = 1.3 × 10–5). B4GALT1 gene–based analysis in 544,955 subjects showed an association with decreased coronary artery disease (odds ratio = 0.64, P = 0.006). The mutant protein had 50% lower galactosyltransferase activity compared with the wild-type protein. N-linked glycan profiling of human serum found serine 352 allele to be associated with decreased galactosylation and sialylation of apolipoprotein B100, fibrinogen, immunoglobulin G, and transferrin. B4galt1353Ser knock-in mice showed decreases in LDL-C and fibrinogen. Our findings suggest that targeted modulation of protein galactosylation may represent a therapeutic approach to decreasing cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3215893826,"Background Psychological distress and self-rated health status may create additional complexities in patients already diagnosed with breast cancer. This study aims to assess the association of self-report-based assessment of psychological distress and self-rated health on survival times among women with breast cancer diagnoses. Methods Seventeen-year data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series—National Health Interview Survey (IPUMS-NHIS) were pooled and analyzed. Women who were aged 30 to 64 years old, with breast cancer diagnosis were selected (n = 2,819). The outcome variable was time to death. The independent variables were self-reported assessment of psychological distress and self-rated health. Psychological distress was defined using the Kessler-6 scale while self-rated health was measured on a 3-point Likert scale: Poor, Fair, and Good-to-Excellent (referred to as good for brevity). We computed unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) using Cox-Proportional Hazard regression models with sociodemographic characteristics and measures of health care access used as potential confounders. Significance was set at alpha = 0.05. Results Women with breast cancer assessed as having psychological distress had 46% (Adjusted HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.02–2.09) increased risks of mortality. Also, women who rated their health as poor or fair had a significantly elevated mortality risk (Poor Health: Adjusted HR: 3.05; 95% CI: 2.61–4.69; Fair Health: Adjusted HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.43–2.35) as compared to women with good health status. Conclusions Self-reported psychological distress and fair and poor self-rated health are associated with reduced survival times among women with breast cancer diagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W3215991458,"Computerized algorithms known as symptom checkers aim to help patients decide what to do should they have a new medical concern. However, despite widespread implementation, most studies on symptom checkers have involved simulated patients. Only limited evidence currently exists about symptom checker safety or accuracy when used by real patients. We developed a new prototype symptom checker and assessed its safety and accuracy in a prospective cohort of patients presenting to primary care and emergency departments with new medical concerns.A prospective cohort study was done to assess the prototype's performance. The cohort consisted of adult patients (≥16 years old) who presented to hospital emergency departments and family physician clinics. Primary outcomes were safety and accuracy of triage recommendations to seek hospital care, seek primary care, or manage symptoms at home.Data from 281 hospital patients and 300 clinic patients were collected and analyzed. Sensitivity to emergencies was 100% (10/10 encounters). Sensitivity to urgencies was 90% (73/81) and 97% (34/35) for hospital and primary care patients, respectively. The prototype was significantly more accurate than patients at triage (73% versus 58%, p<0.01). Compliance with triage recommendations in this cohort using this iteration of the symptom checker would have reduced hospital visits by 55% but cause potential harm in 2-3% from delay in care.The prototype symptom checker was superior to patients in deciding the most appropriate treatment setting for medical issues. This symptom checker could reduce a significant number of unnecessary hospital visits, with accuracy and safety outcomes comparable to existing data on telephone triage."
https://openalex.org/W3215675655,"Secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) is a glycoprotein with frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain that binds with Wnt ligands or frizzled receptors to regulate Wnt signaling. SFRP2 is frequently hypermethylated in glioma patients, and analysis of TCGA data indicates that SFRP2 is one of the most downregulated genes in radiotherapy treated glioma patients. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential function of SFRP2 in tumorigenesis and radioresistance of glioma. The RNA sequencing data of TCGA glioma samples were downloaded and analyzed. SFRP2 expression in 166 glioma patients was evaluated by qRT-PCR. The potential functions of SFRP2 in glioma were evaluated by loss-of-function assays and gain-of-function assays in glioma cell lines. We found that SFRP2 was downregulated in radiotherapy-treated glioma patients, and low SFRP2 expression was correlated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis. CRISP/Cas9-meidated SFRP2 knockdown promoted soft agar colony formation, cancer stemness and radioresistance of glioma cells, while enforced SFRP2 expression exhibited opposite effects. Moreover, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated in radiotherapy treated glioma patients. SFRP2 knockdown activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in glioma cell lines, while overexpression of SFRP2 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin activation. Besides, pharmacological inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by XAV-939 abrogated the effects of SFRP2 knockdown on cancer stemness and radioresistance of glioma cells. Our data for the first time demonstrated a role of SFRP2 in radioresistance of glioma cells, and suggested that inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling might be a potential strategy for increasing radiosensitivity of glioma patients."
https://openalex.org/W3215886179,"Spatiotemporal control of brain activity by optogenetics has emerged as an essential tool to study brain function. For silencing brain activity, optogenetic probes, such as halorhodopsin and archaerhodopsin, inhibit transmitter release indirectly by hyperpolarizing membrane potentials. However, these probes cause an undesirable ionic imbalance and rebound spikes. Moreover, they are not applicable to use in non-excitable glial cells. Here we engineered Opto-vTrap, a light-inducible and reversible inhibition system to temporarily trap the transmitter-containing vesicles from exocytotic release. Light activation of Opto-vTrap caused full vesicle clusterization and complete inhibition of exocytosis within 1 min, which recovered within 30 min after light off. We found a significant reduction in synaptic and gliotransmission upon activation of Opto-vTrap in acute brain slices. Opto-vTrap significantly inhibited hippocampus-dependent memory retrieval with full recovery within an hour. We propose Opto-vTrap as a next-generation optogenetic silencer to control brain activity and behavior with minimal confounding effects."
https://openalex.org/W3216273254,"How cells with DNA replication defects acquire mutations that allow them to escape apoptosis under environmental stress is a long-standing question. Here, we report that an error-prone Okazaki fragment maturation (OFM) pathway is activated at restrictive temperatures in rad27Δ yeast cells. Restrictive temperature stress activated Dun1, facilitating transformation of unprocessed 5′ flaps into 3′ flaps, which were removed by 3′ nucleases, including DNA polymerase δ (Polδ). However, at certain regions, 3′ flaps formed secondary structures that facilitated 3′ end extension rather than degradation, producing alternative duplications with short spacer sequences, such as pol3 internal tandem duplications. Consequently, little 5′ flap was formed, suppressing rad27Δ-induced lethality at restrictive temperatures. We define a stress-induced, error-prone OFM pathway that generates mutations that counteract replication defects and drive cellular evolution and survival."
https://openalex.org/W3217026558,"While ensuring employment opportunities is critical for global progress and stability, workers are now subject to several disruptive trends, including automation, rapid changes in technology and skill requirements, and transitions to low-carbon energy production. Yet, these trends seem almost insignificant compared to labor impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While much has been written about the pandemic's short-term impacts, this study analyzes anticipated long-term impacts on the labor force of 2029 by comparing original 2029 labor projections to special COVID-adjusted projections recently published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Results show that future demand for nearly every type of labor skill and knowledge will increase, while the nature of work shifts from physical to more cognitive activities. Of the nearly three million jobs projected to disappear by 2029 due to COVID, over 91% are among workers without a bachelor's degree. Among workers with a degree demand shifts primarily from business-related degrees to computer and STEM degrees. Results further show that the socialness of labor, which is important for both innovation and productivity, increases in many more industries than it decreases. Finally, COVID will likely accelerate the adoption of teleworking and slightly decrease the rate of workforce automation. These impacts, combined with a shift to more cognitive worker activities, will likely impact the nature of workforce health and safety with less focus on physical injuries and more on illnesses related to sedentary lifestyles. Overall, results suggest that future workers will need to engage more often in training and skill acquisition, requiring life-long learning and skill maintenance strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3214850691,"To develop a prediction model of spontaneous ureteral stone passage (SSP) using machine learning and logistic regression and compare the performance of the two models. Indications for management of ureteral stones are unclear, and the clinician determines whether to wait for SSP or perform active treatment, especially in well-controlled patients, to avoid unwanted complications. Therefore, suggesting the possibility of SSP would help make a clinical decision regarding ureteral stones.Patients diagnosed with unilateral ureteral stones at our emergency department between August 2014 and September 2018 were included and underwent non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography 4 weeks from the first stone episode. Predictors of SSP were applied to build and validate the prediction model using multilayer perceptron (MLP) with the Keras framework.Of 833 patients, SSP was observed in 606 (72.7%). SSP rates were 68.2% and 75.6% for stone sizes 5-10 mm and <5 mm, respectively. Stone opacity, location, and whether it was the first ureteral stone episode were significant predictors of SSP. Areas under the curve (AUCs) for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for MLP, and logistic regression were 0.859 and 0.847, respectively, for stones <5 mm, and 0.881 and 0.817, respectively, for 5-10 mm stones.SSP prediction models were developed in patients with well-controlled unilateral ureteral stones; the performance of the models was good, especially in identifying SSP for 5-10-mm ureteral stones without definite treatment guidelines. To further improve the performance of these models, future studies should focus on using machine learning techniques in image analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3217410269,"The human monoclonal antibody (HmAb) C10 potently cross-neutralizes Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus. Analysis of antibody fragment (Fab) C10 interactions with ZIKV and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) particles by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) shows that Fab C10 binding decreases overall ZIKV particle dynamics, whereas with DENV2, the same Fab causes increased dynamics. Testing of different Fab C10:DENV2 E protein molar ratios revealed that, at higher Fab ratios, especially at saturated concentrations, the Fab enhanced viral dynamics (detected by HDXMS), and observation under cryo-EM showed increased numbers of distorted particles. Our results suggest that Fab C10 stabilizes ZIKV but that with DENV2 particles, high Fab C10 occupancy promotes E protein dimer conformational changes leading to overall increased particle dynamics and distortion of the viral surface. This is the first instance of a broadly neutralizing antibody eliciting virus-specific increases in whole virus particle dynamics."

Structural validity was verified by exploratory factor analysis, which was used to identify dimensionality of the FABQ and TSK. Test-retest reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient(3,1) and internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha. Floor or ceiling effects were also investigated. Responsiveness was verified by effect sizes and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Exploratory factor analysis identified two and one factor in the FABQ and TSK, respectively. FABQ and TSK presented moderate to good reliability and adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.70). The floor effect was present in one factor of the FABQ. The FABQ and TSK showed small to moderate effect sizes and did not show adequate AUC.FABQ and TSK are multidimensional and unidimensional instruments, respectively. Those instruments presented moderate to good reliability and the responsiveness was considered to be suboptimal in individuals with shoulder pain."

The objective of the present study is to overview the utilization of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) by providing the direct insured cost between patients receiving surgery and patients receiving nonsurgical treatment for degenerative lumbar disease.The NHIS-National Sample Cohort was utilized to select patients with lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis or spondylolysis. A matched cohort study design was used to show direct medical costs of surgery (n = 2,698) and nonsurgical (n = 2,698) cohorts. Non-surgical treatment included medication, physiotherapy, injection, and chiropractic. The monthly costs of the surgery cohort and nonsurgical cohort were presented at initial treatment, posttreatment 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and yearly thereafter for 10 years.The characteristics and matching factors were well-balanced between the matched cohorts. Overall, surgery cohort spent $50.84/patient/month, while the nonsurgical cohort spent $29.34/patient/month (p<0.01). Initially, surgery treatment led to more charge to NHIS ($2,762) than nonsurgical treatment ($180.4) (p<0.01). Compared with the non-surgical cohort, the surgery cohort charged $33/month more for the first 3 months, charged less at 12 months, and charged approximately the same over the course of 10 years.Surgical treatment initially led to more government reimbursement than nonsurgical treatment, but the charges during follow-up period were not different. The results of the present study should be interpreted in light of the costs of medical services, indirect costs, societal cost, quality of life and societal willingness to pay in each country. The monetary figures are implied to be actual economic costs but those in the reimbursement system instead reflect reimbursement charges from the government."
https://openalex.org/W3214904240,"Forensic entomologists frequently use a developmental method to estimate a post-mortem interval (PMI). Such estimates are based usually on the blow fly larvae or puparia. Data on their development is obtained by rearing them in colonies. In the case of beetles, which can be also useful for PMI estimation, development data is frequently collected by rearing them individually. However, some carrion beetles are gregarious, for instance, Necrodes littoralis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Silphidae). We compared mortality, rate of development and body size of emerged adult beetles reared individually and in aggregations. Mortality was much higher for beetles reared individually, particularly at low temperatures. The rearing protocol affected the time of immature development and the size of adult insects. Individually reared specimens developed much longer at 16°C, whereas at 20°C and 26°C development times of individually reared beetles were slightly shorter. Significant differences in the body size were observed only at 16°C; beetles that developed in aggregations were larger at this temperature. These findings demonstrate that aggregating is particularly beneficial for larvae of N. littoralis at low temperatures, where it largely reduces mortality and facilitates growth. Moreover, these results indicate that in forensic entomology the protocol of individual rearing is unsuitable for gregarious beetles, as it produces reference developmental data of low quality."
https://openalex.org/W3216118369,"Australia has a universal healthcare system, yet organisation and delivery of primary healthcare (PHC) services varies across local areas. Understanding the nature and extent of this variation is essential to improve quality of care and health equity, but this has been hampered by a lack of suitable measures across the breadth of effective PHC systems. Using a suite of measures constructed at the area-level, this study explored their application in assessing area-level variation in PHC organisation and delivery.Routinely collected data from New South Wales, Australia were used to construct 13 small area-level measures of PHC service organisation and delivery that best approximated access (availability, affordability, accommodation) comprehensiveness and coordination. Regression analyses and pairwise Pearson's correlations were used to examine variation by area, and by remoteness and area disadvantage.PHC service delivery varied geographically at the small-area level-within cities and more remote locations. Areas in major cities were more accessible (all measures), while in remote areas, services were more comprehensive and coordinated. In disadvantaged areas of major cities, there were fewer GPs (most disadvantaged quintile 0.9[SD 0.1] vs least 1.0[SD 0.2]), services were more affordable (97.4%[1.6] bulk-billed vs 75.7[11.3]), a greater proportion were after-hours (10.3%[3.0] vs 6.2[2.9]) and for chronic disease care (28%[3.4] vs 17.6[8.0]) but fewer for preventive care (50.7%[3.8] had cervical screening vs 62.5[4.9]). Patterns were similar in regional locations, other than disadvantaged areas had less after-hours care (1.3%[0.7] vs 6.1%[3.9]). Measures were positively correlated, except GP supply and affordability in major cities (-0.41, p < .01).Application of constructed measures revealed inequity in PHC service delivery amenable to policy intervention. Initiatives should consider the maldistribution of GPs not only by remoteness but also by area disadvantage. Avenues for improvement in disadvantaged areas include preventative care across all regions and after-hours care in regional locations."
https://openalex.org/W3217036123,"Patient and public involvement work (PPI) is essential to good research practice. Existing research indicates that PPI offers benefits to research design, conduct, communication, and implementation of findings. Understanding how PPI works and its value helps to provide information about best practice and highlight areas for further development. This study used a values-based approach to reporting PPI at a Research Unit focused on musculoskeletal conditions within a UK medical school.The study was conducted between October 2019 and January 2020 using Gradinger's value system framework as a theoretical basis. The framework comprises three value systems each containing five clusters. All PPI members and researchers who had attended PPI groups were invited to participate. Participants completed a structured questionnaire based on the value system framework; PPI members also provided further information through telephone interviews. Data were deductively analysed using a framework approach with data mapped onto value systems.Twelve PPI members and 17 researchers took part. Views about PPI activity mapped onto all three value systems. PPI members felt empowered to provide their views, and that their opinions were valued by researchers. It was important to PPI members that they were able to 'give back' and to do something positive with their experiences. Researchers would have liked the groups to be more representative of the wider population, patients highlighted that groups could include more younger members. Researchers recognised the value of PPI, and the study highlighted areas where researchers members might benefit from further awareness.Three areas for development were identified: (i) facilitating researcher engagement in training about the value and importance of PPI in research; (ii) support for researchers to reflect on the role that PPI plays in transparency of healthcare research; (iii) work to further explore and address aspects of diversity and inclusion in PPI."
https://openalex.org/W3217339253,"Most existing electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction methods rely on rule-based approaches. It is difficult to manually define all ECG features. We propose an unsupervised feature learning method using a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that can extract ECG features with unlabeled data. We used 596,000 ECG samples from 1,278 patients archived in biosignal databases from intensive care units to train the CVAE. Three external datasets were used for feature validation using two approaches. First, we explored the features without an additional training process. Clustering, latent space exploration, and anomaly detection were conducted. We confirmed that CVAE features reflected the various types of ECG rhythms. Second, we applied CVAE features to new tasks as input data and CVAE weights to weight initialization for different models for transfer learning for the classification of 12 types of arrhythmias. The f1-score for arrhythmia classification with extreme gradient boosting was 0.86 using CVAE features only. The f1-score of the model in which weights were initialized with the CVAE encoder was 5% better than that obtained with random initialization. Unsupervised feature learning with CVAE can extract the characteristics of various types of ECGs and can be an alternative to the feature extraction method for ECGs."

https://openalex.org/W3214856959,"Accurate liver segmentation is key for volumetry assessment to guide treatment decisions. Moreover, it is an important pre-processing step for cancer detection algorithms. Liver segmentation can be especially challenging in patients with cancer-related tissue changes and shape deformation. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of state-of-the-art deep learning 3D liver segmentation algorithms to generalize across all different Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) liver cancer stages.This retrospective study, included patients from an institutional database that had arterial-phase T1-weighted magnetic resonance images with corresponding manual liver segmentations. The data was split into 70/15/15% for training/validation/testing each proportionally equal across BCLC stages. Two 3D convolutional neural networks were trained using identical U-net-derived architectures with equal sized training datasets: one spanning all BCLC stages (""All-Stage-Net"": AS-Net), and one limited to early and intermediate BCLC stages (""Early-Intermediate-Stage-Net"": EIS-Net). Segmentation accuracy was evaluated by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) on a dataset spanning all BCLC stages and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pairwise comparisons.219 subjects met the inclusion criteria (170 males, 49 females, 62.8±9.1 years) from all BCLC stages. Both networks were trained using 129 subjects: AS-Net training comprised 19, 74, 18, 8, and 10 BCLC 0, A, B, C, and D patients, respectively; EIS-Net training comprised 21, 86, and 22 BCLC 0, A, and B patients, respectively. DSCs (mean±SD) were 0.954±0.018 and 0.946±0.032 for AS-Net and EIS-Net (p<0.001), respectively. The AS-Net 0.956±0.014 significantly outperformed the EIS-Net 0.941±0.038 on advanced BCLC stages (p<0.001) and yielded similarly good segmentation performance on early and intermediate stages (AS-Net: 0.952±0.021; EIS-Net: 0.949±0.027; p = 0.107).To ensure robust segmentation performance across cancer stages that is independent of liver shape deformation and tumor burden, it is critical to train deep learning models on heterogeneous imaging data spanning all BCLC stages."
https://openalex.org/W3164150071,"Earlier findings suggest that men with daughters make judgments and decisions somewhat in line with those made by women. In this paper, we attempt to extend those findings, by testing how gender and parenting daughters affect judgments of the appropriateness of investing in and working for morally controversial companies (""sin stocks""). To do so, in Study 1 (N = 634) we investigate whether women judge the prospect of investing in sin stocks more harshly than men do, and test the hypothesis that men with daughters judge such investments less favorably than other men. In Study 2 (N = 782), we investigate the willingness to work in morally controversial companies at a significant wage premium. Results show that-for men-parenting daughters yields harsher evaluations of sin stocks, but no evidence that it lowers the propensity to work in such companies. This contrasts to the effect of gender: women reliably judge both investment and employment in morally controversial companies more harshly than men do. We suggest that an aversion towards morally controversial companies might be a partial determinant of the gender gap in wages."
https://openalex.org/W3215056309,"Background The effect of malignant diseases is increasing globally, particularly in developing countries as shown by recent cancer statistics from the world health organization reports. It is anticipated that with an increase in life expectancy consequent upon the improved standard of living and increasing urbanization, the burden of hematological malignancies in sub-Saharan Africa particularly in Ethiopia is likely to increase recently. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the incidence and trend of hematological malignancy in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based retrospective study was conducted from 2015 to 2019 at the University of Gondar and Bahir-Dar Felegehiwot comprehensive specialized hospitals. Hematological malignancy data were collected by using a data collection sheet that was consisted of patients’ socio-demography, clinical, and laboratory data. Then, data were entered into Epi-info 3.5.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Skewness and kurtosis were used to check data distribution. Descriptive statistics were summarized as percentages, means, and standard deviations of background variables, and the trend were analyzed. Results In this study, a total of 1,342 study participants were included. The mean age of study participants was 41.49 ± 16.3 years with a range of 1 to 92 years. About 58.3%, 52.2%, and 80% of the cases were observed among males, 18–45 age group, and urban residences, respectively. Of the total cases, 92.9% and 7.1% were lymphoma and leukemia, respectively. On the other hand, from lymphoma cases, 72.3% and 27.7% were HL and NHL, respectively while from leukemic cases, 61.1%, 23.2, 6.3%, 4.2%, and 5.3% were CLL, ALL, CML, AML, and other HM types, respectively. In this study, there was no trend. Conclusion We concluded that lymphoma was the dominant type of hematological malignancy observed in northwest Ethiopia. The study indicated that the majority of cases were observed among male, urban residents, and adult populations aged 18–45 years. Therefore, special focus should be given to the highly affected population. Further, a prospective cohort study should be conducted for a better understanding of the prevalence and associated factors to it."
https://openalex.org/W3216292275,"Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) are associated with increased risk of offspring neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting long-term adverse impacts on fetal brain development. However, the relationship between HDP and deficits in general child development is unclear. Our objective was to assess the association between HDP and motor and cognitive developmental delay in children at 36 months of age. We analyzed data from the All Our Families community-based cohort study (n = 1554). Diagnosis of HDP-gestational or chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia-was measured through medical records. Child development was measured by maternal-report on five domains of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). Standardized cut-off scores were used to operationalize binary variables for any delay, motor delay, and cognitive delay. We calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using logistic regression, sequentially controlling for potential confounders followed by factors suspected to lie on the causal pathway. Overall, 8.0% of women had HDP and hypertension-exposed children had higher prevalence of delay than unexposed children. Hypertension-exposed children had elevated risk for developmental delay, but CIs crossed the null. The aRRs quantifying the fully adjusted effect of HDP on child development were 1.19 (95% CI 0.92, 1.53) for any delay, 1.18 (95% CI 0.86, 1.61) for motor delay, and 1.24 (95% CI 0.83, 1.85) for cognitive delay. We did not find a statistically significant association between HDP and developmental delay. Confidence intervals suggest that children exposed to HDP in utero have either similar or slightly elevated risk of any, motor, and cognitive delay at 36 months after controlling for maternal and obstetric characteristics. The observed direction of association aligns with evidence of biological mechanisms whereby hypertensive pathology can disrupt fetal neurodevelopment; however, more evidence is needed. Findings may have implications for early developmental monitoring and intervention following prenatal hypertension exposure."

Participants included 722 African Americans [mean age = 73.61 years (SD = 6.33)] from the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). Several protective correlates from environmental (e.g., larger life space), sociocultural (e.g., larger social network size), behavioral (e.g., more purpose in life), and biological (e.g., higher global cognition) levels were associated with a lower odds of having higher levels of perceived stress.Perceived stress was associated with established and novel correlates from every level. Future research is needed to examine how changes in these correlates may impact perceived stress in older African Americans."
https://openalex.org/W3177188731,"To minimize the curtailment of renewable generation and incentivize grid-scale energy storage deployment, a concept of combining stationary and mobile applications of battery energy storage systems built within renewable energy farms is proposed. A simulation-based optimization model is developed to obtain the optimal design parameters such as battery capacity and power ratings by solving a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the economic profitability, the energy provided for transportation electrification, the demand peak shaving, and the renewable energy utilized. Two applications considered for the stationary energy storage systems are the end-consumer arbitrage and frequency regulation, while the mobile application envisions a scenario of a grid-independent battery-powered electric vehicle charging station network. The charging stations receive supplies from the energy storage system that absorbs renewable energy, contributing to a sustained DC demand that helps with revenues. Representative results are presented for two operation modes and different sets of weights assigned to the objectives. Substantial improvement in the profitability of combined applications over single stationary applications is shown. Pareto frontier of a reduced dimensional problem is obtained to show the trade-off between design objectives. This work could pave the road for future implementations of the new form of energy storage systems."
https://openalex.org/W3215090008,"In western music, harmonic expectations can be fulfilled or broken by unexpected chords. Musical irregularities in the absence of auditory deviance elicit well-studied neural responses (e.g. ERAN, P3, N5). These responses are sensitive to schematic expectations (induced by syntactic rules of chord succession) and veridical expectations about predictability (induced by experimental regularities). However, the cognitive and sensory contributions to these responses and their plasticity as a result of musical training remains under debate. In the present study, we explored whether the neural processing of pure acoustic violations is affected by schematic and veridical expectations. Moreover, we investigated whether these two factors interact with long-term musical training. In Experiment 1, we registered the ERPs elicited by dissonant clusters placed either at the middle or the ending position of chord cadences. In Experiment 2, we presented to the listeners with a high proportion of cadences ending in a dissonant chord. In both experiments, we compared the ERPs of musicians and non-musicians. Dissonant clusters elicited distinctive neural responses (an early negativity, the P3 and the N5). While the EN was not affected by syntactic rules, the P3a and P3b were larger for dissonant closures than for middle dissonant chords. Interestingly, these components were larger in musicians than in non-musicians, while the N5 was the opposite. Finally, the predictability of dissonant closures in our experiment did not modulate any of the ERPs. Our study suggests that, at early time windows, dissonance is processed based on acoustic deviance independently of syntactic rules. However, at longer latencies, listeners may be able to engage integration mechanisms and further processes of attentional and structural analysis dependent on musical hierarchies, which are enhanced in musicians."
https://openalex.org/W3216041897,"This paper aims to identify the organisational culture profiles of Polish municipalities and examine the influence of the professional, social and political experience and place-based leadership style of mayors on municipalities' organisational culture profiles. The Organisational Culture Assessment Instrument was selected due to its suitability in assessing the organisation's underlying culture. In the study, 917 mayors of municipalities in Poland, completing an on-line questionnaire. It was found that most of the Polish municipalities' organisational culture is characterised by a clan type which is reflected in how employees are managed, how the organisation is held together, and how the organisation's strategy is defined. The leadership style and the organisation's success are hierarchy-focused, while the dominant characteristic is market type. The ANOVA and UNIANOVA analysis results suggest that the type of organisational culture depends on the type of municipality. The clan culture is dominant in rural municipalities. In urban municipalities, market culture and adhocracy are stronger than in rural municipalities, while clan culture is weaker. There is also an association between the dominant type of organisational culture and the mayors' work experience in local administration and their membership in an NGO. The length of the mayor's seniority in local government administration differentiates the importance of hierarchy culture, while his experience in the NGO sector strengthens the clan characteristics of the organisational culture of the office he heads. These findings provide important implications for the initiation and implementation of cultural change in local government administration and cooperation projects and local experiments. A cultural change is difficult to implement, and a change of mayor is not enough to initiate it. It requires planning and management. Cultural change may contribute to the increase of municipalities' activity in cooperation's projects and experiments. There is a need for more research on this topic to determine to what extent the organisational culture supports local cooperation projects."
https://openalex.org/W3216842097,"The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare the stability of first metatarsophalangeal (MTP1) joint arthrodesis with dorsally and medially positioned plates.A physical model of the MTP1 joint consists of printed synthetic bones, a titanium locking plate and screws. In the experiments, samples with dorsally and medially positioned plates were subjected to loading of ground load character in a universal testing machine. Force-displacement relations and relative displacements of bones were recorded. The obtained results were used to validate the corresponding finite element models of the MTP1 joint. Nonlinear finite element simulations of the toe-off phase of gait were performed to determine the deformation and stress state in the MTP1 joint for two positions of the plate.In numerical simulations, the maximum displacement in the dorsal direction was noticed at the tip of the distal phalanx and was equal to 19.6 mm for the dorsal plate and 9.63 mm for the medial plate for a resultant force of 150 N. Lower relative bone displacements and smaller plastic deformation in the plate were observed in the model with the medial plate. Stress values were also smaller in the medially positioned plate and locking screws compared to fixation with the dorsal plate.A medially positioned locking plate provides better stability of the MTP1 joint than a dorsally positioned plate due to greater vertical bending stiffness of the medial plate. Smaller relative bone displacements observed in fixation with the medial plate may be beneficial for the bone healing process. Moreover, lower stress values may decrease the risk of complications associated with hardware failure."
https://openalex.org/W3216879738,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal gastrointestinal malignancies with high mortality. Recurrence develops within only a few years after curative resection and perioperative adjuvant therapy in 30-50% of these patients. Therefore, it is essential to identify postoperative recurrence biomarkers to facilitate selecting the following surveillance and therapeutic strategies. The general transcription factor IIE subunit beta (GTF2E2) is crucial for physiological and pathological functions, but its roles in the aggression and recurrence of ESCC remain ambiguous. In this study, we found that GTF2E2 was highly expressed in ESCC samples, and elevated GTF2E2 expression predicted early recurrence after surgery for ESCC patients. High expression of GTF2E2 associated with more aggressive clinic features and poor prognosis. GTF2E2 promoted the proliferation and mobility of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. We further revealed that miR-139-5p repressed GTF2E2 expression by downregulating its mRNA through binding with Argonaute 2 (Ago2). Rescue assays suggested that miR-139-5p affected GTF2E2-mediated ESCC progression. Moreover, GTF2E2 positively interacted with FUS promoter and regulated FUS expression, and the phenotype changes caused by GTF2E2 manipulation were recovered by rescuing FUS expression in ESCC cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that GTF2E2 promotes ESCC cells progression via activation of the AKT/ERK/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, GTF2E2 may serve as a novel biomarker for recurrence after surgery and a potential therapeutic target for ESCC patients, and it promotes ESCC progression via miR-139-5p/GTF2E2/FUS axis."
https://openalex.org/W3217044293,"It is known that channel engineering, including the construction of piers, will change the river hydrodynamic characteristics, which is a significant factor affecting the transport process of pollutants. With this regard, this study uses the well-validated and tested hydrodynamic module and transport module of MIKE 21 to simulate the hydrodynamics and water quality under various pier densities in the Wuhan reach. Hydrodynamic changes around the piers show spatial differences, which are similar under different discharges. The range and amplitude of hydrodynamic spatial variations increase with the increase in pier density. However, there is a critical value of 1.25 to 2.5 units/km. When the pier density is less than this critical value, this type of cumulative effect is the most significant. Additionally, greater changes can be found in chemical oxygen demand concentrations, which also show spatial and temporal variations. The area with high chemical oxygen demand concentration upstream and downstream from the engineering area exhibits the distribution characteristics of ""decrease in the downstream area and increase in the upstream area"" and ""increase in downstream the area and decrease in the upstream area"" respectively. In the reach section of the engineering area, the area with high chemical oxygen demand concentration increases in the front area near the piers and decreases near the shoreline. Furthermore, the concentration shows attenuation actions with a longer residence time owing to the buffering effect of pier groups. These results have significant implications on shoreline planning and utilization. Moreover, they provide scientific guidelines for water management."

At a time when efforts are being made globally to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, assessing maternal satisfaction is essential. There is a dearth of studies on maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care, particularly in the study area. This study aimed to assess maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care and associated factors among postpartum women at public hospitals of North Shoa Zone Ethiopia.A facility-based cross-sectional study with a systematic random sampling technique was conducted from May1-30/ 2020. Data were entered into EpiData version 4.6 and analyzed using a statistical package for the social sciences version 25. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were employed. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, level of statistical significance was declared at variables with p < 0.05 and the strength of the association was measured by an adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.Of the total 394 participants, 111 (28.2%) [95% CI: 23.9, 32.5] of postpartum women were satisfied with the intrapartum care. Place of residence [AOR: 1.934; 95% CI (1.183, 3.162)], planned status of the pregnancy [AOR: 2.245; 95% CI, (1.212, 4.158)], number of antenatal care visit [AOR: 2.389; 95% (1.437, 3.974)] and duration of labour [AOR: 2.463; 95% (1.378, 4.402)] were factors significantly associated with maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care.The proportion of maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care was low. Therefore, designing strategies to enhance maternal satisfaction by strengthening adherence to antenatal care visits, provision of family planning to prevent unplanned pregnancy, and strict utilization of partograph to prevent prolonged labour and childbirth-related complications are crucial."
