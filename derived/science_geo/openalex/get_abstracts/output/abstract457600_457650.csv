https://openalex.org/W1974415006,"The NAC proteins represent a major plant-specific transcription factor family that has established enormously diverse roles in various plant processes. Aided by the availability of complete genomes, several members of this family have been identified in Arabidopsis, rice, soybean and poplar. However, no comprehensive investigation has been presented for the recently sequenced, naturally stress tolerant crop, Setaria italica (foxtail millet) that is famed as a model crop for bioenergy research. In this study, we identified 147 putative NAC domain-encoding genes from foxtail millet by systematic sequence analysis and physically mapped them onto nine chromosomes. Genomic organization suggested that inter-chromosomal duplications may have been responsible for expansion of this gene family in foxtail millet. Phylogenetically, they were arranged into 11 distinct sub-families (I-XI), with duplicated genes fitting into one cluster and possessing conserved motif compositions. Comparative mapping with other grass species revealed some orthologous relationships and chromosomal rearrangements including duplication, inversion and deletion of genes. The evolutionary significance as duplication and divergence of NAC genes based on their amino acid substitution rates was understood. Expression profiling against various stresses and phytohormones provides novel insights into specific and/or overlapping expression patterns of SiNAC genes, which may be responsible for functional divergence among individual members in this crop. Further, we performed structure modeling and molecular simulation of a stress-responsive protein, SiNAC128, proffering an initial framework for understanding its molecular function. Taken together, this genome-wide identification and expression profiling unlocks new avenues for systematic functional analysis of novel NAC gene family candidates which may be applied for improvising stress adaption in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1972601450,"Spatially explicit ecosystem models of all types require an initial allocation of biomass, often in areas where fisheries independent abundance estimates do not exist. A generalized additive modelling (GAM) approach is used to describe the abundance of 40 species groups (i.e. functional groups) across the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) using a large fisheries independent data set (SEAMAP) and climate scale oceanographic conditions. Predictor variables included in the model are chlorophyll a, sediment type, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and depth. Despite the presence of a large number of zeros in the data, a single GAM using a negative binomial distribution was suitable to make predictions of abundance for multiple functional groups. We present an example case study using pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duroarum) and compare the results to known distributions. The model successfully predicts the known areas of high abundance in the GoM, including those areas where no data was inputted into the model fitting. Overall, the model reliably captures areas of high and low abundance for the large majority of functional groups observed in SEAMAP. The result of this method allows for the objective setting of spatial distributions for numerous functional groups across a modeling domain, even where abundance data may not exist."
https://openalex.org/W2049093658,"Incorporation of selenium into ∼25 mammalian selenoproteins occurs by translational recoding whereby in-frame UGA codons are redefined to encode the selenium containing amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec). Here we applied ribosome profiling to examine the effect of dietary selenium levels on the translational mechanisms controlling selenoprotein synthesis in mouse liver. Dietary selenium levels were shown to control gene-specific selenoprotein expression primarily at the translation level by differential regulation of UGA redefinition and Sec incorporation efficiency, although effects on translation initiation and mRNA abundance were also observed. Direct evidence is presented that increasing dietary selenium causes a vast increase in ribosome density downstream of UGA-Sec codons for a subset of selenoprotein mRNAs and that the selenium-dependent effects on Sec incorporation efficiency are mediated in part by the degree of Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec Um34 methylation. Furthermore, we find evidence for translation in the 5′-UTRs for a subset of selenoproteins and for ribosome pausing near the UGA-Sec codon in those mRNAs encoding the selenoproteins most affected by selenium availability. These data illustrate how dietary levels of the trace element selenium can alter the readout of the genetic code to affect the expression of an entire class of proteins.Background: Selenium is incorporated into selenoproteins as the amino acid, selenocysteine.Results: Dietary selenium supplementation increases ribosome density downstream of selenocysteine-encoding UGA codons.Conclusion: Dietary selenium levels differentially regulate selenoprotein expression by controlling the rate-limiting step of selenocysteine incorporation.Significance: The mechanisms by which dietary selenium can affect the readout of the genetic code and selenoprotein expression have been illuminated.

Selenium is a naturally occurring trace element that is essential for human health in small amounts but toxic at high levels. Human diseases associated with extreme selenium deficiency have been identified in geographic regions that are very low in selenium soil content, e.g. Keshan disease, a regional cardiomyopathy, which is endemic in regions of China (1Keshan, Disease Research Group Epidemiologic studies on the etiologic relationship of selenium and Keshan disease.Chin. Med. J. 1979; 92: 477-482PubMed Google Scholar). In regions of high selenium soil content, selenium toxicity can manifest as a condition called selenosis that is characterized by gastrointestinal upset, hair loss, fatigue, mood changes, and nerve damage (2Yang G.Q.

Evaluating selenium poisoning.Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2006; 36: 409-420PubMed Google Scholar). Although disease symptoms resulting from severe selenium deficiency or intoxication are rare, there is strong evidence that less-overt variations in selenium status have multifaceted health effects including the risk of cancer, diabetes, skeletal muscle, and cardiac disease as well as maintenance of proper immune function (4Hatfield D. Berry MJ Gladyshev VN Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2012Google Scholar). One well established role of selenium is its incorporation into ∼25 mammalian selenoproteins as the amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec) 2The abbreviations used are: Sec, selenocysteine; RPF, ribosome-protected fragment; UGA-Sec, UGA selenocysteine codon; SECIS, Sec insertion sequence element; NMD, nonsense-mediated decay; mcm5U, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine; mcm5Um, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine; RPFKM, reads per kilobase per million mapped reads for ribosome footprints; RPKM, reads per kilobase per million mapped reads for total RNA; CDS, coding sequence; Txnrd1, thioredoxin reductase 1; Gpx4, glutathione peroxidase 4; TE, translational efficiency; nt, nucleotides.

This is accomplished by an expansion of the normal rules of decoding to allow UGA codons to encode Sec in addition to its normal role in terminating translation. Ribosome reprogramming and the process of UGA-Sec codon redefinition is orchestrated by cis-acting Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) elements that reside in the 3′-UTR of selenoprotein mRNAs (7Berry M.J.

Berry MJ Gladyshev VN Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2012Google Scholar). In the context of selenoproteins, Sec mediates reductive/oxidation reactions on a number of substrates important for cellular redox homeostasis, thyroid hormone metabolism, protein folding, and disulfide formation or isomerization (4Hatfield D. Berry MJ Gladyshev VN Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2012Google Scholar). It is also known that selenium availability can have a profound effect on selenoprotein levels with synthesis of certain essential housekeeping selenoproteins, thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), for example, being more resistant to selenium limitation than stress-related selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) (14Hadley K.B. Sunde R.A. Selenium regulation of thioredoxin reductase activity and mRNA levels in rat liver.J. Nutr. Biochem. 2001; 12: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Hill K.E. Lyons P.R.

Evenson J.K. Thompson K.M. Sunde R.A. Glutathione peroxidase and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase are differentially regulated in rats by dietary selenium.J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1438-1446PubMed Google Scholar). The “hierarchy” of differential selenoprotein expression in response to selenium availability and the specific substrates and biochemical pathways affected likely account for the diversity of health effects associated with dietary selenium intake. Despite the identification of key components of selenocysteine synthesis and incorporation, the mechanism by which dietary selenium affects selenoprotein synthesis remains controversial. One commonly invoked mechanism involves the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway in which, under selenium limiting conditions, the UGA-Sec codon in nonessential selenoprotein messages is recognized as a premature termination codon causing RNA degradation. For example, the reduction of Gpx1 mRNA levels under selenium deficiency has been shown to be due to post-transcriptional mRNA turnover rather than reduced transcription (17Christensen M.J. Burgener K.W. Dietary selenium stabilizes glutathione peroxidase mRNA in rat liver.J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 1620-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by induction of the NMD pathway (18Moriarty P.M. Reddy C.C. Maquat L.E. Selenium deficiency reduces the abundance of mRNA for selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase 1 by a UGA-dependent mechanism likely to be nonsense codon-mediated decay of cytoplasmic mRNA.Mol.

Cis-acting elements are required for selenium regulation of glutathione peroxidase-1 mRNA levels.RNA. 1998; 4: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas Gpx4 mRNA levels are unaffected and resistant to NMD. Other explanations implicate changes in Sec insertion efficiency during translation due to differences in SECIS elements and their ability to recruit the Sec incorporation machinery (20Budiman M.E.

Biol. 2007; 27: 7848-7855Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Also, it is known that selenium levels directly correlate with the degree of Um34 methylation of Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec wherein the Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec population consists of two isoforms, the non-Um34-containing isoform, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U), and the Um34-containing isoform, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine (mcm5Um) (23Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C.J. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. McCloskey J.A. Dietary selenium affects methylation of the wobble nucleoside in the anticodon of selenocysteine tRNA[Ser]Sec.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the observation that the mcm5Um isoform is required for efficient expression of the stress-related selenoproteins but not for the housekeeping selenoproteins, it has been proposed that differential utilization of the two Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec isoforms during translation of selenoprotein mRNAs could account for selenium regulation of selenoprotein synthesis (24Moustafa M.E.

Together these studies suggest that biosynthesis of selenoproteins is a complex process that may involve multiple levels of control; however, the degree of which each process may contribute to selenium-dependent regulation is unknown. To directly examine the mechanisms of selenium-dependent regulation of selenoprotein expression in vivo, we have applied ribosome profiling, RNA-Seq, and traditional biochemical approaches to examine selenoprotein synthesis in liver. Using these approaches, we have defined the changes in mRNA abundance and translational activity that occur in response to altered dietary selenium intake and expression of a mutant Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec that prevents Um34 synthesis. Quantitative mapping of ribosome distribution at nucleotide resolution on selenoprotein mRNAs revealed that translational control of selenoprotein synthesis occurred primarily due to changes in Sec incorporation efficiency. Furthermore, translation of Gpx1, Sepx1, Sepw1, and Selh mRNAs requires the Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec mcm5Um isoform for efficient UGA-Sec decoding and involves an excess of ribosome protection upstream or at the UGA-Sec codon. Finally, we find an excess of ribosome-protected fragments upstream of the initiation codons for Selh, Sephs2, Txnrd1, and Selt. These studies provide a unique view of selenoprotein translational control and UGA redefinition efficiency in mammalian tissue and its regulation by dietary selenium intake. Three-week-old male WT and TrspA37G mice in a FVB/N background were fed diets supplemented with 0, 0.1, and 2.0 ppm selenium diets for 6 weeks before euthanasia. All animal work was approved under National Institutes of Health Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees protocol BRL-002. Livers were rapidly excised, cut into four equal parts, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For each experiment, 100 mg of frozen tissue was placed in a 2-ml tube containing a ¼-inch-diameter stainless steel ball with 1.5 ml of pre-chilled lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), 1 mm DTT, and 1% Triton X-100). Samples were homogenized by agitation at full speed for 45 s in the Mini-Beadbeater-8 (Biospec Products, Inc.). To minimize biological variation, total RNA for RNA-Seq analysis and ribosome-protected fragments were prepared from the same lysate. 300 μl of crude lysate were immediately transferred to 2 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's specification. The remaining lysate was incubated with 500 units of RNase I (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 25 °C. Monosomes were isolated by centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 2 h in a TL100 ultracentrifugation (Beckman Coulter). Ribonuclease-resistant RNA fragments were isolated from the pellet by TRIzol extraction and electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. The region of the gel containing 26–36-nucleotide-size RNA fragments was excised, and RNA was isolated by passive elution before library construction. Gel-purified ribosome footprints and hydrolyzed total RNA fragments were treated with 5 units of Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 5 min at 65 °C to deactivate the enzyme. Fragments were then treated with 20 units of polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) for 60 min at 37 °C and purified using RNeasy MinElute columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations for small RNA. RPF and total RNA libraries were built using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's specifications with rRNA subtraction using Ribo-Zero (Epicenter). Limited PCR was used to enrich for ligated fragments. Library aliquots were run on an Agilent 2100 DNA high sensitivity bioanalyzer chip to validate the library size range. RPF and total RNA libraries were subjected to 50 cycles of single-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. Adapter sequences were removed using the Hannon laboratory FastX toolkit. rRNA sequences were removed using bowtie (27Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14996) Google Scholar) alignment against mouse rRNA sequences, and all unaligned sequences were retained for further processing. RefSeq fasta sequences were obtained from the UCSC genome browser (mm9 assembly, RefSeq Genes were downloaded in November of 2012). These fasta files were reduced to a single entry for each mRNA corresponding to the longest transcript isoform. For CDS alignments, the first 15 and last 3 codons were excluded to avoid bias caused by altered footprint density at the initiation and termination codons. Sequences that aligned to only a single site within the database, allowing for two mismatches, were identified using the bowtie short sequence aligner (27Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14996) Google Scholar). Technical variability was addressed by linear regression analysis of all RefSeq mRNAs with greater than 0.01 RPFKM or RPKM values (11,918 mRNAs) for WT samples obtained from mice fed diets supplemented with 0.1 or 2.0 ppm selenium. In each comparison R2 values were >0.98, and >92% of mRNAs revealed less than a 2-fold difference in RPFKM or RPKM values (data not shown). Ribosome profiling and total RNA sequences were aligned separately to selenoprotein and Gapdh mRNAs and were determined using the bowtie alignment parameters described above against the following RefSeq entries: NM_027652.2 Seli, NM_027905 Selo, NM_007860.3 Dio1, NM_013759.2 Sepx1, NM_024439.3 Sels, NM_015762.2 Txnrd1, NM_008160.6 Gpx1, NM_008162.2 Gpx4, NM_009155.3 Sepp1, NM_053102.2 Sep15, NM_013711.3 Txnrd2, NM_019979.2 Selk, NM_001040396.2 Selt, NM_009156.2 Sepw1, NM_009266.3 Sephs2, NM_030677.2 Gpx2, NM_001178058.1 Txnrd3, NM_029100.2 Sepn1, NM_053267.2 Selm, NM_008161.3 Gpx3, NM_001033166.2 Selh, NM_172119.2 Dio3, NM_010050.2 Dio2, NM_175033.3 Selv, NM_008084.2 Gapdh. The 5′ end of ribosome profiling and RNA reads were offset to the predicted first nucleotide of the A-site using the following rule: for sequence lengths ≤34 nt (+17 nt from the 5′ end of the sequence) and for sequence lengths ≥35 nt (+18 nt from the 5′ end of the sequence). These values were determined as the optimum to position initiating ribosome P-sites at the AUG codon for all RefSeq mRNAs (see supplemental Figs. S1 and S3). Total mapped reads used to derive RPKM calculation were determined by aligning sequences to the CDSs of the RefSeq database described above. Total number of aligned reads were: WT 0 ppm selenium 23,945,053 (ribosome profiling) and 16,709,701 (RNA); WT 0.1 ppm selenium 30,296,837 (ribosome profiling) and 14,220,047 (RNA); WT 2.0 ppm selenium 17,763,406 (ribosome profiling) and 12,399,318 (RNA); TrspA37G 0 ppm selenium 28,864,210 (ribosome profiling) and 12,403,067 (RNA); TrspA37G 0.1 ppm selenium 29,816,461 (ribosome profiling) and 10,669,213 (RNA); TrspA37G 2.0 ppm 22,139,115 (ribosome profiling) and 13,073,779 (RNA). Analysis of ribosome footprinting upstream of the UGA-Sec codon excluded the first 15 codons after the initiation codon and the 5 codons preceding the UGA-Sec codon. Ribosome footprinting RPKMs downstream of the UGA-Sec were calculated from the second codon after UGA-Sec to the third codon preceding the stop codon. For reads assigned to A-site codons (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S3), only ribosome footprints of 32 to 36 nt were utilized. The reads that mapped to the first nucleotide of a codon were then summed with those mapping to the adjacent −1 and +1 nucleotide positions to determine the number of footprints with A-sites assigned to each codon. Protein extracts were prepared from WT and TrspA37G mouse liver (n = 2) by homogenizing the liver in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Igepal, and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Total protein was electrophoresed on 4–12% NuPage polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), and blotted with antibodies against Txnrd1, Gpx4, Sep15 (Epitomics), Gpx1 (Abcam), Sepw1 (Rockland), Sepx1 or Selt (26Carlson B.A. Moustafa M.E.

After incubation of the primary antibody, membranes were washed with TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline; 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl containing 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated in anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific). Membranes were washed with TBS-T, incubated in Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific), and exposed to x-ray film. Total RNA was isolated from WT and TrspA37G mouse liver (n = 3) using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and two-step quantitative real-time-PCR was performed to determine the relative expression of genes using the primer sequences as given (28Shrimali R.K.

For each sample, total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the vendor's instructions and used for quantitative real-time-PCR using DyNAmo SYBR Green (Thermo Scientific). Reactions were carried out in triplicate, and RNA levels were normalized to Gapdh. Ribosome profiling involves the isolation and deep sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments (ribosome footprints or RPFs) after digestion of unprotected mRNA with RNase1 (29Gerashchenko M.V.

https://openalex.org/W2061671463,"Attachment of ubiquitin to substrate is typically thought to occur via formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and a lysine residue in the substrate. In vitro, Ube2w is nonreactive with free lysine yet readily ubiquitinates substrate. Ube2w also contains novel residues within its active site that are important for its ability to ubiquitinate substrate. To identify the site of modification, we analyzed ubiquitinated substrates by mass spectrometry and found the N-terminal -NH2 group as the site of conjugation. To confirm N-terminal ubiquitination, we generated lysine-less and N-terminally blocked versions of one substrate, the polyglutamine disease protein ataxin-3, and showed that Ube2w can ubiquitinate a lysine-less, but not N-terminally blocked, ataxin-3. This was confirmed with a second substrate, the neurodegenerative disease protein Tau. Finally, we directly sequenced the N terminus of unmodified and ubiquitinated ataxin-3, demonstrating that Ube2w attaches ubiquitin to the N terminus of its substrates. Together these data demonstrate that Ube2w has novel enzymatic properties that direct ubiquitination of the N terminus of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1990616230,"Background Migration is an adaptive strategy that enables animals to enhance resource availability and reduce risk of predation at a broad geographic scale. Ungulate migrations generally occur along traditional routes, many of which have been disrupted by anthropogenic disturbances. Spring migration in ungulates is of particular importance for conservation planning, because it is closely coupled with timing of parturition. The degree to which oil and gas development affects migratory patterns, and whether ungulate migration is sufficiently plastic to compensate for such changes, warrants additional study to better understand this critical conservation issue. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied timing and synchrony of departure from winter range and arrival to summer range of female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in northwestern Colorado, USA, which has one of the largest natural-gas reserves currently under development in North America. We hypothesized that in addition to local weather, plant phenology, and individual life-history characteristics, patterns of spring migration would be modified by disturbances associated with natural-gas extraction. We captured 205 adult female mule deer, equipped them with GPS collars, and observed patterns of spring migration during 2008–2010. Conclusions/Significance Timing of spring migration was related to winter weather (particularly snow depth) and access to emerging vegetation, which varied among years, but was highly synchronous across study areas within years. Additionally, timing of migration was influenced by the collective effects of anthropogenic disturbance, rate of travel, distance traveled, and body condition of adult females. Rates of travel were more rapid over shorter migration distances in areas of high natural-gas development resulting in the delayed departure, but early arrival for females migrating in areas with high development compared with less-developed areas. Such shifts in behavior could have consequences for timing of arrival on birthing areas, especially where mule deer migrate over longer distances or for greater durations."

https://openalex.org/W2049782913,"Myofibroblast contraction is fundamental in the excessive tissue remodeling that is characteristic of fibrotic tissue contractures. Tissue remodeling during development of fibrosis leads to gradually increasing stiffness of the extracellular matrix. We propose that this increased stiffness positively feeds back on the contractile activities of myofibroblasts. We have previously shown that cycles of contraction directly correlate with periodic intracellular calcium oscillations in cultured myofibroblasts. We analyze cytosolic calcium dynamics using fluorescent calcium indicators to evaluate the possible impact of mechanical stress on myofibroblast contractile activity. To modulate extracellular mechanics, we seeded primary rat subcutaneous myofibroblasts on silicone substrates and into collagen gels of different elastic modulus. We modulated cell stress by cell growth on differently adhesive culture substrates, by restricting cell spreading area on micro-printed adhesive islands, and depolymerizing actin with Cytochalasin D. In general, calcium oscillation frequencies in myofibroblasts increased with increasing mechanical challenge. These results provide new insight on how changing mechanical conditions for myofibroblasts are encoded in calcium oscillations and possibly explain how reparative cells adapt their contractile behavior to the stresses occurring in normal and pathological tissue repair."

However, the molecular mechanism involved in the muscle hypotrophy is unclear. Here we show that the IGF1R/Akt pathway is affected in Mtm1-deficient murine muscles, characterized by an increase in IGF1 receptor and Akt levels in both the presymptomatic and symptomatic phases. Moreover, up-regulation of atrogenes was observed in the presymptomatic phase of the myopathy, supporting overactivation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In parallel, the autophagy machinery was affected as indicated by the increase in the number of autophagosomes and of autophagy markers, such as LC3 and P62. However, phosphorylation of FOXO3a and mTOR were abnormal at late but not at early stages of the disease, suggesting that myotubularin acts both upstream in the IGF1R/Akt pathway and downstream on the balance between the autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways in vivo. Adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of Mtm1 into Mtm1-null muscles rescued muscle mass and normalized the expression levels of IGF1 receptor, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and autophagy markers. These data support the hypothesis that the unbalanced regulation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and the autophagy machinery is a primary cause of the XLMTM pathogenesis.—Al-Qusairi, L., Prokic, I., Amoasii, L., Kretz, C., Messaddeq, N., Mandel, J.-L., Laporte, J.

https://openalex.org/W2066781057,"The bean bug Riptortus pedestris possesses a specialized symbiotic organ in a posterior region of the midgut, where numerous crypts harbor extracellular betaproteobacterial symbionts of the genus Burkholderia. Second instar nymphs orally acquire the symbiont from the environment, and the symbiont infection benefits the host by facilitating growth and by occasionally conferring insecticide resistance. Here we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses of insect genes expressed in symbiotic and non-symbiotic regions of the midgut dissected from Burkholderia-infected and uninfected R. pedestris. Expression sequence tag analysis of cDNA libraries and quantitative reverse transcription PCR identified a number of insect genes expressed in symbiosis- or aposymbiosis-associated patterns. For example, genes up-regulated in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic individuals, including many cysteine-rich secreted protein genes and many cathepsin protease genes, are likely to play a role in regulating the symbiosis. Conversely, genes up-regulated in aposymbiotic relative to symbiotic individuals, including a chicken-type lysozyme gene and a defensin-like protein gene, are possibly involved in regulation of non-symbiotic bacterial infections. Our study presents the first transcriptomic data on gut symbiotic organ of a stinkbug, which provides initial clues to understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the insect-bacterium gut symbiosis and sheds light on several intriguing commonalities between endocellular and extracellular symbiotic associations."

New Zealand was the last Polynesian island group to be settled by humans, who arrived around the end of the 13th century AD. Little is known about the nature of human adaptation and mobility during the initial phase of colonization. We report the results of the isotopic analysis (carbon, nitrogen and strontium) of the oldest prehistoric skeletons discovered in New Zealand to assess diet and migration patterns. The isotope data show that the culturally distinctive burials, Group 1, had similar diets and childhood origins, supporting the assertion that this group was distinct from Group 2/3 and may have been part of the initial colonizing population at the site. The Group 2/3 individuals displayed highly variable diets and likely lived in different regions of the country before their burial at Wairau Bar, supporting the archaeological evidence that people were highly mobile in New Zealand since the initial phase of human settlement."
https://openalex.org/W2027498973,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis has a high mortality rate with limited treatment options. High density lipoprotein (HDL) exerts innate protective effects in systemic inflammation. However, its role in ARDS has not been well studied. Peptides such as L-4F mimic the secondary structural features and functions of apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, the major protein component of HDL. We set out to measure changes in HDL in sepsis-mediated ARDS patients, and to study the potential of L-4F to prevent sepsis-mediated ARDS in a rodent model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated acute lung injury, and a combination of primary human leukocytes and human ARDS serum. We also analyzed serum from non-lung disease intubated patients (controls) and sepsis-mediated ARDS patients. Compared to controls, ARDS demonstrates increased serum endotoxin and IL-6 levels, and decreased HDL, apoA-I and activity of anti-oxidant HDL-associated paraoxanase-1. L-4F inhibits the activation of isolated human leukocytes and neutrophils by ARDS serum and LPS in vitro. Further, L-4F decreased endotoxin activity and preserved anti-oxidant properties of HDL both in vitro and in vivo. In a rat model of severe endotoxemia, L-4F significantly decreased mortality and reduces lung and liver injury, even when administered 1 hour post LPS. Our study suggests the protective role of the apoA-I mimetic peptide L-4F in ARDS and gram-negative endotoxemia and warrant further clinical evaluation. The main protective mechanisms of L-4F are due to direct inhibition of endotoxin activity and preservation of HDL anti-oxidant activity."
https://openalex.org/W2042446436,"The traditional view on dietary restriction has been challenged with regard to extending lifespan of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This is because studies have shown that changing the balance of dietary components without reduction of dietary intake can increase lifespan, suggesting that nutrient composition other than dietary restriction play a pivotal role in regulation of longevity. However, this opinion has not been reflected in yeast aging studies. Inspired by this new finding, response surface methodology was applied to evaluate the relationships between nutrients (glucose, amino acids and yeast nitrogen base) and lifespan as well as biomass production in four Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (wild-type BY4742, sch9Δ, tor1Δ, and sir2Δ mutants) using a high throughput screening assay. Our results indicate that lifespan extension by a typical dietary restriction regime was dependent on the nutrients in media and that nutrient composition was a key determinant for yeast longevity. Four different yeast strains were cultured in various media, which showed similar response surface trends in biomass production and viability at day two but greatly different trends in lifespan. The pH of aging media was dependent on glucose concentration and had no apparent correlation with lifespan under conditions where amino acids and YNB were varied widely, and simply buffering the pH of media could extend lifespan significantly. Furthermore, the results showed that strain sch9Δ was more responsive in nutrient-sensing than the other three strains, suggesting that Sch9 (serine-threonine kinase pathway) was a major nutrient-sensing factor that regulates cell growth, cell size, metabolism, stress resistance and longevity. Overall, our findings support the notion that nutrient composition might be a more effective way than simple dietary restriction to optimize lifespan and biomass production from yeast to other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2023598911,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane glycoprotein, is well known for its involvement in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease of the aging brain, but its normal function is unclear. APP is a prominent component of the adult as well as the developing brain. It is enriched in axonal growth cones (GCs) and has been implicated in cell adhesion and motility. We tested the hypothesis that APP is an extracellular matrix adhesion molecule in experiments that isolated the function of APP from that of well-established adhesion molecules. To this end we plated wild-type, APP-, or β1-integrin (Itgb1)- misexpressing mouse hippocampal neurons on matrices of either laminin, recombinant L1, or synthetic peptides binding specifically to Itgb1 s or APP. We measured GC adhesion, initial axonal outgrowth, and substrate preference on alternating matrix stripes and made the following observations: Substrates of APP-binding peptide alone sustain neurite outgrowth; APP dosage controls GC adhesion to laminin and APP-binding peptide as well as axonal outgrowth in Itgb1− independent manner; and APP directs GCs in contact guidance assays. It follows that APP is an independently operating cell adhesion molecule that affects the GC's phenotype on APP-binding matrices including laminin, and that it is likely to affect axon pathfinding in vivo."

A panel of monoclonal antibodies was raised against human DMBT1(gp340). Analysis of lung washings and colon tissue extracts by Western blotting in the unreduced state, two antibodies (Hyb213-1 and Hyb213-6) reacted with a double band of 290 kDa in lung lavage. Hyb213-6, in addition, reacted against a double band of 270 kDa in colon extract while Hyb213-1 showed no reaction. Hyb213-6 showed strong cytoplasmic staining in epithelial cells of both the small and large intestine whereas no staining was seen with Hyb213-1. The number of DMBT1(gp340) positive epithelial cells, stained with Hyb213-6, was significantly up regulated in inflammatory colon tissue sections from patients with ulcerative colitis (p<0.0001) and Crohn's disease (p = 0.006) compared to normal colon tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis of trefoil factor TFF1, 2 and 3 showed that TFF1 and 3 localized to goblet cells in both normal colon tissue and in tissue from patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. No staining for TFF2 was seen in goblet cells in normal colon tissue whereas the majority of tissue sections in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease showed sparse and scattered TFF2 positive goblet cells. DMBT1 and TFF proteins did therefore not co-localize in the same cells but localized in adjacent cells in the colon. The interaction between DMBT1(gp340) and trefoil TFFs proteins was investigated using an ELISA assay. DMBT1(gp340) bound to solid-phase bound recombinant dimeric TFF3 in a calcium dependent manner (p<0.0001) but did not bind to recombinant forms of monomeric TFF3, TFF2 or glycosylated TFF2. This implies a role for DMBT1 and TFF3 together in inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2068916860,"Subinhibitory concentrations of the neuroleptic drug thioridazine (TDZ) are well-known to enhance the killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by β-lactam antibiotics, however, the mechanism underlying the synergy between TDZ and β-lactams is not fully understood. In the present study, we have examined the effect of a subinhibitory concentration of TDZ on antimicrobial resistance, the global transcriptome, and the cell wall composition of MRSA USA300. We show that TDZ is able to sensitize the bacteria to several classes of antimicrobials targeting the late stages of peptidoglycan (PGN) synthesis. Furthermore, our microarray analysis demonstrates that TDZ modulates the expression of genes encoding membrane and surface proteins, transporters, and enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. Interestingly, resemblance between the transcriptional profile of TDZ treatment and the transcriptomic response of S. aureus to known inhibitors of cell wall synthesis suggests that TDZ disturbs PGN biosynthesis at a stage that precedes transpeptidation by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). In support of this notion, dramatic changes in the muropeptide profile of USA300 were observed following growth in the presence of TDZ, indicating that TDZ can interfere with the formation of the pentaglycine branches. Strikingly, the addition of glycine to the growth medium relieved the effect of TDZ on the muropeptide profile. Furthermore, exogenous glycine offered a modest protective effect against TDZ-induced β-lactam sensitivity. We propose that TDZ exposure leads to a shortage of intracellular amino acids, including glycine, which is required for the production of normal PGN precursors with pentaglycine branches, the correct substrate of S. aureus PBPs. Collectively, this work demonstrates that TDZ has a major impact on the cell wall biosynthesis pathway in S. aureus and provides new insights into how MRSA may be sensitized towards β-lactam antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W1980419864,"When people have different opinions in a group, they often adjust their own attitudes and behaviors to match the group opinion, known as social conformity. The affiliation account of normative conformity states that people conform to norms in order to 'fit in', whereas the accuracy account of informative conformity posits that the motive to learn from others produces herding. Here, we test another possibility that following the crowd reduces the experienced negative emotion when the group decision turns out to be a bad one. Using event related potential (ERP) combined with a novel group gambling task, we found that participants were more likely to choose the option that was predominately chosen by other players in previous trials, although there was little explicit normative pressure at the decision stage and group choices were not informative. When individuals' choices were different from others, the feedback related negativity (FRN), an ERP component sensitive to losses and errors, was enhanced, suggesting that being independent is aversive. At the outcome stage, the losses minus wins FRN effect was significantly reduced following conformity choices than following independent choices. Analyses of the P300 revealed similar patterns both in the response and outcome period. Our study suggests that social conformity serves as an emotional buffer that protects individuals from experiencing strong negative emotion when the outcomes are bad."

However, research on MMM's impacts is too sparse to inform the general public and policy makers whether MMM should be encouraged, managed, or minimized. The primary purpose of the present study was to develop an innovative computerized instrument – the Survey of the Previous Day (SPD) – to quantify MMM as well as media-nonmedia and nonmedia-nonmedia multitasking and sole-tasking. The secondary purpose was to examine whether these indices could predict a sample of well-being related, psychosocial measures. In the SPD, participants first recalled (typed) what they did during each hour of the previous day. In later parts of the SPD, participants analysed activities and their timing and duration for each hour of the previous day, while relevant recall was on display. Participants also completed the Media Use Questionnaire. The results showed non-significant relationship between tasking measures and well-being related measures. Given how little is known about the associations between MMM and well-being, the null results may offer some general reassurance to those who are apprehensive about negative impacts of MMM."

Results Of the 24,264 sampled subjects, 2309 (7.1%) had received an AD diagnosis before the index date; AD was found in 930 (11.5%) cases and 1379 (5.7%) controls (p<0.001). The conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that compared to controls, the OR for prior AD among cases was 2.10 (95% CI = 1.92∼2.29, p<0.001) after adjusting for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and sexually transmitted diseases. Our results show that CP/CPPS was consistently and significantly associated with prior AD in all age groups (18∼39, 40∼59, and >59 years). In particular, subjects aged 40∼59 years had the highest adjusted OR (of 2.53) for prior AD among cases compared to controls. Conclusions We concluded that CP/CPPS is associated with previously diagnosed AD. Urologists should be alert for the association between CP/CPPS and AD in subjects suffering from AD."

Recent findings demonstrate that also motor actions interact with number magnitude processing, showing a motor-to-semantic effect. The current study assesses whether calculation processes can be modulated by motions performed with the whole body. Participants were required to make additions or subtractions while performing (on-line condition) or after having experienced (off-line condition) an ascending or descending motion through a passive (i.e., taking the elevator) or an active (i.e., taking the stairs) mode. Results show a congruency effect between the type of calculation and the direction of the motion depending on: a) the off-line or on-line condition, b) the passive or active mode and c) the real or imagined task. Implications of the results for an embodied and grounded perspective view will be discussed."

Significance: Thiol modifications regulate the activity of proteins under peroxynitrite stress. Oxidative and nitrosative stress, caused by increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS 4The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; ACN, acetonitrile; FTMS, Fourier transform mass spectrometry; GSNO, S-nitrosylated glutathione; ICAT, isotope coded affinity tag; IEF, isoelectric focusing; NO•, nitric oxide; ONOO−, peroxynitrite; O2̇̄, superoxide anion; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid. and RNS), leads to cellular damage and is considered to be a major factor in many pathologies. The response of cells to oxidative and nitrosative stressors such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and nitric oxide has been extensively studied in the past, and much of our knowledge about the mechanisms of these responses has been discovered in model organisms such as Escherichia coli (1Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Activation of the OxyR transcription factor by reversible disulfide bond formation.Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 2Zheng M. Storz G.

Endogenous protein S-nitrosylation in E. coli: regulation by OxyR.Science. 2012; 336: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As more of these studies were conducted, it became apparent that ROS and RNS do not only have damaging effects on the cell but also play roles in cellular signaling and regulation. Thus, the concept of “redox regulation” emerged. Many of the regulatory mechanisms discovered are mediated through proteins that have redox-sensitive cysteines (4Antelmann H. Helmann J.D. Thiol-based redox switches and gene regulation.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1049-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cysteine is predestined as a sensor of redox changes in the cellular environment, because its thiol group cannot only be modified easily through oxidation but several of these modifications, including sulfenic acids, disulfides, thiolations, and nitrosylations, are reversible in vivo as well. This led to a paradigmatic model; a redox-regulated protein typically contains one or several redox-sensing cysteines, which are in the free thiol state in the reducing environment of the cytosol. When the cell encounters exogenous or endogenous oxidative and/or nitrosative stress, the redox-sensitive cysteine(s) become oxidized, which leads to a change in protein structure, frequently inactivating the protein in question but sometimes activating a function that is required under the redox stress conditions encountered by the cell. Redox-regulated proteins include metabolic enzymes, regulators, kinases, chaperones, and other key players in cellular signaling (1Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Activation of the OxyR transcription factor by reversible disulfide bond formation.Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 5Brandes N. Schmitt S. Jakob U.

Once the cell has overcome the redox stress, cellular systems such as the glutaredoxin or thioredoxin system reduce the redox-sensing cysteines and return the protein's activity back to “normal.” This regulation is typically highly specific, and proteins have been shown to be oxidized exclusively by selected nitrosative or oxidative agents (8Leichert L.I. Gehrke F. Gudiseva H.V. Blackwell T. Ilbert M. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Jakob U. Quantifying changes in the thiol redox proteome upon oxidative stress in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nitrosative stress treatment of E. coli targets distinct set of thiol-containing proteins.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Even very strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, which, given its high redox potential of +1349 mV (10Wood P.M. The potential diagram for oxygen at pH 7.Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), should be capable of oxidizing virtually every thiol in a cell, only have relatively few specific targets in the cell. This selectivity can be explained by the fact that thiol-redox reactions are governed much more by kinetic constraints than by thermodynamics. To expand our knowledge of cysteines affected by oxidative and nitrosative stressors, we looked in this study at the effects of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) on E. coli. ONOO− is a highly reactive species with antibacterial properties that can be synthesized in high concentrations (up to 1 mm min−1) by immune cells (11Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Peroxynitrite formation from macrophage-derived nitric oxide.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Immune cells release this RNS upon contact with invading microorganisms. Peroxynitrite is the product of the recombination of the reactive oxygen species superoxide anion (O2̇̄) and the reactive nitrogen species nitric oxide (NO•) and seems to be more potent than the single species by themselves (12Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Apparent hydroxyl radical production by peroxynitrite: implications for endothelial injury from nitric oxide and superoxide.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar). Some of its molecular effects are known as follows: peroxynitrite causes damage to lipids, DNA, and proteins. In other organisms, it has been shown that proteins are modified through tyrosine nitration and that thiol modifications are another source of protein damage and/or regulation by peroxynitrite (13Alvarez B. Radi R. Peroxynitrite reactivity with amino acids and proteins.Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 295-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In a recent study in E. coli, the effect of ONOO− on the transcriptome was examined (14McLean S. Bowman L.A. Sanguinetti G. Read R.C. Poole R.K. Peroxynitrite toxicity in Escherichia coli K12 elicits expression of oxidative stress responses and protein nitration and nitrosylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20724-20731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, typical oxidative stress response genes were up-regulated, although genes involved in a nitrosative stress response were largely unaffected. In our study, we particularly examined oxidative and nitrosative modifications of E. coli proteins under peroxynitrite stress conditions. Although tyrosine nitration can be detected in a major part of E. coli proteins visible on a protein gel, our detailed mass spectrometry-based analysis of modified cysteines revealed that only a small subset of E. coli proteins is modified at cysteine residues in vivo. These proteins were AsnB, FrmA, MaeB, and RidA. Interestingly, all four proteins had positive effects on the growth of E. coli under peroxynitrite stress conditions. We studied the implications of the thiol modifications in the protein RidA in more detail. RidA was recently discovered to act as enamine/imine deaminase (15Lambrecht J.A. Flynn J.M. Downs D.M. Conserved YjgF protein family deaminates reactive enamine/imine intermediates of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme reactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and has not yet been implicated in nitrosative stress. It contains a single cysteine (Cys-107) that is conserved in many species. We show that this protein is specifically affected by RNS. RidA is an enzyme that accelerates the formation of 2-ketobutyrate from threonine catalyzed by the threonine deaminase IlvA. In in vitro experiments, we could show that Cys-107 of RidA has a regulatory function, is specifically modified by nitrosative stressors, and its oxidation inhibits its catalytic activity. However, Cys-107 is not directly involved in the catalytic function of RidA, and a mutation to serine results in a fully active but “redox-dead” enzyme. E. coli strains (Table 1) were grown on LB plates for routine maintenance and in liquid MOPS minimal media (16Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. Culture medium for enterobacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 μm thiamine at 37 °C and 125 rpm in a water bath for physiological stress experiments. MOPS minimal media were buffered at pH 7.4. Cell density was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. When an OD600 of ∼0.4 was reached, the culture was split into subcultures of 20 ml, and peroxynitrite was added to the subcultures to a final concentration between 500 μm and 3 mm. Because of the instability of peroxynitrite, the concentration of the commercially available peroxynitrite stock solution in 0.3 m NaOH (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) was determined spectrophotometrically immediately before the experiment using the extinction coefficient of ϵ302 = 1670 m−1 cm−1. Volumes of ONOO− stock added to the culture did not exceed 2.5% (v/v), and the identical volume of 0.3 m NaOH was used as vehicle control in experiments.TABLE 1Overview of E. coli strains used in this studyE. coli strainGenotypeSource/donor strain for P1 transductionMG1655F− λ− ilvG− rfb-50 rph-1ATCC strain 700926, American Type Culture Collection/−BL21 (DE3)F− ompT− gal− dcm− lon− hsdSB (rB− mB−)λ (DE3 (lacI lacUV5-T7 gene 1 ind1 sam7 nin5))Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA/−CL043MG1655 asnB::KanThis work/E. coli JW0660CL044MG1655 frmA::KanThis work/E. coli JW0347CL045MG1655 maeB::KanThis work/E. coli JW2447CL046MG1655 ridA::KanThis work/E. coli JW5755CL048BL21 (DE3) ridA::KanThis work/E. coli JW5755CL053BL21 (DE3) pCL001 (ridA in pET11-a)This work/−CL054CL048 pCL002 (ridA Cys-107Ser in pET11-a)This work/− Open table in a new tab The deletion strains CL043 to CL046 and CL048 (see Table 1) were obtained by P1 transduction of gene knock-outs from the Keio Collection from the National BioResource Project (National Institute of Genomics, Japan) (17Baba T.

Immediately before and 5, 16, and 60 min after stress treatment, 1-ml aliquots were harvested by centrifugation (16,100 × g, 4 °C, 2 min) and washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 2× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The 2× PBS buffer was prepared by a 1:5 dilution of 10× PBS stock (137 mm sodium chloride, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm disodium hydrogen phosphate, and 1.8 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate). The cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 2× PBS in a volume that was adjusted to the OD600 (80 μl at an OD600 of 0.4). The samples were lysed in 1× NuPAGE SDS sample buffer and 1× NuPAGE reducing agent at 95 °C for 10 min. Additionally, the samples were sonicated in a VialTweeter sonicator (Hielscher Ultrasonics, Teltow, Germany) for 15 s at a cycle of 0.5 s at an amplitude of 100% to shear DNA. Of each sample, 15 μl were applied to an SDS-PAGE 4–12% BisTris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). As control, 10 μl of a 1 μg/μl nitrotyrosine/BSA solution (Sigma) was applied. The electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot Gel Transfer System (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the nitrotyrosine antigen was detected with monoclonal rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 in 2% milk powder in 1× TBS and a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG horse radish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2000 in 2% milk powder in 1× TBS. The quantification of the thiol redox proteome was performed according to the recently described NOxICAT method (19Lindemann C. Leichert L.I. Quantitative redox proteomics: the NOxICAT method.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 893: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the NOxICAT method selectively labels reduced cysteines in a complex sample with light ICAT reagent (20Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Quantitative analysis of complex protein mixtures using isotope-coded affinity tags.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) and reversibly oxidized cysteines with heavy ICAT under low oxygen conditions. Bacterial cultures grown in MOPS minimal medium were exposed to 1 and 3 mm peroxynitrite for 16 and 60 min in the medium. MOPS minimal medium is buffered at pH 7.4. Initial steps of the sample preparation were carried out under low light conditions, due to the known UV sensitivity of S-nitrosylated proteins. To prevent artifactual thiol oxidation, samples were harvested in argon-flushed containers, and buffers used were equilibrated in small volumes (5 ml) for at least 4 h in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Labs, Ann Arbor, MI) prior to use. For each sample, 2 ml of cell culture were harvested by centrifugation (16, 100 × g, 2 min, 4 °C) and washed twice with ice-cold anaerobic 2× PBS. The 2× PBS buffer was prepared by 1:5 dilution of 10× PBS stock (137 mm sodium chloride, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm disodium hydrogen phosphate, and 1.8 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate). The cell pellet was then resuspended in an anaerobic mixture of 80 μl of denaturing alkylation buffer (6 m urea, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and the content of one vial of cleavable light ICAT reagent (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA) dissolved in 20 μl of acetonitrile (ACN). Cells were disrupted in this alkylation mix by sonication in a pre-chilled (4 °C) VialTweeter instrument (Hielscher Ultrasonics, Teltow, Germany) with a cycle of 0.5 s at an amplitude of 90% three times for 1 min interrupted by a 1-min incubation on ice. The sample was then briefly spun down (30 s, 4 °C, 16,100 × g) and incubated at 1300 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark in a thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Proteins were precipitated by adding 400 μl of pre-chilled (−20 °C) acetone and incubated overnight at −20 °C. After centrifugation (16,100 × g, 4 °C, 60 min), the protein pellet was washed twice by rinsing with 400 μl of pre-chilled acetone (−20 °C). Subsequently, the protein pellet was dried and then dissolved in a mixture of 80 μl of denaturing alkylation buffer, 2 μl of 50 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) as a thiol-reducing agent, and the contents of one vial of cleavable heavy ICAT dissolved in 20 μl of ACN. The sample was incubated at 1300 rpm in a thermomixer for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, proteins were precipitated with 400 μl of prechilled acetone and stored for 4 h at −20 °C. After centrifugation (16,100 × g, 4 °C, 60 min), the protein pellet was washed and dried as described above. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 80 μl of denaturing buffer from the ICAT methods development kit and 20 μl of ACN. The sample was mixed with 100 μl of 0.125 μg/μl trypsin solution (Invitrogen) and incubated 12–16 h at 37 °C without shaking. The ICAT-labeled peptides were purified by cation exchange and avidin affinity with materials provided with the ICAT methods development kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluate was concentrated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge and re-dissolved in 5% triisopropylsilane in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and 300 rpm. Subsequently, the samples were concentrated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. LC-MS/MS experiments of at least four biologically independent replicates were performed. The vehicle control and 16-min time point were both repeated four times.

Briefly, NOxICAT-labeled peptides were separated by reverse phase nano-LC and detected by MS/MS with Fourier transform mass spectrometry in an LTQ Orbitrap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Identification and quantification were performed with Mascot (version 2.2.0, MatrixScience, London, UK) against the EcoProt database (21Zhou J. Rudd K.E. EcoGene 3.0.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: D613-D624Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and MSQuant version 1.4.3 (22Mortensen P. Gouw J.W. Olsen J.V. Ong S.-E. Rigbolt K.T. Bunkenborg J.

Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For LC-MS/MS analysis, the samples were re-dissolved in 40 μl of 0.1% TFA. LC of 15 μl of the peptide sample was performed using an HP Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a column oven (60 °C), a variable wavelength UV detector (214 nm), and a loading pump and micro pump system. For enrichment and desalting, the samples were first loaded onto a 300-μm × 5-mm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 micro-precolumn with 3-μm particle size (Dionex). The loading and washing steps were performed by the loading pump system, with a mixture of 95% solvent A (0.1% TFA) and 5% solvent B (0.1% TFA, 50% ACN (v/v)) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 10 min. The pre-column was then connected to a 75-μm × 25-cm Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 3 μm, 100-Å column (Dionex), where the peptide sample was loaded with 95% solvent A (0.1% formic acid (v/v)) and 5% solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 84% ACN) at a flow rate of 0.400 μl/min by the micro pump system. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5% B to 40% B over 120 min at a flow rate of 0.400 μl/min. Mass spectra were obtained on line by an LTQ Orbitrap XL and an LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Fourier transform mass spectrometry was performed in a mass/charge range of 300–2000 with a resolution of 30,000 (LTQ Orbitrap XL) or 60,000 (LTQ Orbitrap Velos). The 6 or 20 most intense peaks (LTQ Orbitrap XL or LTQ Orbitrap Velos, respectively, minimal signal intensity 1500, charge range +2 to +4) in each MS spectrum were selected for MS/MS fragmentation (collision energy 35 V) in collision-induced dissociation mode. The exclusion list size was set to 500, with an exclusion duration time of 35.00 s. For quantifying the redox state of thiol groups, the LC-MS/MS data were evaluated by MSQuant version 1.4.3 (8Leichert L.I. Gehrke F. Gudiseva H.V. Blackwell T. Ilbert M. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R.

MSQuant allows visualization and validation of peptide identification results of the mass spectrometry data and supports relative protein quantification based on ICAT. To be able to use the MSQuant software version 1.4.3 in our context, we additionally installed the following programs: Internet Explorer version 6.0 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA), Xcalibur version 2.0.7, BioWorks Browser 3.3 (both Thermo Fisher Scientific), and DTASuperCharge version 1.17 (22Mortensen P.

MSQuant, an Open Source Platform for Mass Spectrometry-Based Quantitative Proteomics.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The data analysis was divided into three steps. In the first processing step, DTASuperCharge software extracted the peak list from the raw data file and converted it into an .mgf file (mascot generic file). The chosen parameters in DTA processing were “N-2 if phosphorylation loss” for precursor mass determination with a precursor tolerance of 0.01 and a bad precursor cutoff at 15 Da. Furthermore, the box “use charge state from DTA file” was checked. Protein/peptide identification was accomplished using the Mascot search engine (version 2.2.0, Matrix Science, London, UK). Each MS/MS spectrum was searched against an E. coli-specific decoy database based on the EcoProt database (21Zhou J. Rudd K.E. EcoGene 3.0.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: D613-D624Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The following parameters were used for the Mascot search. Trypsin specificity was selected with one potentially missed cleavage; Light ICAT, Heavy ICAT, and Oxidation (M) were chosen as variable modifications. Furthermore, only MS/MS spectra from peptides with a charge from +1 to +4 were used for identification. We used a peptide tolerance of ±15 ppm and a MS/MS tolerance of ±0.4 Da. To generate an .html result file for use in MSQuant, the mascot search result was converted to “peptide summary” with the following parameters: significance threshold p < 0.05, the “max number of hits” was cut below 5% false discovery rate, and the ions score cutoff was set to 15. The boxes “show pop-ups,” “MudPit scoring,” and “require bold red” were checked. The generated peptide summary was saved as “webpage, complete” .html file with Internet Explorer 6.0. After adding the .html result file and the corresponding .RAW file to MSQuant, both files were “associated.” Before starting the MSQuant workflow, the parameters for correlation settings and options were set according to supplemental Table 1. The protein list created by MSQuant was quantified using the MSQuant quantification mode. All quantitations were manually verified, and for further quantitation, values in ratio heavy ICAT/light ICAT below 0.01 were set to 0.01. Peptides were selected as candidate peptide if a difference in the fold change of >4 in the peroxynitrite-treated sample compared with both control samples (untreated control and vehicle control) was observed in all biological replicates. The statistical significance was additionally determined using Student's t test with the TTEST function of Excel for Mac 2011 version 14.2.5 with the following parameters: tails 2 and type 3 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). The RidA gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with the primers ridA_for (5′-CATCATATGAGCAAAACTATCGC-3′) and ridA_rev (5′-GGAGGATCCTTCTTAGCGACGA-3′). The PCR product was cloned into pET11a (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, generating pCL001. The C107S mutant was created from pCL001 by QuikChange mutagenesis, using the mutagenic primers C107S_for (5′-TTCCCGGCACGTTCTTCCGTTGAAGTTGCC-3′) and C107S_rev (5′-GGCAACTTCAACGGAAGAACGTGCCGGGAA-3′), yielding the mutagenized plasmid pCL002. For overexpression, E. coli BL21 CL053 cells, carrying pCL001, and E. coli CL054 cells, carrying pCL002, were grown overnight without shaking in five flasks, each containing 1 liter of LB media with 200 mg/liter ampicillin. The next morning, the cultures were grown shaking at 125 rpm until an OD600 of 0.5 was reached. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the cell culture. E. coli cells were harvested 5 h later by centrifugation at 2000 × g and at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell pellet was washed once with 40 ml of cold low salt buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT) and resuspended in a mixture of 100 ml of ice-cold low salt buffer and 2 ml of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by passing the cell suspension three times through a TS 0.75 constant cell disruption system at 1.8 kbar and 4 °C (Constant Systems Ltd., Daventry, UK) followed by the addition of 2 ml of Protease Inhibitor Mixtu"
https://openalex.org/W1975965941,"Tortuous coronary arteries are commonly observed in clinical screenings and it may cause a reduction of the coronary pressure. However, whether this reduction leads to significant decreasing in the coronary blood supply is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the coronary tortuosity (CT) on the coronary blood supply.A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was conducted to evaluate the impact of tortuosity on the coronary blood supply. Two patient-specific left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) models and the corresponding non-tortuous models were reconstructed to perform three-dimensional CFD analysis. The lumped parameter model was coupled to the outlet of the simulated branches to represent the absent downstream vasculatures. The rest and exercise conditions were modeled by specifying proper boundary conditions.Under resting condition, the mean flow rate could be maintained by decreasing less than 8% of the downstream vascular bed's resistance for tortuous models. While during exercise (maximal dilatation condition), the maximal coronary blood supply would reduce up to 14.9% due to tortuosity. Assuming that the flow rate can be maintained by the auto-regulation effect under the maximal dilatation condition, the distal resistances for CT models still have to reduce more than 23% to maintain blood perfusion.Coronary tortuosity has minor influence on coronary blood supply at rest; while during exercise, patients with CT may lack the ability to adjust distal resistance sufficiently to compensate for the extra resistances generated by tortuosity and this may further lead to an ineffective regulation of the blood supply."
https://openalex.org/W2053553922,"Objectives Overgeneralization has been investigated across many domains of cognitive functioning in major depression, including the imagination of future events. However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon extends to representations of personal goals, which are important in structuring long-term behaviour and providing meaning in life. Furthermore, it is not clear whether depressed individuals provide less specific explanations for and against goal attainment. Method Clinically depressed individuals and controls generated personally important approach and avoidance goals, and then generated explanations why they would and would not achieve these goals. Goals and causal explanations were subsequently coded as either specific or general. Results Compared to controls, depressed individuals did not generate significantly fewer goals or causal explanations for or against goal attainment. However, compared to controls, depressed individuals generated less specific goals, less specific explanations for approach (but not avoidance) goal attainment, and less specific explanations for goal nonattainment. Significance Our results suggest that motivational deficits in depression may stem partly from a reduction in the specificity of personal goal representations and related cognitions that support goal-directed behaviour. Importantly, the findings have the potential to inform the ongoing development of psychotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of depression."

We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H, a linker region mutant, and CBL-C384R, a RING finger mutant, lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor βc subunit in response to stimulation, although expression of total GM-CSFR βc was lower.

Invest. 2001; 108: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling. The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. Establishment and characterization of a unique human cell line that proliferates dependently on GM-CSF, IL-3, or erythropoietin.J. Cell Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Upon GM-CSF stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF βc was observed, resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary, our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases. pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL, HA-CBL-Y371H, or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 4.5 μg of pSV, 1.5 μg of VSV-G, and 4.5 μg of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21, and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells, and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection. TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL, TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12,000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 °C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight, as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 μl of RPMI, 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 μm phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 °C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader. TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer. TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 °C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 μm MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 μm chloroquine (Sigma), respectively, for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h, respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 °C. The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with “cOmplete” protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR βc N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations)), anti-Shp2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008), JAK2, phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416), phospho-Ser-235/236 S6, and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies along with a 50-μl volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting. Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30–60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39Emanuel P.D. Bates L.J. Castleberry R.P. Gualtieri R.J. Zuckerman K.S. Selective hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor by juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia hematopoietic progenitors.Blood. 1991; 77: 925-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor α (GM-CSFRα) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor β common chain (GM-CSFR βc), and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23Sanada M. Suzuki T. Shih L.Y. Otsu M. Kato M. Yamazaki S.

https://openalex.org/W2105780339,"Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is a chronic, highly infectious disease that affects humans, cattle and numerous species of wildlife. In developing countries such as South Africa, the existence of extensive wildlife-human-livestock interfaces poses a significant risk of Mycobacterium bovis transmission between these groups, and has far-reaching ecological, economic and public health impacts. The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), acts as a maintenance host for Mycobacterium bovis, and maintains and transmits the disease within the buffalo and to other species. In this study we aimed to investigate genetic susceptibility of buffalo for Mycobacterium bovis infection. Samples from 868 African buffalo of the Cape buffalo subspecies were used in this study. SNPs (n = 69), with predicted functional consequences in genes related to the immune system, were genotyped in this buffalo population by competitive allele-specific SNP genotyping. Case-control association testing and statistical analyses identified three SNPs associated with BTB status in buffalo. These SNPs, SNP41, SNP137 and SNP144, are located in the SLC7A13, DMBT1 and IL1α genes, respectively. SNP137 remained significantly associated after permutation testing. The three genetic polymorphisms identified are located in promising candidate genes for further exploration into genetic susceptibility to BTB in buffalo and other bovids, such as the domestic cow. These polymorphisms/genes may also hold potential for marker-assisted breeding programmes, with the aim of breeding more BTB-resistant animals and herds within both the national parks and the private sector."
https://openalex.org/W2013629835,"The two-pore domain K(+) channel TRESK is expressed in dorsal root ganglion and trigeminal sensory neurons where it is a major contributor to background K(+) current. TRESK acts as a break to prevent excessive sensory neuron activation and decreases in its expression or function have been involved in neuronal hyperexcitability after injury/inflammation, migraine or altered sensory perception (tingling, cooling and pungent burning sensations). All these effects have implicated this channel in nociception and mechanotransduction. To determine the role of TRESK in sensory transduction, we studied its sensitivity to changes in membrane tension (stretch) in heterologous systems, F-11 cells and trigeminal neurons. Laminar shear stress increased TRESK currents by 22-30%. An increase in membrane tension induced by cell swelling (hypotonic medium) produced a reversible elevation of TRESK currents (39.9%). In contrast, cell shrinkage (hypertonic solution) produced the opposite effect. Membrane crenators or cup-formers produced equivalent effects. In trigeminal sensory neurons, TRESK channels were mechanically stimulated by negative pressure, which led to a 1.51-fold increase in channel open probability. TRESK-like currents in trigeminal neurons were additively inhibited by arachidonic acid, acidic pH and hypertonic stimulation, conditions usually found after tissue inflammation. Our results show that TRESK is modulated by changes in cell membrane tension and/or cell volume. Several key players released during inflammation or tissue injury could modulate sensory neuron activation through small changes in membrane tension."
https://openalex.org/W2025519871,"Specialization makes resource use more efficient and should therefore be a common process in animal evolution. However, this process is not as universal in nature as one might expect. Our study shows that Sphecodes (Halictidae) cuckoo bees frequently change their host over the course of their evolution. To test the evolutionary scenario of host specialization in cuckoo bees, we constructed well-supported phylogenetic trees based on partial sequences of five genes for subtribe Sphecodina (Halictini). We detected up to 17 host switches during Sphecodes evolution based on 37 ingroup species subject to mapping analysis of the hosts associated with the cuckoo bee species. We also examine the direction of evolution of host specialization in Sphecodes using the likelihood ratio test and obtain results to support the bidirectional evolutionary scenario in which specialists can arise from generalists, and vice versa. We explain the existence of generalist species in Sphecodes based on their specialization at the individual level, which is recently known in two species. Our findings suggest flexible host choice and frequent host switches in the evolution of Sphecodes cuckoo bees. This scenario leads us to propose an individual choice constancy hypothesis based on the individual specialization strategy in cuckoo bees. Choice constancy has a close relationship to flower constancy in bees and might be an extension of the latter. Our analysis also shows relationships among the genera Microsphecodes, Eupetersia, Sphecodes and Austrosphecodes, a formerly proposed Sphecodes subgenus. Austrosphecodes species form a basal lineage of the subtribe, and Microsphecodes makes it paraphyletic."
https://openalex.org/W1998429131,"The brain remains electrically and metabolically active during resting conditions. The low-frequency oscillations (LFO) of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coherent across distributed brain regions are known to exhibit features of this activity. However, these intrinsic oscillations may undergo dynamic changes in time scales of seconds to minutes during resting conditions. Here, using wavelet-transform based time-frequency analysis techniques, we investigated the dynamic nature of default-mode networks from intrinsic BOLD signals recorded from participants maintaining visual fixation during resting conditions. We focused on the default-mode network consisting of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left middle temporal cortex (LMTC) and left angular gyrus (LAG). The analysis of the spectral power and causal flow patterns revealed that the intrinsic LFO undergo significant dynamic changes over time. Dividing the frequency interval 0 to 0.25 Hz of LFO into four intervals slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz), slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz), slow-3 (0.073-0.198 Hz) and slow-2 (0.198-0.25 Hz), we further observed significant positive linear relationships of slow-4 in-out flow of network activity with slow-5 node activity, and slow-3 in-out flow of network activity with slow-4 node activity. The network activity associated with respiratory related frequency (slow-2) was found to have no relationship with the node activity in any of the frequency intervals. We found that the net causal flow towards a node in slow-3 band was correlated with the number of fibers, obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, from the other nodes connecting to that node. These findings imply that so-called resting state is not 'entirely' at rest, the higher frequency network activity flow can predict the lower frequency node activity, and the network activity flow can reflect underlying structural connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1970117370,"Acupuncture, an externally somatosensory stimulation in the Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been proposed about its modulations on the brain's default mode network (DMN). However, it is still unknown on how the internal brain resting networks are modulated and what inferences can be made about the physiological processes underlying these changes. Combining high spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG), in the current multimodal study, we sought to explore spatiotemporally whether or not band-specific DMN hub configurations would be induced by verum acupuncture, compared with sham control. Spatial independent component analysis was applied to fMRI data, followed by the discrete regional sources seeded into MEG data. Partial correlation analysis was further adopted to estimate the intrinsic functional connectivity and network hub configurations. One of the most striking findings is that the posterior cingulate cortex is not only validated as a robust DMN hub, but served as a hub only within the delta and gamma bands following the verum acupuncture, compared with its consistently being a DMN hub in sham control group. Our preliminary results may provide a new perspective to lend support for the specificity of neural mechanism underlying acupuncture."
https://openalex.org/W2105533461,"Overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) has been etiologically linked to several inflammatory, immunological, and neurodegenerative diseases. As dimerization of NOS is required for its activity, several dimerization inhibitors, including pyrimidine imidazoles, are being evaluated for therapeutic inhibition of iNOS. However, the precise mechanism of their action is still unclear. Here, we examined the mechanism of iNOS inhibition by a pyrimidine imidazole core compound and its derivative (PID), having low cellular toxicity and high affinity for iNOS, using rapid stopped-flow kinetic, gel filtration, and spectrophotometric analysis. PID bound to iNOS heme to generate an irreversible PID-iNOS monomer complex that could not be converted to active dimers by tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) and l-arginine (Arg). We utilized the iNOS oxygenase domain (iNOSoxy) and two monomeric mutants whose dimerization could be induced (K82AiNOSoxy) or not induced (D92AiNOSoxy) with H4B to elucidate the kinetics of PID binding to the iNOS monomer and dimer. We observed that the apparent PID affinity for the monomer was 11 times higher than the dimer. PID binding rate was also sensitive to H4B and Arg site occupancy. PID could also interact with nascent iNOS monomers in iNOS-synthesizing RAW cells, to prevent their post-translational dimerization, and it also caused irreversible monomerization of active iNOS dimers thereby accomplishing complete physiological inhibition of iNOS. Thus, our study establishes PID as a versatile iNOS inhibitor and therefore a potential in vivo tool for examining the causal role of iNOS in diseases associated with its overexpression as well as therapeutic control of such diseases."

Consistent with these observations, recent experimental studies demonstrated olfactory deficits in transgenic Parkinson's disease mouse models, but corresponding data are lacking for MSA models.Olfactory function and underlying neuropathological changes were investigated in a transgenic multiple system atrophy mouse model based on targeted oligodendroglial overexpression of α-synuclein as well as wild-type controls. The study was divided into (1) a pilot study investigating olfactory preference testing and (2) a long-term study characterizing changes in the olfactory bulb of aging transgenic multiple system atrophy mice.In our pilot behavioral study, we observed no significant differences in investigation time in the olfactory preference test comparing transgenic with wild-type animals. These findings were accompanied by unaffected tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell numbers in the olfactory bulb. Similarly, although a significant age-related increase in the amount of α-synuclein within the olfactory bulb was detected in the long-term study, progressive degeneration of the olfactory bulb could not be verified.Our experimental data show preserved olfaction in a transgenic multiple system atrophy mouse model despite α-synucleinopathy in the olfactory bulb.

https://openalex.org/W2034508324,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a novel neurotransmitter that has been shown to influence cardiovascular functions as well and corticotrophin hormone (CRH) secretion. Since the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) is a central relay center for autonomic and endocrine functions, we sought to investigate the effects of H2S on the neuronal population of the PVN. Whole cell current clamp recordings were acquired from the PVN neurons and sodium hydrosulfide hydrate (NaHS) was bath applied at various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, and 50 mM). NaHS (1, 10, and 50 mM) elicited a concentration-response relationship from the majority of recorded neurons, with almost exclusively depolarizing effects following administration. Cells responded and recovered from NaHS administration quickly and the effects were repeatable. Input differences from baseline and during the NaHS-induced depolarization uncovered a biphasic response, implicating both a potassium and non-selective cation conductance. The results from the neuronal population of the PVN shed light on the possible physiological role that H2S has in autonomic and endocrine function."
https://openalex.org/W1992046512,"The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is a conserved non-canonical (β-catenin-independent) branch of Wnt signaling crucial to embryogenesis, during which it regulates cell polarity and polarized cell movements. Disruption of PCP components in mice, including Vangl2 and Dact1, results in defective neural tube closure and other developmental defects. Here, we show that Sestd1 is a novel binding partner of Vangl2 and Dact1. The Sestd1-Dact1 interface is formed by circumscribed regions of Sestd1 (the carboxyl-terminal region) and Dact1 (the amino-terminal region). Remarkably, we show that loss of Sestd1 precisely phenocopies loss of Dact1 during embryogenesis in mice, leading to a spectrum of birth malformations, including neural tube defects, a shortened and/or curly tail, no genital tubercle, blind-ended colons, hydronephrotic kidneys, and no bladder. Moreover, as with Dact1, a knock-out mutation at the Sestd1 locus exhibits reciprocal genetic rescue interactions during development with a semidominant mutation at the Vangl2 locus. Consistent with this, examination of Wnt pathway activities in Sestd1 mutant mouse embryonic tissue reveals disrupted PCP pathway biochemistry similar to that characterized in Dact1 mutant embryos. The Sestd1 protein is a divergent member of the Trio family of GTPase regulatory proteins that lacks a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain. Nonetheless, in cell-based assays the Sestd1-Dact1 interaction can induce Rho GTPase activation. Together, our data indicate that Sestd1 cooperates with Dact1 in Vangl2 regulation and in the PCP pathway during mammalian embryonic development."

Methods A survey was conducted in January and February of 2012 in China. It focused on the middle-aged and elderly with age of 45 and above. A total of 2,093 people from 1,152 households were surveyed. Results For inpatient treatment, the probability of using grade III hospitals, which had the highest level of care, was positively associated with age, being married, living in urban areas, and having higher income. For outpatient treatment, the probability of using grade III hospitals was positively associated with age, being married, working in enterprises, living in urban areas, living in central and western regions, and having higher income, and negatively associated with being farmers. The total and out-of-pocket (OOP) medical expenses were analyzed separately. It was found that the expense level was associated with age, education, occupation, living in urban areas, type of hospital used, insurance being used, and per capita income. Conclusion The access to healthcare and level of medical expenditure were found as associated with demographic characteristics. In addition, differences between areas and regions were observed. Such results may be useful for identifying vulnerable population and for tuning future healthcare development policies."
https://openalex.org/W2022304175,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are a relatively rare but clinically challenging tumor type. In particular, high grade, poorly-differentiated PanNETs have the worst patient prognosis, and the underlying mechanisms of disease are poorly understood. In this study we have identified and characterized a previously undescribed class of poorly differentiated PanNETs in the RIP1-Tag2 mouse model. We found that while the majority of tumors in the RIP1-Tag2 model are well-differentiated insulinomas, a subset of tumors had lost multiple markers of beta-cell differentiation and were highly invasive, leading us to term them poorly differentiated invasive carcinomas (PDICs). In addition, we found that these tumors exhibited a high mitotic index, resembling poorly differentiated (PD)-PanNETs in human patients. Interestingly, we identified expression of Id1, an inhibitor of DNA binding gene, and a regulator of differentiation, specifically in PDIC tumor cells by histological analysis. The identification of PDICs in this mouse model provides a unique opportunity to study the pathology and molecular characteristics of PD-PanNETs."

Three polymorphisms in two genes, VKORC1 and CYP2C9, are the main coumarin dose determinants and no additional polymorphisms of any relevant pharmacogenetic importance have been identified. Objectives To identify new genetic variations in VKORC1 with relevance for oral anticoagulant therapy. Methods and Results 3949 consecutive patients taking acenocoumarol were genotyped for the VKORC1 rs9923231 and CY2C9* polymorphisms. Of these, 145 patients with a dose outside the expected range for the genetic profile determined by these polymorphisms were selected. Clinical factors explained the phenotype in 88 patients. In the remaining 57 patients, all with higher doses than expected, we sequenced the VKORC1 gene and genetic changes were identified in 14 patients. Four patients carried VKORC1 variants previously related to high coumarin doses (L128R, N = 1 and D36Y, N = 3).Three polymorphisms were also detected: rs17878544 (N = 5), rs55894764 (N = 4) and rs7200749 (N = 2) which was in linkage disequilibrium with rs17878544. Finally, 2 patients had lost the rs9923231/rs9934438 linkage. The prevalence of these variations was higher in these patients than in the whole sample. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that only D36Y and rs55894764 variants significantly affect the dose, although the improvement in the prediction model is small (from 39% to 40%). Conclusion Our strategy identified novel associations of VKORC1 variants with higher acenocoumarol doses albeit with a low effect size. Further studies are necessary to test their influence on the VKORC1 function and the cost/benefit of their inclusion in pharmacogenetic algorithms."

A central problem in the study of crime specialization is to determine, from the perspective of the criminal, which crimes should be considered similar and which crimes should be considered distinct. We study a large set of Swedish suspects to empirically investigate generalist and specialist behavior in crime. We show that there is a large group of suspects who can be described as generalists. At the same time, we observe a non-trivial pattern of specialization across age and gender of suspects. Women are less prone to commit crimes of certain types, and, for instance, are more prone to specialize in crimes related to fraud. We also find evidence of temporal specialization of suspects. Older persons are more specialized than younger ones, and some crime types are preferentially committed by suspects of different ages."
https://openalex.org/W1964047302,"The cerebellum has a conserved foliation pattern and a well-organized layered structure. The process of foliation and lamination begins around birth. β-catenin is a downstream molecule of Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in tissue organization. Lack of β-catenin at early embryonic stages leads to either prenatal or neonatal death, therefore it has been difficult to resolve its role in cerebellar foliation and lamination. Here we used GFAP-Cre to ablate β-catenin in neuronal cells of the cerebellum after embryonic day 12.5, and found an unexpected role of β-catenin in determination of the foliation pattern. In the mutant mice, the positions of fissure formation were changed, and the meninges were improperly incorporated into fissures. At later stages, some lobules were formed by Purkinje cells remaining in deep regions of the cerebellum and the laminar structure was dramatically altered. Our results suggest that β-catenin is critical for cerebellar foliation and lamination. We also found a non cell-autonomous role of β-catenin in some developmental properties of major cerebellar cell types during specific stages."

WAVE2-knockdown (WAVE2-KD) cells formed large multi-lobular acini that continued to proliferate at an abnormally late stage compared to control acini. Immunostaining of the cell-cell junctions of WAVE2-KD acini revealed weak and heterogeneous E-cadherin staining despite little change in actin filament localization to the same junctions. Analysis of cadherin expression demonstrated a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in N-cadherin protein and mRNA abundance in total cell lysates. In addition, WAVE2-KD cells exhibited an increase in the mRNA levels of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated transcription factor Twist1. KD of Twist1 expression in WAVE2-KD cells reversed the cadherin switching and completely rescued the aberrant 3D morphological phenotype. Activity of the WAVE2 complex binding partner Abl kinase was also increased in WAVE2-KD cells, as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the Abl substrate CrkL. Inhibition of Abl with STI571 rescued the multi-lobular WAVE2-KD 3D phenotype whereas overexpression of Abl kinase phenocopied the WAVE2-KD phenotype.The WAVE2 complex regulates breast epithelial morphology by a complex mechanism involving repression of Twist1 expression and Abl kinase activity.

Furthermore, acquiring the ability to metastasize in melanoma and many other tumor types is directly related to incurable disease. The B1 kinin receptor participates in a variety of cancer-related pathophysiological events, such as inflammation and angiogenesis. Therefore, we investigated whether this G protein-coupled receptor plays a role in tumor progression. We used a murine melanoma cell line that expresses the kinin B1 receptor and does not express the kinin B2 receptor to investigate the precise contribution of activation of the B1 receptor in tumor progression and correlated events using various in vitro and in vivo approaches. Activation of the kinin B1 receptor in the absence of B2 receptor inhibits cell migration in vitro and decreases tumor formation in vivo. Moreover, tumors formed from cells stimulated with B1-specific agonist showed several features of decreased aggressiveness, such as smaller size and infiltration of inflammatory cells within the tumor area, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the host anti-tumor immune response, lower number of cells undergoing mitosis, a poorer vascular network, no signs of invasion of surrounding tissues or metastasis and increased animal survival. Our findings reveal that activation of the kinin B1 receptor has a host protective role during murine melanoma tumor progression, suggesting that the B1 receptor could be a new anti-tumor GPCR and provide new opportunities for therapeutic targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1984606432,"α-Hemoglobin (αHb)-stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a molecular chaperone that assists hemoglobin assembly. AHSP induces changes in αHb heme coordination, but how these changes are facilitated by interactions at the αHb·AHSP interface is not well understood. To address this question we have used NMR, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and ligand binding measurements to probe αHb conformational changes induced by AHSP binding. NMR chemical shift analyses of free CO-αHb and CO-αHb·AHSP indicated that the seven helical elements of the native αHb structure are retained and that the heme Fe(II) remains coordinated to the proximal His-87 side chain. However, chemical shift differences revealed alterations of the F, G, and H helices and the heme pocket of CO-αHb bound to AHSP. Comparisons of iron-ligand geometry using extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy showed that AHSP binding induces a small 0.03 Å lengthening of the Fe-O2 bond, explaining previous reports that AHSP decreases αHb O2 affinity roughly 4-fold and promotes autooxidation due primarily to a 3-4-fold increase in the rate of O2 dissociation. Pro-30 mutations diminished NMR chemical shift changes in the proximal heme pocket, restored normal O2 dissociation rate and equilibrium constants, and reduced O2-αHb autooxidation rates. Thus, the contacts mediated by Pro-30 in wild-type AHSP promote αHb autooxidation by introducing strain into the proximal heme pocket. As a chaperone, AHSP facilitates rapid assembly of αHb into Hb when βHb is abundant but diverts αHb to a redox resistant holding state when βHb is limiting."
https://openalex.org/W2053719737,"Recognition strategies for tRNA aminoacylation are ancient and highly conserved, having been selected very early in the evolution of the genetic code. In most cases, the trinucleotide anticodons of tRNA are important identity determinants for aminoacylation by cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. However, a degree of ambiguity exists in the recognition of certain tRNA(Ile) isoacceptors that are initially transcribed with the methionine-specifying CAU anticodon. In most organisms, the C34 wobble position in these tRNA(Ile) precursors is rapidly modified to lysidine to prevent recognition by methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MRS) and production of a chimeric Met-tRNA(Ile) that would compromise translational fidelity. In certain bacteria, however, lysidine modification is not required for MRS rejection, indicating that this recognition strategy is not universally conserved and may be relatively recent. To explore the actual distribution of lysidine-dependent tRNA(Ile) rejection by MRS, we have investigated the ability of bacterial MRSs from different clades to differentiate cognate tRNACAU(Met) from near-cognate tRNACAU(Ile). Discrimination abilities vary greatly and appear unrelated to phylogenetic or structural features of the enzymes or sequence determinants of the tRNA. Our data indicate that tRNA(Ile) identity elements were established late and independently in different bacterial groups. We propose that the observed variation in MRS discrimination ability reflects differences in the evolution of genetic code machineries of emerging bacterial clades."
https://openalex.org/W2117818071,"Evidence-based medicine considers randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to be the strongest form of evidence for clinical decision making. To test the hypothesis that RCTs have fewer methodological flaws than non-RCTs, limitations of 17,591 RCTs and 39,029 non-RCTs were characterized. Panels of experts assembled to write meta-analyses evaluated this literature to determine which articles should be included in 316 meta-analytic reviews. Overall, 38.7% of RCTs evaluated were excluded from review for an identified flaw. Commonly identified flaws in RCTs were as follows: insufficient data provided to evaluate the study (9.6% of 17,591 RCTs); inadequate randomization (9.0%); inadequate blinding (4.9%); and duplicative publication (4.4%). Overall, 20.2% of all published medical research has an identified methodological flaw, with RCTs having as many limitations as non-RCTs."
https://openalex.org/W2060881137,"Human fibroblasts provide immunosuppressive functions that are partly mediated by the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Moreover, upon stimulation with inflammatory cytokines human fibroblasts exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial effector functions directed against various clinically relevant pathogens and these effects are also IDO-dependent. Therefore human fibroblasts are suggested to be involved in the control of immune reactions during infectious diseases. As human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) represents a pathogen frequently found in immunocompromised hosts and IDO is involved in the control of HCMV growth, we here investigated the impact of HCMV infection on IDO-mediated antimicrobial and immunoregulatory effects. We show that infection with HCMV substantially impairs IFN-γ-induced IDO-activity in human fibroblasts in a dose and time dependent fashion. Consequently, these cells are no longer able to restrict bacterial and parasitic growth and, furthermore, loose their IDO-mediated immunosuppressive capacity. Our results may have significant implications for the course of HCMV infection during solid organ transplantation: we suggest that loss of IDO-mediated antimicrobial and immunoregulatory functions during a HCMV infection might at least in part explain the enhanced risk of organ rejection and infections observed in patients with HCMV reactivation after solid organ transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2067538852,"Brooding corals often exhibit daily planulation peaks in certain phases of lunar months during their reproductive season. The mechanism controlling this diurnal phenomenon, however, remains uncertain. Seriatopora hystrix populations of Southern Taiwan exhibit a highly synchronized planulation rhythm characterized by pre-dawn peak release episodes over a period of 4-6 days per month throughout the year. In this study, controlled light-dark cycles and temperatures were used to study the mechanism of the diel planulation rhythm in the laboratory. Seriatopora hystrix did not release planulae under continuous light or continuous darkness. Thus, the lack of free-run did not support a regulatory mechanism involving an endogenous oscillator. Under some lighting conditions, planula release occurred in two peaks per day. Both peaks always occur under dark phases of various light-dark cycles in the laboratory. The first peak occurred when the dark period just started, which might be stimulated by an abrupt transition between light and darkness. The second, pre-dawn peak consistently occurred 23 hrs after application of light. We concluded that this peak of planula release of S. hystrix was cued by sunrise of the previous day. Temperature treatments at 1°C intervals from 23.5-28.5°C did not change the diel time of planula release. We suggest that the temperature compensation exhibited in the hourglass model of this species may have a common origin as that of the oscillator model of circadian clocks, due to the similar duration (23 h) and period (∼24 h) between the two. The timing mechanism of planulation discovered here represents an intermediate stage between the hourglass and the oscillator models."
https://openalex.org/W2115734088,"In primary visual cortex, spiking activity that evoked by stimulus confined in receptive field can be modulated by surround stimulus. This center-surround interaction is hypothesized to be the basis of visual feature integration and segregation. Spiking output has been extensively reported to be surround suppressive. However, less is known about the modulation properties of the local field potential (LFP), which generally reflects synaptic inputs. We simultaneously recorded spiking activity and LFP in the area 17 of anesthetized cats to examine and compare their modulation characteristics. When the stimulus went beyond the classical receptive field, LFP exhibited decreased power along the gamma band (30–100 Hz) in most of our recording sites. Further investigation revealed that suppression of the LFP gamma mean power (gLFP) depended on the angle between the center and surround orientations. The strongest suppression was induced when center and surround orientations were parallel. Moreover, the surround influence of the gLFP exhibited an asymmetric spatial organization. These results demonstrate that the gLFP has similar but not identical surround modulation properties, as compared to the spiking activity. The spatiotemporal integration of LFP implies that the oscillation and synchronization of local synaptic inputs may have important functions in surround modulation."

AIMS AND SAMPLES: To obtain empirical evidence, we compared the personality profile of a group of 100 Dutch-speaking students with dyslexia with that of a control group of 100 students without learning disabilities.The NEO-PI-R based on the Big Five in personality research was used.Our study showed no differences in the personality between both groups. This agrees with a recent meta-analysis of English findings (Swanson & Hsieh, 2009), suggesting that students with dyslexia do not perceive themselves differently than their non-dyslexic peers. Practical implications and directions for future research are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1974703468,"Many species exhibit variation in the color of their scales, feathers, or fur. Various forms of natural selection, such as mimicry, crypsis, and species recognition, as well as sexual selection, can influence the evolution of color. Eastern Indigo Snakes (Drymarchon couperi), a federally threatened species, have coloration on the sides of the head and the chin that can vary from black to red or cream. Despite significant conservations efforts for this species, little is known about its biology in the field. Past researchers have proposed that the color variation on the head and chin is associated with the sex of the individual. Alternatively, color might vary among individuals because it is controlled by genes that are under natural selection or neutral evolution. We tested these alternative hypotheses by examining whether coloration of the sublabial, submaxillary, and ventral scales of this species differed by sex or among clutches. We used color spectrometry to characterize important aspects of color in two ways: by examining overall color differences across the entire color spectrum and by comparing differences within the ultraviolet, yellow, and red colorbands. We found that Eastern Indigo Snakes do not exhibit sexual dichromatism, but their coloration does vary among clutches; therefore, the pattern of sexual selection leading to sexual dichromatism observed in many squamates does not appear to play a role in the evolution and maintenance of color variation in Eastern Indigo Snakes. We suggest that future studies should focus on determining whether color variation in these snakes is determined by maternal effects or genetic components and if color is influenced by natural selection or neutral evolutionary processes. Studying species that exhibit bright colors within lineages that are not known for such coloration will contribute greatly to our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological factors that drive these differences."
https://openalex.org/W2086661527,"Group decisions on the timing of mutually exclusive activities pose a dilemma: monopolized decision-making by a single leader compromises the optimal timing of activities by the others, while independent decision-making by all group members undermines group coherence. Theory suggests that initiation of foraging should be determined by physiological demand in social foragers, thereby resolving the dilemma of group coordination. However, empirical support is scant, perhaps because intrinsic qualities predisposing individuals to leadership (social status, experience or personality), or their interactions with satiation level, have seldom been simultaneously considered. Here, we examine which females initiated foraging in eider (Somateria mollissima) brood-rearing coalitions, characterized by female dominance hierarchies and potentially large individual differences in energy requirements due to strenuous breeding effort. Several physiological and social factors, except for female breeding experience and boldness towards predators, explained foraging initiation. Initiators spent a larger proportion of time submerged during foraging bouts, had poorer body condition and smaller structural size, but they were also aggressive and occupied central positions. Initiation probability also declined with female group size as expected given random assignment of initiators. However, the relative importance of physiological predictors of leadership propensity (active foraging time, body condition, structural size) exceeded those of social predictors (aggressiveness, spatial position) by an order of magnitude. These results confirm recent theoretical work suggesting that ‘leading according to need’ is an evolutionary viable strategy regardless of group heterogeneity or underlying dominance structure."
