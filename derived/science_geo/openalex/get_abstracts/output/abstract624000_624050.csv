https://openalex.org/W2905214127,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited degenerative disease causing severe retinal dystrophy and visual impairment mainly with onset in infancy or adolescence. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become an efficient tool to encounter the enormous genetic heterogeneity of diverse retinal dystrophies, including RP. To identify disease-causing mutations in unselected, consecutive RP patients, we conducted Sanger sequencing of genes commonly involved in the suspected genetic RP subtype, followed by targeted large-panel NGS if no mutation was identified, or NGS as primary analysis. A high (70%) detection rate of disease-causing mutations was achieved in a large cohort of 116 unrelated patients. About half (48%) of the solved RP cases were explained by mutations in four genes: RPGR, EYS, PRPF31 and USH2A. Overall, 110 different mutations distributed across 30 different genes were detected, and 46 of these mutations were novel. A molecular diagnosis was achieved in the majority (82-100%) of patients if the family history was suggestive for a particular mode of inheritance, but only in 60% in cases of sporadic RP. The diagnostic potential of extensive molecular analysis in a routine setting is also illustrated by the identification of unexpected genotype-phenotype correlations for RP patients with mutations in CRX, CEP290, RPGRIP1, MFSD8. Furthermore, we identified numerous mutations in autosomal dominant (PRPF31, PRPH2, CRX) and X-linked (RPGR) RP genes in patients with sporadic RP. Variants in RP2 and RPGR were also found in female RP patients with apparently sporadic or dominant disease. In summary, this study demonstrates that massively parallel sequencing of all known retinal dystrophy genes is a valuable diagnostic approach for RP patients."
https://openalex.org/W2905228268,"The 'DREAMS Partnership' promotes a multi-sectoral approach to reduce adolescent girls and young women's (AGYW) vulnerability through a core package of interventions targeting multiple sources of HIV risk-to promote Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) lives. Implementation of such multi-sectoral programmes is complex and requires adaptation to national and local contexts. We describe the early implementation of DREAMS in diverse settings, to identify lessons for the scale-up and replication of combination programmes for young people.As part of evaluations underway in six DREAMS sites in three countries (Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe), we draw on process evaluation data collected from focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews with beneficiaries, parents/caregivers, programme managers and opinion leaders. Additionally, structured observations were conducted and Gantt charts completed upon consultation with implementers. We concurrently reviewed documentation available on DREAMS and held cross-site discussions to interpret findings.All sites sought to implement all components of the DREAMS core package, but how and when they were implemented varied by context. Models of delivery differed, with either multiple or single partners responsible for some or all interventions. Key challenges included the urgent and ambitious expectations of DREAMS; 'layering' multiple interventions across different sectors (health, education, social welfare); supporting individuals' journeys between services to improve uptake and retention; engaging communities beyond direct beneficiaries; avoiding perceived/actual exclusivity; and ensuring continuity of commitment and funding for DREAMS. Despite significant challenges, DREAMS was well-received in the communities and perceived by both beneficiaries and implementers to empower AGYW to remain HIV negative. Structures, protocols and tools were introduced to strengthen referrals and deliver services targeted to the age and circumstances of young people.The benefits of combinations or integrated 'packages' of interventions are increasingly recognised. Early implementation of DREAMS provides useful lessons for improving coordination across multiple partners using a phased, systematic approach, regular adaptions to each unique context, and ensuring community ownership."
https://openalex.org/W2903982349,"Background A stepped wedge cluster randomised trial (SWCRT) is a multicentred study which allows an intervention to be rolled out at sites in a random order. Once the intervention is initiated at a site, all participants within that site remain exposed to the intervention for the remainder of the study. The time since the start of the study (“calendar time”) may affect outcome measures through underlying time trends or periodicity. The time since the intervention was introduced to a site (“exposure time”) may also affect outcomes cumulatively for successful interventions, possibly in addition to a step change when the intervention began. Methods Motivated by a SWCRT of self-monitoring for bipolar disorder, we conducted a simulation study to compare model formulations to analyse data from a SWCRT under 36 different scenarios in which time was related to the outcome (improvement in mood score). The aim was to find a model specification that would produce reliable estimates of intervention effects under different scenarios. Nine different formulations of a linear mixed effects model were fitted to these datasets. These models varied in the specification of calendar and exposure times. Results Modelling the effects of the intervention was best accomplished by including terms for both calendar time and exposure time. Treating time as categorical (a separate parameter for each measurement time-step) achieved the best coverage probabilities and low bias, but at a cost of wider confidence intervals compared to simpler models for those scenarios which were sufficiently modelled by fewer parameters. Treating time as continuous and including a quadratic time term performed similarly well, with slightly larger variations in coverage probability, but narrower confidence intervals and in some cases lower bias. The impact of misspecifying the covariance structure was comparatively small. Conclusions We recommend that unless there is a priori information to indicate the form of the relationship between time and outcomes, data from SWCRTs should be analysed with a linear mixed effects model that includes separate categorical terms for calendar time and exposure time. Prespecified sensitivity analyses should consider the different formulations of these time effects in the model, to assess their impact on estimates of intervention effects."
https://openalex.org/W2904500988,"Biodiversity has to be accurately evaluated to assess more precisely possible dam effects on fish populations, in particular on the most biodiverse rivers such as the Mekong River. To improve tools for fish biodiversity assessment, a methodological survey was performed in the surroundings of a recent hydropower dam in the Mekong basin, the Nam Theun 2 project. Results of two different approaches, experimental surface gillnets capture and environmental DNA metabarcoding assays based on 12S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome b, were compared during 3 years (2014–2016). Pitfalls and benefits were identified for each method but the combined use of both approaches indisputably allows describing more accurately fish diversity around the reservoir. Importantly, striking convergent results were observed for biodiversity reports. 75% of the fish species caught by gillnets (62/82) were shown by the metabarcoding study performed on DNA extracted from water samples. eDNA approach also revealed to be sensitive by detecting 30 supplementary species known as present before the dam construction but never caught by gillnets during 3 years. Furthermore, potential of the marker-genes study might be underestimated since it was not possible to assign some sequences at lower taxonomic levels. Although 121 sequences were generated for this study, a third of species in the area, that exhibits high endemism, are still unknown in DNA databases. Efforts to complete local reference libraries must continue to improve the taxonomic assignment quality when using the non-invasive and promising eDNA approach. These results are of broader interest because of increasing number of hydropower projects in the Mekong Basin. They reveal the crucial importance to sample tissues/DNA of species before dam projects, i.e. before the species could become endangered and difficult to catch, to obtain more precise biomonitoring in the future as we believe eDNA metabarcoding will rapidly be integrated as a standard tool in such studies."

The interviews were part of a mixed method study comprising qualitative interviews and online survey. A Framework Method of analysis to analyse the qualitative data.Three themes and sub-themes were abstracted from the data about participants' experiences and, at times, opposing viewpoints about caring for patients with non-medical emergency-related mental health and/or AOD problems: caring for these patients is a routine part of paramedics' work, contrasting perspectives about scope of practice in caring for this group of patients, competing perspectives about extending scope of practice to incorporate education with this cohort of patients.Paramedics need more undergraduate and in-service education about the care of patients with mental health and/or AOD problems, and to address concerns about extending their scope of practice to include education with these patients. Thought should be given to introducing alternative models of paramedic practice, such as community paramedicine, with a focus on supporting people in the community with mental health and/or AOD problems. There is a need for a change in workplace and organisational culture about scope of practice in caring for patients with these problems. Extending paramedics' role could, potentially, benefit people with these problems by improving the quality of care, reducing the need for transportation to emergency departments, and decreasing clinicians' workloads in these departments."
https://openalex.org/W2962956099,"Bitcoin is a digital currency and electronic payment system operating over a peer-to-peer network on the Internet. One of its most important properties is the high level of anonymity it provides for its users. The users are identified by their Bitcoin addresses, which are random strings in the public records of transactions, the blockchain. When a user initiates a Bitcoin-transaction, his Bitcoin client program relays messages to other clients through the Bitcoin network. Monitoring the propagation of these messages and analyzing them carefully reveal hidden relations. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model using a probabilistic approach to link Bitcoin addresses and transactions to the originator IP address. To utilize our model, we carried out experiments by installing more than a hundred modified Bitcoin clients distributed in the network to observe as many messages as possible. During a two month observation period we were able to identify several thousand Bitcoin clients and bind their transactions to geographical locations."
https://openalex.org/W2904672199,"Machine learning approaches to predict essential genes have gained a lot of traction in recent years. These approaches predominantly make use of sequence and network-based features to predict essential genes. However, the scope of network-based features used by the existing approaches is very narrow. Further, many of these studies focus on predicting essential genes within the same organism, which cannot be readily used to predict essential genes across organisms. Therefore, there is clearly a need for a method that is able to predict essential genes across organisms, by leveraging network-based features. In this study, we extract several sets of network-based features from protein-protein association networks available from the STRING database. Our network features include some common measures of centrality, and also some novel recursive measures recently proposed in social network literature. We extract hundreds of network-based features from networks of 27 diverse organisms to predict the essentiality of 87000+ genes. Our results show that network-based features are statistically significantly better at classifying essential genes across diverse bacterial species, compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, which use mostly sequence and a few 'conventional' network-based features. Our diverse set of network properties gave an AUROC of 0.847 and a precision of 0.320 across 27 organisms. When we augmented the complete set of network features with sequence-derived features, we achieved an improved AUROC of 0.857 and a precision of 0.335. We also constructed a reduced set of 100 sequence and network features, which gave a comparable performance. Further, we show that our features are useful for predicting essential genes in new organisms by using leave-one-species-out validation. Our network features capture the local, global and neighbourhood properties of the network and are hence effective for prediction of essential genes across diverse organisms, even in the absence of other complex biological knowledge. Our approach can be readily exploited to predict essentiality for organisms in interactome databases such as the STRING, where both network and sequence are readily available.

https://openalex.org/W2903649785,"Introduction Antibiotic-loaded poly(methyl methacrylate) bone cements (ALBCs) are widely used in total joint replacement (TJR), for local delivery of antibiotics to provide prophylaxis against prosthetic joint infections (PJI). One of the shortcomings of the current generation of ALBCs is that the antibiotic release profile is characterized by a burst over the first few hours followed by a sharp decrease in rate for the following several days (often below minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)), and, finally, exhaustion (after, typically, ~ 20 d). This profile means that the ALBCs provide only short-term antimicrobial action against bacterial strains involved PJI. Rationale The purpose of the present study was to develop an improved antibiotic delivery system for an ALBC. This system involved using a layer-by-layer technique to load the antibiotic (gentamicin sulphate) (GEN) on silica nanoparticles, which are then blended with the powder of the cement. Then, the powder was mixed with the liquid of the cement (NP-GEN cement). For controls, two GEN-loaded brands were used (Cemex Genta and Palacos R+G). Gentamicin release and a host of other relevant properties were determined for all the cements studied. Results Compared to control cement specimens, improved GEN release, longer antimicrobial activity (against clinically-relevant bacterial strains), and comparable setting time, cytocompatibility, compressive strength (both prior to and after aging in PBS at 37 oC for 30 d), 4-point bend strength and modulus, fracture toughness, and PBS uptake. Conclusions NP-GEN cement may have a role in preventing or treating PJI."

https://openalex.org/W2903814366,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are nowadays one of the most promising tumor biomarkers. It is well correlated with overall survival and progression-free survival in breast cancer, as well as in many other types of human cancer. In addition, enumeration and analysis of CTCs could be important for monitoring the response to different therapeutic agents, thus guiding the treatment of cancer patients and offering the promise of a more personalized approach. In this article, we present a new method that could be used for the automatic detection of CTC in blood, based on the microscopic appearance of unstained cells. The proposed method is based on the evaluation of image characteristics and boosting techniques. A dataset of 263 dark field microscopy images was constructed and used for our tests, containing blood spiked with three different types of tumor cells. An overall sensitivity of 92.87% and a specificity of 99.98% were obtained for the detection of CTC, performances which proved to be comparable to those obtained by human experts."
https://openalex.org/W2904358395,"Background Primary care practitioners (PCP) play key roles in cervical cancer prevention. Human papillomavirus (HPV) knowledge is an important influence on PCPs’ cervical cancer prevention-related behaviours. We investigated HPV knowledge, and associated factors, among general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses. Methods A survey, including factual questions about HPV infection and vaccination, was mailed to GPs and practice nurses in Ireland. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine which PCPs had low knowledge (questions correctly answered: infection ≤5/11; vaccination: ≤4/10). Questions least often answered correctly were identified. Results 697 PCPs participated. For HPV infection, GPs and practice nurses answered a median of nine and seven questions correctly, respectively (p<0.001). Significantly associated with low HPV infection knowledge were: being a practice nurse/male GP; working fewer hours/week; not having public patients; and having never taken a cervical smear. For HPV vaccination, both GPs and practice nurses answered a median of six questions correctly (p = 0.248). Significantly associated with low HPV vaccination knowledge were: being a practice nurse/male GP; working more years in general practice, fewer hours/week, in a smaller practice or in a practice not specialising in women’s health; and having never taken a smear. Six HPV infection questions, and seven HPV vaccination questions, were not answered correctly by >⅓ of PCPs. Conclusions There are important limitations in HPV infection and vaccination knowledge among PCPs. By identifying factors associated with poor knowledge, and areas of particular uncertainty, these results can inform development of professional education initiatives thereby ensuring women have access to uniformly high-quality HPV-related information and advice."
https://openalex.org/W2904437896,"Objectives Lumbar puncture (LP) is an important technique for assessing and treating neurological symptoms. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of diagnostic lumbar punctures performed on hospitalized patients in the United States. Methods We analyzed data from the 2010 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the National Emergency Department Survey (NEDS). We included patients treated in the Emergency Department (ED) as well as those admitted to an inpatient bed through the ED. We identified patients undergoing LPs from ICD-9 procedural code 03.31 and CPT code 62270. We generated nationally weighted estimates of the total number of LPs. We also assessed patient and hospital characteristics of cases undergoing LP. Results Of an estimated 135 million hospitalizations (ED + admission, or ED only), there were an estimated 362,718 LPs (331,248–394,188), including 273,612 (251,850–295,375) among adults and 89,106 (71,870–106,342) among children (<18 years old). Of the 362,718 LPs, 136,764 (122,117–151,410) were performed in the ED without admission. The most common conditions associated with LP among children were fever of unknown origin, meningitis, seizures and other perinatal conditions. The most common conditions associated with LP among adults were headache and meningitis. Conclusions Lumbar Puncture remains an important procedure for diagnostic and therapeutic uses in United States Hospitals."

https://openalex.org/W2905273147,"Background Non-attendance of treatment groups in the community has been a long-standing problem in mental health care. It has been found to have financial ramifications for services, worsen outcomes for those that do not attend and negatively impact on therapeutic group processes. There is a need to gain a better understanding of patients’ reasons for attending or not attending. This study aimed to explore patient views on facilitators and barriers to the attendance of treatment groups in the community. Methods The study used interview data collected as part of three studies that investigated treatment groups for psychiatric patients in the community. Sixty-seven interview transcripts were analysed using the framework method. Results Five themes relating to facilitators of group attendance were identified: opportunity for autonomy; self-acknowledging need and therapist encouragement; optimal group format and safe environment; interest in content and enjoyment; actual and expected benefits of attendance. Four themes related to barriers: not being sufficiently informed; concerns about social interactions and the unknown; limited accessibility; and negative group dynamics. Conclusion To facilitate attendance and reduce attrition to treatment groups in the community clinicians should address patient’s wishes for information, capture their interest in the group modality, and potentially offer a ‘trial’ session. Furthermore, they should make the group location and time as accessible as possible and create a moderately sized group of six to eight patients. In these groups, mutual respect, feelings of safety and encouragement appear essential to make patients feel they can benefit from attendance."
https://openalex.org/W2905358219,"Plants are rarely randomly distributed across communities, and patchiness is a common spatial pattern in most tropical forests. Clusters of high density of plant individuals are related to internal and external forces, as well as to historical events. The detection of aggregated patterns of plant individuals allows for a better understanding of the internal and external factors that guide the distribution of species. The aim of this research was to detect and characterize clusters of high abundance of plants and species richness in semi-deciduous forests in the Dominican Republic. For this, we collected vegetation data from 575 quadrats in 23 transects (2300 m2 in total) within the Ocoa river basin. Using local Moran’s I statistics, we isolated 18 quadrats of high density of individuals. We show that density of individuals can be 2.5 times larger on average than in non-aggregated quadrats, and can reach higher values for shrubs species as well as for palms and vines species. In addition, we found that shrub species are the most abundant group in aggregated quadrats, and density of tree species is significantly smaller than that of shrub species. High density quadrats are predominantly occupied by shrubs, palms and vines, following patterns of species composition and lithology. Detecting clusters of high density of individuals could help in the efficient assessment of richness in semi-deciduous tropical forests, and may support new conservation practices for this valuable but threatened ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2903897650,"The incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing rapidly in the UK. Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC generally show superior clinical responses relative to HPV-negative patients. We hypothesised that these superior responses could be associated with defective repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). The study aimed to determine whether defective DNA repair could be associated with sensitivity to inhibition of DNA repair using the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Sensitivity to Olaparib, and induction and repair of DNA damage, were assessed in a panel of 8 OPSCC cell-lines, including 2 novel HPV-positive lines. Effects on cell cycle distribution and levels of PARP1 and p53 were quantified. RNA-sequencing was used to assess differences in activity of DNA repair pathways. Two HPV-positive OPSCC lines were sensitive to Olaparib at potentially therapeutic doses (0.1-0.5 μM). Two HPV-negative lines were sensitive at an intermediate dose. Four other lines, derived from HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumours, were resistant to PARP inhibition. Only one cell-line, UPCISCC90, showed results consistent with the original hypothesis i.e. that in HPV-positive cells, treatment with Olaparib would cause accumulation of DSB, resulting in cell cycle arrest. There was no evidence that HPV-positive tumours exhibit defective repair of DSB. However, the data suggest that a subset of OPSCC may be susceptible to PARP-inhibitor based therapy."

Method 9 matched pairs (age: 7y5m, SD 4y1m; 13 boys; gross-motor-functional-classification-scale: median 4; manual-ability-classification-system: median 4) were randomized to receive either auditory stimulation embedded in music (study, n = 9) or music alone (sham, control, n = 9) for at least 10 minutes 4 times a week for 4 weeks. Goal-Attainment-Scale, Care-and-Comfort-Hypertonicity-Questionnaire, Gross-Motor-Function–Measure and Quality-of-Upper-Extremity-Skills-Test (QUEST) were assessed before and 5 months following intervention. Result Children receiving auditory stimulation attained more goals than children who listened to music alone (p = 0.002). Parents reported improved care and comfort in children in the study group compared to a slight deterioration in controls (p = 0.002). Upper extremity skills improved in the study group compared to controls (p = 0.006). Similar gross motor function changes were documented in both groups (p = 0.41).

https://openalex.org/W2904737972,"It has been demonstrated that nurturing and affiliative touch is essential for human emotional and physical well-being throughout our entire life. Within the last 30 years a system of low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers innervating the hairy skin was discovered and described; this system is hypothesized to represent the neurobiological substrate for the affective and rewarding properties of touch. This discovery opens new perspectives for multidisciplinary research of the role of affiliative social touch in health and disease, and calls for establishing novel psychometric tools assessing individual differences in the domain of affective touch. The main objective of the study was to construct and validate a Russian version of the Touch Experiences and Attitudes Questionnaire (TEAQ), a self-report measure recently developed to quantify individual experience and attitude to social and affective touch. A pool of 117 items was translated into Russian and all the items were assessed for appropriateness for Russian culture (232 participants). After exploring the factor structure (468 participants), we composed a 37-item questionnaire (TEAQ-37 Rus) characterized by good reliability and a clear 5-factor structure, covering the aspects of attitude to intimate touch, attitude to friendly touch, attitude to self-care, current intimate touch experiences, and childhood touch experiences. Confirmatory factor analysis (551 participants) has demonstrated good consistency and reliability of the 5-factor structure of the TEAQ-37 Rus. Cross-validation research demonstrated moderate positive correlations between predisposition to social touch and emotional intelligence; positive correlations with extraversion and openness facets of the Big Five personality model were also found. As predicted, participants with higher TEAQ-37 Rus scores rated all observed kinds of touch as more pleasant, with a particular preference for slow touch. We anticipate that this questionnaire will be a valuable tool for researchers of social touch, touch perception abnormalities, and the importance of touch experiences for emotional and mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2905462525,"To target food security interventions for smallholder households, decision makers need large-scale information, such as maps on poverty, food security and key livelihood activities. Such information is often based on expert knowledge or aggregated data, despite the fact that food security and poverty are driven largely by processes at the household level. At present, it is unclear if and how household level information can contribute to the spatial prediction of such welfare indicators or to what extent local variability is ignored by current mapping efforts. A combination of geo-referenced household level information with spatially continuous information is an underused approach to quantify local and large-scale variation, while it can provide a direct estimate of the variability of welfare indicators at the most relevant scale. We applied a stepwise regression kriging procedure to translate point information to spatially explicit patterns and create country-wide predictions with associated uncertainty estimates for indicators on food availability and related livelihood activities using household survey data from Uganda. With few exceptions, predictions of the indicators were weak, highlighting the difficulty in capturing variability at larger scale. Household explanatory variables identified little additional variation compared to environmental explanatory variables alone. Spatial predictability was strongest for indicators whose distribution was determined by environmental gradients. In contrast, indicators of crops that were more ubiquitously present across agroecological zones showed large local variation, which often overruled large-scale patterns. Our procedure adds to existing approaches that often only show large-scale patterns by revealing that local variation in welfare is large. Interventions that aim to target the poor must recognise that diversity in livelihood activities for income generation within any given area often overrides the variability of livelihood activities between distant regions in the country."
https://openalex.org/W2949127651,"The alsodid ground frogs of the Eupsophus genus are divided into two groups, the roseus (2n = 30) and vertebralis (2n = 28), which are distributed throughout the temperate Nothofagus forests of South America. Currently, the roseus group is composed by four species, while the vertebralis group consists of two. Phylogenetic relationships and species delimitation within each group are controversial. In fact, previous analyses considered that the roseus group was composed of between four to nine species. In this work, we evaluated phylogenetic relationships, diversification times, and species delimitation within the roseus group using a multi-locus dataset. For this purpose, mitochondrial (D-loop, Cyt b, and COI) and nuclear (POMC and CRYBA1) partial sequences from 164 individuals were amplified, representing all species. Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. Species tree was estimated using BEAST and singular value decomposition scores for species quartets (SVDquartets). Species limits were evaluated with six coalescent approaches. Diversification times were estimated using mitochondrial and nuclear rates with LogNormal relaxed clock in BEAST. Nine well-supported monophyletic lineages were recovered in Bayesian, ML, and SVDquartets, including eight named species and a lineage composed by specimens from the Villarrica population (Bootstrap:>70, PP:> 0.99). Single-locus species delimitation analyses overestimated the species number in E. migueli, E. calcaratus, and E. roseus lineages, while multi-locus analyses recovered as species the nine lineages observed in phylogenetic analyses (Ctax = 0.69). It is hypothesized that Eupsophus diversification occurred during Mid-Pleistocene (0.42–0.14 Mya), with most species having originated after the Last Southern Patagonian Glaciation (0.18 Mya). Our results revitalize the hypothesis that the E. roseus group is composed of eight species and support the Villarrica lineage as a new putative species."

https://openalex.org/W2904305880,"Despite previous empirical studies which have linked social capital to a number of health outcomes, few studies have investigated sub-group specific social capital among populations at increased risk for HIV infection such as gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM). Many GBM of color belong to constructed families in which friends refer to each other with kinship terms such as parents and children. No studies have measured social capital provisions within constructed family networks. This study developed a preliminary instrument for assessing social capital among constructed families. The network level social capital scale incorporated the following theoretical domains hypothesized to define social capital derived from network membership: social influence, multiplex ties, heterogeneity, social cohesion, trust, quality of support, and compositional quality. A cross-sectional survey administered an eight-item scale to 131 GBM who belonged to constructed families. The factor structure and confirmatory factor analysis were assessed. Reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha to measure internal consistency. A final single factor solution was obtained which was comprised of six items with high factor loadings. The resulting measures were highly correlated with an alpha of 0.84 and each factor loading was well above 0.3. This study assessed the psychometric properties of a preliminary network level social capital instrument among GBM in constructed families. Future studies may utilize or adopt this scale to measure network-level social capital within other populations."

Household NCD status was determined through self-report of at least one of the six major NCDs within the household-heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney diseases, asthma, and cancer. We estimated unadjusted and regression-adjusted differences in household expenditure shares between NCD and non-NCD households. We further investigated how consumption of different food sub-categories is related to NCD status, distinguishing between household economic levels. The medical expenditure share was estimated to be 59% higher for NCD households than non-NCD households, and NCD households had lower expenditure shares on food, clothing, hygiene, and energy. Regression results indicated that presence of NCDs was associated with lower relative expenditure on clothing and housing in all economic subgroups, and with lower expenditure on food among marginally poor households. Having an NCD was significantly associated with higher household spending on tobacco and higher-calorie foods such as sugar, beverages, meat, dairy, and fruit, and with lower spending on fish, vegetables, and legumes. The findings indicate a link between NCDs and the possibility of adverse economic effects on the household by highlighting the potential displacement effect on household consumption that might occur through higher medical expenditure and lower spending on essentials. The findings might also point to a need for raising awareness about the link between NCDs and diet in Bangladesh."

https://openalex.org/W2888979048,"Background Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is spread widely across Asia, and the hospitalization burden is currently not well understood. Here, we estimated serotype-specific and age-specific hospitalization rates of HFMD in Southern China. Methods We enrolled pediatric HFMD patients admitted to 3/3 county-level hospitals, and 3/23 township-level hospitals in Anhua county, Hunan (CN). Samples were collected to identify enterovirus serotypes by RT-PCRs between October 2013 and September 2016. Information on other eligible, but un-enrolled, patients were retrospectively collected from the same six hospitals. Monthly numbers of all-cause hospitalizations were collected from each of the 23 township-level hospitals to extrapolate hospitalizations associated with HFMD among these. Results During the three years, an estimated 3,236 pediatric patients were hospitalized with lab-confirmed HFMD, and among these only one case was severe. The mean hospitalization rate was 660 (95% CI: 638–684) per 100,000 person-years for lab-confirmed HFMD, with higher rates among CV-A16 and CV-A6 associated HFMD (213 vs 209 per 100,000 person-years), and lower among EV-A71, CV-A10 and other enterovirus associated HFMD (134, 39 and 66 per 100,000 person-years respectively, p<0.001). Children aged 12–23 months had the highest hospitalization rates (3,594/100,000 person-years), followed by those aged 24–35 months (1,828/100,000 person-years) and 6–11 months (1,572/100,000 person-years). Compared with other serotypes, CV-A6-associated hospitalizations were evident at younger ages. Conclusions Our study indicates a substantial hospitalization burden associated with non-severe HFMD in a rural county in southern China. Future mitigation policies should take into account the disease burden identified, and optimize interventions for HFMD."
https://openalex.org/W2904400293,"Background Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is aimed to counteract cognitions and behaviours that are considered as dysfunctional. The aim of the study is to test whether the inclusion of a non-counteractive approach (dilemma-focused intervention, DFI) in combination with CBT group therapy will yield better short- and long-term outcomes than an intervention conducted entirely using CBT. Method A total of 128 patients with depression and at least one cognitive conflict, of six health community centres in Barcelona, participated from November of 2011 to December of 2014 in seven weekly group CBT sessions and were then randomly allocated to either DFI or CBT (eight individual sessions each) by an independent researcher. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II at baseline, at the end of therapy and three- and twelve-month follow-ups. Therapists did not participate in any of the assessments nor in the randomisation of patients and evaluators were masked to group assignment. Both intention to treat and complete case analyses were performed using linear mixed models with random effects. Findings According to intention-to-treat analysis (F2, 179 = 0.69) and complete case analysis (F2, 146 = 0.88), both conditions similarly reduced the severity of symptoms across posttreatment assessments. For the 77 participants (CBTgroup +CBTindividual = 40; CBTgroup+DFIindividual = 37) that completed allocated treatment and one-year follow-up assessment, response and remission rates were relative higher for the DFI condition, however no significant differences were found between treatment conditions. The relapse rates were similar between treatment conditions (CBTgroup +CBTindividual = 7/20; CBTgroup+DFIindividual = 8/22). Interpretation Although using a counteractive approach across all the treatment sessions is quite effective, it does not seem to be necessary to produce significant improvement. DFI may be considered as an alternative, which could be included in a wider treatment for depression. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov; ID: NCT01542957."
https://openalex.org/W2905244793,"The SRP-Sec61 targeting/translocation pathway of eukaryotic cells targets nascent protein chains to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Using this machinery, secretory proteins are translocated across this membrane whereas membrane proteins are integrated into the lipid bilayer. One of the key players of the pathway is the protein-conducting Sec61 (translocon) complex of the endoplasmic reticulum. The Sec61 complex has no enzymatic activity, is expressed only intracellularly and is difficult to purify and to reconstitute. Screening for small molecule inhibitors impairing its functions is thus notoriously difficult. Such inhibitors may not only be valuable tools for cell biology, they may also represent novel anti-tumor drugs. Here we have developed a two-step, sequential screening assay for inhibitors of the whole SRP-Sec61 targeting/translocation pathway which might include molecules affecting Sec61 complex functions. The resulting hit compounds were analyzed using a whole cell biosynthesis assay and a cell free transcription/translation/translocation assay. Using this methodology, we identified novel compounds inhibiting this pathway. Following structure-based back screening, one of these substances was analyzed in more detail and we could show that it indeed impairs translocation at the level of the Sec61 complex. A slightly modified methodology may be used in the future to screen for substances affecting SecYEG, the bacterial ortholog of the Sec61 complex in order to derive novel antibiotic drugs."

Methods Rainy seasons were defined for each study site using climatological information from the World Meteorological Organization. The dengue attack rate in the placebo group for each study month was calculated as the number of symptomatic, virologically-confirmed dengue events in a given month divided by the number of participants at risk in the same month. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were used to test whether rainy season was associated with dengue disease and whether it modified vaccine efficacy in each of the two trials and in both of the trials combined. Findings Rainy season, country, and age were all significantly associated with dengue disease in both studies. Vaccine efficacy did not change during the rainy season in any of the analyses. Conclusions Although dengue transmission and exposure are expected to increase during the rainy season, our results indicate that CYD-TDV vaccine efficacy remains constant throughout the year in endemic regions."
https://openalex.org/W2903807787,"Tracing the evolution of the siboglinid group, peculiar group of marine gutless annelids, requires the detailed study of the fragmentarily explored central nervous system of vestimentiferans and other siboglinids. 3D reconstructions of the neuroanatomy of Riftia revealed that the “brain” of adult vestimentiferans is a fusion product of the supraesophageal and subesophageal ganglia. The supraesophageal ganglion-like area contains the following neural structures that are homologous to the annelid elements: the peripheral perikarya of the brain lobes, two main transverse commissures, mushroom-like structures, commissural cell cluster, and the circumesophageal connectives with two roots which give rise to the palp neurites. Three pairs of giant perikarya are located in the supraesophageal ganglion, giving rise to the paired giant axons. The circumesophageal connectives run to the VNC. The subesophageal ganglion-like area contains a tripartite ventral aggregation of perikarya (= the postoral ganglion of the VNC) interconnected by the subenteral commissure. The paired VNC is intraepidermal, not ganglionated over most of its length, associated with the ciliary field, and comprises the giant axons. The pairs of VNC and the giant axons fuse posteriorly. Within siboglinids, the vestimentiferans are distinguished by a large and considerably differentiated brain. This reflects the derived development of the tentacle crown. The tentacles of vestimentiferans are homologous to the annelid palps based on their innervation from the dorsal and ventral roots of the circumesophageal connectives. Neuroanatomy of the vestimentiferan brains is close to the brains of Cirratuliiformia and Spionida/Sabellida, which have several transverse commissures, specific position of the giant somata (if any), and palp nerve roots (if any). The palps and palp neurite roots originally developed in all main annelid clades (basally branching, errantian and sedentarian annelids), show the greatest diversity in their number in sedentarian species. Over the course of evolution of Sedentaria, the number of palps and their nerve roots either dramatically increased (as in vestimentiferan siboglinids) or were lost."

We sought to determine the frequency of nighttime ICU discharge and identify whether nighttime ICU discharge is associated with worse outcomes in a private adult ICU located in Brazil.Post hoc analysis of a cohort study addressing the effect of ICU readmissions on outcomes. This retrospective, single center, propensity matched cohort study was conducted in a medical-surgical ICU located in a private tertiary care hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Based on time of transfer, patients were categorized into nighttime (7:00 pm to 6:59 am) and daytime (7:00 am to 6:59 pm) ICU discharge and were propensity-score matched at a 1:2 ratio. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality.Among 4,313 eligible patients admitted to the ICU between June 2013 and May 2015, 1,934 patients were matched at 1:2 ratio [649 (33.6%) nighttime and 1,285 (66.4%) daytime discharged patients]. The median (IQR) cohort age was 66 (51-79) years and SAPS III score was 43 (33-55). In-hospital mortality was 6.5% (42/649) in nighttime compared to 5.6% (72/1,285) in daytime discharged patients (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.73; p = 0.444). While frequency of ICU readmission (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.29; p = 0.741) and length of hospital stay did not differ between the groups, length of ICU stay was lower in nighttime compared to daytime ICU discharged patients [1 (1-3) days vs. 2 (1-3) days, respectively, p = 0.047].In this propensity-matched retrospective cohort study, time of ICU discharge did not affect in-hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2905391521,"Prolonged exposure to organic barn dusts can lead to chronic inflammation and a broad range of lung problems over time, mediated by innate immune mechanisms. The immune surfactant or collectin surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a crucial multifunctional innate immune receptor. Little work to date has examined the effect of such collectins in response to organic dusts. We provide evidence here that agricultural organic dusts can inhibit mRNA and protein expression of SP-D in a human alveolar epithelial cell line, and an in vivo mouse model. This inhibition was not a result of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or peptidoglycans, the two most commonly cited immune active components of these dusts. We further show that inhibition of the signaling molecule protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) can reverse this inhibition implicating it as a mechanism of SP-D inhibition. Examination of the SP-D regulatory receptor GPR116 showed that its mRNA expression was increased in response to dust and inhibited by blocking PKCα, implicating it as a means of inhibiting SP-D in the lungs in response to organic dusts. This reduction shows that organic barn dust can reduce lung SP-D, thus leaving workers potentially at risk for a host of pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2903623335,"Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is an inflammatory maker, and high PLR is associated with mortality in several diseases. The predictors of mortality in individuals with high PLR is still lacking. Our aims were to assess if mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) can predict all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with high PLR. Adult participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-1994) were included. All participants were divided into low PLR and high PLR groups with the cut-off point being the median PLR level, and each group was evaluated for risk factors of mortality. MAMC was divided into tertiles and the general characteristics of the study population related to MAMC were evaluated. The study included 14,221 adults with 6,701 (47.1%) male and 7,520 (52.9%) female participants. The median PLR ratio was 122. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, C-reactive protein, uric acid, and glucose, as well as a higher age, were associated with increased risk of mortality in both groups. After adjusting for all the covariates, in the higher PLR group, the highest MAMC tertile was significantly associated with lower hazard ratios for all-cause and cancer mortalities compared with the lowest MAMC tertile. However, this association was not observed in the low PLR group. The highest MAMC tertile showed protective effects from all-cause and cancer mortalities compared with the lowest MAMC tertile in individuals with PLR ≥ 122. In conclusion, the highest MAMC tertile was significantly associated with decreasing HRs for all-cause and cancer mortalities compared with the lowest MAMC tertile in individuals with elevated PLR."
https://openalex.org/W2904922740,"Special investigations (e.g. blood tests, electrocardiograms, x-rays) play an integral role in patient management in the emergency department (ED). Having results immediately available prior to assessing a patient may lead to improved efficiency. This could be instituted by utilizing point-of-care (POC) testing with an alternative ED workflow, but the implementation would be dependent on acceptance by the end-users. The aim of this study was to assess doctors' perceptions of POC testing in the ED when the normal treatment pathway was modified to use upfront POC tests performed prior to doctor evaluation in an effort to decrease treatment times.A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was performed in the ED where medical patients received either the normal ED workflow pathway or one of the enhanced workflow pathways with POC tests in various combinations prior to doctor evaluation. At the end of the study period, doctors were invited to participate in an anonymous survey to gauge their opinions on the implementation of the early POC testing.Overall, the doctors surveyed were very satisfied with use of upfront POC in the ED. One hundred per cent of the 28 doctors surveyed found it helpful to assess patients who already had test results available and would want it to be permanently available. Normalized satisfaction scores were more favorable for combinations of 3 or more tests (0.7-1.0) as opposed to combinations with 2 or less tests (0.3-0.7). There was a preference for combinations that included comprehensive blood results.The implementation of workflow changes to assist doctors in the ED can potentially make them more productive. End-user buy-in is essential in order for the change to be successful. Upfront, protocolised, POC testing is a low-input, high-yield intervention that decreased treatment time and satisfied doctors."

https://openalex.org/W2905537110,"The aim of this study was to determine the energy demand of one session of active video game (AVG) and its potential to reduce blood pressure (BP). Fourteen hypertensive (56.4±7.5 years) individuals performed sessions of AVG, a traditional sedentary video game sessions (SVG) and walking (WAL), as negative and positive controls, in a randomly determined order. Oxygen consumption and energy expenditure (EE) were measured during sessions. BP and cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM) were measured at rest and every 15 minutes of a 60-minute period of recovery from activities. A rating of enjoyment scale was also applied. AVG and WAL resulted in higher oxygen consumption (10.0±0.5 ml/kg/min and 16.6±3.1 ml/kg/min, respectively) and EE (3.5±0.2 kcal/min and 4.2±0.5 kcal/min) compared to 4.1±0.8 ml/kg/min and 1.4±0.1 kcal/min in SVG. A reduction in systolic and diastolic BP was evident following AVG sessions (-11.6±2.5 mmHg and -8.7±2.5 mmHg) and WAL (-10.8±2.8 mmHg and -8.6±2.3 mmHg) compared to pre-experiment value, and the same did not occur in SVG. All sessions promoted a feeling of enjoyment, with no difference between them. The parasympathetic activity was significantly lower at 30 and 45 minutes in post-WAL recovery (34.6±15.0 ms2 and 34.4±16.0 ms2) in the frequency domain (HF) in relation to both AVG (195.5±67.0 ms2 and 164.5±55.0 ms2) and the SVG (158.9±45.0 and 281.3±98.0 ms2). It is concluded that an AVG session promotes increased metabolic activity and is able to promote acute reduction of BP in hypertensive individuals similar to traditional walking exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2904132499,"Ordinal categorical responses are frequently collected in survey studies, human medicine, and animal and plant improvement programs, just to mention a few. Errors in this type of data are neither rare nor easy to detect. These errors tend to bias the inference, reduce the statistical power and ultimately the efficiency of the decision-making process. Contrarily to the binary situation where misclassification occurs between two response classes, noise in ordinal categorical data is more complex due to the increased number of categories, diversity and asymmetry of errors. Although several approaches have been presented for dealing with misclassification in binary data, only limited practical methods have been proposed to analyze noisy categorical responses. A latent variable model implemented within a Bayesian framework was proposed to analyze ordinal categorical data subject to misclassification using simulated and real datasets. The simulated scenario consisted of a discrete response with three categories and a symmetric error rate of 5% between any two classes. The real data consisted of calving ease records of beef cows. Using real and simulated data, ignoring misclassification resulted in substantial bias in the estimation of genetic parameters and reduction of the accuracy of predicted breeding values. Using our proposed approach, a significant reduction in bias and increase in accuracy ranging from 11% to 17% was observed. Furthermore, most of the misclassified observations (in the simulated data) were identified with a substantially higher probability. Similar results were observed for a scenario with asymmetric misclassification. While the extension to traits with more categories between adjacent classes is straightforward, it could be computationally costly. For traits with high heritability, the performance of the methodology would be expected to improve."

Only high-quality images with an identifiable scleral spur were included, and only the nasal quadrant was analyzed. A single glaucoma specialist analyzed the parameters according to the Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program (ZAAP, Guangzhou, China). Multivariate analysis was performed using mixed effects regression correcting for age, gender, and ethnicity.89 subjects and 110 eyes were included in this study. The mean age of subjects was 74.83 {+/-} 8.69 years old. Most common diagnoses were POAG and glaucoma suspect (23% and 52%, respectively), and 16% of subjects had an LPI. In multivariate analysis of AS-OCT parameters, decreases in IT750, IT2000, ITCM, ICURV, and pupil size were statistically significant (p<0.05).After phacoemulsification, eyes with glaucoma as well as glaucoma suspect eyes have thinner irises and smaller pupils. This may lead to less iris-mediated aqueous outflow obstruction, providing support for early phacoemulsification glaucoma treatment.Our AS-OCT imaging findings may guide clinical practice as iris parameters become increasingly relevant in preoperative phaco planning."

We studied tree stand density in Jiufeng National Forest Park in Beijing. The number of spectral local maxima points (NSLMP) calculated within each sample plot was extracted by the spectral maximum filtering method using QuickBird imagery. Regression analysis of NSLMP and the true stand density collected by ground measurements using differential GPS and the total station were used to estimate stand density of the study area. We used NSLMP as an independent variable and the actual stand density as the dependent variable to develop separate statistical models for all stands in the coniferous forest and broadleaf forest. By testing the different combination of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholds and window sizes, the optimal selection was identified. The combination of a 3 × 3 window size and NDVI ≥ 0.3 threshold in coniferous forest produced the best result using near-infrared band (coniferous forest R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 12.60). The best combination for broadleaf forest was a 3 × 3 window size and NDVI ≥ 0.1 with R2 = 0.44, RMSE = 9.02 using near-infrared band. The combination of window size and NDVI threshold for all unclassified forest was 3 × 3 window size and NDVI ≥ 0.3 with R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 11.20 using near-infrared band. A stand density planning map was constructed using the best models applied for different forest types. Different forest types require the use of different combination strategies to best extract the stand density by using the local maximum (LM). The proposed method uses a combination of high spatial resolution imagery and sampling plots strategy to estimate stand density."
