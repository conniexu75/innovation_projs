https://openalex.org/W1987503886,"Natural production rates of the 16 million-year iodine-129 from spontaneous fission and from cosmic-ray reactions are estimated to contribute a steady-state concentration of more than 10-14 gram of I129 per gram of I127 to the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere. These concentrations are expected to be detectable by neutron-activation analysis in natural materials that concentrate iodine. Substantial additional contributions have been made by fission-produced I129 in fallout, serving as an intrinsic tracer for natural iodine kinetics. Iodine-129 activation analysis has advantages as a tracer technique."

https://openalex.org/W2041513787,"Substitution of deuterium for the N-methyl hydrogens of morphine produced a significant reduction in the potency and lethality of morphine in mice regardless of the route of administration. There was no effect on the time of onset, maximal effect, or duration of action. N-demethylation by rat liver microsomal enzymes was characterized by a smaller reaction rate constant, a higher energy of activation, and a larger Michaelis constant with respect to the deuterated morphine. These findings indicated that deuteration of the N-methyl group of morphine not only caused reduction in potency, but also a reduction in the rate of oxidative N-demethylation, and a distinct weakening of the binding to the enzyme active centers."
https://openalex.org/W2230785544,"SUMMARY The polymerization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into polyadenylate chains of 50 to 100 nucleotides by an ATP poly- merase from calf thymus nuclei has been shown to depend upon the presence of polynucleotide primer, which can be isolated from a boiled extract of the purified enzyme. Treatment primer with pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase), Taka-Diastase T1 RNase and TQ RNase, snake venom phosphodiesterase, squid RNase, and A. agilis nuclease demonstrated that inactivation oc- curred only if the nuclease was capable of cleaving phosphodiester bonds between adenylate units. Purification of the enzyme raised the adenylate content of the polynucleotide component from 19y0 in the crude extract to 27 y0 in the purified enzyme and to 87% after removal of inactive polynucleotides by treatment with pancreatic RNase and Taka-Diastase T1 RNase. Poly- adenylate synthesized with polynucleotide phosphorylase was found to function as a primer for ATP polymerase, although the reaction differed in some details from that with the native primer. The conclusion was drawn that a long polyadenylate sequence occurred naturally in calf thymus nuclei as the primer for ATP polymerase.

The data confirm the Bruce effect but also indicate that changes in physical environment produced great effects on implantation in recently inseminated females."

The first measurements were made about five weeks after the start of testing and about 10 days after iodine-131 was first observed in dairy products in New York City. The accumulation of iodine-131 in human thyroids was observed by in vivo procedures and dissection methods. The human thyroid burdens are shown to be above 10 pC/g, higher than normal, for the milk-drinking portion. (N.W.R.)"
https://openalex.org/W2018103446,RUBIN has published data1a on erythrocyte acetyl-cholinesterase which showed a bimodal distribution of this enzyme in schizophrenic patients. This paper was criticized1b and the criticism answered1c. Our work was an attempt to repeat Rubin's findings in larger groups of patients and normals.

The major changes which occur with selection and the differential roles in geotaxis of the three large chromosomes are described.

https://openalex.org/W2059096239,"A monkey, after corpus callosum transection, will fail to recall through one hand tactual tasks that he has learned through the other hand. However, if a monkey has already learned a task through one hand, destruction of the corpus callosum does not greatly affect his subsequent recall of that task through the other hand. It is concluded that task learning through one hand develops separate memory trace systems in both hemispheres."

It was found that inhibition, as judged by discharge frequency, may depend upon rate of change of light intensity. Apparently the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs at the ganglion cell level depends upon rate of change of illumination. Visual purple bleaching or sensory adaptation taking place during the stimulation does not explain the results."

https://openalex.org/W1964293284,"IT has been suggested by Steffensen1 that calcium is the key metal affecting radiosensitivity. Rixon and Whitfield2 showed that a single post-irradiation injection of parathyroid extract has a significant effect on the survival of rats, which had been exposed to 800 r. of X-rays. They explain this result by the mobilizing effect of parathyroid extract on the calcium store in bones."

https://openalex.org/W2002042391,"INTRA-ARTERIAL infusions of small amounts of adrenaline cause a marked but transient increase in the flow of blood in the calf of the leg; this is followed by a return to the base-line or even by a decrease in flow of blood, although the infusion continues1. The biphasic effect of adrenaline may be explained by interaction with the different adrenergic receptors2, the primary vasodilatation being mediated by the β-receptors and the secondary vasoconstriction being brought about by action on the α-receptors. Supporting such an explanation is the observation that the decrease in flow of blood in the muscles of the fore-arm due to adrenaline can be abolished by an intra-arterial infusion of dibenyline which is known to inhibit the action of adrenaline on the α-receptors3. Proof of the existence of β-receptors in blood vessels of man has so far not been reported."
