https://openalex.org/W2616867613,"The benefit of social robots to support child learning in an educational context over an extended period of time is evaluated. Specifically, the effect of personalisation and adaptation of robot social behaviour is assessed. Two autonomous robots were embedded within two matched classrooms of a primary school for a continuous two week period without experimenter supervision to act as learning companions for the children for familiar and novel subjects. Results suggest that while children in both personalised and non-personalised conditions learned, there was increased child learning of a novel subject exhibited when interacting with a robot that personalised its behaviours, with indications that this benefit extended to other class-based performance. Additional evidence was obtained suggesting that there is increased acceptance of the personalised robot peer over a non-personalised version. These results provide the first evidence in support of peer-robot behavioural personalisation having a positive influence on learning when embedded in a learning environment for an extended period of time."

To evaluate the therapeutic potential of melatonin in mastitis, we examined the ability of melatonin to protect bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) from the harmful effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that melatonin inhibited the LPS-binding protein-CD14-TLR4 signaling pathway in bMECs, which had opposing effects on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Melatonin decreased LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and positive acute-phase proteins (APPs), including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, chemokine CC motif ligand (CCL)2, CCL5, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and α-1 antitrypsin, and increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1Ra and the negative APP fibrinogen. In addition, melatonin increased dityrosine levels but suppressed nitrite levels by upregulating the expression of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 in the Nrf2 antioxidant defense pathway. Finally, melatonin administration increased the viability of LPS-stimulated bMECs. These results suggest that melatonin protects bMECs from LPS-induced inflammatory and oxidant stress damage and provide evidence that melatonin might have therapeutic utility in mastitis."

The aims of this study were to examine the relationships between inflammatory biomarkers and the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) of pain, appetite and fatigue; and to explore whether levels of baseline biomarkers were associated with changes in these PROMs following treatment with corticosteroids.An exploratory analysis was done on a trial examining the analgesic properties of corticosteroids in patients with advanced cancer. Inclusion criteria were: >18 years, taking opioids for moderate or severe cancer pain; pain ≥4 (numerical rating scale 0-10). Serum was extracted and levels of inflammatory biomarkers were assessed. PROMs of pain, appetite and fatigue were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The relationships between PROMs and inflammatory biomarkers were examined using Spearman Rho-Rank and multiple regression analysis.Data were available on 49 patients. Levels of sTNF-r1, IL-6, IL-18, MIF, MCP-1, TGF-β1, IL-1ra, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were elevated; IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), interferon-γ, MIP-1α, and TNF-α were below the level of detection. The following correlations were observed: appetite and IL-6 and CRP; fatigue and IL-1ra (rs: 0.38-0.41, p< .01). There was no association between pretreatment biomarkers and effect from corticosteroid treatment.In patients with advanced cancer and pain, some pro-inflammatory cytokines were related to appetite and fatigue. Inflammatory biomarkers were not associated with pain or with the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy. Further research examining the attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response and possible effects on symptoms would be of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2619324108,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) containing consumer products have been proliferating in the market due to its unique antimicrobial property, however, lack of in-depth knowledge about their potential effect on human health in a longer run is of great concern. Therefore, we investigated dose-dependent in vivo effect of AgNPs using Drosophila as a model system. Drosophila, a genetically tractable organism with distinct developmental stages, short life cycle and significant homology with human serves as an ideal organism to study nanomaterial-mediated toxicity. Our studies suggest that ingestion of AgNPs in Drosophila during adult stage for short and long duration significantly affects egg laying capability along with impaired growth of ovary. Additionally, dietary intake of AgNPs from larval stage has more deleterious effects that result in reduced survival, longevity, ovary size and egg laying capability at a further lower dosage. Interestingly, the trans-generational effect of AgNPs was also observed without feeding progeny with AgNPs, thereby suggesting its impact from previous generation. Our results strongly imply that higher doses of AgNPs and its administration early during development is detrimental to the reproductive health and survival of Drosophila that follows in generations to come without feeding them to AgNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2616886507,"Activation of SIRT1 has previously been shown to protect mice against osteoporosis through yet ill-defined mechanisms. In this study, we outline a role for SIRT1 as a positive regulator of the master osteoblast transcription factor, RUNX2. We find that ex vivo deletion of sirt1 leads to decreased expression of runx2 downstream targets, but not runx2 itself, along with reduced osteoblast differentiation. Reciprocally, treatment with a SIRT1 agonist promotes osteoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of runx2 downstream targets, in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Biochemical and luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that SIRT1 interacts with and promotes the transactivation potential of RUNX2. Intriguingly, mice treated with the SIRT1 agonist, resveratrol, show similar increases in the expression of RUNX2 targets in their calvaria (bone tissue), validating SIRT1 as a physiologically relevant regulator of RUNX2."
https://openalex.org/W2617518756,"Epidemiological studies have shown obesity to be linked with poorer outcomes in breast cancer patients. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of invasive/metastatic disease with obesity are complex, but may include elevated levels of adipokines such as leptin. Using physiological levels of leptin found in obesity in a novel chronic in vitro treatment model (≤200 ng/ml for 14 days), we confirmed the occurrence of leptin-mediated changes in growth, apoptosis and metastatic behavior, and gene expression changes representing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a cancer stem cell (CSC) like phenotype in breast epithelial and cancer cell lines (MCF10A, MCF10AT1, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). Further, we have discovered that these effects were accompanied by increased expression of TGFB1, and could be significantly reduced by co-treatment with neutralizing antibody against TGFB1, indicating that the induction of these characteristics was mediated via TGFB1. Occurring in both MCF7 and MCF10AT1 cells, it suggests these actions of leptin to be independent of estrogen receptor status. By linking leptin signalling to the established TGFB1 pathway of metastasis / EMT, this study gives a direct mechanism by which leptin can contribute to the poorer outcomes of obese cancer patients. Inhibitors of TGFB1 are in currently in phase III clinical trials in other malignancies, thus identifying the connection between leptin and TGFB1 will open new therapeutic opportunities for improving outcomes for obese breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2614803864,"In consensually non-monogamous relationships there is an open agreement that one, both, or all individuals involved in a romantic relationship may also have other sexual and/or romantic partners. Research concerning consensual non-monogamy has grown recently but has just begun to determine how relationships amongst partners in consensually non-monogamous arrangements may vary. The current research examines this issue within one type of consensual non-monogamy, specifically polyamory, using a convenience sample of 1,308 self-identified polyamorous individuals who provided responses to various indices of relationship evaluation (e.g. acceptance, secrecy, investment size, satisfaction level, commitment level, relationship communication, and sexual frequency). Measures were compared between perceptions of two concurrent partners within each polyamorous relationship (i.e., primary and secondary partners). Participants reported less stigma as well as more investment, satisfaction, commitment and greater communication about the relationship with primary compared to secondary relationships, but a greater proportion of time on sexual activity with secondary compared to primary relationships. We discuss how these results inform our understanding of the unique costs and rewards of primary-secondary relationships in polyamory and suggest future directions based on these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2614918224,"New treatments and novel drugs are required to counter the growing problem of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Our approach against drug resistant M.tb, as well as other intracellular pathogens, is by targeted drug delivery using nanoformulations of drugs already in use, as well as drugs in development. Among the latter are gallium (III) (Ga)-based compounds. In the current work, six different types of Ga and rifampin nanoparticles were prepared in such a way as to enhance targeting of M.tb infected-macrophages. They were then tested for their ability to inhibit growth of a fully pathogenic strain (H37Rv) or a non-pathogenic strain (H37Ra) of M.tb. Encapsulating Ga in folate- or mannose-conjugated block copolymers provided sustained Ga release for 15 days and significantly inhibited M.tb growth in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Nanoformulations with dendrimers encapsulating Ga or rifampin also showed promising anti-tuberculous activity. The nanoparticles co-localized with M.tb containing phagosomes, as measured by detection of mature cathepsin D (34 kDa, lysosomal hydrogenase). They also promoted maturation of the phagosome, which would be expected to increase macrophage-mediated killing of the organism. Delivery of Ga or rifampin in the form of nanoparticles to macrophages offers a promising approach for the development of new therapeutic anti-tuberculous drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2617575010,"Background In recent decades the overall smoking prevalence in the US has fallen steadily. This study examines whether the same trend is seen in the Medicaid population. Methods and findings National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 17 consecutive annual surveys from 1997 to 2013 (combined N = 514,043) were used to compare smoking trends for 4 insurance groups: Medicaid, the Uninsured, Private Insurance, and Other Coverage. Rates of chronic disease and psychological distress were also compared. Results Adjusted smoking prevalence showed no detectable decline in the Medicaid population (from 33.8% in 1997 to 31.8% in 2013, trend test P = 0.13), while prevalence in the other insurance groups showed significant declines (38.6%-34.7% for the Uninsured, 21.3%-15.8% for Private Insurance, and 22.6%-16.8% for Other Coverage; all P’s<0.005). Among individuals who have ever smoked, Medicaid recipients were less likely to have quit (38.8%) than those in Private Insurance (62.3%) or Other Coverage (69.8%; both P’s<0.001). Smokers in Medicaid were more likely than those in Private Insurance and the Uninsured to have chronic disease (55.0% vs 37.3% and 32.4%, respectively; both P’s<0.01). Smokers in Medicaid were also more likely to experience severe psychological distress (16.2% for Medicaid vs 3.2% for Private Insurance and 7.6% for the Uninsured; both P’s<0.001). Conclusions The high and relatively unchanging smoking prevalence in the Medicaid population, low quit ratio, and high rates of chronic disease and severe psychological distress highlight the need to focus on this population. A targeted and sustained campaign to help Medicaid recipients quit smoking is urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2618161919,"Invasion of trophoblast cells is spatio-temporally regulated by various cytokines and growth factors. In pregnancy, complications like preeclampsia, shallow invasion of trophoblast cells and low amounts of epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been reported. In the present study, regulatory mechanisms associated with EGF-mediated invasion in HTR-8/SVneo trophoblastic cells have been delineated. Treatment of HTR-8/SVneo cells with EGF (10 ng/ml) led to eight fold increase (p < 0.05) in invasion. Increased invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells by EGF was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of ERK½. In addition, significant phosphorylation of STAT1 (ser 727) and STAT3 (both tyr 705 and ser 727 residues) was also observed, accompanied by a decrease in total STAT1. Inhibition of ERK½ phosphorylation by U0126 (10 μM) led to a significant decrease in EGF-mediated invasion with simultaneous decrease in the phosphorylated forms of STAT3 and STAT1. Decrease in total STAT1 was also reversed on inhibition of ERK½. Interestingly, inhibition of STAT3 by siRNA led to a significant decrease in EGF-mediated invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells and phosphorylation of STAT1, but it did not have any effect on the activation of ERK½. On the other hand, inhibition of STAT1 by siRNA, also led to a significant decrease in the EGF-mediated invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells, showed concomitant decrease in ERK½ phosphorylation and STAT3 phosphorylation at ser 727 residue. These results suggest cross-communication between ERK½ and JAK-STAT pathways during EGF-mediated increase in invasion of trophoblast cells; phosphorylation at ser 727 residue of both STAT3 and STAT1 appears to be critical."
https://openalex.org/W2619437256,"Fatigue is a prevalent symptom and major burden in neuroimmunological diseases. In neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a severe autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disease with autoantibodies reactive to aquaporin-4, there are few reports about fatigue and quality of life (QOL). We aimed to evaluate the severity of fatigue and its relationship with QOL in patients with NMOSD. We prospectively studied patients with NMOSD who were in remission and seropositive for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody, and they were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of fatigue assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue score. Sleep quality, depression, pain, and QOL were also evaluated. A total of 35 patients were enrolled (mean age, 46.5 ± 14.1 years; female: male = 29:6), and the median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 2.0 (range, 0 to 8.0). The patients with fatigue (N = 25, 71.4%) had poorer sleep quality and more severe depression than those without fatigue (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001). Both the physical and mental QOL scores were lower in patients with fatigue than in those without fatigue (p = 0.033 and p = 0.004). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the degree of fatigue with EDSS score and pain were independent predictors of physical aspects of QOL (B = 0.382, p = 0.001), whereas depression was the only predictor of the mental components of QOL (B = -0.845, p = <0.001). Fatigue is a common symptom and an important predictor of QOL in patients with NMOSD."
https://openalex.org/W2617526393,"Plants' reaction to underground microorganisms is complex as sessile nature of plants compels them to prioritize their responses to diverse microorganisms both pathogenic and symbiotic. Roots of important crops are directly exposed to diverse microorganisms, but investigations involving root pathogens are significantly less. Thus, more studies involving root pathogens and their target crops are necessitated to enrich the understanding of underground interactions. Present study reported the molecular complexities in chickpea during Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri Race 1 (Foc1) infection. Transcriptomic dissections using RNA-seq showed significantly differential expression of molecular transcripts between infected and control plants of both susceptible and resistant genotypes. Radar plot analyses showed maximum expressional undulations after infection in both susceptible and resistant plants. Gene ontology and functional clustering showed large number of transcripts controlling basic metabolism of plants. Network analyses demonstrated defense components like peptidyl cis/trans isomerase, MAP kinase, beta 1,3 glucanase, serine threonine kinase, patatin like protein, lactolylglutathione lyase, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, sulfotransferases; reactive oxygen species regulating components like respiratory burst oxidase, superoxide dismutases, cytochrome b5 reductase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, ATPase; metabolism regulating components, myo inositol phosphate, carboxylate synthase; transport related gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, and structural component, ubiquitins to serve as important nodals of defense signaling network. These nodal molecules probably served as hub controllers of defense signaling. Functional characterization of these hub molecules would not only help in developing better understanding of chickpea-Foc1 interaction but also place them as promising candidates for resistance management programs against vascular wilt of legumes."
https://openalex.org/W2617526825,"The role of inflammation in diabetic retinal amage is well accepted. While a number of cytokines and inflammatory mediators are responsible for these changes, upstream regulators are less well studied. Additionally, the role for these upstream mediators in retinal health is unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that inhibition of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) could restore normal insulin signaling in retinal endothelial cells (REC) grown in high glucose, as well as protect the retina against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced retinal damage. REC were grown in normal (5mM) or high glucose (25mM) and treated with Box A or glycyrrhizin, two different HMGB1 inhibitors. Western blotting was done for HMGB1, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and Akt. ELISA analyses were done for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and cleaved caspase 3. In addition, C57/B6 mice were treated with glycyrrhizin, both before and after ocular I/R. Two days following I/R, retinal sections were processed for neuronal changes, while vascular damage was measured at 10 days post-I/R. Results demonstrate that both Box A and glycyrrhizin reduced HMGB1, TLR4, and TNFα levels in REC grown in high glucose. This led to reduced cleavage of caspase 3 and IRS-1Ser307 phosphorylation, and increased insulin receptor and Akt phosphorylation. Glycyrrhizin treatment significantly reduced loss of retinal thickness and degenerate capillary numbers in mice exposed to I/R. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of HMGB1 can reduce retinal insulin resistance, as well as protect the retina against I/R-induced damage."
https://openalex.org/W2620263982,"Chronic myocardial infarction (MI) triggers pathological remodeling in the heart and cardiac nervous system. Abnormal function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), including stellate ganglia (SG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) contribute to increased sympathoexcitation, cardiac dysfunction and arrythmogenesis. ANS modulation is a therapeutic target for arrhythmia associated with cardiac injury. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the pathological remodeling in ANS following cardiac injury remains to be established.In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis by RNA-sequencing in thoracic SG and (T1-T4) DRG obtained from Yorkshire pigs following either acute (3 to 5 hours) or chronic (8 weeks) myocardial infarction. By differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified significant transcriptome changes and specific gene modules in the ANS tissues in response to myocardial infarction at either acute or chronic phases. Both differential expressed genes and the member genes of the WGCNA gene module associated with post-infarct condition were significantly enriched for inflammatory signaling and apoptotic cell death. Targeted validation analysis supported a significant induction of inflammatory and apoptotic signal in both SG and DRG following myocardial infarction, along with cellular evidence of apoptosis induction based on TUNEL analysis. Importantly, these molecular changes were observed specifically in the thoracic segments but not in their counterparts obtained from lumbar sections.Myocardial injury leads to time-dependent global changes in gene expression in the innervating ANS. Induction of inflammatory gene expression and loss of neuron cell viability in SG and DRG are potential novel mechanisms contributing to abnormal ANS function which can promote cardiac arrhythmia and pathological remodeling in myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2615531805,"Ewing Sarcoma is an aggressive, oncofusion-driven, malignant neoplasm of bone and soft tissue affecting predominantly children and young adults. Seeking to identify potential novel therapeutic targets/agents for this disease, our previous studies uncovered microRNAs regulated by EWS/Fli1, the most common oncofusion, with growth modulatory properties. In the present study, we sought to identify EWS/Fli1-repressed, growth suppressive, microRNAs potentially amenable to replacement in Ewing Sarcoma cells. Eight microRNAs (143, 153, 184, 193b, 195, 203, 206 and 223) were selected for evaluation as EWS/Fli1-repressed and underexpressed in Ewing Sarcoma cells, and reported to be growth suppressive in other pediatric or/and adult cancers. The selected miRs, and appropriate non-targeting controls, were introduced into two different Ewing Sarcoma cell lines (A673 and SK-ES-1), and effects on growth were examined using a high and low-density growth assay. MiR-193b was growth inhibitory in both assays and cell lines. In subsequent analyses, we found that stable overexpression of miR-193b also inhibits anchorage-independent growth in both A673 and SK-ES-1 cells. We further show that miR-193b negatively regulates expression of the ErbB4 oncogene in A673 and SK-ES-1 cells, and that depletion of ErbB4 is itself inhibitory to anchorage-independent growth in the same cell lines. Together, our studies show that the EWS/Fli1-repressed miR-193b is growth suppressive in Ewing Sarcoma, and identify ErbB4 as a target gene and candidate mediator of this growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2617697681,"Introduction The childhood heart disease of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) is characterized by hypertrophy and failure. It is caused by loss of frataxin (FXN), a mitochondrial protein involved in energy homeostasis. FRDA model hearts have increased mitochondrial protein acetylation and impaired sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) deacetylase activity. Protein acetylation is an important regulator of cardiac metabolism and loss of SIRT3 increases susceptibility of the heart to stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic injury. The underlying pathophysiology of heart failure in FRDA is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine in detail the physiologic and acetylation changes of the heart that occur over time in a model of FRDA heart failure. We predicted that increased mitochondrial protein acetylation would be associated with a decrease in heart function in a model of FRDA. Methods A conditional mouse model of FRDA cardiomyopathy with ablation of FXN (FXN KO) in the heart was compared to healthy controls at postnatal days 30, 45 and 65. We evaluated hearts using echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, histology, protein acetylation and expression. Results Acetylation was temporally progressive and paralleled evolution of heart failure in the FXN KO model. Increased acetylation preceded detectable abnormalities in cardiac function and progressed rapidly with age in the FXN KO mouse. Acetylation was also associated with cardiac fibrosis, mitochondrial damage, impaired fat metabolism, and diastolic and systolic dysfunction leading to heart failure. There was a strong inverse correlation between level of protein acetylation and heart function. Conclusion These results demonstrate a close relationship between mitochondrial protein acetylation, physiologic dysfunction and metabolic disruption in FRDA hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and suggest that abnormal acetylation contributes to the pathophysiology of heart disease in FRDA. Mitochondrial protein acetylation may represent a therapeutic target for early intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2617837274,"Antimicrobial agents are used in cattle production systems for the prevention and control of bacterial associated diseases. A consequence of their use is the potential development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis that are resistant to antimicrobials are of increased concern to public health officials throughout the world as they may compromise the ability of various treatment regimens to control disease and infection in human medicine. Australia is a major exporter of beef; however it does not have an ongoing surveillance system for AMR in cattle or foods derived from these animals. This study examined 910 beef cattle, 290 dairy cattle and 300 veal calf faecal samples collected at slaughter for the presence of enterococci. Enterococcus were isolated from 805 (88.5%) beef cattle faeces, 244 (84.1%) dairy cattle faeces and 247 (82.3%) veal calf faeces with a total of 800 enterococci subsequently selected for AMR testing. The results of AMR testing identified high levels of resistance to antimicrobials that are not critically or highly important to human medicine with resistance to flavomycin (80.2%) and lincomycin (85.4–94.2%) routinely observed. Conversely, resistance to antibiotics considered critically or highly important to human medicine such as tigecycline, daptomycin, vancomycin and linezolid was not present in this study. There is minimal evidence that Australian cattle production practices are responsible for disproportionate contributions to AMR development and in general resistance to antimicrobials of critical and high importance in human medicine was low regardless of the isolate source. The low level of antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus from Australian cattle is likely to result from comprehensive controls around the use of antimicrobials in food-production animals in Australia. Nevertheless, continued monitoring of the effects of all antimicrobial use is required to support Australia’s reputation as a supplier of safe and healthy food."
https://openalex.org/W2619214037,"The CrbS/R two-component signal transduction system is a conserved regulatory mechanism through which specific Gram-negative bacteria control acetate flux into primary metabolic pathways. CrbS/R governs expression of acetyl-CoA synthase (acsA), an enzyme that converts acetate to acetyl-CoA, a metabolite at the nexus of the cell's most important energy-harvesting and biosynthetic reactions. During infection, bacteria can utilize this system to hijack host acetate metabolism and alter the course of colonization and pathogenesis. In toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae, CrbS/R-dependent expression of acsA is required for virulence in an arthropod model. Here, we investigate the function of the CrbS/R system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas entomophila, and non-toxigenic V. cholerae strains. We demonstrate that its role in acetate metabolism is conserved; this system regulates expression of the acsA gene and is required for growth on acetate as a sole carbon source. As a first step towards describing the mechanism of signaling through this pathway, we identify residues and domains that may be critical for phosphotransfer. We further demonstrate that although CrbS, the putative hybrid sensor kinase, carries both a histidine kinase domain and a receiver domain, the latter is not required for acsA transcription. In order to determine whether our findings are relevant to pathogenesis, we tested our strains in a Drosophila model of oral infection previously employed for the study of acetate-dependent virulence by V. cholerae. We show that non-toxigenic V. cholerae strains lacking CrbS or CrbR are significantly less virulent than are wild-type strains, while P. aeruginosa and P. entomophila lacking CrbS or CrbR are fully pathogenic. Together, the data suggest that the CrbS/R system plays a central role in acetate metabolism in V. cholerae, P. aeruginosa, and P. entomophila. However, each microbe's unique environmental adaptations and pathogenesis strategies may dictate conditions under which CrbS/R-mediated acs expression is most critical."
https://openalex.org/W2618718415,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a critical role in immune and inflammatory responses and is important in controlling a variety of processes in monocytes and macrophages. However, very little information is available about the functions of HIF-1α in fish monocytes/macrophages (MO/MФ). In this study, the cDNA sequence of the mudskipper (Boleophthalmus pectinirostris) HIF-1α gene (BpHIF-1α) was determined. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that BpHIF-1α is clustered in the fish HIF-1α tree. Constitutive expression of BpHIF-1α mRNA was detected by real-time quantitative PCR in all tested tissues, and the expression was found to be dramatically increased in the skin, liver, spleen, and kidney after Edwardsiella tarda infection. In addition, hypoxia and infection induced the expression of the BpHIF-1α transcript and protein in MO/MФ, respectively. Hypoxia caused an increase in phagocytic and bactericidal capacity of mudskipper MO/MФ in a BpHIF-1α-dependent manner. BpHIF-1α induced an anti-inflammatory status in MO/MФ upon E. tarda infection and hypoxia. Therefore, BpHIF-1α may play a predominant role in the modulation of mudskipper MO/MФ function in the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2617039577,"Genome-wide association studies have identified a genetic variant at 3p14.3 (SNP rs1354034) that strongly associates with platelet number and mean platelet volume in humans. While originally proposed to be intronic, analysis of mRNA expression in primary human hematopoietic subpopulations reveals that this SNP is located directly upstream of the predominantly expressed ARHGEF3 isoform in megakaryocytes (MK). We found that ARHGEF3, which encodes a Rho guanine exchange factor, is dramatically upregulated during both human and murine MK maturation. We show that the SNP (rs1354034) is located in a DNase I hypersensitive region in human MKs and is an expression quantitative locus (eQTL) associated with ARHGEF3 expression level in human platelets, suggesting that it may be the causal SNP that accounts for the variations observed in human platelet traits and ARHGEF3 expression. In vitro human platelet activation assays revealed that rs1354034 is highly correlated with human platelet activation by ADP. In order to test whether ARHGEF3 plays a role in MK development and/or platelet function, we developed an Arhgef3 KO/LacZ reporter mouse model. Reflecting changes in gene expression, LacZ expression increases during MK maturation in these mice. Although Arhgef3 KO mice have significantly larger platelets, loss of Arhgef3 does not affect baseline MK or platelets nor does it affect platelet function or platelet recovery in response to antibody-mediated platelet depletion compared to littermate controls. In summary, our data suggest that modulation of ARHGEF3 gene expression in humans with a promoter-localized SNP plays a role in human MKs and human platelet function—a finding resulting from the biological follow-up of human genetic studies. Arhgef3 KO mice partially recapitulate the human phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2617991335,"In this study, we used several molecular techniques to develop a fast and reliable protocol (DNA Verity Test, DVT) for the characterization and confirmation of the species or taxa present in herbal infusions. As a model plant for this protocol, Camellia sinensis, a traditional tea plant, was selected due to the following reasons: its historical popularity as a (healthy) beverage, its high selling value, the importation of barely recognizable raw product (i.e., crushed), and the scarcity of studies concerning adulterants or contamination. The DNA Verity Test includes both the sequencing of DNA barcoding markers and genotyping of labeled-PCR DNA barcoding fragments for each sample analyzed. This protocol (DVT) was successively applied to verify the authenticity of 32 commercial teas (simple or admixture), and the main results can be summarized as follows: (1) the DVT protocol is suitable to detect adulteration in tea matrices (contaminations or absence of certified ingredients), and the method can be exported for the study of other similar systems; (2) based on the BLAST analysis of the sequences of rbcL+matK±rps7-trnV(GAC) chloroplast markers, C. sinensis can be taxonomically characterized; (3) rps7-trnV(GAC) can be employed to discriminate C. sinensis from C. pubicosta; (4) ITS2 is not an ideal DNA barcode for tea samples, reflecting potential incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization/introgression phenomena in C. sinensis taxa; (5) the genotyping approach is an easy, inexpensive and rapid pre-screening method to detect anomalies in the tea templates using the trnH(GUG)-psbA barcoding marker; (6) two herbal companies provided no authentic products with a contaminant or without some of the listed ingredients; and (7) the leaf matrices present in some teabags could be constituted using an admixture of different C. sinensis haplotypes and/or allied species (C. pubicosta)."
https://openalex.org/W2615491086,"The goal was to gain understanding of how 12 genes containing SNP previously related to embryo competence to become a blastocyst (BRINP3, C1QB, HSPA1L, IRF9, MON1B, PARM1, PCCB, PMM2, SLC18A2, TBC1D24, TTLL3 and WBP1) participate in embryonic development. Gene expression was evaluated in matured oocytes and embryos. BRINP3 and C1QB were not detected at any stage. For most other genes, transcript abundance declined as the embryo developed to the blastocyst stage. Exceptions were for PARM1 and WBP1, where steady-state mRNA increased at the 9-16 cell stage. The SNP in WBP1 caused large differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of the protein while the SNP in PARM1 caused smaller changes. The mutation in WBP1 causes an amino acid substitution located close to a P-P-X-Y motif involved in protein-protein interactions. Moreover, the observation that the reference allele varies between mammalian species indicates that the locus has not been conserved during mammalian evolution. Knockdown of mRNA for WBP1 decreased the percent of putative zygotes becoming blastocysts and reduced the number of trophectoderm cells and immunoreactive CDX2 in the resulting blastocysts. WBP1 is an important gene for embryonic development in the cow. Further research to identify how the SNP in WBP1 affects processes leading to differentiation of the embryo into TE and ICM lineages is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2620166652,"Pitch discrimination is important for language or music processing. Previous studies indicate that auditory perception depends on pre-target neural activity. However, so far the pre-target electrophysiological conditions which enable the detection of small pitch changes are not well studied, but might yield important insights into pitch-processing. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging to reveal the pre-target effects of successful auditory detection of small pitch deviations from a sequence of standard tones. Participants heard a sequence of four pure tones and had to determine whether the last target tone was different or identical to the first three standard sounds. We found that successful pitch change detection could be predicted from the amplitude of theta (4–8 Hz) oscillatory activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as well as beta (12–30 Hz) oscillatory activity in the right auditory cortex. These findings confirm and extend evidence for the involvement of theta as well as beta-band activity in auditory perception."
https://openalex.org/W2619325023,"High-potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP) is a soluble electron carrier protein of photosynthetic bacteria with an Fe4S4 cluster. Although structural changes accompanying the electron transfer are important for understanding of the functional mechanism, the changes have not been clarified in sufficient detail. We previously reported the high-resolution crystal structures of HiPIP from a thermophilic purple bacterium Thermochromatium tepidum in the reduced state. In order to perform a detailed comparison between the structures in different redox states, the oxidized structure should also be revealed at high resolution. Therefore, in the present study we performed a crystallographic analysis of oxidized HiPIP and a structural comparison with the reduced form at a high resolution of 0.8 Å. The comparison highlighted small but significant contraction in the iron-sulfur cluster. The changes in Fe-S bond lengths were similar to that predicted by theoretical calculation, although some discrepancies were also found. Almost distances between the sulfur atoms of the iron-sulfur cluster and the protein environment are elongated upon the oxidation. Positional changes of hydrogen atoms in the protein environment, such as on the amide-hydrogen of Cys75 in the proximity of the iron-sulfur cluster, were also observed in the accurate analyses. None of the water molecules exhibited significant changes in position or anisotropy of atomic displacement parameter between the two states, while the orientations of some water molecules were different."
https://openalex.org/W2620360530,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequent and serious complication of atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). We aimed to develop a simple accurate model to predict the risk of renal dysfunction in aHUS based on clinical and biological features available at hospital admission. Renal function at 1-year follow-up, based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60mL/min/1.73m2 as assessed by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, was used as an indicator of significant CKD. Prospectively collected data from a cohort of 156 aHUS patients who did not receive eculizumab were used to identify predictors of CKD. Covariates associated with renal impairment were identified by multivariate analysis. The model performance was assessed and a scoring system for clinical practice was constructed from the regression coefficient. Multivariate analyses identified three predictors of CKD: a high serum creatinine level, a high mean arterial pressure and a mildly decreased platelet count. The prognostic model had a good discriminative ability (area under the curve = .84). The scoring system ranged from 0 to 5, with corresponding risks of CKD ranging from 18% to 100%. This model accurately predicts development of 1-year CKD in patients with aHUS using clinical and biological features available on admission. After further validation, this model may assist in clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2604122043,"This research assessed event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited during the processing of different kinds of visual stimuli among children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (n = 15) and typically developing (TD) children (n = 19). Within a simple visual oddball paradigm, participating children passively viewed fruit and vegetable images that were used as standard stimuli in addition to images of these foods with their usual colors modified to create novel stimuli and cartoon depictions of these images (i.e., “deviant” stimuli). Analyses revealed significant main effect differences between the groups for P100, N100 and P300 components; ASD group children showing longer P100 latencies, weaker N100 amplitudes and larger P300 amplitudes than did the TD group. A Group x Hemisphere interaction also emerged for N400 amplitudes but differences were not significant in simple-effects analyses. Together these results suggested children with ASD may be characterized by lower attention resource allocation and engagement during early stages of processing visual stimuli. However, ERPs in later processing stages suggested children with ASD and TD children have similar neural responses in attending to visual images as stimulus presentations continue."
https://openalex.org/W2618701601,"Introduction Though still high, the infant mortality rate in Guinea-Bissau has declined. We aimed to identify risk factors including vaccination coverage, for infant mortality in the rural population of Guinea-Bissau and assess whether these risk factors changed from 1992–3 to 2002–3. Methods The Bandim Health Project (BHP) continuously surveys children in rural Guinea-Bissau. We investigated the association between maternal and infant factors (especially DTP and measles coverage) and infant mortality. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox regression. We tested for interactions with sex, age groups (defined by current vaccination schedule) and cohort to assess whether the risk factors were the same for boys and girls, in different age groups in 1992–3 and in 2002–3. Results The infant mortality rate declined from 148/1000 person years (PYRS) in 1992–3 to 124/1000 PYRS in 2002–3 (HR = 0.88;95%CI:0.77–0.99); this decline was significant for girls (0.77;0.64–0.94) but not for boys (0.97;0.82–1.15) (p = 0.10 for interaction). Risk factors did not differ significantly by cohort in either distribution or effect. Mortality decline was most marked among girls aged 9–11 months (0.56;0.37–0.83). There was no significant mortality decline for girls 1.5–8 months of age (0.93;0.68–1.28) (p = 0.05 for interaction). DTP and measles coverage increased from 1992–3 to 2002–3. Conclusions Risk factors did not change with the decline in mortality. Due to beneficial non-specific effects for girls, the increased coverage of measles vaccination may have contributed to the disproportional decline in mortality by sex and age group."
https://openalex.org/W2618932953,"Cerato-platanin (CP) is a non-catalytic, cysteine-rich protein, the first member of the cerato-platanin family. It is a single-domain protein with a double Ψ/β barrel domain resembling the D1 domain of plant and bacterial expansins. Similarly to expansins, CP shows a cell wall-loosening activity on cellulose and can be defined as an expanisin-like protein, in spite of the missing D2 domain, normally present in plant expansins. The weakening activity shown on cellulose may facilitate the CP-host interaction, corroborating the role of CP in eliciting plant defence response. Indeed, CP is an elicitor of primary defences acting as a Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMP). So far, structure-function relationship study has been mainly performed on the bacterial BsEXLX1 expansin, probably due to difficulties in expressing plant expansins in heterologous systems. Here, we report a subcloning and purification method of CP in the engineered E. coli SHuffle cells, which proved to be suitable to obtain the properly folded and biologically active protein. The method also enabled the production of the mutant D77A, rationally designed to be inactive. The wild-type and the mutated CP were characterized for cellulose weakening activity and for PAMP activity (i.e. induction of Reactive Oxygen Species synthesis and phytoalexins production). Our analysis reveals that the carboxyl group of D77 is crucial for expansin-like and PAMP activities, thus permitting to establish a correlation between the ability to weaken cellulose and the capacity to induce defence responses in plants. Our results enable the structural and functional characterization of a mono-domain eukaryotic expansin and identify the essential role of a specific aspartic residue in cellulose weakening."
https://openalex.org/W2619444765,"Stable isotope analysis is an important tool for characterising food web structure; however, interpretation of isotope data can often be flawed. For instance, lipid normalisation and trophic fractionation values are often assumed to be constant, but can vary considerably between ecosystems, species and tissues. Here, previously determined lipid normalisation equations and trophic fractionation values were re-evaluated using freshwater fish species from three rivers in the Upper Zambezian floodplain ecoregion in southern Africa. The parameters commonly used in lipid normalisation equations were not correct for the 18 model species (new D and I parameters were estimated as D = 4.46‰ [95% CI: 2.62, 4.85] and constant I = 0 [95% CI: 0, 0.17]). We suggest that future isotopic analyses on freshwater fishes use our new values if the species under consideration do not have a high lipid content in their white muscle tissue. Nitrogen fractionation values varied between species and river basin; however, the average value closely matched that calculated in previous studies on other species (δ15N fractionation factor of 3.37 ± 1.30 ‰). Here we have highlighted the need to treat stable isotope data correctly in food web studies to avoid misinterpretation of the data."
https://openalex.org/W2617074166,"Objective Atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequently detected after ischemic stroke for the first time, and brain regions involved in autonomic control have been suspected to trigger AF. We examined whether specific brain regions are associated with newly detected AF after ischemic stroke. Methods Patients with acute cerebral infarctions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were included in this lesion mapping study. Lesions were mapped and modeled voxelwise using Bayesian Spatial Generalised Linear Mixed Modeling to determine differences in infarct locations between stroke patients with new AF, without AF and with AF already known before the stroke. Results 582 patients were included (median age 68 years; 63.2% male). AF was present in 109/582 patients [(18.7%); new AF: 39/109 (35.8%), known AF: 70/109 (64.2%)]. AF patients had larger infarct volumes than patients without AF (mean: 29.7 ± 45.8 ml vs. 15.2 ± 35.1 ml; p<0.001). Lesions in AF patients accumulated in the right central middle cerebral artery territory. Increasing stroke size predicted progressive cortical but not pontine and thalamic involvement. Patients with new AF had more frequently lesions in the right insula compared to patients without AF when stroke size was not accounted for, but no specific brain region was more frequently involved after adjustment for infarct volume. Controlled for stroke size, left parietal involvement was less likely for patients with new AF than for those without AF or with known AF. Conclusions In the search for brain areas potentially triggering cardiac arrhythmias infarct size should be accounted for. After controlling for infarct size, there is currently no evidence that ischemic stroke lesions of specific brain areas are associated with new AF compared to patients without AF. This challenges the neurogenic hypothesis of AF according to which a relevant proportion of new AF is triggered by ischemic brain lesions of particular locations."
https://openalex.org/W2617705793,"Modulation of the redox system in cancer cells has been considered a promising target for anti-cancer therapy. The novel MTH1 inhibitor TH588 proved tremendous potential in terms of cancer cell eradication, yet its specificity has been questioned by recent reports, indicating that TH588 may also induce cancer cell death by alternative mechanisms than MTH1 inhibition. Here we used a panel of heterogeneous neuroendocrine tumor cells in order to assess cellular mechanisms and molecular signaling pathways implicated in the effects of TH588 alone as well as dual-targeting approaches combining TH588 with everolimus, cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil or γ-irradiation. Our results reflect that TH588 alone efficiently decreased the survival of neuroendocrine cancer cells by PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis downregulation, increased apoptosis and oxidative stress. However, in the dual-targeting approaches cell survival was further decreased due to an even stronger downregulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis and augmentation of apoptosis but not oxidative stress. Furthermore, we could attribute TH588 chemo- and radio-sensitizing properties. Collectively our data not only provide insights into how TH588 exactly kills cancer cells but also depict novel perspectives for combinatorial treatment approaches encompassing TH588."

We then made daily, in-person attempts to enroll eligible families during a time-varying 2-hour enrollment period until families declined participation, consented, or were no longer eligible.The primary outcome was the proportion of eligible patients for whom ≥1 family member was enrolled. Secondary outcomes included enrollment of legal healthcare proxies, the consent rate among families approached for enrollment, and success rates for recruiting at different times during the day and week. Among 284 eligible patients, 108 (38%, 95% CI 32%-44%) had ≥1 family member enrolled, and 75 (26%, 95% CI 21%-32%) had their legal healthcare proxy enrolled. Among 117 family members asked to participate, 108 (92%, 95% CI 86%-96%) were enrolled. Patients with versus without an enrolled proxy were more likely to be white (44% vs. 30%, P = .02), live in a zip code with a median income of ≥$100,000 (15% vs. 5%, P = .01), be mechanically ventilated (63% vs. 47%, P = .01), die in the ICU (19% vs. 9%, P = .03), and to have longer ICU stays (median 5.0 vs. 1.8 days, P<.001).

https://openalex.org/W2619800738,"Sponges have a high capacity for regeneration and this process improves biomass production in some species, thus contributing to a solution for the biomass supply problem for biotechnological applications. The aim of this work is to characterize the dynamics of cell behavior during the initial stages of sponge regeneration, using bright-field microscopy, confocal microscopy and SEM. We focused on the first 20 h of regeneration, during which blastema formation and epithelium initialization occur. An innovative sponge organotypic culture of the regenerating internal region is described and investigated by confocal microscopy, cell transplantation and vital staining. Cell-cell interaction and cell density are shown to affect events in morphogenesis such as epithelial/mesenchymal and mesenchymal/epithelial transitions as well as distinct cell movements required for regeneration. Extracellular matrix was organized according to the morphogenetic process observed, with evidence for cell-signaling instructions and remodeling. These data and the method of organotypic culture described here provide support for the development of viable sponge biomass production."
https://openalex.org/W2619822881,"Previous studies have shown that Zika virus can infect and be transmitted by A. albopictus. The World Health organization (WHO) has raised concerns of autochthonous transmission of the virus in regions where the vector is endemic. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the occurrence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in western Austria (Tyrol) especially after a history of travel to A. albopictus endemic regions.The study participants were healthy blood donors at randomly selected donation sites in the west Austrian region Tyrol. Rest blood (plasma) samples were tested for the presence of ZIKV nucleic acid and antibodies against the virus.Mean age of the study participants was 44.6 (SD = 12.9) and 58.8% were men. Eighty percent reported to have received vaccine against TBEV, whereas only 4.9 and 0.9% had received YFV and JEV vaccines. Three out of 1001 (0.03%) participants tested positive solely for ZIKV IgM antibody but not for other flaviviruses. Only one individual had ZIKV IgG antibody. All four donors were negative in the neutralization (confirmation) assay. No viral RNA was detected in any of the samples.The null finding of our study refutes WHO's initial fear of global expansion of ZIKV infection including its occurrence in Europe. There appears to be no urgent need to introduce universal screening of donated blood for ZIKV in central Europe at least until the next warm season. Further, Euroimmun anti-Zika ELISA proved to be a highly suitable and reliable test system in populations with high prevalence of TBEV infection and/or immunization."
https://openalex.org/W2620042101,"GPR40 (FFA1) is a fatty acid receptor whose activation results in potent glucose lowering and insulinotropic effects in vivo. Several reports illustrate that GPR40 agonists exert glucose lowering in diabetic humans. To assess the mechanisms by which GPR40 partial agonists improve glucose homeostasis, we evaluated the effects of MK-2305, a potent and selective partial GPR40 agonist, in diabetic Goto Kakizaki rats. MK-2305 decreased fasting glucose after acute and chronic treatment. MK-2305-mediated changes in glucose were coupled with increases in plasma insulin during hyperglycemia and glucose challenges but not during fasting, when glucose was normalized. To determine the mechanism(s) mediating these changes in glucose metabolism, we measured the absolute contribution of precursors to glucose production in the presence or absence of MK-2305. MK-2305 treatment resulted in decreased endogenous glucose production (EGP) driven primarily through changes in gluconeogenesis from substrates entering at the TCA cycle. The decrease in EGP was not likely due to a direct effect on the liver, as isolated perfused liver studies showed no effect of MK-2305 ex vivo and GPR40 is not expressed in the liver. Taken together, our results suggest MK-2305 treatment increases glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), resulting in changes to hepatic substrate handling that improve glucose homeostasis in the diabetic state. Importantly, these data extend our understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which GPR40 partial agonists reduce hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2617155613,"Chromatin looseness, which can be analyzed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) using eGFP-tagged core histone proteins, is an important index of the differentiation potential of blastomere cells and embryonic stem cells. Whether chromatin looseness is a reliable index of the developmental potential of embryos during ontogenesis is not known. As a necessary first step toward answering this question, we investigated whether FRAP-analyzed embryos are capable of normal preimplantation and full-term development. All tested concentrations (50, 100, and 250 ng/μL) of microinjected eGFP-H2B mRNA were sufficient for detecting differences in chromatin looseness between male and female pronuclei. After FRAP analysis, most of the zygotes developed into blastocysts. Importantly, a considerable number of offspring developed from the FRAP analyzed zygotes (32/78; 41.0%) and grew into healthy adults. The offspring of zygotes injected with 250 ng/μL of eGFP-H2B mRNA and bleached using 110 μW laser power for 5 s were not genetically modified. Interestingly, bleaching using a 3-fold stronger laser intensity for a 6-fold longer time did not cause toxicity during preimplantation development, indicating that bleaching did not critically affect preimplantation development. Finally, we confirmed that similar results were obtained using two different types of confocal laser-scanning microscopes. This FRAP protocol would be useful for investigating the association between chromatin looseness and development."
https://openalex.org/W2617774209,"A model Post-Termination Complex (PoTC) used for the discovery of Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF) was purified and characterized by cryo-electron microscopic analysis and biochemical methods. We established that the model PoTC has mostly one tRNA, at the P/E or P/P position, together with one mRNA. The structural studies were supported by the biochemical measurement of bound tRNA and mRNA. Using this substrate, we establish that the release of tRNA, release of mRNA and splitting of ribosomal subunits occur during the recycling reaction. Order of these events is tRNA release first followed by mRNA release and splitting almost simultaneously. Moreover, we demonstrate that IF3 is not involved in any of the recycling reactions but simply prevents the re-association of split ribosomal subunits. Our finding demonstrates that the important function of RRF includes the release of mRNA, which is often missed by the use of a short ORF with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence near the termination site."
https://openalex.org/W2617254034,"Immunological tolerance between fetal allograft and mother is crucial for pregnancy establishment and maintenance; however, these mechanisms particularly those during the latter part of pregnancy have not been definitively elucidated. The aim of this study was to examine the presence and potential function of innate immunity characteristic to the middle to late pregnancy. We first characterized up-regulated proteins in decidua from day 11 pregnant (P11) mice using 2D-PAGE, followed by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. These analyses identified increased complement component 3 (C3) and its derivatives in P11 decidua. We then found that in the decidual tissues, C3 mRNA increased on P15 and remained high on P19. C3 is converted to C3b and then iC3b by complement component factor I (Cfi) and complement receptor 1-like protein (Crry), both of which were present in P19 placentas. In addition, iC3b proteins and its receptor CR3 (Cd11b/Cd18) in decidual and placental tissues increased toward the latter phase of pregnancy. Moreover, CR3 subunit CD11b protein was predominantly localized to spongiotrophoblast layer in the P19 placenta. Because iC3b is known to induce anti-inflammatory cytokine production, the analysis was extended to examine changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Il12, Il10, and Tgfb1. Il12 expression decreased in P15 and P19 placenta, while high mRNA expression of Il10 and Tgfb1 was found in P19 placental tissues. Furthermore, placental Il10 and Tgfb1 mRNAs were down-regulated when pregnant mice were treated with an anti-C3 antibody, detecting C3, C3b and iC3b. These results indicated that C3 derivatives, in particular, iC3b and its receptor CR3 were up-regulated at the fetal-maternal interface, and suggest that iC3b may regulate the placental expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL10 and TGFB1, during the latter phase of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2619990730,"Computational models have gained popularity as a predictive tool for assessing proposed policy changes affecting dietary choice. Specifically, they have been used for modeling dietary changes in response to economic interventions, such as price and income changes. Herein, we present a novel addition to this type of model by incorporating habitual behaviors that drive individuals to maintain or conform to prior eating patterns. We examine our method in a simulated case study of food choice behaviors of low-income adults in the US. We use data from several national datasets, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the USDA, to parameterize our model and develop predictive capabilities in 1) quantifying the influence of prior diet preferences when food budgets are increased and 2) simulating the income elasticities of demand for four food categories. Food budgets can increase because of greater affordability (due to food aid and other nutritional assistance programs), or because of higher income. Our model predictions indicate that low-income adults consume unhealthy diets when they have highly constrained budgets, but that even after budget constraints are relaxed, these unhealthy eating behaviors are maintained. Specifically, diets in this population, before and after changes in food budgets, are characterized by relatively low consumption of fruits and vegetables and high consumption of fat. The model results for income elasticities also show almost no change in consumption of fruit and fat in response to changes in income, which is in agreement with data from the World Bank’s International Comparison Program (ICP). Hence, the proposed method can be used in assessing the influences of habitual dietary patterns on the effectiveness of food policies."

Using Kleinman’s eight prompting questions the study synthesizes explanatory models from patients to describe common illness experiences of diabetes in a rural setting where malaria is the predominant health threat. Methods We conducted 17 focus group discussions with adult members of the general community, diabetes patients, neighbours and relatives of diabetes patients to gain insight into shared experiences. To gain in-depth understanding of the individual illness experiences, we conducted 41 in-depth interviews with malaria or diabetes patients and family members of diabetes patients. The analysis followed grounded theory principles and the illness experiences were derived from the emerging themes. Results The illness experiences showed that malaria and diabetes are both perceived to be severe and fatal conditions, but over the years people have learned to live with malaria and the condition is relatively manageable compared with diabetes. In contrast, diabetes was perceived as a relatively new disease, with serious life-long consequences. Uncertainty, fear of those consequences, and the increased risk for severe malaria and other illnesses impacted diabetes patients and their families’ illness experiences. Unpredictable ailments and loss of consciousness, memory, libido, and functional incapability were common problems reported by diabetes patients. These problems had an effect on their psychological and emotional health and limited their social life. Direct and indirect costs of illness pushed individuals and their families further into poverty and were more pronounced for diabetes patients. Conclusion The illness experiences revealed both malaria and diabetes as distressing conditions, however, diabetes showed a higher level of stress because of its chronicity. Strategies for supporting social, emotional, and psychological well-being that build on the patient accounts are likely to improve illness experiences and quality of life for the chronically ill patient."
https://openalex.org/W2619019479,"L-Lactate (LL) is an essential cellular metabolite which can be used to generate energy. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that LL is used for inter-cellular signalling. Some LL-sensitive receptors have been identified but we recently proposed that there may be yet another unknown G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) sensitive to LL in the brain. Olfactory receptors (ORs) represent the largest family of GPCRs and some of them are expressed outside the olfactory system, including brain, making them interesting candidates for non-olfactory LL signalling. One of the “ectopically” expressed ORs, Olfr78 in mice (Olr59 in rats and OR51E2 in humans), reportedly can be activated by LL. This implies that both rodents and humans should be able to detect the LL odour. Surprisingly, this has never been demonstrated. Here we show that mice can detect the odour of LL in odour detection and habituation-dishabituation tasks, and discriminate it from peppermint and vanilla odours. Behaviour of the Olfr78 null mice and wildtype mice in odour detection task was not different, indicating that rodents are equipped with more than one LL-sensitive OR. Rats were also able to use the smell of LL as a cue in an odour-reward associative learning task. When presented to humans, more than 90% of participants detected a smell of LL in solution. Interestingly, LL was perceived differently than acetate or propionate—LL was preferentially reported as a pleasant sweet scent while acetate and propionate were perceived as repulsive sour/acid smells. Subjective perception of LL smell was different in men and women. Taken together, our data demonstrate that both rodents and humans are able to detect the odour of LL. Moreover, in mice, LL perception is not purely mediated by Olfr78. Discovery of further LL-sensitive OR might shed the light on their contribution to LL signalling in the body."
https://openalex.org/W2620061206,"Escherichia coli RNase E (Eco-RNase E), encoded by rne (Eco-rne), is considered the global RNA decay initiator. Although Eco-RNase E is an essential gene product in E. coli, some bacterial species, such as Bacillus subtilis, do not possess Eco-RNase E sequence homologues. B. subtilis instead possesses RNase J1/J2 (Bsu-RNase J1/J2) and RNase Y (Bsu-RNase Y) to execute RNA decay. Here we found that E. coli lacking the Eco-rne gene (Δrne E. coli) was viable conditional on M9 minimal media by introducing Bsu-RNase J1/J2 or Bsu-RNase Y. We also cloned an extremely short Eco-RNase E homologue (Wpi-RNase E) and a canonical sized Bsu-RNase J1/J2 homologue (Wpi-RNase J) from Wolbachia pipientis, an α-proteobacterial endosymbiont of arthropods. We found that Wpi-RNase J restored the colony-forming ability (CFA) of Δrne E. coli, whereas Wpi-RNase E did not. Unexpectedly, Wpi-RNase E restored defective CFA due to lack of Eco-RNase G, a paralogue of Eco-RNase E. Our results indicate that bacterial species that lack Eco-RNase E homologues or bacterial species that possess Eco-RNase E homologues which lack Eco-RNase E-like activities have a modest Eco-RNase E-like function using RNase J and/or RNase Y. These results suggest that Eco-RNase E-like activities might distribute among a wide array of bacteria and that functions of RNases may have changed dynamically during evolutionary divergence of bacterial lineages."

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 285 patients attending sexually transmitted diseases and inner-city clinics to evaluate the prevalence, body site colonisation and risk factors associated with carriage of methicillin susceptible SA (MSSA). All isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec, staphylococcal protein A and multilocus sequence typing. Results The prevalence of colonisation with SA was 57.5% (164/285); 162 (56.8%) participants were colonized with MSSA, and 4 (1.4%) with methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA), 2 of them were co-colonised with both MRSA and MSSA. The most common sites of colonisation were the throat (73.1%), nares (65.2%) and interdigital web spaces of the hand (21.3%). Three out of 4 MRSA isolates were USA300-MRSA strains. Twelve MSSA isolates were closely related to the USA300 CA-MRSA. We identified sexual behaviours such as having more than 6 heterosexual sexual partners in the last 6 months and trimming pubic hair to be independently associated with MSSA colonisation, and more specifically practicing oral sex as a risk factor for throat colonisation. Conclusion There is a high prevalence of MSSA carriage in this population, with a low prevalence of MRSA. The throat was the most common site of carriage and sexual behaviours were found to be risk factors for MSSA colonisation. Close strain relatedness of MSSA and USA300-MRSA isolates suggests either gain or loss of the SCCmec element, respectively."

Furthermore, we aimed to compare the immunoreactive and bioactive leptin levels associations with parameters of insulin resistance and insulin secretion in obese children and adolescents.We measured bioactive and immunoreactive leptin levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in fasting serum samples of 70 children with severe (BMI SDS >3) non-syndromic obesity with onset <3 years of life from our Leipzig childhood obesity cohort (n = 1204). Sanger sequencing of the leptin gene was performed in probands with proportion of bioactive/immunoreactive leptin <90%.The mean levels of bioactive and immunoreactive leptin were almost identical (41.1±25.2 vs. 41.1±25.4ng/mL). In three probands with the lowest bioactive leptin proportion (<90%) we did not identify mutations in the leptin gene. Compared to immunoreactive leptin, bioactive leptin showed similar and slightly better statistical associations with indices of insulin resistance in correlation and multivariate analyses.In our sample selected for severe early onset childhood obesity, we did not identify leptin gene mutations leading to decreased proportion of bioactive leptin. Nevertheless, the bioactive leptin levels were stronger associated with selected insulin secretion/resistance indices than the immunoreactive leptin levels."

Clinicopathologic characteristics, endoscopic features and long-term outcomes were analyzed.Of 1,509 patients, 236 (15.6%) were included in the ex-adenoma group. Mean age (P = 0.003) and Helicobacter pylori infection rate (P = 0.040) were significantly higher in the ex-adenoma than in the de novo group. Mean endoscopic size was significantly larger, elevated lesions were more prevalent (both P < 0.001), and carcinomas were more differentiated in the ex-adenoma group than in the de novo group (P = 0.037). The degree of atrophy (P = 0.025) or intestinal metaplasia (P < 0.001) was more advanced in the ex-adenoma group. Synchronous gastric neoplasia was significantly more prevalent in the ex-adenoma group (P < 0.001), whereas metachronous cancer recurrence rate was not significantly different between the two groups.EGCs with pre-existing adenoma show a greater association with H. pylori-related chronic inflammation than those without, which could explain the differences in the characteristics between groups. Potential differences in carcinogenic mechanisms between the groups were explored."
https://openalex.org/W2618728484,"The performance of complex polyrhythms-rhythms where the left and right hand move at different rates-is usually the province of highly trained individuals. However, studies in which hand movement is guided haptically show that even novices can perform polyrhythms with no or only brief training. In this study, we investigated whether novices are able to tap with one hand by matching different rates of a metronome while sawing with the other hand. This experiment was based on the assumption that saw movement is controlled consistently at a predictable rate without the need for paying primary attention to it. It would follow that consciously matching different stipulated metronome rates with the other hand would result in the spontaneous performance of polyrhythms. Six experimental conditions were randomised: single handed tapping and sawing as well as four bimanual conditions with expected ratios of 1:1 (performed with and without matching a metronome) as well as 3:4 and 4:3 (performed matching a metronome). Results showed that participants executed the saw movement at a consistent cycle duration of 0.44 [0.20] s to 0.51 [0.19] s across single and bimanual conditions, with no significant effect of the condition on the cycle duration (p = 0.315). Similarly, free tapping was executed at a cycle duration of 0.48 [0.22] s. In the bimanual conditions, we found that for a ratio of 4:3 (4 taps against 3 sawing cycles per measure), the observed and predicted ratio of 0.75 were not significantly different (p = 0.369), supporting our hypothesis of the spontaneous adoption of polyrhythms. However, for a ratio of 3:4 (3 taps against 4 sawing cycles per measure), the observed and predicted ratio differed (p = 0.016), with a trend towards synchronisation. Our findings show that bimanual independence when performing complex polyrhythms can in principle be achieved if the movement of one hand can be performed without paying much-if any-attention to it. In this paradigm, small rhythmic arm movements are possibly driven by an intrinsic timing which leads to spontaneous convergence on a cycle duration of around 0.5 s, while the movement of the other hand can be controlled consciously to occur at desired rates."
https://openalex.org/W2617880195,"Alternative splicing is an ubiquitous phenomenon in most human genes and has important functions. The switch-like exon is the type of exon that has a high level of usage in some tissues, but has a low level of usage in the other tissues. They usually undergo strong tissue-specific regulations. There is still a lack a systematic method to identify switch-like exons from multiple RNA-seq samples. We proposed a novel method called iterative Tertile Absolute Deviation around the mode (iTAD) to profile the distribution of exon relative usages among multiple samples and to identify switch-like exons and other types of exons using a robust statistic estimator. We validated the method with simulation data, and applied it on RNA-seq data of 16 human body tissues and detected 3,100 switch-like exons. We found that switch-like exons tend to be more associated with Alu elements in their flanking intron regions than other types of exons."
https://openalex.org/W2297230323,"Flood front is the jump interface where fluids distribute discontinuously, whose interface condition is the theoretical basis of a mathematical model of the multiphase flow in porous medium. The conventional interface condition at the jump interface is expressed as the continuous Darcy velocity and fluid pressure (named CVCM ). Our study has inspected this conclusions. First, it is revealed that the principle of mass conservation has no direct relation to the velocity conservation, and the former is not the true foundation of the later, because the former only reflects the kinetic characteristic of the fluid particles at one position(the interface), but not the neighborhood of the interface which required by the later. Then the reasonableness of CVCM is queried from the following three aspects:(1)Using Mukat's two phase seepage equation and the mathematical method of apagoge, we have disproved the continuity of each fluid velocity;(2)Since the analytical solution of the equation of Buckley-Leveret equations is acquirable, its velocity jumps at the flood front presents an appropriate example to disprove the CVCM;(3) The numerical simulation model gives impractical result that flood front would stop moving if CVCM were used to calculate the velocities at the interface between two gridcells. Subsequently, a new one, termed as Jump Velocity Condition Model (JVCM), is deduced from Muskat's two phase seepage equations and Darcy's law without taking account of the capillary force and compressibility of rocks and fluids. Finally, several cases are presented. And the comparisons of the velocity, pressure difference and the front position, which are given by JVCM, CVCM and SPU, have shown that the result of JVCM is the closest to the exact solution."
