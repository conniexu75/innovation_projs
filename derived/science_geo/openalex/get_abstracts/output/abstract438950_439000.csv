https://openalex.org/W2056707942,"Active materials are hierarchically assembled, starting from extensile microtubule bundles, to form emulsions with unexpected collective biomimetic properties such as autonomous motility. Autonomous motion is a characteristic of living organisms; by consuming energy, cells and their components can generate motion without the need for externally applied force. This paper reports the creation of polymer gels, liquid crystals and emulsions that mimic this behaviour using biological molecules as building blocks. The authors assemble microtubules into hierarchical bundles and then into percolating networks. In the presence of ATP as the chemical energy source and the molecular motor protein kinesin, spatiotemporally chaotic flows are generated by creating hydrodynamic instabilities and enhanced fluid transport. When confined to the surface of emulsion droplets, the microtubule networks form two-dimensional active liquid crystals that impart autonomous motility to the emulsion droplets. This work raises the exciting possibility that chaotic behaviour of this type could be engineered to be tunable and controllable. With remarkable precision and reproducibility, cells orchestrate the cooperative action of thousands of nanometre-sized molecular motors to carry out mechanical tasks at much larger length scales, such as cell motility, division and replication1. Besides their biological importance, such inherently non-equilibrium processes suggest approaches for developing biomimetic active materials from microscopic components that consume energy to generate continuous motion2,3,4. Being actively driven, these materials are not constrained by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics and can thus exhibit sought-after properties such as autonomous motility, internally generated flows and self-organized beating5,6,7. Here, starting from extensile microtubule bundles, we hierarchically assemble far-from-equilibrium analogues of conventional polymer gels, liquid crystals and emulsions. At high enough concentration, the microtubules form a percolating active network characterized by internally driven chaotic flows, hydrodynamic instabilities, enhanced transport and fluid mixing. When confined to emulsion droplets, three-dimensional networks spontaneously adsorb onto the droplet surfaces to produce highly active two-dimensional nematic liquid crystals whose streaming flows are controlled by internally generated fractures and self-healing, as well as unbinding and annihilation of oppositely charged disclination defects. The resulting active emulsions exhibit unexpected properties, such as autonomous motility, which are not observed in their passive analogues. Taken together, these observations exemplify how assemblages of animate microscopic objects exhibit collective biomimetic properties that are very different from those found in materials assembled from inanimate building blocks, challenging us to develop a theoretical framework that would allow for a systematic engineering of their far-from-equilibrium material properties."

https://openalex.org/W2063261544,"Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells, characterized by expression of the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), maintain immune homeostasis by suppressing self-destructive immune responses. Foxp3 operates as a late-acting differentiation factor controlling T(reg) cell homeostasis and function, whereas the early T(reg)-cell-lineage commitment is regulated by the Akt kinase and the forkhead box O (Foxo) family of transcription factors. However, whether Foxo proteins act beyond the T(reg)-cell-commitment stage to control T(reg) cell homeostasis and function remains largely unexplored. Here we show that Foxo1 is a pivotal regulator of T(reg )cell function. T(reg) cells express high amounts of Foxo1 and display reduced T-cell-receptor-induced Akt activation, Foxo1 phosphorylation and Foxo1 nuclear exclusion. Mice with T(reg)-cell-specific deletion of Foxo1 develop a fatal inflammatory disorder similar in severity to that seen in Foxp3-deficient mice, but without the loss of T(reg) cells. Genome-wide analysis of Foxo1 binding sites reveals ~300 Foxo1-bound target genes, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine Ifng, that do not seem to be directly regulated by Foxp3. These findings show that the evolutionarily ancient Akt-Foxo1 signalling module controls a novel genetic program indispensable for T(reg) cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1994125144,"The sessile tunicate Ciona intestinalis possesses a lineage of cells, originating at the margin of the neural plate, that express several neural crest specification genes and can be reprogrammed into migrating ectomesenchyme by the targeted misexpression of Twist. Many of the characteristics that make vertebrates so different from other animals relate to the head, with its distinct cranium and specialized eyes and ears. The form of the head is in large part specified by neural crest cells which arise from the neural plate, the region of the embryo that forms the central nervous system, and migrate through the body to contribute to a variety of tissues. The origin of the neural crest has been a mystery. This study shows that a distant relative of vertebrates, the solitary sea squirt Ciona intestinalis, has a lineage of cells originating at the margin of the neural plate. These cells express several neural crest specification genes, but lack some of the defining properties of neural crest, such as long-range migration. However, targeted misexpression of the regulatory gene Twist is sufficient to induce some of these properties. The results suggest that much of the neural crest gene network predated the divergence of tunicates and vertebrates, and that the co-option of mesenchyme determinants, such as Twist, into the neural plate ectoderm was crucial for the emergence of the vertebrate 'new head'. Neural crest arises at the neural plate border, expresses a core set of regulatory genes and produces a diverse array of cell types, including ectomesenchyme derivatives that elaborate the vertebrate head1,2. The evolution of neural crest has been proposed to be a key event leading to the appearance of new cell types that fostered the transition from filter feeding to active predation in ancestral vertebrates3. However, the origin of neural crest remains controversial, as homologous cell types have not been unambiguously identified in non-vertebrate chordates1,4. Here we show that the tunicate Ciona intestinalis possesses a cephalic melanocyte lineage (a9.49) similar to neural crest that can be reprogrammed into migrating ‘ectomesenchyme’ by the targeted misexpression of Twist (also known as twist-like 2). Our results suggest that the neural crest melanocyte regulatory network pre-dated the divergence of tunicates and vertebrates. We propose that the co-option of mesenchyme determinants, such as Twist, into the neural plate ectoderm was crucial to the emergence of the vertebrate ‘new head’3."
https://openalex.org/W2122077421,"A combination of structural, computational and biophysical tools is used to characterize the bond between tip-link proteins protocadherin 15 and cadherin 23, which have an essential role in inner-ear mechanotransduction; the bond, involving an extended protein handshake, is found to be affected by deafness mutations and is mechanically strong enough to resist forces in hair cells, adding to our understanding of hair-cell sensory transduction and interactions among cadherins. Hair cells in the inner ear transform mechanical stimuli into electrical signals that are crucial for hearing and balance. These cells contain actin-rich stereocilia that are interconnected by filaments such as the tip link, which forms the mechanotransduction apparatus. The adhesion molecules protocadherin 15 and cadherin 23 form the tip link. In this study, David Corey et al. use a combination of structural and biophysical experiments to characterize the bond between cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15. The bond is mechanically strong enough to resist forces in hair cells and requires calcium to maintain stability. These results provide molecular insights into the mechanics of hair-cell sensory transduction. Hearing and balance use hair cells in the inner ear to transform mechanical stimuli into electrical signals1. Mechanical force from sound waves or head movements is conveyed to hair-cell transduction channels by tip links2,3, fine filaments formed by two atypical cadherins known as protocadherin 15 and cadherin 23 (refs 4, 5). These two proteins are involved in inherited deafness6,7,8,9,10 and feature long extracellular domains that interact tip-to-tip5,11 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. However, the molecular architecture of this complex is unknown. Here we combine crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations and binding experiments to characterize the protocadherin 15–cadherin 23 bond. We find a unique cadherin interaction mechanism, in which the two most amino-terminal cadherin repeats (extracellular cadherin repeats 1 and 2) of each protein interact to form an overlapped, antiparallel heterodimer. Simulations predict that this tip-link bond is mechanically strong enough to resist forces in hair cells. In addition, the complex is shown to become unstable in response to Ca2+ removal owing to increased flexure of Ca2+-free cadherin repeats. Finally, we use structures and biochemical measurements to study the molecular mechanisms by which deafness mutations disrupt tip-link function. Overall, our results shed light on the molecular mechanics of hair-cell sensory transduction and on new interaction mechanisms for cadherins, a large protein family implicated in tissue and organ morphogenesis12,13, neural connectivity14 and cancer15."
https://openalex.org/W2034741116,"Studies of bacteriophage Mu transposition paved the way for understanding retroviral integration and V(D)J recombination as well as many other DNA transposition reactions. Here we report the structure of the Mu transpososome—Mu transposase (MuA) in complex with bacteriophage DNA ends and target DNA—determined from data that extend anisotropically to 5.2 Å, 5.2 Å and 3.7 Å resolution, in conjunction with previously determined structures of individual domains. The highly intertwined structure illustrates why chemical activity depends on formation of the synaptic complex, and reveals that individual domains have different roles when bound to different sites. The structure also provides explanations for the increased stability of the final product complex and for its preferential recognition by the ATP-dependent unfoldase ClpX. Although MuA and many other recombinases share a structurally conserved ‘DDE’ catalytic domain, comparisons among the limited set of available complex structures indicate that some conserved features, such as catalysis in trans and target DNA bending, arose through convergent evolution because they are important for function. The structure of the bacteriophage transposase MuA bound to DNA sequences that mimic both the transposon ends and the target DNA ends is solved; the picture of this synaptic complex illustrates the intricacy of Mu transposition, and exposes the architectural diversity among DDE recombinases in complex with substrate DNAs. DNA sequences known as transposons encode proteins that allow them to insert copies of themselves throughout the genome. The mechanism of transposition has similarities to processes involved in retroviral integration and during immunoglobulin and T-cell-receptor development. Phoebe Rice and colleagues have now solved the structure of a bacteriophage transposase (MuA) bound to DNA sequences that mimic both the transposon ends and the target DNA ends. Images of this synaptic complex show the roles that individual domains of MuA have, and highlight the benefits provided by the intertwined structure."
https://openalex.org/W2059909177,"Although microtubules have long been implicated in cell locomotion, the mechanism of their involvement remains controversial. Most studies have concluded that microtubules play a positive role by regulating actin polymerization, transporting membrane vesicles to the leading edge, and/or facilitating the turnover of adhesion plaques. Here we used wild-type and mutant CHO cell lines with alterations in tubulin to demonstrate that microtubules can also act to restrain cell motility. Tubulin mutations or low concentrations of drugs that suppress microtubule dynamics without affecting the amount of microtubule polymer inhibited the rate of migration by preventing microtubule reorganization in the trailing portion of the cells where the more dynamic microtubules are normally found. Under these conditions, cells along the edge of a wound still extended lamellipodia and elongated toward the wound but were inhibited in their ability to retract their tails, thus retarding forward progress. The idea that microtubules normally act to restrain cell locomotion was confirmed by treating cells with high concentrations of nocodazole to depolymerize the microtubule network. In the absence of microtubules, wild-type CHO and HeLa cells could still move at near normal speeds, but the movement became more random. We conclude that microtubules act both to restrain cell movement and to establish directionality.

https://openalex.org/W1975425183,"Metformin is a leading oral anti-diabetes mellitus medication and is known to stimulate GLUT4 translocation. However, the mechanism by which metformin acts is still largely unknown. Here, we showed that short time treatment with metformin rapidly increased phosphorylation of Cbl in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent fashion in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Metformin also increased phosphorylation of Src in an AMPK-dependent manner. Src inhibition blocked metformin-mediated Cbl phosphorylation, suggesting that metformin stimulates AMPK-Src-Cbl axis pathway. In addition, long term treatment with metformin stimulated the expression of Cbl-associated protein (CAP) mRNA and protein. Long term treatment with metformin stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream molecule c-Jun, which is a critical molecule for CAP transcription. Knockdown of AMPK and JNK blocked metformin-induced expression of CAP, implying that metformin stimulates AMPK-JNK-CAP axis pathway. Moreover, AMPK knockdown attenuated metformin-induced Cbl/CAP multicomplex formation, which is critical for GLUT4 translocation. A colorimetric absorbance assay demonstrated that metformin-induced translocation of GLUT4 was suppressed in CAP or Cbl knockdown cells. Furthermore, the promoter activity of CAP was increased by metformin in an AMPK/JNK-dependent fashion. In summary, these results demonstrate that metformin modulates GLUT4 translocation by regulating Cbl and CAP signals via AMPK."

Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the terminal steps in the de novo biogenesis of fatty acids. In cancer cells, FASN may act as a metabolic oncogene, given that it confers growth and survival advantages to these cells, whereas its inhibition effectively and selectively kills tumor cells. Hormones such as estrogens and growth factors contribute to the transcriptional regulation of FASN expression also through the activation of downstream signaling and a cross-talk among diverse transduction pathways. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that 17β-estradiol (E2) and the selective GPER ligand G-1 regulate FASN expression and activity through the GPER-mediated signaling, which involved the EGF receptor/ERK/c-Fos/AP1 transduction pathway, as ascertained by using specific pharmacological inhibitors, performing gene-silencing experiments and ChIP assays in breast SkBr3, colorectal LoVo, hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cancer cells, and breast cancer-associated fibroblasts. In addition, the proliferative effects induced by E2 and G-1 in these cells involved FASN as the inhibitor of its activity, named cerulenin, abolished the growth response to both ligands. Our data suggest that GPER may be included among the transduction mediators involved by estrogens in regulating FASN expression and activity in cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts that strongly contribute to cancer progression.

https://openalex.org/W2034321751,"Chrysanthemum L. (Asteraceae-Anthemideae) is a genus with rapid speciation. It comprises about 40 species, most of which are distributed in East Asia. Many of these are narrowly distributed and habitat-specific. Considerable variations in morphology and ploidy are found in this genus. Some species have been the subjects of many studies, but the relationships between Chrysanthemum and its allies and the phylogeny of this genus remain poorly understood. In the present study, 32 species/varieties from Chrysanthemum and 11 from the allied genera were analyzed using DNA sequences of the single-copy nuclear CDS gene and seven cpDNA loci (psbA-trnH, trnC-ycf6, ycf6-psbM, trnY-rpoB, rpS4-trnT, trnL-F, and rpL16). The cpDNA and nuclear CDS gene trees both suggest that 1) Chrysanthemum is not a monophyletic taxon, and the affinity between Chrysanthemum and Ajania is so close that these two genera should be incorporated taxonomically; 2) Phaeostigma is more closely related to the Chrysanthemum+Ajania than other generic allies. According to pollen morphology and to the present cpDNA and CDS data, Ajania purpurea is a member of Phaeostigma. Species differentiation in Chrysanthemum appears to be correlated with geographic and environmental conditions. The Chinese Chrysanthemum species can be divided into two groups, the C. zawadskii group and the C. indicum group. The former is distributed in northern China and the latter in southern China. Many polyploid species, such as C. argyrophyllum, may have originated from allopolyploidization involving divergent progenitors. Considering all the evidence from present and previous studies, we conclude that geographic and ecological factors as well as hybridization and polyploidy play important roles in the divergence and speciation of the genus Chrysanthemum."
https://openalex.org/W2024257093,"The timing of flowering is coordinated by a web of gene regulatory networks that integrates developmental and environmental cues in plants. Light and temperature are two major environmental determinants that regulate flowering time. Although prolonged treatment with low nonfreezing temperatures accelerates flowering by stable repression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), repeated brief cold treatments delay flowering. Here, we report that intermittent cold treatments trigger the degradation of CONSTANS (CO), a central activator of photoperiodic flowering; daily treatments caused suppression of the floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and delayed flowering. Cold-induced CO degradation is mediated via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway that involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 1 (HOS1). HOS1-mediated CO degradation occurs independently of the well established cold response pathways. It is also independent of the light signaling repressor CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) E3 ligase and light wavelengths. CO has been shown to play a key role in photoperiodic flowering. Here, we demonstrated that CO served as a molecular hub, integrating photoperiodic and cold stress signals into the flowering genetic pathways. We propose that the HOS1-CO module contributes to the fine-tuning of photoperiodic flowering under short term temperature fluctuations, which often occur during local weather disturbances."

Another proprotein convertase, furin, cleaves PCSK9 at Arg218-Gln219 in the surface-exposed “218 loop.” This cleaved form circulates in blood along with the intact form, albeit at lower concentrations. To gain a better understanding of how cleavage affects PCSK9 function, we produced recombinant furin-cleaved PCSK9 using antibody Ab-3D5, which binds the intact but not the cleaved 218 loop. Using Ab-3D5, we also produced highly purified hepsin-cleaved PCSK9. Hepsin cleaves PCSK9 at Arg218-Gln219 more efficiently than furin but also cleaves at Arg215-Phe216. Further analysis by size exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry indicated that furin and hepsin produced an internal cleavage in the 218 loop without the loss of the N-terminal segment (Ser153–Arg218), which remained attached to the catalytic domain. Both furin- and hepsin-cleaved PCSK9 bound to LDL receptor with only 2-fold reduced affinity compared with intact PCSK9. Moreover, they reduced LDL receptor levels in HepG2 cells and in mouse liver with only moderately lower activity than intact PCSK9, consistent with the binding data. Single injection into mice of furin-cleaved PCSK9 resulted in significantly increased serum cholesterol levels, approaching the increase by intact PCSK9. These findings indicate that circulating furin-cleaved PCSK9 is able to regulate LDL receptor and serum cholesterol levels, although somewhat less efficiently than intact PCSK9.

https://openalex.org/W2111818121,"Atpif1, a mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, was identified as a zebrafish anemic mutant, pinotage, providing an important link in our understanding of the relationship between mitochondrial homeostasis and haem synthesis and identifying a gene that may have a role in human iron, haem and mitochondrial diseases. Defects in haem biosynthesis in erythrocytes cause anaemia. Many of the enzymes and substrates involved in this important process are known, but it is still unclear how iron transport is regulated in the mitochondria and coordinated with haem homeostasis. Here, Barry Paw and colleagues report the cloning of mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor factor 1 (atpif1) from a zebrafish genetic screen. Atpif1 regulates ferrochelatase, the terminal enzyme in haem biosynthesis, through alteration of mitochondrial pH and redox potential in the presence of a [2Fe–2S] cluster as the iron supply. The authors show that the human orthologue of Atpif1 is vital for normal red-blood-cell differentiation, suggesting that its deficiency may contribute to human diseases such as congenital sideroblastic anaemias and other mitochondriopathies. Defects in the availability of haem substrates or the catalytic activity of the terminal enzyme in haem biosynthesis, ferrochelatase (Fech), impair haem synthesis and thus cause human congenital anaemias1,2. The interdependent functions of regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis and enzymes responsible for haem synthesis are largely unknown. To investigate this we used zebrafish genetic screens and cloned mitochondrial ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (atpif1) from a zebrafish mutant with profound anaemia, pinotage (pnt tq209 ). Here we describe a direct mechanism establishing that Atpif1 regulates the catalytic efficiency of vertebrate Fech to synthesize haem. The loss of Atpif1 impairs haemoglobin synthesis in zebrafish, mouse and human haematopoietic models as a consequence of diminished Fech activity and elevated mitochondrial pH. To understand the relationship between mitochondrial pH, redox potential, [2Fe–2S] clusters and Fech activity, we used genetic complementation studies of Fech constructs with or without [2Fe–2S] clusters in pnt, as well as pharmacological agents modulating mitochondrial pH and redox potential. The presence of [2Fe–2S] cluster renders vertebrate Fech vulnerable to perturbations in Atpif1-regulated mitochondrial pH and redox potential. Therefore, Atpif1 deficiency reduces the efficiency of vertebrate Fech to synthesize haem, resulting in anaemia. The identification of mitochondrial Atpif1 as a regulator of haem synthesis advances our understanding of the mechanisms regulating mitochondrial haem homeostasis and red blood cell development. An ATPIF1 deficiency may contribute to important human diseases, such as congenital sideroblastic anaemias and mitochondriopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2139855450,"Objective In addition to improve glucose intolerance, recent studies suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonism also decreases triglyceride (TG) levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonism on very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG production and liver TG metabolism. Experimental Approach The GLP-1 peptide analogues CNTO3649 and exendin-4 were continuously administered subcutaneously to high fat diet-fed APOE*3-Leiden transgenic mice. After 4 weeks, hepatic VLDL production, lipid content, and expression profiles of selected genes involved in lipid metabolism were determined. Results CNTO3649 and exendin-4 reduced fasting plasma glucose (up to −30% and −28% respectively) and insulin (−43% and −65% respectively). In addition, these agents reduced VLDL-TG production (−36% and −54% respectively) and VLDL-apoB production (−36% and −43% respectively), indicating reduced production of VLDL particles rather than reduced lipidation of apoB. Moreover, they markedly decreased hepatic content of TG (−39% and −55% respectively), cholesterol (−30% and −55% respectively), and phospholipids (−23% and −36% respectively), accompanied by down-regulation of expression of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis (Srebp-1c, Fasn, Dgat1) and apoB synthesis (Apob). Conclusion GLP-1 receptor agonism reduces VLDL production and hepatic steatosis in addition to an improvement of glycemic control. These data suggest that GLP-receptor agonists could reduce hepatic steatosis and ameliorate dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

https://openalex.org/W2097641375,"Here we analyzed the dependence of African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection on the integrity of the endosomal pathway. Using confocal immunofluorescence with antibodies against viral capsid proteins, we found colocalization of incoming viral particles with early endosomes (EE) during the first minutes of infection. Conversely, viral capsid protein was not detected in acidic late endosomal compartments, multivesicular bodies (MVBs), late endosomes (LEs) or lysosomes (LY). Using an antibody against a viral inner core protein, we found colocalization of viral cores with late compartments from 30 to 60 minutes postinfection. The absence of capsid protein staining in LEs and LYs suggested that virus desencapsidation would take place at the acid pH of these organelles. In fact, inhibitors of intraluminal acidification of endosomes caused retention of viral capsid staining virions in Rab7 expressing endosomes and more importantly, severely impaired subsequent viral protein production. Endosomal acidification in the first hour after virus entry was essential for successful infection but not thereafter. In addition, altering the balance of phosphoinositides (PIs) which are responsible of the maintenance of the endocytic pathway impaired ASFV infection. Early infection steps were dependent on the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) which is involved in EE maturation and multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis and on the interconversion of PtdIns3P to phosphatidylinositol 3, 5-biphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2). Likewise, GTPase Rab7 activity should remain intact, as well as processes related to LE compartment physiology, which are crucial during early infection. Our data demonstrate that the EE and LE compartments and the integrity of the endosomal maturation pathway orchestrated by Rab proteins and PIs play a central role during early stages of ASFV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2000404166,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach to treat head and neck cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether mitochondrial iron uptake through mitoferrin-2 (Mfrn2) enhanced PDT-induced cell killing. Three human head and neck squamous carcinoma cell lines (UMSCC1, UMSCC14A, and UMSCC22A) were exposed to light and Pc 4, a mitochondria-targeted photosensitizer. The three cell lines responded differently: UMSCC1 and UMSCC14A cells were more resistant, whereas UMSCC22A cells were more sensitive to Pc 4-PDT-induced cell death. In non-erythroid cells, Mfrn2 is an iron transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane. PDT-sensitive cells expressed higher Mfrn2 mRNA and protein levels compared with PDT-resistant cells. High Mfrn2-expressing cells showed higher rates of mitochondrial Fe(2+) uptake compared with low Mfrn2-expressing cells. Bafilomycin, an inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump of lysosomes and endosomes that causes lysosomal iron release to the cytosol, enhanced PDT-induced cell killing of both resistant and sensitive cells. Iron chelators and the inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) (and Fe(2+)) uniporter, Ru360, protected against PDT plus bafilomycin toxicity. Knockdown of Mfrn2 in UMSCC22A cells decreased the rate of mitochondrial Fe(2+) uptake and delayed PDT plus bafilomycin-induced mitochondrial depolarization and cell killing. Taken together, the data suggest that lysosomal iron release and Mfrn2-dependent mitochondrial iron uptake act synergistically to induce PDT-mediated and iron-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell killing. Furthermore, Mfrn2 represents a possible biomarker of sensitivity of head and neck cancers to cell killing after PDT."
https://openalex.org/W1991451437,"In recent years, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has attracted significant attention as an indicator of high risk for Alzheimer's disease. An understanding of the pathology of aMCI may benefit the development of effective clinical treatments for dementia. In this work, we measured the cortical thickness of 109 aMCI subjects and 99 normal controls (NC) twice over two years. The longitudinal changes and the cross-sectional differences between the two types of participants were explored using the vertex thickness values. The thickness of the cortex in aMCI was found significantly reduced in both longitudinal and between-group comparisons, mainly in the temporal lobe, superolateral parietal lobe and some regions of the frontal cortices. Compared to NC, the aMCI showed a significantly high atrophy rate in the left lateral temporal lobe and left parahippocampal gyrus over two years. Additionally, a significant positive correlation between brain atrophy and the decline of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores was also found in the left superior and left middle temporal gyrus in aMCI. These findings demonstrated specific longitudinal spatial patterns of cortical atrophy in aMCI and NC. The higher atrophy rate in aMCI might be responsible for the accelerated functional decline in the aMCI progression process."
https://openalex.org/W2141248446,"Natural killer (NK) cells are abundant in the liver and have been implicated in inducing hepatocellular damage in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the role of NK cells in acute HBV infection remains to be elucidated. We comprehensively characterized NK cells and investigated their roles in HBV clearance and liver pathology in 19 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 21 acute hepatitis B (AHB) patients as well as 16 healthy subjects. It was found that NKp46+ NK cells were enriched in the livers of AHB and CHB patients. We further found that peripheral NK cells from AHB patients expressed higher levels of activation receptors and lower levels of inhibitory receptors than those from CHB patients and HC subjects, thus displaying the increased cytolytic activity and interferon-γ production. NK cell activation levels were also correlated positively with serum alanine aminotransferase levels and negatively with plasma HBV DNA levels in AHB patients, which is further confirmed by the longitudinal follow-up of AHB patients. Serum pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels were also increased in AHB patients as compared with CHB and HC subjects. Thus, the concomitantly increased interferon-γ and cytotoxicity of NK cells were associated with liver injury and viral clearance in AHB patients."

We show that miR-378 is up-regulated in human cancers and found that tumor cells transfected with miR-378 acquired properties of tumor stem cells, including cell self-renewal. Overexpression of miR-378 enhanced cell survival and colony formation. Isolated from a single-cell colony, the miR-378-expressing cells formed tumors in nude mice at low cell densities. These cells expressed higher levels of miR-378 and formed more and larger spheres and colonies. We found that the miR-378-expressing cells contained a large number of side population cells and could undergo differentiation. Cells transfected with miR-378 expressed increased levels of Sox2. Expression of miR-378 and Sox2 was found correlated significantly in cancer cell lines and in cancer patient specimens. We also observed opposite levels of vimentin in the cancer cell lines and human breast carcinoma specimens. We further demonstrated that vimentin is a target of miR-378, and ectopic transfection of vimentin inhibited Sox2 expression, resulting in decreased cell survival. Silencing vimentin promoted Sox2 expression and cell survival.

MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29438) Google Scholar). miRNAs are single-stranded RNAs of 18–24 nucleotides in length and are generated by an RNase III-type enzyme from an endogenous transcript that contains a hairpin structure (10Hutvágner G.

Previous studies have shown that miR-378 is expressed in a number of cancer cell lines (36Jiang J. Lee E.J. Gusev Y. Schmittgen T.D. Real-time expression profiling of microRNA precursors in human cancer cell lines.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5394-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and it is involved in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (37Hua Z.

To understand the biological functions of miR-378, we have generated a miR-378 expression construct for functional studies. We demonstrated that tumor cell line U87, a human primary glioblastoma cell line, transfected with miR-378, formed larger tumors and blood vessels (38Lee D.Y. Deng Z. Wang C.H. Yang B.B. MicroRNA-378 promotes cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis by targeting SuFu and Fus-1 expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A miRNA construct expressing miR-378 was designed by our laboratory and generated as described previously (38Lee D.Y. Deng Z. Wang C.H. Yang B.B. MicroRNA-378 promotes cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis by targeting SuFu and Fus-1 expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20350-20355Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This plasmid has been used successfully in our laboratory. The control plasmid is the same except the pre-miR-378 sequence was replaced with a nonrelated sequence (atacagtactgtgataactgaagtttttggaaaagctttagttattaa), serving as a mock control. Cultured cells were fixed in 10% formalin and washed with distilled water for 10 min. The fixed cells were rinsed with 60% isopropyl alcohol and stained with freshly prepared Oil Red O solution for 15 min. After being rinsed with 60% isopropyl alcohol, the cells were briefly stained with aluminum hematoxylin and mounted in glycerine jelly. After being dried, the stained cells were examined under a light microscope. U87 cells transfected with miR-378, anti-miR-378, or mock were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates to subconfluence. The medium was changed to serum-free DMEM, followed by treating the cells with 200 μl of oleic acid solution overnight. The medium was removed, and the cells were treated with 100 μl of fixative solution (10% formalin) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by microscopic examination. The cells were stained with Oil Red O as described above. After washing and drying completely, 100 μl of 100% isopropyl alcohol was added to each well. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min to release Oil Red O from the staining. The extract solution was then transferred to another 96-well plate. The plate was subjected to absorbance measurement at a wavelength of 405 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). The total RNA was extracted from ∼1 × 106 cells with the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by reverse transcription to synthesize cDNA using 1 μg of RNA. Successive PCR was performed by a QuantiMir-RT kit using 1 μl of cDNA as a template (Qiagen, miScript Reverse Transcription kit, catalog 218060; miScript Primer Assay, catalog 218411; miScript SYBR Green PCR kit, catalog 218073). The primers specific for mature miR-378 were purchased from Qiagen. The primers used as real-time PCR controls were human-U6RNAf and human-U6RNAr. Cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well or 2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded on 35-mm Petri dishes in DMEM containing 0–10% FBS and incubated for different time periods. The cell numbers were counted using trypan blue staining as described (39Sheng W. Wang G. Wang Y. Liang J. Wen J. Zheng P.S. Wu Y. Lee V. Slingerland J. Dumont D. Yang B.B. The roles of versican V1 and V2 isoforms in cell proliferation and apoptosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from tissue culture dishes with trypsin and EDTA, washed, and suspended at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM containing 2% FCS. The cells were preincubated at 37 ºC for 10 min and then maintained at 37 ºC for 90 min with 2.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 dye, either alone or in combination with 50 μm verapamil. The number of SP cells were measured with flow cytometry by using a dual-wavelength for analysis (blue, 424–444 nm; red, 675 nm) after excitation with 350-nm UV light. Propidium iodide-positive (dead) cells, which were normally <15%, were excluded from the analysis. Colony formation was assessed using a method described previously (40Zheng P.S. Wen J. Ang L.C. Sheng W. Viloria-Petit A. Wang Y. Wu Y. Kerbel R.S. Yang B.B. Versican/PG-M G3 domain promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis.FASEB J. 2004; 18: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 103 cells were mixed in 0.3% low melting agarose in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and plated on 0.66% agarose-coated 6-well tissue culture plates. Colony formation was monitored weekly. Four weeks after cell inoculation, colonies were examined and photographed. Six-week-old CD1 strain nude mice were injected with the miR-378- and mock-transfected U87 cell lines (1 × 106 cells/injection). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. Tumor volume (V) was estimated using a caliper by measuring the length (L) and width (W), where V = (L ×W2)/2. Tumors were removed for further analysis 40 days after the injection as described (40Zheng P.S. Wen J. Ang L.C. Sheng W. Viloria-Petit A. Wang Y. Wu Y. Kerbel R.S. Yang B.B. Versican/PG-M G3 domain promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis.FASEB J. 2004; 18: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Human cancer specimens (n = 14) and paired noncancerous normal specimens (n = 14) were obtained from patients who had been subjected to the surgery for tumor removal at The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University. All samples were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen until RNA extraction. We followed the guidelines of The Affiliated People's Hospital protocol including patient consent and specimen collection. Total RNA was isolated from the specimens with mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs were subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription using 1 μg of RNA. PCRs were then performed with QuantiMir-RT Kit using 2 μl of cDNA as template. To perform these experiments, other kits were also needed, including the miScript Reverse Transcription kit and miScript SYBR Green PCR kit. For real-time PCR of miR-378, the primer was specific for mature miR-378 (5′-ctcctgactccaggtcctgtgt). The primers for internal control U6 RNA were human-U6RNAf (5′-gtgctcgcttcggcagcacatatac) and human-U6RNAr (5′-aaaaatatggaacgcttcacgaatttg). The primers for Sox2 were Hom-Sox2–421F (5′-cgcccgcatgtacaacatgatgg) and Hom-Sox2–660R (5′-tcggcgcccaggcgcttgctgatc). The primers for internal control GAPDH were Hu-Gapdh421F (5′-aaggctggggctcatttgcag) and Hu-Gapdh720R (5′-gatgttctggagagccccgcg). The correlations between miR-378 and Sox2 (levels of miR-378 and Sox2 products) were assessed with Pearson's correlation coefficient using GraphPad Prism software. The results (mean values ±S.D.) of all experiments were subjected to statistical analysis by t test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.01 and p < 0.05. We have previously demonstrated that expression of miR-378 enhances tumor cell survival and promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis (38Lee D.Y. Deng Z. Wang C.H. Yang B.B. MicroRNA-378 promotes cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis by targeting SuFu and Fus-1 expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20350-20355Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In continuation of this study, we conducted analysis of miR-378 expression in 23 pairs of human cancer specimens and found that miR-378 levels were higher in the tumor areas than in the adjacent nontumor areas (Fig. 1a, left). We also isolated RNAs from the wax blocks of human breast carcinoma specimens and the adjacent tissues. Analysis of miR-378 levels indicated that the cancer tissues expressed significantly higher levels of miR-378 than the adjacent tissues (Fig. 1a, right). To understand how miR-378 affected cancer cell activities, we transfected miR-378 expression construct in U87 cells (Fig. 1b). The cells were cultured in Petri dishes and tissue culture plates without serum, and we observed that the miR-378-transfected cells could survive for a long period of time, characteristics of tumor stem cells (Fig. 1c). We have also tested whether the apoptosis-inducing agent C2-ceramide had any effect on miR-378-enhanced cell survival and observed that U87 cells transfected with miR-378 exhibited reduced cell death (Fig. 1d and supplemental Fig. S1a). To test the effect of endogenous miR-378, an antisense construct was developed which bound and arrested the functions of miR-378 (anti-miR-378). Expression of anti-miR-378 reduced cell survival significantly (Fig. 1e and supplemental Fig. S1b). In colony formation assays, we detected more colonies with larger sizes formed by the miR-378-expressing cells compared with the control (Fig. 1f). In single-cell culture, we found that the miR-378-transfected cells could formed larger colonies than the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1g, upper). When the colonies obtained from the single-cell culture were passed to new wells, the miR-378-transfected cells could form large new colonies, but most of the mock-transfected cells died (Fig. 1g, lower). To examine whether or not the cells that formed colonies were those that expressed high levels of miR-378 and had tumor stem cell properties, we isolated cells from single colonies. Analysis of miRNA levels indicated that the cells isolated from the single colony expressed significantly higher levels of miR-378 compared with cells transfected with miR-378, but selected with flow cytometry thus containing a mix of cell population called miR-378 mix or miR-378M, or with a control vector (Fig. 2a). We tested whether there is a correlation between miR-378 expression and stem cell-associated properties. Cells expressing low and high levels of miR-378 were cultured in serum-free medium in Petri dishes for 6 days. Examination of cell survival indicated that the cells expressing higher levels of miR-378 showed higher rates of survival (Fig. 2b and supplemental Fig. 1c). When being cultured in tissue culture plates, the cells expressing higher levels of miR-378 also displayed higher rates of survival (supplemental Fig. 1d). The cells were also cultured in soft agar for colony formation assays. Cells expressing miR-378 formed significantly more colonies than the mock control (Fig. 2c). The cells expressing higher levels of miR-378 formed more colonies than the cells expressing lower levels of miR-378. The colonies in the groups expressing miR-378 were much larger than the ones in the control group. To further confirm the stem-like properties, we cultured the cells in sphere formation medium and found that the miR-378-expressing cells formed greater number of spheres with larger sizes than the mock control (Fig. 2d). The cell expressing higher levels of miR-378 (miR-378C) formed larger spheres than the cell expressing lower levels of miR-378 (miR-378M). After long term culture, the spheres were able to survive and continue to grow (Fig. 2e). This is a normal process of stem cell differentiation. After long term culture as a monolayer, these cells obtained less stem-like phenotype. Our results suggest that miR-378 has dose-dependent effect of the stemness of tumor stem cells. It has been reported that tumor stem cells have great capacity in tumor formation (1Li C. Heidt D.G. Dalerba P. Burant C.F. Zhang L. Adsay V. Wicha M. Clarke M.F. Simeone D.M.

To test whether or not the colony derived from the single cell could form bigger tumors, we tested tumorigenic capacity of the three types of cells including miR-378M, miR-378C, and mock by injecting the cells into nude mice subcutaneously. Tumor incidence was examined 40 days after the injection. Due to injection of low cell number, the mock-transfected cells did not form visible tumors, whereas the miR-378M cells formed tumors with medium sizes and the miR-378C cells formed large tumors (Fig. 3a). Because the parental U87 cells form tumors slowly, it normally takes 4–5 weeks to form small tumors by injecting 1 × 107 cells/mouse. It is expected that 1 × 106 cells would not form visible sizes of tumors. This is in agreement with our previous report that miR-378 expression promotes tumor growth (38Lee D.Y. Deng Z. Wang C.H. Yang B.B. MicroRNA-378 promotes cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis by targeting SuFu and Fus-1 expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20350-20355Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To further understand the effect of miR-378 on tumor stem cell behaviors, we isolated miR-378-transfected cells from the tumors formed in the nude mice by digesting the miR-378C-formed tumor tissues with collagenase and maintaining in medium containing G418. Sensitivities of these cells along with miR-378M, miR-378C, and mock cells to clinical chemodrugs docetaxel and epirubicin were tested. The cells isolated from the tumor tissues exhibited highest activity of resistance to both drugs (Fig. 3b). This is in agreement with the above results and previous report that tumor stem cells are more resistant to chemodrug treatment (7Yu F. Yao H. Zhu P. Zhang X. Pan Q. Gong C. Huang Y. Hu X. Su F.

We then analyzed the levels of CD133, a marker of stem cells, and found that expression of miR-378 dramatically up-regulated CD133 levels (Fig. 4a, left). The experiments were repeated three times for statistical analysis and we observed a significant up-regulation of CD133 in the miR-378-transfected cells (Fig. 4a, right). Analysis of SP fraction with Hoechst 33342 dye-based technique has been used to isolate stem cells. To investigate the prevalence of SP cells, we stained the miR-378- and mock-transfected cells with Hoechst 33342 dye and identified the SP fractions by its characteristic fluorescent profile in dual-wavelength analysis. The miR-378-transfected cells contained higher percentage of SP cells than the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4b, left). The experiments were repeated three times for statistical analysis.

A circular genome with a head-to-tail sequence was identified in one (BJQ435) out of 15 samples tested by nested PCR. The complete circular genome of HBoV2-C1 (BJQ435) was 5307 nt in length and was flanked with a 520 nt-long terminal non-coding region (NCR). The secondary structure of HBoV2 -C1 had some differences compared to HBoV3-E1 (JN086998).

To explore the distribution of N-glycosylation sites (glycosites) in these two glycoproteins, we collected and aligned the amino acid sequences of all the HA and NA subtypes. Two glycosites were located at HA0 cleavage sites and fusion peptides and were strikingly conserved in all HA subtypes, while the remaining glycosites were unique to their subtypes. Two to four conserved glycosites were found in the stalk domain of NA, but these are affected by the deletion of specific stalk domain sequences. Another highly conserved glycosite appeared at the top center of tetrameric global domain, while the others glycosites were distributed around the global domain. Here we present a detailed investigation of the distribution and the evolutionary pattern of the glycosites in the envelope glycoproteins of IVs, and further focus on the H5N1 virus and conclude that the glycosites in H5N1 have become more complicated in HA and less influential in NA in the last five years."

To investigate the in vivo role for FBXL5 in the maintenance of iron homeostasis, we generated mice in which the Fbxl5 gene locus has been disrupted. FBXL5-null mice die during embryogenesis due to unregulated IRP2 accumulation. Fbxl5 heterozygotes, although viable, exhibit an unexpected phenotype. Unlike their wild type littermates, these mice maintain their hematocrit and hemoglobin levels when challenged with a low iron diet. Here we show that although Fbxl5 heterozygosity has little apparent effect on the iron-responsive behavior of most tissues, iron absorption through the duodenum is substantially altered. These results suggest that the FBXL5-dependent iron sensitivity of the cells within the intestine is set differently from other cells in the body and, as a consequence, FBXL5 plays a previously unrecognized role in systemic iron homeostasis. Murine 129 Sv/Ev embryonic stem cells heterozygous for the gene-trapped Fbxl5 allele (clone OST386421) were obtained from Texas A&M Institute for Genomic Medicine and injected into C57Bl/6J blastocysts at the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) Transgenic Technology Center. The resulting chimeric mice were crossed to C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) to produce heterozygous animals. Backcrossing Fbxl5 heterozygous mice of mixed background to wild type 129 Sv/Ev mice resulted in the generation of syngeneic Fbxl5+/GT mice that were 99.99% of 129 Sv/Ev genetic background as determined by speed congenics (Taconic). Fbxl5 wild type and Fbxl5 heterozygous mice were weaned onto a ad libitum iron-sufficient (50 ppm) or low iron (5 ppm) diet (Harlan-Teklad) for 3 weeks. For the 59Fe feeding experiments, mice fed a low iron diet for 3 weeks were then fasted for 24 h and gavaged with an olive-tipped needle containing 200 μl of PBS supplemented with 2.5 μCi of 59FeCl3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.5 m ascorbic acid. At the indicated time points, animals were exsanguinated and 59Fe accumulation in tissues was measured in a Packard Cobra Gamma Counter. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein or via cardiac puncture following intraperitoneal administration of anesthetic rodent mixture (ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine). Complete Blood Count analysis was performed by the UTSW Diagnostic Lab.

Cells were cultured on a layer of mitotic inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cells in Dulbecco's modified high glucose Eagle's medium (HyClone) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological), 1× nonessential amino acids (HyClone), 1× penicillin and streptomycin (HyClone), 2 mm glutamine (HyClone), 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 110 mg/liter of pyruvate (Hyclone). After 4 weeks, cells were grown without feeder cells and immortalized upon transfection of the SV40 large T antigen (pSV3-Neo, ATCC) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml of G418. See supplemental “Materials and Methods” for supporting information. As all mammalian cells have a requirement for iron, yet are susceptible to damage when bioavailable iron accumulates, a bona fide cellular iron sensor should be ubiquitously expressed. FBXL5 mRNA levels were quantitated by quantitative PCR across panels of human and murine tissue extracts. As predicted, FBXL5 expression was detected in all samples with the highest relative levels present in the brain, particularly the metal-rich cerebellum (19Popescu B.F. Robinson C.A. Rajput A. Rajput A.H. Harder S.L. Nichol H. Iron, copper, and zinc distribution of the cerebellum.Cerebellum. 2009; 8: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), eye, and testis (Fig. 1, A and B). These same FBXL5 mRNA-abundant tissues also tend to express relatively high levels of IRP1 and IRP2 mRNAs (Fig. 1, A and B, and Ref. 20Guo B. Brown F.M. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A.

In the mouse, FBXL5 expression is high at embryonic day (E) 7.5 (Fig. 1B), suggesting a role in early embryogenesis, although its expression decreases as the embryo progresses through development (E11 and E15). Insertion of a gene-trapping (GT) vector downstream of the second exon of FBXL5 generated a disrupted allele (Fbxl5GT; Fig. 2). Progeny from mice containing one copy of this nonfunctional allele were genotyped at various developmental time points. Although wild type (Fbxl5+/+), heterozygous (Fbxl5+/GT), and homozygous null (Fbxl5GT/GT) embryos were initially observed in a Mendelian 1:2:1 ratio, no Fbxl5GT/GT pups were born (Table 1). In the mixed genetic background of our mice, E9.5 Fbxl5GT/GT embryos exhibited growth retardation as compared with wild type and heterozygous littermates (Fig. 3A). Although developmentally delayed, histopathological analysis revealed that E9.5 Fbxl5GT/GT embryos had undergone normal placentation (Fig. 3, B and C), gastrulation, and cardiovascular development (Fig. 3D). However, at E10.5 these embryos appeared very distorted and were completely absorbed by day E12.5.TABLE 1Genotypes of embryos from heterozygous matingsStageNo. of Progeny+/++/GTGT/GTTotalE9.520441882E10.51122942E11.5122810aPartially absorbed embryos.50E12.51022032Postnatal851550240a Partially absorbed embryos.

Due to the early embryonic lethality of the Fbxl5GT/GT mice, we generated mouse embryonic cell lines from Fbxl5+/+, Fbxl5+/GT, and Fbxl5GT/GT embryos (Fig. 4A) harvested on day E8. Fbxl5+/+ and Fbxl5+/GT cells depleted of bioavailable iron with the metal chelator deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) strongly accumulate IRP2 compared with iron-replete cells incubated with ferric ammonium citrate. However, Fbxl5GT/GT cells aberrantly accumulate IRP2 under both conditions (Fig. 4C). Total IRP1 protein levels remained constant under all conditions and in all cell types (Fig. 4C). This inappropriately accumulated IRP2 is competent for IRE binding (Fig. 4D) and Fbxl5GT/GT cells exhibit increased TfR1 expression and decreased ferritin expression under iron replete conditions (Fig. 4, B and C). An increase in iron uptake, coupled with a decrease in iron storage capacity, could result in the overaccumulation of iron accompanied by increased oxidative stress in these FBXL5-null cells. To ascertain whether embryonic lethality was due to deregulated IRP2 expression, we crossed Fbxl5+/GT mice with IRP2 knock-out mice (21Galy B. Ferring D. Benesova M. Benes V. Hentze M.W.

Like their littermates, Irp2−/−; Fbxl5GT/GT mice grow normally and are fertile. This result suggests that the early embryonic mortality of FBXL5-null animals is due to the constitutive accumulation of IRP2 with concomitant dysregulation of its target genes. Interestingly, when Irp1+/−; Fbxl5+/GT mice were crossed, no Irp1−/−; Fbxl5GT/GT pups were observed at birth (Table 3), despite the significant redundancy in IRP1 and IRP2 function (22LaVaute T.

Nutr. 2002; 132: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After 3 weeks ingesting the specified diets, complete blood counts and serum iron levels were determined. Wild type mice fed a low iron diet exhibited an expected 77% decrease in serum iron levels despite a compensatory 149% increase in the total iron binding capacity of transferrin (Table 4). Consistent with the low dietary iron availability, wild type animals report significant reductions in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, and a modest reduction in the number of red blood cells (RBC) (Table 4). All measurements taken from Fbxl5+/GT mice fed an iron-sufficient (50 ppm) diet were indistinguishable from control Fbxl5+/+ mice. Even Fbxl5+/GT mice fed a low iron diet exhibit similar changes in serum iron and total iron binding capacity values to those of their wild type counterparts (Table 4). However, this reduced iron availability does not result in any corresponding reductions in hematocrit, hemoglobin, or erythrocyte levels in the Fbxl5 heterozygotes (Table 4). To guard against the possibility that this unexpected phenotype was due to the mixed genetic background of these mice, Fbxl5+/GT mice were backcrossed to 129 Sv/Ev mice to generate syngeneic Fbxl5+/GT mice. Just like their mixed background Fbxl5+/GT counterparts, syngeneic Fbxl5+/GT mice still maintained normal hematologic values when fed a low iron diet (Table 5). These data suggest that Fbxl5+/GT mice have altered their systemic iron homeostasis so as to make iron preferentially available to the erythroid compartment, irrespective of genetic background.TABLE 4Hematological parameters and serum values from Fbxl5+/+ and Fbxl5+/GT mice fed either an iron sufficient or low iron dietFbxl5+/+Fbxl5+/GTSufficient FeLow FeSufficient FeLow FeRBC (M/μl)9.2 ± 0.37.6 ± 0.4ap = 0.006.9.2 ± 0.29.3 ± 0.4ap = 0.006.Hematocrit (%)53 ± 233 ± 2bp < 0.001.51 ± 249 ± 2bp < 0.001.Hemoglobin (g/dl)13.8 ± 0.39.9 ± 0.8cp < 0.005.13.0 ± 0.413.0 ± 0.5cp < 0.005.Iron (μg/dl)253 ± 2058 ± 10252 ± 553 ± 10TIBC (μg/dl)337 ± 8504 ± 9334 ± 26556 ± 34Saturation (%)75 ± 612 ± 178 ± 510 ± 2a p = 0.006.b p < 0.001.c p < 0.005.

Open table in a new tab We hypothesized that the requisite iron needed to maintain normal hematocrit and hemoglobin values in Fbxl5+/GT mice could be made available either through depletion of iron stores or through increased intestinal absorption. The metal content of the liver, a major site of iron storage (4Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Galy B. Camaschella C. Two to tango. Regulation of mammalian iron metabolism.Cell. 2010; 142: 24-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar), was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S1 and Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, total iron content in the liver was reduced in an equivalent amount in all mice fed the low iron diet for 3 weeks, providing no indication that additional iron was mobilized from Fbxl5+/GT liver stores. To determine whether Fbxl5+/GT mice are more efficient than wild type mice at absorbing limiting dietary iron, 59Fe was directly introduced via gastric gavage into the stomachs of mice that had been fed a low iron diet for 3 weeks and the distribution of 59Fe in various tissues was measured over time. After 1 h, almost 80-fold more 59Fe was incorporated within the duodena of Fbxl5+/GT mice as compared with wild type animals (Fig. 6A). This increased efficiency in intestinal uptake was accompanied by a corresponding 3-fold increase in serum 59Fe levels (Fig. 6B). The whole body distribution of 59Fe is also markedly different in the Fbxl5+/GT mice, as this newly absorbed iron is made preferentially available to the spleen (Fig. 6C) and the bone marrow (Fig. 6D, femur) for rapid incorporation into red blood cells (Fig. 6E), rather than sites of storage (Fig. 6F, liver). Although Fbxl5+/GT mice are indistinguishable from Fbxl5+/+ mice when fed an iron-sufficient diet, the heterozygous mice take up iron more efficiently when dietary availability is limiting. To determine the underlying cause of this difference, immunoblot analysis was used to examine the expression of iron metabolism genes. In wild type mice fed a low iron diet, intestinal iron absorption is typically promoted in multiple ways. At the cell autonomous level (25Galy B. Ferring-Appel D. Kaden S. Gröne H.J. Hentze M.W.

https://openalex.org/W2067469593,"The telomere at the end of a linear chromosome plays crucial roles in genome stability. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Rap1 protein, one of the central players at the telomeres, associates with multiple proteins to regulate various telomere functions, such as the maintenance of telomere DNA length, telomere end protection, maintenance of telomere heterochromatin, and telomere clustering in meiosis. The molecular bases of the interactions between Rap1 and its partners, however, remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the identification of the interaction domains of Rap1 with its partners. The Bqt1/Bqt2 complex, which is required for normal meiotic progression, Poz1, which is required for telomere length control, and Taz1, which is required for the recruitment of Rap1 to telomeres, bind to distinct domains in the C-terminal half of Rap1. Intriguingly, analyses of a series of deletion mutants for rap1+ have revealed that the long N-terminal region (1–456 a.a. [amino acids]) of Rap1 (full length: 693 a.a.) is not required for telomere DNA length control, telomere end protection, and telomere gene silencing, whereas the C-terminal region (457–693 a.a.) containing Poz1- and Taz1-binding domains plays important roles in those functions. Furthermore, the Bqt1/Bqt2- and Taz1-binding domains are essential for normal spore formation after meiosis. Our results suggest that the C-terminal half of Rap1 is critical for the primary telomere functions, whereas the N-terminal region containing the BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminus) and Myb domains, which are evolutionally conserved among the Rap1 family proteins, does not play a major role at the telomeres."
https://openalex.org/W2000609328,"Conformational flexibility between structural ensembles is an essential component of enzyme function. Although the broad dynamical landscape of proteins is known to promote a number of functional events on multiple time scales, it is yet unknown whether structural and functional enzyme homologues rely on the same concerted residue motions to perform their catalytic function. It is hypothesized that networks of contiguous and flexible residue motions occurring on the biologically relevant millisecond time scale evolved to promote and/or preserve optimal enzyme catalysis. In this study, we use a combination of NMR relaxation dispersion, model-free analysis, and ligand titration experiments to successfully capture and compare the role of conformational flexibility between two structural homologues of the pancreatic ribonuclease family: RNase A and eosinophil cationic protein (or RNase 3). In addition to conserving the same catalytic residues and structural fold, both homologues show similar yet functionally distinct clusters of millisecond dynamics, suggesting that conformational flexibility can be conserved among analogous protein folds displaying low sequence identity. Our work shows that the reduced conformational flexibility of eosinophil cationic protein can be dynamically and functionally reproduced in the RNase A scaffold upon creation of a chimeric hybrid between the two proteins. These results support the hypothesis that conformational flexibility is partly required for catalytic function in homologous enzyme folds, further highlighting the importance of dynamic residue sectors in the structural organization of proteins."

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib inhibits migration of several cell lines from solid-organ tumours, but effects on CLL cells have not been reported. We studied the effect of clinically achievable concentrations of dasatinib on signaling induced by the chemokine CXCL12 through its' receptor CXCR4, which is highly expressed on CLL cells. Dasatinib pre-treatment inhibited Akt and ERK phosphorylation in CLL cells upon stimulation with CXCL12. Dasatinib also significantly diminished the rapid increase in actin polymerisation observed in CLL cells following CXCL12 stimulation. Moreover, the drug significantly inhibited chemotaxis in a transwell assay, and reduced the percentage of cells able to migrate beneath a CXCL12-expressing murine stromal cell line. Dasatinib also abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of prolonged CXCL12 stimulation on cultured CLL cells. These data suggest that dasatinib, akin to other small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, may redistribute CLL cells from protective tissue niches to the peripheral blood, and support the investigation of dasatinib in combination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2046258882,"In seven-transmembrane (7TM), G protein-coupled receptors, highly conserved residues function as microswitches, which alternate between different conformations and interaction partners in an extended allosteric interface between the transmembrane segments performing the large scale conformational changes upon receptor activation. Computational analysis using x-ray structures of the β(2)-adrenergic receptor demonstrated that PheVI:09 (6.44), which in the inactive state is locked between the backbone and two hydrophobic residues in transmembrane (TM)-III, upon activation slides ∼2 Å toward TM-V into a tight pocket generated by five hydrophobic residues protruding from TM-III and TM-V. Of these, the residue in position III:16 (3.40) (often an Ile or Val) appears to function as a barrier or gate for the transition between inactive and active conformation. Mutational analysis showed that PheVI:09 is essential for the constitutive and/or agonist-induced signaling of the ghrelin receptor, GPR119, the β(2)-adrenergic receptor, and the neurokinin-1 receptor. Substitution of the residues constituting the hydrophobic pocket between TM-III and TM-V in the ghrelin receptor in four of five positions impaired receptor signaling. In GPR39, representing the 12% of 7TM receptors lacking an aromatic residue at position VI:09, unchanged agonist-induced signaling was observed upon Ala substitution of LeuVI:09 despite reduced cell surface expression of the mutant receptor. It is concluded that PheVI:09 constitutes an aromatic microswitch that stabilizes the active, outward tilted conformation of TM-VI relative to TM-III by sliding into a tight hydrophobic pocket between TM-III and TM-V and that the hydrophobic residue in position III:16 constitutes a gate for this transition."
https://openalex.org/W2110801566,"Few time series of deep-sea systems exist from which the factors affecting abyssal fish populations can be evaluated. Previous analysis showed an increase in grenadier abundance, in the eastern North Pacific, which lagged epibenthic megafaunal abundance, mostly echinoderms, by 9–20 months. Subsequent diet studies suggested that carrion is the grenadier's most important food. Our goal was to evaluate if changes in carrion supply might drive the temporal changes in grenadier abundance. We analyzed a unique 17 year time series of abyssal grenadier abundance and size, collected at Station M (4100 m, 220 km offshore of Pt. Conception, California), and reaffirmed the increase in abundance and also showed an increase in mean size resulting in a ∼6 fold change in grenadier biomass. We compared this data with abundance estimates for surface living nekton (pacific hake and jack mackerel) eaten by the grenadiers as carrion. A significant positive correlation between Pacific hake (but not jack mackerel) and grenadiers was found. Hake seasonally migrate to the waters offshore of California to spawn. They are the most abundant nekton species in the region and the target of the largest commercial fishery off the west coast. The correlation to grenadier abundance was strongest when using hake abundance metrics from the area within 100 nmi of Station M. No significant correlation between grenadier abundance and hake biomass for the entire California current region was found. Given the results and grenadier longevity, migration is likely responsible for the results and the location of hake spawning probably is more important than the size of the spawning stock in understanding the dynamics of abyssal grenadier populations. Our results suggest that some abyssal fishes' population dynamics are controlled by the flux of large particles of carrion. Climate and fishing pressures affecting epipelagic fish stocks could readily modulate deep-sea fish dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2151474354,"Recessive mutations in the F-box only protein 7 gene (FBXO7) cause PARK15, a mendelian form of early-onset, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism with severe loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. However, the function of the protein encoded by FBXO7, and the pathogenesis of PARK15 remain unknown. No animal models of this disease exist. Here, we report the generation of a vertebrate model of PARK15 in zebrafish. We first show that the zebrafish Fbxo7 homolog protein (zFbxo7) is expressed abundantly in the normal zebrafish brain. Next, we used two zFbxo7-specific morpholinos (targeting protein translation and mRNA splicing, respectively), to knock down the zFbxo7 expression. The injection of either of these zFbxo7-specific morpholinos in the fish embryos induced a marked decrease in the zFbxo7 protein expression, and a range of developmental defects. Furthermore, whole-mount in situ mRNA hybridization showed abnormal patterning and significant decrease in the number of diencephalic tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons, corresponding to the human nigrostriatal or ventral tegmental dopaminergic neurons. Of note, the number of the dopamine transporter-expressing neurons was much more severely depleted, suggesting dopaminergic dysfunctions earlier and larger than those due to neuronal loss. Last, the zFbxo7 morphants displayed severe locomotor disturbances (bradykinesia), which were dramatically improved by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. The severity of these morphological and behavioral abnormalities correlated with the severity of zFbxo7 protein deficiency. Moreover, the effects of the co-injection of zFbxo7- and p53-specific morpholinos were similar to those obtained with zFbxo7-specific morpholinos alone, supporting further the contention that the observed phenotypes were specifically due to the knock down of zFbxo7. In conclusion, this novel vertebrate model reproduces pathologic and behavioral hallmarks of human parkinsonism (dopaminergic neuronal loss and dopamine-dependent bradykinesia), representing therefore a valid tool for investigating the mechanisms of selective dopaminergic neuronal death, and screening for modifier genes and therapeutic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2092933936,"Paired box (PAX) 2, a transcription factor, plays a critical role in embryogenesis. When aberrantly expressed in adult tissues, it generally exhibits oncogenic properties. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We reported previously that the expression of PAX2 was up-regulated in human colon cancers. However, the role of PAX2 in colon cancer cells has yet to be determined. The aim of this study is to determine the function of PAX2 in colon cancer cells and to investigate the possible mechanisms underlain. We find that knockdown of PAX2 inhibits proliferation and xenograft growth of colon cancer cells. Inhibition of PAX2 results in a decreased expression of cyclin D1. Expression of cyclin D1 is found increased in human primary colon malignant tumors, and its expression is associated with that of PAX2. These data indicate that PAX2 is a positive regulator of expression of cyclin D1. We find that knockdown of PAX2 inhibits the activity of AP-1, a transcription factor that induces cyclin D1 expression, implying that PAX2 induces cyclin D1 through AP-1. PAX2 has little effect on expression of AP-1 members including c-Jun, c-Fos, and JunB. Our data show that PAX2 prevents JunB from binding c-Jun and enhances phosphorylation of c-Jun, which may elevate the activity of AP-1. Taken together, these results suggest that PAX2 promotes proliferation of colon cancer cells through AP-1."

To investigate the molecular features underlying this unusual behavior, we simulated the ion conduction through the selectivity filter at a fully atomistic level by means of molecular dynamics-based methods, using a homology-derived model. According to our calculations, permeation of potassium ions can occur along two pathways, one involving site vacancies inside the filter (showing an energy barrier of about 6 kcal mol(-1)), and the other characterized by the presence of a knock-on intermediate (about 8 kcal mol(-1)). These barriers are indeed in accordance with a low conductance behavior, and can be explained in terms of a series of distinctive structural features displayed by the hERG ion permeation pathway."

However, the volume and content of published biomedical literature on drug interactions is expanding rapidly, making it increasingly difficult for DDIs database curators to detect and collate DDIs information manually. In this paper, we propose a single kernel-based approach to extract DDIs from biomedical literature. This novel kernel-based approach can effectively make full use of syntactic structural information of the dependency graph. In particular, our approach can efficiently represent both single subgraph topological information and the relation of two subgraphs in the dependency graph.

MA also binds to RNA at a site that overlaps its PI(4,5)P(2) site, suggesting that RNA binding may protect MA from associating with inappropriate cellular membranes prior to PrGag delivery to the PM. Based on this, we have developed an assay in which small molecule competitors to MA-RNA binding can be characterized, with the assumption that such compounds might interfere with essential MA functions and help elucidate additional features of MA binding. Following this approach, we have identified four compounds, including three thiadiazolanes, that compete with RNA for MA binding. We also have identified MA residues involved in thiadiazolane binding and found that they overlap the MA PI(4,5)P(2) and RNA sites. Cell culture studies demonstrated that thiadiazolanes inhibit HIV-1 replication but are associated with significant levels of toxicity. Nevertheless, these observations provide new insights into MA binding and pave the way for the development of antivirals that target the HIV-1 matrix domain."
https://openalex.org/W2040689294,"Cyan fluorescent proteins (CFP) derived from Aequorea victoria GFP, carrying a tryptophan-based chromophore, are widely used as FRET donors in live cell fluorescence imaging experiments. Recently, several CFP variants with near-ultimate photophysical performances were obtained through a mix of site-directed and large scale random mutagenesis. To understand the structural bases of these improvements, we have studied more specifically the consequences of the single-site T65S mutation. We find that all CFP variants carrying the T65S mutation not only display an increased fluorescence quantum yield and a simpler fluorescence emission decay, but also show an improved pH stability and strongly reduced reversible photoswitching reactions. Most prominently, the Cerulean-T65S variant reaches performances nearly equivalent to those of mTurquoise, with QY = 0.84, an almost pure single exponential fluorescence decay and an outstanding stability in the acid pH range (pK1/2 = 3.6). From the detailed examination of crystallographic structures of different CFPs and GFPs, we conclude that these improvements stem from a shift in the thermodynamic balance between two well defined configurations of the residue 65 hydroxyl. These two configurations differ in their relative stabilization of a rigid chromophore, as well as in relaying the effects of Glu222 protonation at acid pHs. Our results suggest a simple method to greatly improve numerous FRET reporters used in cell imaging, and bring novel insights into the general structure-photophysics relationships of fluorescent proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1998335193,"LINE-1 (abbreviated L1) is a major class of retroelements in humans and mice. If unrestricted, retroelements accumulate in the cytoplasm and insert their DNA into the host genome, with the potential to cause autoimmune disease and cancer. Retroviruses and other retroelements are inhibited by proteins of the APOBEC family, of which activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a member. Although AID is mainly known for being a DNA mutator shaping the antibody repertoire in B lymphocytes, we found that AID also restricts de novo L1 integrations in B- and non-B-cell lines. It does so by decreasing the protein level of open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of both exogenous and endogenous L1. In activated B lymphocytes, AID deficiency increased L1 mRNA 1.6-fold and murine leukemia virus (MLV) mRNA 2.7-fold. In cell lines and activated B lymphocytes, AID forms cytoplasmic high-molecular-mass complexes with L1 mRNA, which may contribute to L1 restriction. Because AID-deficient activated B lymphocytes do not express ORF1 protein, we suggest that ORF1 protein expression is inhibited by additional restriction factors in these cells. The greater increase in MLV compared to L1 mRNA in AID-deficient activated B lymphocytes may indicate less strict surveillance of retrovirus."
https://openalex.org/W2083823678,"Alternative splicing represents a unique post-transcriptional mechanism that increases the complexity of the eukaryotic proteome-generating protein isoforms whose functions can be novel, diverse, and/or even antagonistic when compared to its full-length transcript. The KLF family of genes consists of ≥17 members, which are involved in the regulation of numerous critical cellular processes, including differentiation, cell proliferation, growth-related signal transduction, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Using a strategy based on RT-PCR, selective cloning, and promoter-based assays of cancer-relevant genes, we identify and characterize the existence of multiple biologically active KLF splice forms across the entire family of proteins. We demonstrate biological function for a number of these isoforms. Furthermore, we highlight a possible functional interaction between full-length KLF4 and one of its splice variants in up-regulating cellular proliferation. Taken together, this report identifies for the first time a more complete view of the genomic and proteomic breadth and complexity of the KLF transcription factor family, revealing the existence of highly expressed and biologically active isoforms previously uncharacterized. In essence, knowing that these KLF isoforms exist provides the first step toward understanding the roles of these genes in human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2016140551,"Beta-adrenoceptors (β-AR) play an important role in the neurohumoral regulation of cardiac function. Three β-AR subtypes (β(1), β(2), β(3)) have been described so far. Total deficiency of these adrenoceptors (TKO) results in cardiac hypotrophy and negative inotropy. TKO represents a unique mouse model mimicking total unselective medical β-blocker therapy in men. Electrophysiological characteristics of TKO have not yet been investigated in an animal model.In vivo electrophysiological studies using right heart catheterisation were performed in 10 TKO mice and 10 129SV wild type control mice (WT) at the age of 15 weeks. Standard surface ECG, intracardiac and electrophysiological parameters, and arrhythmia inducibility were analyzed.The surface ECG of TKO mice revealed a reduced heart rate (359.2±20.9 bpm vs. 461.1±33.3 bpm; p<0.001), prolonged P wave (17.5±3.0 ms vs. 15.1±1.2 ms; p = 0.019) and PQ time (40.8±2.4 ms vs. 37.3±3.0 ms; p = 0.013) compared to WT. Intracardiac ECG showed a significantly prolonged infra-Hisian conductance (HV-interval: 12.9±1.4 ms vs. 6.8±1.0 ms; p<0.001). Functional testing showed prolonged atrial and ventricular refractory periods in TKO (40.5±15.5 ms vs. 21.3±5.8 ms; p = 0.004; and 41.0±9.7 ms vs. 28.3±6.6 ms; p = 0.004, respectively). In TKO both the probability of induction of atrial fibrillation (12% vs. 24%; p<0.001) and of ventricular tachycardias (0% vs. 26%; p<0.001) were significantly reduced.TKO results in significant prolongations of cardiac conduction times and refractory periods. This was accompanied by a highly significant reduction of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Our finding confirms the importance of β-AR in arrhythmogenesis and the potential role of unspecific beta-receptor-blockade as therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2072143408,"Ricin is a member of the ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) family of plant and bacterial toxins. In this study we used a high-throughput, cell-based assay to screen more than 118,000 compounds from diverse chemical libraries for molecules that reduced ricin-induced cell death. We describe three compounds, PW66, PW69, and PW72 that at micromolar concentrations significantly delayed ricin-induced cell death. None of the compounds had any demonstrable effect on ricin's ability to arrest protein synthesis in cells or on ricin's enzymatic activity as assessed in vitro. Instead, all three compounds appear to function by blocking downstream stress-induced signaling pathways associated with the toxin-mediated apoptosis. PW66 virtually eliminated ricin-induced TNF-α secretion by J774A.1 macrophages and concomitantly blocked activation of the p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways. PW72 suppressed ricin-induced TNF-α secretion, but not p38 MAPK and JNK signaling. PW69 suppressed activity of the executioner caspases 3/7 in ricin toxin- and Shiga toxin 2-treated cells. While the actual molecular targets of the three compounds have yet to be identified, these data nevertheless underscore the potential of small molecules to down-regulate inflammatory signaling pathways associated with exposure to the RIP family of toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2013772874,"The signaling pathways that are essential for gastric organogenesis have been studied in some detail; however, those that regulate the maintenance of the gastric epithelium during adult homeostasis remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) and its main receptor, Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b), in adult glandular stomach homeostasis. We first showed that mouse adult glandular stomach expressed Fgf10, its receptors, Fgfr1b and Fgfr2b, and most of the other FGFR2b ligands (Fgf1, Fgf7, Fgf22) except for Fgf3 and Fgf20. Fgf10 expression was mesenchymal whereas FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression were mostly epithelial. Studying double transgenic mice that allow inducible overexpression of Fgf10 in adult mice, we showed that Fgf10 overexpression in normal adult glandular stomach increased epithelial proliferation, drove mucous neck cell differentiation, and reduced parietal and chief cell differentiation. Although a similar phenotype can be associated with the development of metaplasia, we found that Fgf10 overexpression for a short duration does not cause metaplasia. Finally, investigating double transgenic mice that allow the expression of a soluble form of Fgfr2b, FGF10's main receptor, which acts as a dominant negative, we found no significant changes in gastric epithelial proliferation or differentiation in the mutants. Our work provides evidence, for the first time, that the FGF10-FGFR2b signaling pathway is not required for epithelial proliferation and differentiation during adult glandular stomach homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1993560085,"Background Although the prevalence of inspiratory muscle strength training has increased in clinical medicine, its effect on diaphragm fiber remodeling is not well-understood and no relevant animal respiratory muscle strength training-rehabilitation experimental models exist. We tested the postulate that intrinsic transient tracheal occlusion (ITTO) conditioning in conscious animals would provide a novel experimental model of respiratory muscle strength training, and used significant increases in diaphragmatic fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) as the primary outcome measure. We hypothesized that ITTO would increase costal diaphragm fiber CSA and further hypothesized a greater duration and magnitude of occlusions would amplify remodeling. Methodology/Principal Findings Sprague-Dawley rats underwent surgical placement of a tracheal cuff and were randomly assigned to receive daily either 10-minute sessions of ITTO, extended-duration, 20-minute ITTO (ITTO-20), partial obstruction with 50% of cuff inflation pressure (ITTO-PAR) or observation (SHAM) over two weeks. After the interventions, fiber morphology, myosin heavy chain composition and CSA were examined in the crural and ventral, medial, and dorsal costal regions. In the medial costal diaphragm, with ITTO, type IIx/b fibers were 26% larger in the medial costal diaphragm (p<0.01) and 24% larger in the crural diaphragm (p<0.05). No significant changes in fiber composition or morphology were detected. ITTO-20 sessions also yielded significant increases in medial costal fiber cross-sectional area, but the effects were not greater than those elicited by 10-minute sessions. On the other hand, ITTO-PAR resulted in partial airway obstruction and did not generate fiber hypertrophy. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that the magnitude of the load was more influential in altering fiber cross-sectional area than extended-duration conditioning sessions. The results also indicated that ITTO was associated with type II fiber hypertrophy in the medial costal region of the diaphragm and may be an advantageous experimental model of clinical respiratory muscle strength training."
https://openalex.org/W2087474402,"Background Chronological aging of yeast cells is commonly used as a model for aging of human post-mitotic cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown on glucose in the presence of ammonium sulphate is mainly used in yeast aging research. We have analyzed chronological aging of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha grown at conditions that require primary peroxisome metabolism for growth. Methodology/Principal Findings The chronological lifespan of H. polymorpha is strongly enhanced when cells are grown on methanol or ethanol, metabolized by peroxisome enzymes, relative to growth on glucose that does not require peroxisomes. The short lifespan of H. polymorpha on glucose is mainly due to medium acidification, whereas most likely ROS do not play an important role. Growth of cells on methanol/methylamine instead of methanol/ammonium sulphate resulted in further lifespan enhancement. This was unrelated to medium acidification. We show that oxidation of methylamine by peroxisomal amine oxidase at carbon starvation conditions is responsible for lifespan extension. The methylamine oxidation product formaldehyde is further oxidized resulting in NADH generation, which contributes to increased ATP generation and reduction of ROS levels in the stationary phase. Conclusion/Significance We conclude that primary peroxisome metabolism enhanced chronological lifespan of H. polymorpha. Moreover, the possibility to generate NADH at carbon starvation conditions by an organic nitrogen source supports further extension of the lifespan of the cell. Consequently, the interpretation of CLS analyses in yeast should include possible effects on the energy status of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2153394592,"The di-2-pyridylketone thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT is a metal-chelating compound that has been demonstrated to have potent activity as an anticancer agent. Here we report that it also has a dramatic inhibitory effect on T-cell activation in vitro. We found that 10 nM Dp44mT (IC50 3.2 nM) prevented the up-regulation of surface CD25, and completely suppressed the activation and proliferation of splenic T cells isolated from Mus musculus that were stimulated with either T-cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking antibodies or phorbol ester plus ionomycin. In contrast, Dp44mT had no adverse effects on the survival of resting T cells. In addition, T cells stimulated in the presence of Dp44mT maintained the ability to upregulate CD69 surface expression and secrete interleu-kin-2. Consistent with these observations, Dp44mT did not inhibit multiple canonical signals downstream of the TCR, including the nuclear factor of activated T cells. The effects of Dp44mT were easily mitigated by addition of nontoxic copper chelators or N-acetylcysteine, indicating a role for copper and reactive oxygen species in its actions. Together, these findings suggest that Dp44mT may serve as a potent immunosuppressive agent that could complicate its use as a cancer therapeutic agent, but might have utility in the treatment of autoimmunity.—Gundelach, J.

https://openalex.org/W2143480500,"Actin plays fundamental roles in a variety of cell functions in eukaryotic cells. The polymerization-depolymerization cycle, between monomeric G-actin and fibrous F-actin, drives essential cell processes. Recently, we proposed the atomic model for the F-actin structure and found that actin was in the twisted form in the monomer and in the untwisted form in the filament. To understand how the polymerization process is regulated (Caspar, D. L. (1991) Curr. Biol. 1, 30-32), we need to know further details about the transition from the twisted to the untwisted form. For this purpose, we focused our attention on the Ala-108-Pro-112 loop, which must play crucial roles in the transition, and analyzed the consequences of the amino acid replacements on the polymerization process. As compared with the wild type, the polymerization of P109A was accelerated in both the nucleation and the elongation steps, and this was attributed to an increase in the frequency factor of the Arrhenius equation. The multiple conformations allowed by the substitution presumably resulted in the effective formation of the collision complex, thus accelerating polymerization. On the other hand, the A108G mutation reduced the rates of both nucleation and elongation due to an increase in the activation energy. In the cases of polymerization acceleration and deceleration, each functional aberration is attributed to a distinct elementary process. The rigidity of the loop, which mediates neither too strong nor too weak interactions between subdomains 1 and 3, might play crucial roles in actin polymerization."
