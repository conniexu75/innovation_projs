https://openalex.org/W2011042857,"Simple tandem-repetitive regions of DNA (or 'minisatellites') which are dispersed in the human genome frequently show substantial length polymorphism arising from unequal exchanges which alter the number of short tandem repeats in a minisatellite. We have shown previously that the repeat elements in a subset of human minisatellites share a common 10-15-base-pair (bp) 'core' sequence which might act as a recombination signal in the generation of these hypervariable regions. A hybridization probe consisting of the core repeated in tandem can detect many highly polymorphic minisatellites simultaneously to provide a set of genetic markers of general use in human linkage analysis. We now show that other variant (core)n probes can detect additional sets of hypervariable minisatellites to produce somatically stable DNA 'fingerprints' which are completely specific to an individual (or to his or her identical twin) and can be applied directly to problems of human identification, including parenthood testing."

https://openalex.org/W1480114110,"Platelets, and a variety of other cells, rapidly hydrolyze the phosphoinositides in response to stimulation by agonists. One of the products of hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which recently has been suggested to mediate intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. We have found that human platelets contain an enzyme that degrades inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. We have isolated this soluble enzyme and find that it hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Km = 30 microM, Vmax = 5.3 microM/min/mg of protein). The products of the reaction are inositol 1,4-diphosphate and phosphate. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme is 38,000 as determined both by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. This enzyme is specific for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Other water soluble inositol phosphates as well as phosphorylated sugars are not hydrolyzed, while the only inositol containing phospholipid hydrolyzed is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate at a rate less than 1% that for inositol 4,5-trisphosphate. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase requires Mg2+ for activity and is inhibited by Ca2+, Ki = 70 microM. Li+, up to 40 mM, has no effect on enzyme activity. The duration and magnitude of any inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate response in stimulated platelets may be determined by the activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1734562766,"The entire human kininogen gene has been isolated as a set of overlapping genomic DNA fragments, and the 11 exons encompassing approximately 27 kilobase pairs have been mapped by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequence determination. The nine 5'-terminal exons encode the 5'-untranslated region and the protein-coding region for the signal peptide and the heavy chain, which are common for high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) prekininogen mRNAs. Exon 10 consists of the common sequence for bradykinin and the immediately following unique sequence for HMW prekininogen mRNA. Exon 11 is then located following a 90-nucleotide sequence downstream from exon 10 and precisely specifies the sequence unique to LMW prekininogen mRNA. This, together with the hybridization analysis of total human cellular DNA, leads us to conclude that human HMW and LMW prekininogen mRNAs are produced from a single gene as a consequence of alternative RNA processing events. The structural analysis of the kininogen gene also shows that each of the nine 5'-terminal exons discretely specifies the nine protein domains observed in the amino-terminal portion of the kininogens. Furthermore, these nine genetic domains can be characterized by a thrice repeated pattern of three genetic segments, and two sets of these three domains, encompassing exons 3-5 and exons 6-8, are most closely related to each other. Therefore, we have proposed two successive duplication mechanisms as a model for the generation of the structure of the kininogen gene."

https://openalex.org/W1525478170,"Near full length cDNA clones for both alpha-/beta- and gamma-type gliadins were isolated and studied for sequence diversity. Based on restriction site polymorphism and cross-hybridization studies, alpha-/beta- and gamma-type clones could be divided into five and three homology classes, respectively. Clones representing each of the different classes were sequenced and compared. Sequence divergence between the classes was due to single-base substitutions and to duplications or deletions within or near direct repeats. Thus, through numerous duplications and subsequent divergence, the gliadin multigene family encodes a polymorphic set of polypeptides differing in both isoelectric point and molecular size. Southern blot analysis of wheat DNA suggested that the number of genes encoding the alpha-/beta-type gliadins was extremely large (greater than 100 copies/haploid genome). Inasmuch as hybridization patterns were the same using DNA isolated from seeds or leaves, amplification or rearrangement of DNA does not occur during development. The complete coding sequence of a gamma-gliadin was similar to that observed for the alpha-/beta-gliadins, but with several notable differences. Comparison of gamma-type gliadin cDNA sequences showed that, unlike the conserved dodecamer repeat common to all the alpha-/beta-gliadins, the tandem repeat unit differed among gamma-gliadin clones."
https://openalex.org/W1577743463,"Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (formerly known as ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase), from rabbit reticulocytes, has been shown to hydrolyze thiol esters formed between the ubiquitin carboxyl terminus and small thiols (e.g. glutathione), as well as free ubiquitin adenylate (Rose, I. A., and Warms, J. V. B. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 4234-4237). We now show that this enzyme hydrolyzes amide derivatives of the ubiquitin carboxyl terminus, including those of lysine (epsilon-amino), glycine methyl ester, and spermidine. It also hydrolyzes ubiquitin COOH-terminal hydroxamic acid, but is inactivated under the conditions for assaying ubiquitin-hydroxylamine adduct hydrolysis. Amide adducts formed between ubiquitin and epsilon-amino groups of protein lysine residues are much poorer substrates than is the ubiquitin amide of the epsilon-amino group of free lysine. The enzyme is thus a general hydrolase that recognizes the ubiquitin moiety, but is highly selective for small ubiquitin derivatives. It probably functions to regenerate ubiquitin from adventitiously formed ubiquitin amides and thiol esters. It also has the correct specificity to function in regenerating ubiquitin from small ubiquitin peptides that are probable end products of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. A simple, large-scale preparation of the enzyme from human erythrocytes is described."

https://openalex.org/W1547637982,"Monoclonal antibodies to the human nerve growth factor receptor have been used to biochemically characterize the receptor in the human melanoma cell line A875. Labeling of A875 cell proteins by culture with [35S]cysteine or labeling of cell surface proteins with 125I followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-nerve growth factor receptor antibody reveals a receptor protein with an apparent Mr of 70,000-75,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.9-5.2. Incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into this species indicates it is a glycoprotein. The receptor becomes phosphorylated on serine residues in intact cells and in isolated membranes incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. The receptor appears to exist, at least partially, in the form of a disulfide-linked oligomer (probably a dimer) of Mr = 75,000 subunits. Kinetic [35S]cysteine labeling studies reveal an Mr = 59,000 core protein which is glycosylated via N-linked and probably also O-linked sugar moieties to produce the mature (Mr = 70,000-75,000) receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1614919593,"The gene structure of cytochrome P-450b, a major form of phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 in rat livers was elucidated by sequence analysis of the cloned genomic DNAs and was compared with the previously determined gene structures of cytochrome P-450e, a minor form of phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 and two forms of 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible cytochrome P-450 (P-450c and -d). The gene for cytochrome P-450b is 23 kilobase pairs (kb) long and is separated into 9 exons by 8 intervening sequences. This gene structure is very similar to that of cytochrome P-450e except for the first intron, the first intron being much longer in cytochrome P-450b gene (approximately 12 kb) than in cytochrome P-450e gene (3.2 kb), but differs greatly from the gene structures of two 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible cytochrome P-450s as pointed out previously (Sogawa, K., Gotoh, O., Kawajiri, K. & Fujii-Kuriyama, Y. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 5066-5070). The nucleotide sequences in all 9 exons and their flanking regions in introns show very close homology between the two phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 genes. Forty base substitutions are found in approximately 1900 nucleotides of all exonic sequences, and 15 of them result in 14 amino acid replacements. These base substitutions occur in relatively limited regions of the gene sequences. Most of them are found in exons 6, 7, 8, and 9, most frequently in exon 7 as described previously (Mizukami, Y., Sogawa, K., Suwa, Y., Muramatsu, M. & Fujii-Kuriyama, Y. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 3958-3962). The close sequence homology between the two phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 genes is also found to extend to the promoter region with one notable exception. The simple repeated sequences of (CA)n which is present at -254 position in cytochrome P-450e gene is also observed at the equivalent position in cytochrome P-450b gene, but the repetitiveness is greatly reduced in cytochrome P-450b gene ((CA)5 for P-450b versus (CA)19 for P-450e), and this may somehow be related to the difference in the level of cytochrome P-450b and P-450e in the inductive phase of phenobarbital administration."
https://openalex.org/W1529232018,"It is well known that catalase is transformed to nitric oxide-Fe2+-catalase by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plus azide. In this report, we show that myeloperoxidase is also inactivated by H2O2 plus azide. Utilizing this system, we studied the presence and source of intracellular H2O2 generated by activated neutrophils. Stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 100 ng/ml) plus azide (5 mM) for 30 min completely inactivated intragranular myeloperoxidase and reduced cytosolic catalase to 35% of resting cells. This intracellular inactivation of heme enzymes did not occur in normal neutrophils incubated with either PMA or azide alone or in neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CDG) which cannot produce H2O2 in response to PMA. Incubation of neutrophils with azide and a H2O2 generating system (glucose-glucose oxidase) inactivated 41% of neutrophil myeloperoxidase. Glutathione-glutathione peroxidase (GSH-GSH peroxidase), an extracellular H2O2 scavenger, totally protected neutrophil myeloperoxidase from inactivation by azide plus glucose-glucose oxidase. In addition, when a mixture of normal and CGD cells was stimulated with PMA in the presence of azide, 90% of the myeloperoxidase in CGD neutrophils was inactivated. Therefore, H2O2 released extracellularly from activated neutrophils can diffuse into cells. In contrast, myeloperoxidase in normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with PMA in the presence of azide and GSH-GSH peroxidase was 75% inactivated. Thus, the results indicate that a GSH-GSH peroxidase-insensitive pool of H2O2 is also generated, presumably at the plasma membrane, and this pool of H2O2 can undergo direct internal diffusion to inactivate myeloperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1518741632,"The hemoprotein ligninase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds. catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of lignin model dimers between C alpha and C beta of their propyl side chains. The model dimers hitherto used give multiple products and complex stoichiometries upon enzymatic oxidation. Here we present experiments with a new model dimer, 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethanediol (dimethoxyhydrobenzoin, DMHB) which is quantitatively cleaved by ligninase in air to give benzaldehyde and veratraldehyde according to the stoichiometry: 2DMHB + O2----2PhCHO + 2Ph(OMe)2CHO. Catalytic amounts of H2O2 are required for this aerobic reaction. Under anaerobic conditions, ligninase uses H2O2 as the oxidant for cleavage: DMHB + H2O2----PhCHO + Ph(OMe)2CHO. Electron spin resonance experiments done in the presence of spin traps, 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane or 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, show that C alpha-C beta cleavage yields alpha-hydroxybenzyl radicals as intermediate products. Under anaerobic conditions, these radicals react further to give the final aldehyde products. In air, O2 adds to the carbon-centered radicals, probably giving alpha-hydroxybenzylperoxyl radicals which fragment to yield superoxide, benzaldehyde, and veratraldehyde. These results lead us to propose a mechanism for C alpha-C beta cleavage in which attack by ligninase and H2O2 on the methoxylated ring of DMHB yields a cation radical, which then cleaves to give either benzaldehyde and an alpha-hydroxy(dimethoxybenzyl) radical or veratraldehyde and an alpha-hydroxybenzyl radical (cf. Kersten, P. J., Tien, M., Kalyanaraman, B., and Kirk, T.K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2609-2612; Snook, M. E., and Hamilton, G. A. (1974) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 96, 860-869). Similar mechanisms probably apply to the enzymatic C alpha-C beta cleavage of natural lignin."

https://openalex.org/W1554120835,"The murine Leydig tumor cell line, MLTC-1, contains gonadotropin receptors and a gonadotropin-responsive adenylate cyclase system that became refractory (desensitized) when exposed to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). MLTC-1 cells also contain phorbol ester receptors with a Kd of 53 nM for [3H]phorbol dibutyrate. Exposing cells to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) also causes desensitization of the hCG response. TPA-induced desensitization was similar to hCG-induced desensitization by every criteria tested. Both TPA- and hCG-induced desensitization caused approximately 50% loss of the hormone response within 30 min. Neither TPA or hCG altered receptor affinity for hCG. The dose response of adenylate cyclase to hCG or GTP in isolated membranes was not affected by either hCG- or TPA-induced desensitization. Similarly the dose response to hCG of cAMP accumulation in intact cells was not altered by desensitization with hCG or TPA. It was determined that MLTC-1 cells have Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase activity that displayed a dose-dependent response to TPA. The concentration of TPA required to activate the protein kinase was similar to that required for desensitization. Phorbol esters that were unable to activate protein kinase C were also unable to desensitize MLTC-1 cells. The protein kinase from MLTC-1 cells was also activated by diacylglycerol. In addition, diacylglycerols caused desensitization of the hCG response. TPA- and diacylglycerol-induced desensitization is probably mediated by protein kinase C, and the similarities between hCG- and TPA-induced refractoriness suggests a convergence of mechanisms at some point of MLTC-1 cell desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1550576044,"Recombinant human immune interferon (HuIFN-gamma) was labeled with [gamma-32P]ATP and cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart to a specific radioactivity of 11,000 Ci/mmol. At least two molecules of phosphate were incorporated per molecule of interferon. The binding of [32P]HuIFN-gamma to human U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells was time dependent, and displaceable by HuIFN-gamma but not by HuIFN-alpha A or HuIFN-beta. The specific binding was saturable with less than 10% nonspecific binding. The dissociation constant of [32P]HuIFN-gamma for U937 interferon receptors was calculated to be 1.5 X 10(-10) M with a total of 1,800 binding sites/cell. Dissociation of bound [32P]IFN-gamma at 24 degrees C exhibited two distinct rates. A fast dissociation with a specific rate constant of 0.141 min-1, and a slow dissociation with a specific rate constant of 0.0027 min-1. The Kd for [32P]HuIFN-gamma was calculated from kinetic constants to be 5.4 X 10(-10) M."
https://openalex.org/W1564492178,"The properties of the Na+/H+ exchange system have been studied with 22Na+ uptake techniques at two stages of muscle development: proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. The characteristics of the interactions of the exchanger with external H+, with external Na+, and with amiloride or its more potent analogs are the same at both stages of development. Differences between the two stages of development concern: (i) the internal pH (pHi) dependence of the Na+/H+ exchanger, and (ii) the activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by serum and phorbol ester which is observed in myoblasts but not in myotubes. Properties of the Na+/H+ exchanger in myoblasts after serum activation seem to be identical to those observed in myotubes with or without serum as if myotube formation stabilized a fully activated state of the exchanger. The activation of the myoblast Na+/H+ exchange system by serum is due to a shift of the pHi dependence towards alkaline pHi values and to an increase in the maximal activity of the Na+/H+ exchange system at acidic pH. Phorbol esters which are well-known activators of protein kinase C can only partially mimic the effects of serum on the Na+/H+ exchanger: they produce a shift of the pH dependence, but they do not increase the maximal activity at acidic pH."

https://openalex.org/W1510785746,"Mitochondrial porin, the outer membrane pore-forming protein, was isolated in the presence of detergents and converted into a water-soluble form. This water-soluble porin existed under nondenaturing conditions as a mixture of dimers and oligomers. The proportion of dimers increased with decreasing porin concentration during conversion. Water-soluble porin inserted spontaneously into artificial bilayers as did detergent-solubilized porin. Whereas the latter form had no specific requirements for the lipid composition of the bilayer, water-soluble porin inserted only into membranes containing a sterol, and only in the presence of very low concentrations of Triton X-100 (0.001% w/v) in the solution bathing the bilayer. The channels formed by water-soluble porin were indistinguishable from those formed by detergent-purified porin with respect to specific conductance and voltage dependence of conductance. Water-soluble porin bound tightly in a saturable fashion to isolated mitochondria. The bound form was readily accessible to added protease, indicating its presence on the mitochondrial surface. The number of binding sites was in the range of 5-10 pmol/mg of mitochondrial protein. Water-soluble porin apparently binds to a site on the assembly pathway of the porin precursor, since mitochondria whose binding sites were saturated with the water-soluble form did not import porin precursor synthesized in a cell-free system."
https://openalex.org/W148648419,Synthetic rat atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was derivatized with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [125I]iodoazidosalicylic acid to yield a radioactive photoaffinity probe. Incubation of purified plasma membranes from rat kidney cortex with this photoaffinity probe resulted in the specific labeling of a 140-kDa glycoprotein. The photoaffinity labeling of this protein was inhibited by ANF but not by reduced and alkylated ANF nor by other unrelated peptides. A 140-kDa band was also specifically labeled in liver plasma membranes but not in adipocyte plasma membranes. These observations suggest strongly that the 140-kDa glycoprotein is the ANF receptor.
https://openalex.org/W1593594279,"Sequences termed v-abl, which encode the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of Abelson murine leukemia virus, have been expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion product (ptabl50 kinase). This fusion protein contains 80 amino acids of SV40 small t and the 403 amino acid protein kinase domain of v-abl. We report here the purification and characterization of this kinase. The purified material contains two proteins (Mr = 59,800 and 57,200), both of which possess sequences derived from v-abl. Overall purification was 3,750-fold, with a 31% yield, such that 117 micrograms of kinase could be obtained from 40 g of E. coli within 6-7 days. The specific kinase activity is over 170 mumol of phosphate min-1 mumol-1, comparable to the most active protein-serine kinases. Kinase activity is insensitive to K+, Na+, Ca2+, Ca2+-calmodulin, cAMP, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor. The Km for ATP is dependent on the concentration of the second substrate. GTP can also be used as a phosphate donor. The enzyme can phosphorylate peptides consisting of as few as two amino acids and, at a very low rate, free tyrosine. Incubation of the kinase with [gamma-32P]ATP results in incorporation of 1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. This reaction, however, cannot be blocked by prior incubation with unlabeled ATP. Incubation of 32P-labeled kinase with either ADP or ATP results in the synthesis of [32P]ATP. This suggests the phosphotyrosine residue on the Abelson kinase contains a high energy phosphate bond."
https://openalex.org/W1572476018,"Treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells with phospholipase C was previously shown to stimulate the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, and to cause activation of the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase with a concomitant change in subcellular location of the enzyme (Sleight, R., and Kent, C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 831-835). This paper presents a detailed analysis of the early events in the phospholipase C treatment, and provides evidence that the increased cytidylyltransferase activity causes the increased flux through the pathway. The time courses for the increase in cytidylyltransferase activity, increase in amount of membrane-associated enzyme, decrease in phosphocholine levels, and increase in phosphatidylcholine synthesis were similar, with all changes occurring within 30 min after addition of phospholipase C. These events preceded a decrease in cellular choline levels which correlated with a decreased capacity for choline uptake. The rate at which radioactive label was lost from pulse-labeled phosphocholine was the same as the rate at which label was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, and these rates were stimulated 2.2-fold by phospholipase C treatment. We have also shown that the association of cytidylyltransferase with membranes was rapidly reversible when phospholipase C was removed from the cultures, and that the rate of decrease in phosphatidylcholine synthesis paralleled the rate of decrease in cytidylyltransferase activity. Cytidylyltransferase became reassociated with membranes when phospholipase C was added back to cultures from which it was previously removed. These results represent the first detailed account of the time frame involved in regulating phosphatidylcholine synthesis by the reversible association of cytidylyltransferase with cellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1510123979,"Previous research has shown that binding sites for hyaluronate are present on the surfaces of a number of different cell types. To further characterize these binding sites, membranes were prepared from SV-3T3 cells and dissolved in a solution of sodium deoxycholate. Hyaluronate binding activity was detected by mixing the sodium deoxycholate extract with [3H]hyaluronate and then adding an equal volume of saturated (NH4)2SO4, which precipitated the binding protein and any [3H]hyaluronate associated with it, but left free [3H]hyaluronate in solution. Following partial purification by hydroxylapatite chromatography, the binding site was examined by molecular sieve chromatography and by rate-zonal centrifugation, which revealed that it has a Stokes radius of 6.5 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.8 S. From these values, it was possible to calculate that the sodium deoxycholate-solubilized binding site has a frictional coefficient of 1.87 and a molecular weight of 132,000. Since this latter value applies to the complex of both detergent and protein, the binding protein by itself must have a molecular weight lower than 132,000. To determine the molecular weight of the hyaluronate binding site itself, the protein was purified by the sequential application of hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieve chromatography, rate-zonal centrifugation, and finally lectin-affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-agarose. Analysis of the purified material by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an 85,000 Mr protein which has been identified as the binding site. This protein was also detected on nitrocellulose blots which had been specifically stained for concanavalin A binding material, suggesting that the binding site is a glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1481922413,"We have previously shown that newly synthesized liver secretory proteins are exported at three distinct characteristic rates, with intracellular retention half-times of 110-120 min (e.g. transferrin), 75-80 min (e.g. ceruloplasmin), and 30-40 min (e.g. alpha 1-protease inhibitor) (J. B. Parent, H. Bauer, and K. Olden (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press). In the present study we have determined the average time required for specific glycoproteins to move through the various compartments of the intracellular transport pathway, consisting of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Localization in particular compartments was monitored by the use of the following complementary approaches: (i) Percoll density gradient fractionation of the subcellular organelles, (ii) sensitivity of the glycan moiety of N-linked glycosylation to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and (iii) by the lectin-binding characteristics. The cell fractionation studies revealed that alpha 1-protease inhibitor, ceruloplasmin, and transferrin were transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum with a retention half-time of 10, 30, or 45 min, respectively. Measurements of the rate at which newly synthesized glycoprotein became endo H-resistant (an event localized near the medial region of Golgi) demonstrated that it took 60-70, 30, and 18 min for 50% of transferrin, ceruloplasmin, and alpha 1-protease inhibitor, respectively, to reach the medial Golgi. Consistent with this finding, maximal binding of transferrin to wheat germ agglutinin (also a medial Golgi event) and Ricinus communis agglutinin I (a trans Golgi event) required 75 and 90 min, respectively, and maximal binding of ceruloplasmin to both lectins occurred in approximately 30 min. Maximal binding of alpha 1-protease inhibitor to wheat germ agglutinin and Ricinus communis agglutinin I required 15 and 30 min, respectively. The results presented here clearly indicate that (i) the time required for protein secretion cannot be entirely accounted for by lag in transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi since the glycoproteins examined are retained in the former organelle for no more than two-fifths of the total intracellular retention half-time, and (ii) the variability in rates of protein secretion is not due solely to differences in rates of transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi as variability in retention within the Golgi is also demonstrated. The results are discussed in terms of their compatibility with receptor-mediated transport of glycoproteins in both the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1568401901,"Abstract The yeast GDH1 gene encodes NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase. This gene was isolated by complementation of an Escherichia coli glutamate auxotroph. NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase was overproduced 6-10-fold in Saccharomyces cerevisiae bearing GDH1 on a multicopy plasmid. The nucleotide sequence of the 1362-base pair coding region and 5' and 3' flanking sequences were determined. Transcription start sites were located by S1 nuclease mapping. Regulation of GDH1 was not maintained when the gene was present on a multicopy plasmid. Protein secondary structure predictions identified a region with potential to form the dinucleotide-binding domain. The amino acid sequences of the yeast and Neurospora crassa enzymes are 63% conserved. Unlike the N. crassa gene, yeast GDH1 has no introns."
https://openalex.org/W1592681337,"Two Drosophila genes that code for the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) have been isolated and their structures determined by DNA sequence analysis. The two genes, Gadph-1 and Gapdh-2, are homologous to each other in their coding regions but differ entirely in the 5' and 3' flanking regions. Both genes are functionally expressed in adult flies as determined by Northern blot analysis using gene-specific probes. Gapdh-1 is mapped by in situ hybridization at position 43E-F on the right arm of the second chromosome and Gapdh-2 at position 13F on the left arm of the X chromosome. Transcription initiation sites as well as polyadenylation sites for both Gapdh transcripts have also been determined. Gapdh-1 lacks a sequence homologous to the TATA box in its -30-base pair region that is characteristic of many RNA polymerase II transcribed promoters. In contrast, Gapdh-2 contains a consensus TATA box sequence as well as a CAAT box in its promoter region. Furthermore, a sequence element ATTTGCAT (dc) and nontandem multiple direct repeats have been found in the -35 to -155-base pair 5' flanking region. Other than the intron located in the 5' noncoding region of Gapdh-2, both genes lack intervening sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1576168684,"The enzymatic domains of the avian retrovirus polymerase (pol) gene have been mapped by the use of peptide antibodies and COOH-terminal amino acid analysis. The processed pol beta polypeptide is cleaved in vivo to yield alpha and pp32. Rabbit antibodies were directed against synthetic peptides whose sequence was deduced from the known pol sequence of Rous sarcoma virus, Prague C (Schwartz, D.E., Tizard, R., and Gilbert, W. (1983) Cell 32, 853-869). The RNase H active site of pol was located in the NH2-terminal region of the alpha DNA polymerase subunit. The COOH terminus of the alpha subunit was found to be immediately adjacent to the NH2 terminus of the pp32 pol protein. COOH-terminal amino acid analysis of pp32 revealed that this protein is also processed. From the deduced amino acid sequence of pol, it appears likely that pol encodes an additional 4100-dalton polypeptide located at its extreme COOH terminus. The enzymatic domains on beta appear to map in the following order: RNase H-DNA polymerase-DNA endonuclease. Hydrophilicity analysis and secondary structure predictions of wild type Rous sarcoma virus pol products and mutated pp32 possessing single amino acid changes permit further structural evaluation of the multifunctional pol protein."

The midpoint potential (Em) between the ferric and ferrous forms of the enzyme exhibited a pH-dependent change between pH 4 and 9, and the effect of added chloride ion indicated that Cl- competed with OH- for a binding site on the enzyme. Interestingly, the pH dependence of the Em indicated that the overall redox reactions of the enzyme was: ferric myeloperoxidase + 2e- + 1H+ = ferrous myeloperoxidase. Myeloperoxidase exhibited a rhombic high spin EPR signal which exhibited reduced rhombicity upon the binding of chloride. Our results strongly suggest that chloride binds to the sixth coordination position of the chlorin iron in myeloperoxidase by replacing the water which is the sixth ligand in the resting state. It is also concluded that the two iron centers are identical and that there is no interaction between them."
https://openalex.org/W1491307696,"The plasmid pT181 of Staphylococcus aureus consists of 4437 base pairs and encodes resistance to tetracycline. Initiation of pT181 replication specifically requires the plasmid-encoded repC protein. An in vitro system has been shown to carry out semiconservative replication of pT181 and its derivative plasmids (Khan, S A., Carleton, S. M., and Novick, R. P. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 4902-4906). We have used this replication assay to isolate repC protein, which was purified to near homogeneity. The repC gene was cloned into the pKJB825 plasmid that contains the phage lambda temperature-sensitive repressor gene, cI857, and the rightward promoter, PR. Upon temperature induction, Escherichia coli clones containing the recombinant plasmid overproduced repC protein, which was purified in significant quantities. The molecular weight of repC protein under denaturing conditions is 38,000, which is consistent with the size predicted from the DNA sequence data. Presence of repC protein was absolutely essential for the initiation of replication of pT181 and its derivatives in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1610265054,"Polynuclear iron complexes of Fe(III) and phosphate occur in seawater and soils and in cells where the iron core of ferritin, the iron storage protein, contains up to 4500 Fe atoms in a complex with an average composition of (FeO.OH)8FeO.OPO3H2. Although phosphate influences the size of the ferritin core and thus the availability of stored iron, little is known about the nature of the Fe(III)-phosphate interaction. In the present study, Fe-phosphate interactions were analyzed in stable complexes of Fe(III).ATP which, in the polynuclear iron form, had phosphate at interior sites. Such Fe(III).ATP complexes are important not only as models but also because they may play a role in intracellular iron transport and in iron toxicity; the complexes were studied by extended x-ray absorption fine structure, EPR, NMR spectroscopy, and measurement of proton release. Mononuclear iron complexes exhibiting a g' = 4.3 EPR signal were formed at Fe:ATP ratios less than or equal to 1:3, and polynuclear iron complexes (Fe greater than or equal to 250, EPR silent at g' = 4.3) were formed at an Fe:ATP ratio of 4:1. No NMR signals due to ATP were observed when Fe was in excess (Fe:ATP = 4:1). Extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis of the polynuclear Fe(III).ATP complex was able to distinguish an Fe-P distance at 3.27 A in addition to the octahedral O at 1.95 A and 4-5 Fe atoms at 3.36 A. The Fe-O and Fe-Fe distances are the same as in ferritin, and the Fe-P distance is analogous to that in another metal-ATP complex. An observable Fe-P environment in such a large polynuclear iron cluster as the Fe(III).ATP (4:1) complex indicates that the phosphate is distributed throughout rather than merely on the surface, in contrast to earlier models of chelate-stabilized iron clusters. Complexes of Fe(III) and ATP similar to those described here may form in vivo either as normal components of intracellular iron metabolism or during iron excess where the consequent alteration of free nucleotide triphosphate pools could contribute to the observed toxicity of iron."
https://openalex.org/W1576052266,"We report here the identification of the amino acid residue which forms the covalent intermediate in the catalytic mechanism of bovine intestinal 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase and the sequence of the neighboring amino acids. The active site of 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase was labeled using thymidine 5'-[alpha-32P]triphosphate as substrate. A single labeled cyanogen bromide peptide was isolated using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. After subdigestion with endoproteinase Lys-C and chymotrypsin, the entire amino acid sequence of the 60-residue active site peptide was obtained using automated Edman degradation. All of the radioactivity of the active site peptide was localized to a hexapeptide with sequence Thr-Phe-Pro-Asn-His-Tyr. Phosphoamino acid analysis of this peptide indicated that the labeled residue was threonine. We are not aware of any other enzymes in which threonine is phosphorylated as a covalent intermediate in the catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1535432942,"Abstract The effects of Mg2+ and guanine nucleotides on glucagon binding to its receptor were studied using [125I-Tyr10]monoiodoglucagon. Contrary to findings with beta-adrenergic receptors, high affinity binding of the stimulatory hormone was not dependent on Mg2+ and low affinity binding could be obtained on nucleotide addition regardless of presence of Mg2+. GDP, guanyl-5'-yl thiophosphate (GDP beta S), GTP, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P) were all able to induce low affinity hormone binding. Since the Ns component of adenylyl cyclase, with which the receptor interacts, is inactive in stimulating the catalytic component C of adenylyl cyclase in the absence of Mg2+, both before and after GDP addition, it is suggested that Ns has at least two domains that change conformation independently of each other: a r domain, that interacts with the receptor and confers to it high affinity binding, and a c domain, that interacts with the catalyst C and stimulates it. It is suggested further that Ns is r+c- when stabilizing the receptor in its conformation with high affinity for hormone, and r-c- when under the influence of GDP which results in the receptor adopting the conformation that exhibits low affinity for the hormone. Comparison of potencies of the four nucleotides to induce low affinity binding showed that GDP and GDP beta S were equipotent and 10 times more potent than GTP and 100 times more potent than GMP-P(NH)P. Under the conditions used it was impossible to substantiate that the effects of GTP or GMP-P(NH)P were not due to formation of GDP from GTP or presence of GDP-like material in GMP-P(NH)P. It is suggested that, contrary to widely held opinions, GDP and GDP-like compounds, and not GTP or its analogs, are responsible for the lowering of the affinity of adenylyl cyclase stimulating receptors for their hormones or agonists. Furthermore, the experiments suggest that the c+ conformation of the c domain of Ns co-exists with the r+ and not the r- conformation of its r domain."
https://openalex.org/W1565307995,"The interaction of ADP with platelets leads to shape change, exposure of fibrinogen binding sites, and aggregation, all of which have been shown to be inhibited by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA), an alkylating analogue of adenine nucleotides which binds covalently to a 100-kDa polypeptide in intact platelet membranes (Figures, W. R., Niewiarowski, S., Morinelli, T., Colman, R. F., and Colman, R. W. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7789-7795). In plasma, FSBA can break down to adenosine which stimulates adenylate cyclase. To distinguish between direct effects of FSBA and the actions of adenosine, we have used washed platelet suspensions and adenosine deaminase. We studied the effects of FSBA on shape change and cyclic AMP metabolism, and on the binding of 2-methylthio-ADP, which mimics the effects of ADP on cyclic AMP metabolism at concentrations too low to activate platelets. Inhibition of ADP-induced shape change of platelets incubated with FSBA for 2 min in platelet-rich plasma was greatly reduced by adenosine deaminase. In the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 100 microM FSBA increased platelet cyclic AMP to the same extent as did 10 microM adenosine. These effects were inhibited by theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, and by adenosine deaminase. Incubation of washed platelets for 60 min with FSBA and adenosine deaminase caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of ADP-induced shape change. Inhibition closely paralleled the covalent incorporation of 3H from tritiated FSBA into platelet membranes. Under these conditions, FSBA did not block inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation by ADP, nor did it block the binding of 2-methylthio-ADP. We conclude that part of the inhibition of shape change caused by brief exposure to FSBA is due to adenosine, but at longer times shape change is inhibited in association with covalent incorporation of sulfonylbenzoyladenosine. This effect of FSBA is independent of adenosine and occurs at a site distinct from that at which ADP inhibits adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1498860939,"The fluorescent probes, N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-phosphatidylethanolamine and lissamine-rhodamine-B-sulfonylphosphatidylethanolamine, were inserted at the appropriate surface density into membranes of reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes, thus allowing transfer of energy between the fluorescent probes. In addition, only the fluorescent molecule N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-phosphatidylethanolamine was inserted into the viral envelopes, resulting in self-quenching. Incubation of fluorescent, reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes with human erythrocyte ghosts resulted in either reduction in the efficiency of energy transfer or in fluorescence dequenching. No reduction in the efficiency of energy transfer or fluorescence dequenching was observed when fluorescent, reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes were incubated with glutaraldehyde-fixed or desialized human erythrocyte ghosts. Similarly, no change in the fluorescence value was observed when nonfusogenic, reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes were incubated with human erythrocyte ghosts. These results clearly show that reduction in the efficiency of energy transfer or dequenching is due to virus-membrane fusion and not to lipid-lipid exchange. Incubation of reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes, carrying inserted N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazolephosphatidylethanolamine, with cultured cells also resulted in a significant and measurable dequenching. However, incubation of nonfusogenic, fluorescent reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes with hepatoma tissue culture cells also resulted in fluorescent dequenching, the degree of which was about 50% of that observed with fusogenic, fluorescent reconstituted viral envelopes. It is therefore possible that, in addition to virus-membrane fusion, endocytosis of fluorescent viral envelopes results in fluorescence dequenching as well."

https://openalex.org/W1533105292,"Mechanisms controlling the local generation of angiotensin II by vascular tissue are incompletely understood. Human platelets were examined for their ability to metabolize angiotensin I. Platelet-dependent angiotensin I metabolism was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography assay which allowed quantitation of angiotensin I substrate utilized and products formed. The major product of platelet-dependent angiotensin I metabolism was identified as des-Leu10-angiotensin I. The platelet des-Leu10-angiotensin I-generating activity had a pH optimum of 6.0-6.5 and was inhibited 100% by mersalyl acid (10(-4) M), 86% by leupeptin (10(-4) M), and 95% by iodoacetamide (10(-2) M). The activity had an approximate Mr = 70,000 as determined by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. Intact human platelets stimulated with calcium ionophore (1-10 microM) released 13.7-30.8% of the des-Leu10-angiotensin I-generating activity. Des-Leu10-angiotensin I, the major product of platelet angiotensin I metabolism, inhibited human serum and purified rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzymes with an I50 of 3.7 X 10(-6) and 2.0 X 10(-6) M, respectively. These results suggest that the platelet may control local angiotensin II formation at vascular sites both by metabolism of the precursor peptide angiotensin I and by generation of an endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, des-Leu10-angiotensin I. This platelet-dependent pathway may contribute to the control of local levels of vasoactive peptides, such as bradykinin and angiotensin II, so as to alter local tissue blood flow."

https://openalex.org/W1533548516,"Rat skeletal myoblasts contain two cytosolic cAMP-dependent protein kinases, types I and II. Photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-cAMP reveals the presence of regulatory subunits of Mr = 52,000, 47,000, and 36,000. The Mr = 52,000 and 47,000 subunits are very likely RII and RI, respectively, while the Mr = 36,000 subunit appears to be a proteolytic product of RI, as judged by its cross-reactivity to anti-RI antiserum. The total protein kinase activity increases about 3-fold during the fusion of myoblasts. In parallel with this increase, the concentration of RI subunit also increases, while the levels of RII remain unchanged. Myoblast mutants which lack the capability to differentiate both biochemically and morphologically also lack the ability to increase the concentration of RI subunit. This ability is restored in complementing somatic hybrids which regain the capability to differentiate."
https://openalex.org/W1519233895,"We have used single strand specific nucleases to map DNA distortion in the adult chicken beta A-globin gene. We have detected two structures of that kind and have mapped nuclease-cutting sites at one base resolution. One prominent site is centered at -190 relative to the RNA capping site and is positioned at the center of a stretch of contiguous C residues. The second site is near the first intron/exon junction (+620) and appears as a series of discrete 1-base-long enzyme-cutting sites. Based upon the pattern of nuclease cutting and the kinetics of nuclease cutting we conclude that the poly(C) stretch may assume a looped geometry in supertwisted DNA molecules which is similar to that proposed by Felsenfeld (Nickol, J. M., and Felsenfeld, G. (1983) Cell 35, 467-477). We show that S1 nuclease cuts within the intron occur mainly at the end points of polypurine segments and suggest that such end points may assume a distorted transitional geometry. We find that Neurospora crassa endonuclease cuts both the promotor and intron sites in linear DNA molecules but that in linear DNA the cutting process is limited by a first order conformation change of the DNA substrate. Based upon those kinetics we propose that in unstressed DNA, each of the two sites can convert between a distorted and undistorted geometry. In the enzyme assay buffer at 37 degrees C, the time constant for the equilibrium is nearly 10 h for the promotor site and 7 h for the intron."
https://openalex.org/W1591575483,"The distribution of a lipophilic spin probe, 5-doxyl stearate, between the inner and outer halves of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) bilayer was determined by titration with Ni X EDTA, a spin broadening agent. Titrations were also performed with Fe(CN)3-6 and with the solvated Ni2+ cation. Ni X EDTA titrations reached a clearly defined asymptote at 35% signal reduction. Fe(CN)3-6 and Ni2+ titrations gave biphasic curves but showed 35% of the signal to be readily eliminated at low concentrations. When the Ni2+ cation was used with ionophore, titrations indicated that 96% of the probe is aligned in the bilayer with the spin moiety at either the inner or outer interface. It was concluded that the spin probe distribution between the outer and inner halves of the SR bilayer is 35:65, respectively. Titrations performed on vesicles of purified SR lipids gave a ratio of 60 exposed:40 protected, consistent with the vesicular geometry. In addition the spin probe distribution in SR vesicles did not vary as a function of temperature, salt concentration, or spin probe concentration. On this basis it was concluded that the spin probe distribution gives a reasonable estimation of the volume of fluid lipids available to readily solubilize the probe in each half of the bilayer and that the observed asymmetry in distribution is due to the presence of SR proteins which were eliminated in the pure lipid vesicles. Furthermore, as EDTA is unique in its ability to chelate transition metals, Ca2+ and EGTA can be used in Ni X EDTA titrations without altering the chelation of Ni2+. Known changes in ATPase conformation accompanying Ca2+ and adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate X Mg binding did not affect the spin probe distribution. However, phosphorylation of the enzyme by Pi gave a small, but clearly discernible, protection of spin probe signal. Chemical reduction with ascorbate indicated that this was due to occlusion of a small fraction of spin probes and thus possibly SR lipids."

https://openalex.org/W1987312118,"We reported previously1,2 the age-dependent appearance of extrachromosomal circular DNA bands hybridizing to a human DNA fragment (‘inter-Alu’), isolated from a genomic cluster of AluI repeats3. Such bands appeared or increased at late passage in four out of six human fibroblast strains (six out of nine cell expansions); moreover, all DNAs (9/9) obtained from peripheral lymphocytes of aged donors, but none (0/8) from young donors, revealed a non-genomic inter-Alu band at ≃4.8 kilobases (kb)1,2. Subsequent data extended these numbers to 16/24 aged donors compared with 0/18 young donors4. These results were interpreted as evidence of age-dependent DNA rearrangement in normal human cells1,2. We now report that the ‘extra’ bands were of microbial origin, although clearly occurring in an age-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W1598119323,"A potent guanosine diphosphatase activity that hydrolyzes GDP to 5'-GMP + Pi has been isolated and purified from the salt wash proteins of calf liver microsomes. The purified enzyme, a monomeric protein of approximate Mr 46,000, possesses nucleotide substrate specificity since, among the nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates tested, only GDP and UDP are hydrolyzed by the enzyme. The relative affinity of the enzyme for GDP is, however, much higher than for UDP. The effect of the enzyme on the binary complex formed between eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and GDP has also been investigated. The enzyme neither hydrolyzes GDP bound to eIF-2 nor catalyzes the exchange of eIF-2-bound GDP with GTP even in the presence of Met-tRNAf. The enzyme, therefore, is presumably not involved in recycling of eIF-2 in eukaryotic polypeptide chain initiation reaction. The possible biological function of the enzyme in maintaining the cellular pool of GTP-GDP is discussed."
