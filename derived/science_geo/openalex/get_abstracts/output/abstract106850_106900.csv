https://openalex.org/W1520909561,"RecA promotes homologous pairing of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). This reaction occurs inefficiently if the ssDNA substrate is preincubated with Escherichia coli ssDNA-binding protein (SSB). However, RecO and RecR can act together as accessory factors for RecA to overcome this inhibition by SSB (Umezu, K., Chi, N.-W., and Kolodner, R. D. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 3875-3879). To elucidate the mechanism that underlies this process, we examined protein-protein interactions between RecA, RecF, RecO, RecR, and SSB, and characterized the structure and activity of the ssDNA complexes formed with different combinations of these proteins. We obtained the following results. (i) RecO physically interacts with both RecR and SSB. The interaction between RecO and SSB is stronger than the RecO-RecR interaction. (ii) RecO and RecR do not remove SSB from SSB.ssDNA complexes, but instead bind to these complexes. The resulting RecO.RecR.SSB.ssDNA complexes were more active in RecA-mediated joint molecule formation than were SSB.ssDNA complexes. (iii) RecA can nucleate on the RecO.RecR.SSB.ssDNA complexes more efficiently than on SSB.ssDNA complexes. (iv) When RecA presynaptic filaments were formed in the presence of SSB, RecO, and RecR, the protein-DNA complexes obtained contained 70% of the amount of RecA required to saturate ssDNA. These complexes, however, can mediate joint molecule formation and strand exchange as efficiently as presynaptic filaments which are fully saturated with RecA. Based on these results, we propose dual roles for RecO and RecR in joint molecule formation. First, RecO and RecR bind to SSB.ssDNA complexes and modify their structure to allow RecA to nucleate on them efficiently. Second, RecO and RecR are retained in RecA presynaptic filaments and play a role in the subsequent homologous pairing process promoted by RecA."
https://openalex.org/W1564510779,"The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) belongs to the cytokine receptor family, members of which lack a tyrosine kinase domain. Recent studies, however, have shown that a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, JAK2, interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR and becomes activated upon binding of Epo to the receptor. Epo has also been shown to stimulate activation of Ras and Raf-1. The present studies were undertaken to examine the possible involvement of Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway and to determine its significance on the growth signaling from the EpoR. In an interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell line expressing the transfected wild-type EpoR, Epo, or IL-3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2. These cytokines also induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase isoforms ERK1 and ERK2. A mutant EpoR with a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 108 amino acids (H mutant), which is mitogenically functional but lacks tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal region, showed markedly diminished abilities to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinases. A mutant receptor (PM4 mutant) inactivated by a point mutation, Trp282 to Arg, which abrogates the interaction with JAK2, failed to induce any effect on Shc or MAP kinases. In cells expressing a mutant EpoR that is constitutively activated by a point mutation, Arg129 to Cys, in the extracellular portion of the receptor, neither tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc nor activation of MAP kinases by phosphorylation was detectable without stimulation with Epo or IL-3. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of EpoR may play a crucial role in activation of MAP kinases through the Ras signaling pathway which may be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2. The activation of MAP kinases, however, failed to correlate with the mitogenic activity of mutant EpoRs and thus may not be required for growth signaling from the EpoR."
https://openalex.org/W1534485474,"Heparin binds to phospholipase A2 myotoxins from Bothrops asper snake venom, inhibiting their toxic activities. This interaction was investigated using purified myotoxin II, a Lys-49 phospholipase A2 of this venom, and a series of heparin variants, fragments, and other glycosaminoglycans. The binding was correlated to toxin neutralization, using endothelial cells as a target. Myotoxin II binds radiolabeled heparin in solution unselectively, and forms macromolecular complexes with an optimum at a heparin:toxin molar ratio of 1:5. Both O-sulfates and N-sulfates play a role in heparin binding, in the order of importance 2-O-sulfates > 6-Osulfates > N-sulfates. The shortest heparin oligosaccharides interacting with myotoxin II are hexasaccharides. The binding of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb-3) to myotoxin II was not inhibited by heparin, indicating that the two molecules interact with different sites on the toxin. A synthetic peptide (residues 115-129 in the numbering system of Renetseder et al. (Renetseder, R., Brunie, S., Dijkstra, B. W., Drenth, J., and Sigler, P. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11627-11634) of myotoxin II displays both heparin-binding and cytolytic activities. It is concluded that heparin neutralizes myotoxin II by binding to a strongly cationic site in the region of residues 115-129, a possible contribution of lysines 36 and 38 suggested by molecular modeling studies. As this cationic region appears to be responsible for the cytolytic activity of the toxin, the present report constitutes the first identification of a cytotoxic region on a phospholipase A2 myotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1555637041,"In muscle and fat tissues, insulin stimulates glucose transport through the translocation of glucose transporter proteins from an intracellular storage pool to the plasma membrane. The mechanism of this translocation is unknown. We have examined the possible role of the actin microfilament network in the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin and on the distribution of glucose transporters, in differentiated L6 rat skeletal muscle cells. Insulin (10(-7) M for 30 min) caused a major reorganization of the actin network of differentiated L6 myotubes. Cytochalasin D, a widely used inhibitor of actin filament formation, caused a dose- and time-dependent disassembly of the actin network, which was associated with an 80% inhibition of the insulin stimulation of glucose transport, without affecting the basal rate of glucose uptake. L6 myotubes express three glucose transporter isoforms, named GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4. Disassembly of the actin network by cytochalasin D did not affect the number of basal glucose transporters in the plasma membrane but reduced the content of all three glucose transporters in intracellular membranes and prevented their appearance at the plasma membrane response to insulin. The inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D treatment on the insulin stimulation of glucose transport occurred downstream of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 and of binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the insulin receptor substrate-1. Using immunoprecipitation of intact membranes, we detected specific association of the actin-binding protein spectrin with GLUT4 glucose transporter-containing vesicles. We conclude that an intact actin network is required for the correct intracellular localization of glucose transporters, as well as for their incorporation into the plasma membrane in response to insulin. A direct interaction may exist between the actin network and the glucose transporter vesicles which may be mediated through a spectrin-containing skeleton attached to glucose transporter-containing vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1545526472,"A potential human DNA helicase, RECQL, was partially purified from HeLa cells, and a cDNA encoding this protein was subsequently cloned from a HeLa library. The RECQL cDNA contains a protein coding region of 1977 base pairs, and encodes a 659-amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted M(r) 72,000. This predicted protein sequence contains several domains that have extensive sequence identity with similar domains of the RecQ protein from Escherichia coli that has been shown to be an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Overall amino acid sequence identity between the two proteins is 32% overall sequence similarity is 57%. The similarities between the two sequences are particularly high in the seven consecutive domains characteristic of DNA and RNA helicases. Expression of the RECQL cDNA in reticulocyte lysates and in transiently transfected cells confirms the M(r) 72,000 of the protein; this protein reacted with antibodies raised against synthetic peptides comprising both the predicted amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences. These antibodies demonstrated that RECQL is located predominantly in the nucleus of human fibroblasts. Based on its sequence similarity to the E. coli RecQ protein, it is possible that the putative human helicase RECQL may play a role in the repair of DNA that is damaged by ultraviolet light or other mutagens."
https://openalex.org/W1542497408,"Drebrin is a development-associated neuroprotein whose cDNA into fibroblasts causes the formation of dendrite-like structures (Shirao, T., Kojima, N., and Obata, K. (1992) Neuroreport 3, 109-112). To explore molecular functions of drebrin during brain development, we purified drebrin from brains of rat embryos. Drebrin bound to actin filaments at a stoichiometry of 1:5 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.2 x 10(-7) M. It strongly inhibited the actin binding activity of tropomyosin. Excess amounts of tropomyosin also inhibited the drebrin binding to actin filaments, suggesting that drebrin and tropomyosin competitively bind to actin filaments. Further, drebrin inhibited not only the actin binding activity of alpha-actinin but also the actin cross-linking activity of alpha-actinin. Gene transfection experiments revealed that tropomyosin was dissociated from actin filaments in drebrin-overexpressing fibroblasts. Thus we hypothesize that drebrin may destabilize actin filaments by dissociating tropomyosin and alpha-actinin from actin filaments, resulting in the formation of axon and dendrites during neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W1495843779,"MSH1 is a homologue of the Escherichia coli MutS gene that is proposed to play an important role in the repair and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Reenan, R.A., and Kolodner, R. D. (1992) Genetics 132, 985-1985). In this study, we demonstrate that msh1/MSH1 strains accumulate point mutations in mitochondria seven times faster than the wild-type. We also show that the MSH1 protein is targeted to the mitochondria where its mitochondrial-targeting sequence is removed. Purified MSH1 hydrolyzes ATP and recognizes DNA substrates containing nucleotide mismatches and unpaired nucleotides. The hierarchy of binding affinity of MSH1 among various mismatches is similar to that of MutS, suggesting that both proteins share a highly conserved scheme for recognizing mismatches. The specific binding of MSH1 to mismatches is more resistant to NaCl inhibition and has a slower dissociation rate as compared to the nonspecific binding to complementary DNA sequences. Our data support the idea that MSH1 plays a role in eliminating biosynthetic errors and homeologous recombination in mitochondrial genome by recognizing premutagenic DNA mismatches."
https://openalex.org/W1543647466,"Multidrug transport system in proteoliposomes was reconstituted using the highly purified membrane transport protein responsible for bacterial multidrug resistance. This protein (named Smr, for staphylococcal multidrug resistance) consists of 107 amino acid residues and displays four putative transmembrane domains. The Smr protein was tagged with a FLAG epitope, and the modified protein was expressed, purified, characterized, and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. With this in vitro experimental system, it has been demonstrated that a highly purified multidrug resistance protein functions as a drug pump, which transports methyltriphenylphosphonium actively against a 10(3)-fold concentration gradient. Delta mu H+ was shown to be a driving force, and an electrogenic drug/proton antiport was suggested as the molecular mechanism of the drug transport. Of the 2 Glu residues in putative extramembrane loops of the Smr polypeptide chain, Glu-24 was shown to be involved in determining the specificity of drug resistance. Replacement of both of these Glu residues with Asp produced active Smr. In contrast, Smr was unable to protect cells from multiple drugs when a Glu-13–>Asp-13 replacement was made. We suggest that Glu-13, a unique acidic residue located in the hydrophobic domain of Smr, is directly involved in the drug/proton antiport."
https://openalex.org/W1608764077,"To identify new members of a family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), of which VH1 is prototype, we screened a B5/589 human mammary epithelial cell cDNA library by low stringency hybridization with probes for the catalytic domains of the human VHR and mouse 3CH134 phosphatases. Two overlapping clones of 1.8 and 2.5 kilobase pairs were detected by 3CH134 but not VHR probes. Sequence analysis of the largest clone, B23, revealed a 2470-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a novel protein. Within the 397 amino acid sequence, the HCXAGXXR signature sequence for PTPs was located at positions 261-268. The closest similarities were to 3CH134, its human homolog CL100, and PAC-1, PTPs induced as early response genes to mitogen stimulation. Less relatedness was observed with VHR and VH1 dual specificity phosphatases of human and vaccinia virus, respectively. A bacterially expressed recombinant protein containing the catalytic domain of B23 showed significant but consistently lower activity than VHR in vitro. Among the substrates tested, B23 displayed the highest relative activity toward phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase-1, suggesting that it may be a target for B23 activity in vivo. The B23 transcript was detected in a wide variety of normal human tissues, with relatively high expression in pancreas and brain. B23 was induced by serum stimulation of human fibroblasts as well as by heat shock with similar kinetics to those observed with CL100. Thus, B23 is a new human protein phosphatase which appears to be regulated in response to mitogenic signaling and at least some forms of stress."
https://openalex.org/W1582873515,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor that binds and endocytoses several structurally and functionally distinct ligands. Several of the ligands for LRP participate in both normal physiology and pathophysiology of the central nervous system. To begin to gain insights into the role of LRP in the central nervous system, we have analyzed the expression, subcellular distribution, and endocytic function of LRP in human glioblastoma U87 cells. These cells express an abundance of LRP at both the mRNA and protein levels. A 39-kDa protein, which copurifies with LRP and regulates its ligand binding activity, is also highly expressed in U87 cells. The subcellular localization of LRP and the 39-kDa protein was analyzed using scanning laser confocal and electron microscopy combined with immunolabeled U87 cells. At the plasma membrane, LRP was largely confined to clathrin-coated pits. Within cells, LRP and the 39-kDa protein partially colocalized within rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex, suggesting a potential intracellular interaction between the two proteins. Little 39-kDa protein was found in endosomes in which LRP occurred abundantly. In examining the functional role of LRP in U87 cells, we found that LRP at the cell surface and along the cellular processes was functional in the binding and endocytosis of its ligands, and its activity therein was regulated by the 39-kDa protein. Using truncated recombinant 39-kDa protein constructs, we also demonstrated that distinct regions of the 39-kDa protein were responsible for inhibiting the binding of different LRP ligands on U87 cells. Our results thus strongly suggest several potential roles for LRP in brain protein and lipoprotein metabolism, as well as control of extracellular protease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1516787664,"The met proto-oncogene is a receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). HGF/SF is a multifunctional cytokine that stimulates mitogenesis, motility, invasion, and tubulogenesis of a spectrum of epithelial and endothelial cells in culture. Using a chimeric receptor (CSF-MET), containing the extracellular domain of the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of the Met receptor, we have previously demonstrated that activation of the Met kinase domain is sufficient to mediate the motility, invasion and morphogenic signals of HGF/SF in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK). In this study we have analyzed the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of the Met receptor in the transmission of these signals by site-directed mutagenesis of specific tyrosine residues. Mutation of two tyrosine residues (tyrosine 1234 and tyrosine 1235), involved in activation of the catalytic activity of the kinase, abrogates the biological activity of the chimera. In addition, we have identified a single noncatalytic tyrosine residue (tyrosine 1356) in the carboxyl terminus of the Met receptor, that is essential for the biological activity of the chimeric receptor. Mutation of tyrosine 1356 to a nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine residue does not affect the exogenous kinase activity of the receptor toward enolase, but it impairs the ability of the mutant protein to associate with the adaptor protein Grb2, and MDCK cells expressing this mutant fail to scatter, invade, and form branching tubules in response to CSF-1. These results support a crucial role for tyrosine 1356 in activation of signaling pathways involved in the biological activity of the Met receptor in response to HGF/SF."
https://openalex.org/W1510824617,"Several class I and class II human tRNA synthetases are clearly related to their bacterial counterparts. We report here the cloning, cDNA sequence, deduced primary structure, and expression in bacteria of a class II human glycyl-tRNA synthetase. While the human sequence aligns well with a Bombyx mori and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequence for glycyl-tRNA synthetase, particularly in the region of the class II-defining sequence motifs, it diverges widely from that of the Escherichia coli enzyme. The divergence is so great that from the sequences alone we cannot conclude that the human and E. coli proteins are descended from homologous genes. Moreover, even though the human and E. coli class II alanyl-tRNA synthetases cross-acylate their respective tRNAs, aminoacylations by the recombinant human and E. coli glycyl-tRNA synthetases are restricted to their homologous tRNAs. The species-specific aminoacylations correlate with a nucleotide sequence difference at a location in the acceptor stem that is known to be critical for aminoacylations by the E. coli enzyme. Thus, glycyl-tRNA synthetase may have followed a path of historical development different in at least some respects from that of several other tRNA synthetases."
https://openalex.org/W1585493541,"Evidence indicates that a component of the multicatalytic proteinase complex (MPC) that preferentially cleaves bonds after branched chain amino acids (BrAAP) is a major factor responsible for the protein-degrading activity of the MPC. We report here the synthesis of substrate-related peptidyl aldehydes that inhibit the activity of this component toward both synthetic peptide substrates and proteins. The most potent of the inhibitors, Cbz-Gly-Pro-Phe-leucinal (Cbz-GPFL-CHO) inhibits competitively with a Ki of 1.5 microM. The peptidyl aldehydes also inhibit the small neutral amino acid preferring and the peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing activities of the MPC. The chymotrypsin-like activity is only weakly inhibited, and the trypsin-like activity is moderately activated. The importance of a Pro residue in the P3 position and a leucinal residue in the P1 position for inhibition of the BrAAP component is indicated by the finding that replacement of these residues by a glycine or phenylalaninal, respectively, markedly increases the Ki. Cbz-GPFL-CHO inhibited the BrAAP activity with the same Ki both before and after activation of this component by exposure of the MPC to 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, suggesting that the peptidyl aldehyde is an effective inhibitor of both the overt and latent proteolytic activities of the MPC. Incubation of a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) in culture with the inhibitors of the BrAAP component led to an accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates, indicating inhibition of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1584735053,"Human GLUT4 protein expression in muscle and adipose tissues of transgenic mice decreases plasma insulin and glucose levels and improves glucose tolerance compared with nontransgenic controls (Liu, M.-L., Gibbs, E. M., McCoid, S. C., Milici, A. J., Stukenbrok, H. A., McPherson, R. K., Treadway, J. L., and Pessin, J. E. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 11346-11350). We examined the basis of improved glycemic control in hGLUT4 transgenic mice by determining glucose homeostasis and metabolic profiles in vivo. Glucose turnover experiments indicated a 1.4-fold greater systemic glucose clearance in hGLUT4 mice relative to controls (p < 0.05), whereas hepatic glucose production was similar despite 26% lower (p < 0.05) glucose levels. Glucose infusion rate during an euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp was 2-fold greater (p < 0.05) in hGLUT4 mice versus controls, and skeletal muscle and heart glycogen content were increased 3-5-fold (p < 0.05). The increased peripheral glucose clearance in hGLUT4 mice was associated with increased (25-32%) basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport rate in soleus muscle (p < 0.01), and increased muscle plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 protein. Fed hGLUT4 mice displayed 20-30% lower plasma glucose and insulin levels (p < 0.05) and 43% elevated glucagon levels (p < 0.001) compared with controls. Triglycerides, free fatty acids, and beta-hydroxy-butyrate were elevated 43-63% (p < 0.05) in hGLUT4 mice due to hypoinsulinemia-induced lipolysis. Free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in hGLUT4 mice increased further upon fasting, and skeletal muscle glycogen levels decreased markedly compared with controls. The data demonstrate that high level expression of hGLUT4 increases systemic glucose clearance and muscle glucose utilization in vivo and also results in marked compensatory lipolysis and muscle glycogenolysis during a fast."
https://openalex.org/W1583431816,"We have previously shown that during wound healing migrating keratinocytes, which are in contact with the dermal matrix, express interstitial collagenase, whereas basal epidermal cells, which reside on an intact basement membrane, do not. Duplicating this in vivo pattern, collagenase production was induced in primary human keratinocytes grown on native type I collagen, but only background levels of enzyme were detected in cells cultured on denatured type I collagen or on Matrigel. Using genistein, herbimycin A, and sodium orthovanadate, we show that tyrosine kinase activity was required for collagen-mediated induction of keratinocyte collagenase. Similarly, collagenase steady-state mRNA levels and the activity of a transfected human collagenase-promoter CAT construct were inhibited by genistein and enhanced by orthovanadate. Staurosporine and H-7 also blocked collagenase production, indicating that protein kinase C activity was also required for collagen-mediated induction of keratinocyte collagenase. All inhibitory effects were dose-dependent, and no compound significantly affected total protein synthesis. Furthermore, both tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C inhibitors blocked phorbol ester-mediated induction of collagenase, but only protein kinase C antagonists abrogated phorbol ester-mediated induction of c-fos mRNA. These data suggest that similar signal transduction pathways are used by various agonists to mediate the stimulation of interstitial collagenase production."
https://openalex.org/W1598518683,"The transmembrane domain of chemoreceptor Trg from Escherichia coli contains four segments, two from each subunit of the homodimer. We used site-specific mutagenesis to introduce cysteines into those segments and oxidative cross-linking of cysteine pairs to identify residues that are near each other in space. Propensity for cross-linking was determined for pairs of homologously placed cysteines in the two subunits of the dimer at all 54 possible positions. Also, combinations of cysteines were identified that readily oxidized to join heterologous segments within or between monomers. These patterns of cross-linking were used to develop a model for the three-dimensional structure of the transmembrane domain in which the four transmembrane segments are helices associated in a bundle, with stronger interactions near the periplasm and weaker interactions near the cytoplasm. The striking similarity of this model to a model for the transmembrane domain of chemoreceptor Tar, derived using the same experimental strategy, strengthens the notion that a combination of comprehensive cysteine substitutions and analysis of patterns of disulfide cross-linking is sufficient to deduce a detailed three-dimensional structure for a transmembrane domain."
https://openalex.org/W1614304853,"Tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanin synthesis, is expressed specifically in pigment-producing cells. Studies with transgenic mice and gene transfer experiments have demonstrated that the 270-base pair 5'-flanking sequence of the mouse tyrosinase gene leads to weak but cell type-specific and developmentally regulated expression. To elucidate the underlying transcriptional control, we focused on the identification of cis-acting elements within this 270-base pair minimal promoter. We also addressed the potential role of promoter elements in the control of cAMP regulation of the tyrosinase gene. Deletion and linker scanning mutagenesis revealed that promoter activity is modulated by two positive elements and one negative element. One of the positive elements includes the M-box, a sequence motif shared with the promoter of two other melanocyte-specific genes, trp-1 and trp-2. Cotransfection experiments provide evidence that a basic helix-loop-helix-zipper protein, encoded at the microphthalmia gene locus, transactivates the tyrosinase promoter, probably by binding to the M-box. Activating cis elements are bound by nuclear factors in vitro and confer increased expression to a reporter gene both in melanoma cells and in fibroblasts. We therefore suggest that the positive promoter elements modulate tyrosinase expression rather than determine cell specificity in vivo, whereas the negative element acts cell type specifically."
https://openalex.org/W1542743898,"Pulmonary surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) possess similar structure as members of the mammalian C-type lectin superfamily. Both proteins are composed of four characteristic domains which are: 1) an NH2-terminal domain involved in interchain disulfide formation (denoted A1 domain for SP-A or D1 for SP-D); 2) a collagenous domain (denoted A2 or D2); 3) a neck domain (denoted A3 or D3); and 4) a carbohydrate recognition domain (denoted A4 or D4). SP-A specifically binds to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, the major lipid component of surfactant, and can regulate the secretion and recycling of this lipid by alveolar type II cells. SP-D binds to phosphatidylinositol (PI) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer), and its role in alveolar lipid metabolism remains to be clarified. To understand the relationship between the structure and the function of both proteins with respect to their interaction with lipids, we expressed recombinant wild type rat SP-D (rSP-D) and chimeric molecules of SP-A and SP-D (A1A2A3D4, A1A2D3D4, and D1D2A3A4) using a baculovirus expression system, and performed lipid binding and aggregation assays. The rSP-D effectively competed with 125I-labeled native rat SP-D in a solid phase binding assay to PI and GlcCer in a manner nearly identical to native SP-D. The rSP-D also bound to PI liposomes with approximately half the affinity of native rat SP-D. Chimera A1A2D3D4 competed with iodinated SP-D in the solid phase binding assay to both PI and GlcCer. This chimera did not bind to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes or induce their aggregation. Chimera A1A2A3D4 did not bind solid phase PI or GlcCer but was equivalent to rSP-D in binding to PI liposomes. This chimera exhibited weak binding to DPPC but failed to aggregate DPPC liposomes. Chimera D1D2A3A4 failed to bind PI and GlcCer and bound weakly to DPPC liposomes but was quite effective at inducing aggregation of DPPC liposomes. These findings demonstrate that the D3 plus D4 domains of SP-D play a role in lipid binding and that the D4 domain is essential for PI binding. Furthermore, the A3 domain of SP-A cannot account for all the lipid binding activity of this protein. In addition, the results implicate the A4 domain of SP-A as an important structural domain in lipid aggregation phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1481914385,"ParA, a P1 protein required for partition of the prophage plasmid, regulates expression of its own gene and another partition gene, parB, from a promoter upstream of parA. The ATP-dependent ParA DNA binding activity to the par promoter is thought to mediate this regulation. An alternate purification for ParA is presented. This highly purified ParA was used to examine ParA DNA binding activity using DNase I protection assays. At high concentration, ParA bound to the par promoter in the absence of ATP, demonstrating that although ATP stimulates, it is not required for DNA binding. Non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues as well as ADP stimulated binding more than ATP, suggesting that the act of hydrolysis is coupled to release of the DNA. Glycerol gradient sedimentation and chemical cross-linking experiments suggest that ParA exists in an monomer-dimer equilibrium that is shifted toward dimer formation by adding ATP or ADP. These observations lead to the proposal that the more active DNA binding form of ParA is a dimer and that the effects of ATP and ParA concentration on DNA binding are a direct result of their effects on oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1506403296,"Pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a mammalian lectin that regulates the uptake and secretion of surfactant by alveolar type II cells and is an important component of surfactant complexes. The domains of SP-A which mediate these functions have not been fully mapped. The binding of SP-A to its high affinity receptor on alveolar type II cells is thought to be dependent on a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), while the interaction with lipids has been attributed to the hydrophobic neck region of the molecule. To explore the role of the CRD in the interactions of SP-A with type II cells and lipids, we introduced mutations into the cDNA to encode for the substitutions Glu195-->Gln and Arg197-->Asp (SP-Ahyp,Gln195,Asp197) and expressed the mutant protein in insect (Sf9) cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Similar mutations introduced into mannose-binding protein A have been shown to switch the carbohydrate binding specificity from mannose > galactose to the converse. Wild type SP-A produced in Sf9 cells does not contain hydroxyproline (SP-Ahyp), but like rat SP-A it binds to carbohydrate affinity columns, lipids, and the SP-A receptor and is a potent inhibitor of the secretion of surfactant from type II cells (IC50 = 0.5-1.0 micrograms/ml). The SP-Ahyp,Gln195,Asp197 also bound to affinity matrices of galactose-Sepharose and mannose-Sepharose but the indicated mutations rendered the binding at least 100 times more susceptible than SP-Ahyp to competition by free galactose. The SP-Ahyp,Gln195,Asp197 did not compete with rat SP-A for occupancy of its high affinity receptor on type II cells and the mutant protein was 25-50-fold less potent as an inhibitor of the secretion of surfactant from type II cells (IC50 = 26.0 micrograms/ml). Unlike SP-Ahyp, the inhibition of secretion of surfactant by SP-Ahyp,Gln195,Asp197 was reversed by 0.25 M alpha-methylmannoside or galactose. In addition, the SP-Ahyp,Gln195,Asp197 bound avidly to phospholipid but did not aggregate vesicles or augment the uptake of phospholipid into type II cells. We conclude that the binding of SP-A to its receptor and the inhibition of surfactant secretion are critically dependent on the carbohydrate binding specificity of the CRD. Furthermore, phospholipid aggregation and augmentation of phospholipid uptake into type II cells are mediated by the COOH-terminal region of SP-A by a mechanism that is distinct from phospholipid binding."
https://openalex.org/W1605520753,"The critical physiological functions of the liver make hepatocytes important targets for therapeutic gene delivery. This study reports significant gene expression following direct injection of plasmid DNA into the livers of rats and cats. Transfection was characterized using luciferase and Lac Z expression from plasmids with the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancer (CMV IE) or the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR). Dexamethasone treatment enhanced and prolonged transfected gene expression, possibly by activating gene expression. Southern analysis of total DNA extracted from liver at various times following injection detected persistent unintegrated plasmid DNA which maintained a prokaryotic methylation pattern.

https://openalex.org/W1494429877,"Although a role for the beta gamma-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (G beta gamma) in signal transduction by several cellular systems has been established, the structural features of cellular proteins interacting with G beta gamma have yet to be fully elucidated. The G beta gamma-binding region of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), a cytosolic enzyme recruited to the membrane receptor substrate by G beta gamma, has been localized to the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme. Here, we demonstrate that the amino terminus of phosducin, a 33-kDa G beta gamma-binding retinal phosphoprotein, contains sequences homologous with the G beta gamma-binding domain of beta ARK. Accordingly, a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein containing only the amino-terminal 105 amino acids of phosducin displayed G beta gamma binding ability. This domain of phosducin contains a protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site, and upon phosphorylation, the binding of full-length phosducin to G beta gamma is reduced. In addition, transient expression of phosducin in COS-7 cells significantly inhibits G beta gamma-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. This inhibitory effect is completely reversed by pretreatment of cells with dibutyryl cAMP, an activator of PKA. Thus, the binding of G beta gamma to phosducin can be regulated by PKA-phosphorylation in an intact cell model system."
https://openalex.org/W1542226633,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is phosphorylated on tyrosine both in vitro and in vivo. To identify the protein tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the receptor, we have previously cloned and characterized two protein tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Fyk, that are highly expressed in Torpedo electric organ, a tissue enriched in the AChR. Both kinases were shown by coimmunoprecipitation to be specifically associated with the AChR. In this study, we examined the molecular basis for the interaction of Fyn and Fyk with the AChR using fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of the two kinases as affinity reagents. The AChR bound specifically and in a protein concentration-dependent manner to the SH2 domain fusion proteins of Fyn and Fyk. Quantitation of the association revealed that the binding of the AChR to Fyn and Fyk SH2 domain fusion proteins was to a single class of saturable high affinity sites. In addition, the association of the AChR with the SH2 domain fusion proteins was dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR and was mediated by the delta subunit of the receptor. Furthermore, upon dissociation of the AChR into subunits, the delta subunit coimmunoprecipitated with both Fyn and Fyk. These data suggest that the association of the AChR with Fyn and Fyk is mediated by an interaction of the tyrosine-phosphorylated delta subunit of the receptor with the SH2 domains of the protein tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1495020242,"Most eukaryotic cells abundantly express polypeptide chain elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), an enzyme which catalyzes the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes. In this study, a series of deletion and scanning mutations was introduced in the promoter region of human EF-1 alpha chromosomal gene. Mutated promoters were fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, and their promoter activity was determined in human HeLa cells. These analyses indicated that both the 5'-flanking region and the first intron of the EF-1 alpha gene are essential for its promoter activity. The region responsible in the intron contains several Sp1 and Ap1 elements which seem to have additive effects on its promoter activity. In the 5'-flanking region, two cis-elements (EFP1 and EFP2) which work interdependently were identified. Gel shift assay with EFP1 and EFP2 elements indicated that several nuclear factors bind to EFP1 and EFP2, and one of the three retarded bands with EFP2 could be super-shifted with the anti-Sp1 antibody. These results indicate that Sp1 or its related factor cooperatively enhances the expression of the EF-1 alpha gene in the 5' flanking region."
https://openalex.org/W1536066326,"The nuclear factor I (NFI) family of site-specific DNA-binding proteins plays a role in both transcription and adenovirus DNA replication. The DNA binding domain of NFI family members contains 4 cysteine residues (Cys-2, Cys-3, Cys-4, and Cys-5) that are conserved in all NFI proteins. Mutation of the Cys-2, Cys-4, and Cys-5 residues in the human NFI-C protein to several other amino acids abolished DNA binding, while 8 of 10 mutations of the Cys-3 residue had little or no effect on binding. Wild-type NFI-C was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide in vitro, while the active Cys-3 mutant proteins were resistant to N-ethylmaleimide. Treatment of wild-type NFI in vitro with the oxidizing agent diamide also inactivated DNA binding, and subsequent reduction with dithiothreitol restored binding activity. The active Cys-3 mutant NFI proteins were resistant to diamide-inactivation, indicating that the Cys-3 residue is required for modulation of DNA-binding by oxidation state. These studies indicate that oxidative-inactivation can play an important role in the modifying NFI-DNA-protein interactions. The presence of this nonessential Cys-3 residue in all known NFI proteins raises the possibility that it may function in a manner similar to redox-sensitive cysteine residues found in other site-specific DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1500937033,"A classical biochemical approach was taken to identify mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activators in bovine brain. Fractionation revealed the presence of one major MEK-stimulating activity that was distinct from c-Raf-1 and MEK kinase. Similar results were obtained using bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, and in both cases, immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated co-purification of MEK activator with B-Raf. Partially purified MEK activator stimulated phosphorylation of MEK1 on residues tentatively identified as serine 218 and serine 222. Little or no MEK activator was associated with c-Raf-1 in bovine brain or chromaffin cells, although this protein was expressed, suggesting that B-Raf might be the major MEK activator in cells of neural origin."
https://openalex.org/W1549696718,"MSH1 is a DNA-binding protein in yeast mitochondria that recognizes nucleotide mismatches in DNA and plays a role in mitochondrial mutation avoidance (Chi, W., and Kolodner, R. D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29984-29992). MSH1 exhibits an ATPase activity that hydrolyses approximately 1 ATP molecule/min in the absence of DNA. In this study, p3 show that DNA alters the pH dependence of the MSH1 ATPase and stimulates ATP hydrolysis at neutral pH. Using heteroduplex DNA containing mismatches with various affinity, we show an inverse correlation between the extent of ATPase stimulation by DNA and the binding affinity of MSH1 for the DNA effector. We also show that the presence of ATP increases the mismatch specificity of MSH1-DNA binding. Taken together, the observed interaction between the ATPase and the mismatch-binding activities suggests that MSH1 binds to ATP and mismatches with positive cooperativity. This interaction may provide a system for elucidating the role of ATP in mismatch recognition and repair."
https://openalex.org/W1564810885,"Recombinant forms of the human thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor composed of the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues 220-343 were phosphorylated in vitro by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC), and these phosphorylations were competed for by synthetic peptides corresponding to the proposed carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail and/or the third extracellular loop of the receptor, respectively. Exogenous addition of PKA or PKC to membrane preparations of human embryonic kidney 293 cells, transfected with the TXA2 receptor, typically reduced TXA2 receptor binding by 10 and 30%, respectively. In vivo inhibition of PKC or PKA in the transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells increased TXA2 receptor binding to 121.4% (+/- 5.3%) and 110.4% (+/- 4.6%), respectively, relative to control cells. In vivo activation of PKC in the platelet-like human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in an initial reduction followed by a time-dependent increase in TXA2 receptor ligand binding. Stimulation of HEL cells with the TXA2 receptor agonist [15-(alpha,2 beta(5Z)-3 alpha(E,3S)-4 alpha)]-7-[3- (3-hydroxy-4-(p-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo-[-2.2,1-]hept -2-yl]- 5-heptenoic acid or basic fibroblast growth factor, alone or together, resulted in a marked decrease in TXA2 receptor binding. Northern blot studies in HEL cells demonstrated that PMA stimulation induced the expression of the TXA2 receptor gene with mRNA levels peaking following PMA stimulation for 4-8 h. This induction is consistent with the presence of a phorbol ester response element in promoter I of the TXA2 receptor gene. Dexamethasone did not induce the expression of the receptor gene, despite the presence of a glucocorticoid response element in promoter II of the TXA2 receptor gene. In summary, our results indicate that the cellular responses to TXA2 are mediated both by phosphorylation of the TXA2 receptor by different protein kinases and by regulated expression of the TXA2 receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1996307586,"φ29 DNA polymerase shares with other DNA-dependent DNA polymerases several regions of amino acid homology along the primary structure. A conserved amino acid motif, located in the C-terminal portion of the polypeptide and characterized by the amino acid sequence KK(K/R)Y, is conserved in the group of eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases. In the subgroup of DNA polymerases that have a protein-priming mechanism, this motif is restricted to the sequence KXY, X never being a positively charged amino acid. Residues Lys498 and Tyr500 form this conserved motif in φ29 DNA polymerase. Mutant K498T, in which the positive charge of the motif has been eliminated, was strongly affected both in initiation (terminal protein-dAMP formation, using terminal protein as primer) and DNA polymerization reactions. Mutants K498R and Y500S were able to carry out the initiation reaction to a higher or similar extent, respectively, than wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase but were affected in DNA polymerization reactions. All of the mutations severely affected the stable binding of the polymerase to a primer-template DNA. In addition, all of the mutant polymerases analyzed in this work showed an unusually strong 3′-5′ exonuclease activity both under polymerization or non-polymerization conditions. The results obtained suggest a role of the conserved residues of the KXY motif in stabilizing the primer terminus at the polymerization active site, the positive charge of residue Lys498 being critical for the synthetic activities of φ29 DNA polymerase. φ29 DNA polymerase shares with other DNA-dependent DNA polymerases several regions of amino acid homology along the primary structure.

The results obtained suggest a role of the conserved residues of the KXY motif in stabilizing the primer terminus at the polymerization active site, the positive charge of residue Lys498 being critical for the synthetic activities of φ29 DNA polymerase. The φ29 genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA, with a TP ( 1The abbreviation used is: TPφ29 terminal protein. )covalently linked to both 5′-ends. This linear genome solves the problem of complete replication of the DNA ends by a protein-primed initiation mechanism (for a review, see Salas, 1991). To initiate TP-DNA replication, φ29 DNA polymerase is able to use the 3′-OH group of residue Ser232 of a free TP as primer, catalyzing the formation of TP•dAMP, the initiation complex (Blanco and Salas, 1984; Hermoso et al., 1985). This initiation complex is further elongated by φ29 DNA polymerase in a process that requires high processivity and strand-displacement ability, two properties of this enzyme (Blanco and Salas, 1985a). In addition, φ29 DNA polymerase has two degradative activities, a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (Watabe et al., 1984; Blanco and Salas, 1985b) involved in proofreading (Garmendia et al., 1992) and a pyrophosphorolytic activity (Blasco et al., 1991). φ29 terminal protein. φ29 DNA polymerase consists of a single polypeptide (66 kDa), and its enzymatic activities (protein-primed initiation, DNA polymerization, 3′-5′ exonuclease, and pyrophosphorolysis) have been well characterized. Therefore, it is an appropriate system for studies to relate structure and function. φ29 DNA polymerase has been included in the group of eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases because of its sensitivity to drugs that are specific inhibitors of eukaryotic DNA polymerase α (Blanco and Salas, 1986; Bernad et al., 1987) and because it shares with this group of polymerases several regions of amino acid similarity along the primary structure (Blanco et al., 1991). In addition to the evolutionary conserved 3′-5′ exonuclease active site, present in the N-terminal domain of both prokaryotic- and eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases (Bernad et al., 1989; reviewed by Joyce and Steitz, 1994), several amino acid sequence motifs conserved in the C-terminal portion of eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases have been proposed to be part of the active site for synthetic activities (Larder et al., 1987; Gibbs et al., 1988). The functional significance of the conserved motifs DX2SLYP, KX3NSXYG, TX2GR, and YXDTDS has been previously studied by site-directed mutagenesis in φ29 DNA polymerase; most of the mutant polymerases showed an essentially normal 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, but they were affected in synthetic activities (protein-primed initiation and/or polymerization) and in pyrophosphorolysis. Thus, φ29 residues Asp249 (in conserved motif DX2SLYP) and Asp456 and Asp458 (in conserved motif YXDTDS) have been proposed to be involved in catalysis, probably contributing to metal binding (Bernad et al., 1990; Blasco et al., 1993a). Conserved motif KX3NSXYG has been proposed to be involved in primer-template binding and dNTP selection (Blasco et al., 1992a, 1993b). Thr434 and Arg438, belonging to conserved motif TX2GR, have been proposed to be involved in primer binding (Méndez et al., 1994). In addition, a mutant in residue Tyr254 of φ29 DNA polymerase conserved motif DX2SLYP has been described to be affected in dNTP binding (Blasco et al., 1992a). Other amino acid motifs in the C-terminal portion of eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases have been also described (Blanco et al., 1991; Braithwaite and Ito, 1993); conserved amino acid motif KK(K/R)Y is found in most eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases described up to now, with the exception of those involved in a protein-priming mechanism. In the latter, this motif is restricted to KXY. Preliminary data with crude extracts have indicated the importance of φ29 DNA polymerase motif KXY in synthetic activities (Blasco et al., 1992b). In this paper, a detailed characterization of purified φ29 DNA polymerase mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S allows us to conclude that φ29 DNA polymerase conserved motif KXY forms part of the active site for synthetic activities, probably contributing to primer terminus stabilization. Wild-type or φ29 DNA polymerase mutants were purified essentially as described (Lázaro et al., 1994). TP was purified as described (Zaballos et al., 1989). TP-DNA was isolated as described (Peñalva and Salas, 1982). Oligonucleotides sp1 (5′-GATCACAGTGAGTAC), sp1c (5′-GTACTCACTGTGATC), and sp1c+6 (5′-TCTATTGTACTCACTGTGATC) were prepared, purified, and labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, as described (Garmendia et al. 1992). Hybrid molecules sp1/sp1c (15/15-mer), sp1/sp1c+6 (15/21-mer), and primed M13 mp2 DNA were obtained as described (Garmendia et al., 1992). EcoRI-digested φ29 DNA was prepared from proteinase K-treated φ29 DNA (Inciarte et al., 1976). 32P-dA-tailed DNA, prepared by extending PstI-digested pUC19 with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and [α-32P]dATP, was used as substrate for quantitative analysis of the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. As substrate for pyrophosphorolytic activity, EcoRI-digested φ29 DNA was 3′-labeled with [α-32P]dATP in a partial filling-in reaction carried out by an exonuclease-deficient mutant φ29 DNA polymerase (D12A/D66A; Bernad et al., 1989). Plasmid pMBw2, harboring the φ29 DNA polymerase gene, was obtained as described (Blasco et al., 1990). The Escherichia coli strain K514 was used as a host for transformation with pT7-4 (Tabor and Richardson, 1985) recombinants containing the φ29 DNA polymerase gene. The wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase gene cloned into M13 mp19 (M13 mp19w21; Bernad et al., 1989) was used for site-directed mutagenesis, carried out essentially as described (Nakamaye and Eckstein, 1986). For expression, fragments carrying the different mutations were cloned in plasmid pMBw2 (not shown). The presence of the desired mutations and the absence of any other changes was confirmed by complete sequencing of each φ29 DNA polymerase mutant gene. Expression of the mutant proteins was carried out in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Studier and Moffatt, 1986). For quantitative analysis, 32P-dA-tailed DNA (PstI-digested pUC19; 3.3 × 106 cpm/pmol of 3′-end) was used as substrate of the exonucleolytic activity of wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerases, as described (Méndez et al., 1994). When indicated, the dAMP turnover coupled to filling-in DNA polymerization assays (see later) was determined as described (Méndez et al., 1994). Analysis of DNA polymerization activity by filling-in of 3′-recessive DNA ends, primed M13 DNA replication, or polymerase/exonuclease-coupled assays, was carried out as described (Méndez et al., 1994). The hybrid oligonucleotide 5′-32P-sp1/sp1c+6 (15/21-mer) was used as primer template for analysis of its interaction either with wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerase. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by gel retardation assays, performed as described by Méndez et al. (1994), and detected as a shift (retardation) in the position of the labeled DNA. When TP-DNA was used as template, the reaction mixture contained, in 25 μl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM ammonium sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 0.25 μM [α-32P]dATP (2.5 μCi), 20 ng of purified TP, 20 ng of either wild-type or mutant DNA polymerase, and TP-DNA (0.5 μg) as template. Incubation was at 30°C during 5 min. To study template-independent TP deoxynucleotidylation, reaction conditions were as described above, using 1 mM MnCl2 as metal activator instead of MgCl2, in the absence of TP-DNA and in the presence of 100 ng of purified TP and either wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerase; incubation was for 4 h at 25°C. In all cases, after incubation, the reactions were stopped by adding up to 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, the samples were filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns in the presence of 0.1% SDS, and the excluded volume was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Quantitation was done by densitometry of the radioactive bands corresponding to TP•dAMP. Reactions were carried out as described for the initiation assay in the absence of TP-DNA and using invariant amounts of TP (12.5 ng) and wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase (25 ng). Increasing amounts of φ29 DNA polymerase mutant K498T (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 ng) were added. After incubation for 3 h at 25°C, the reactions were stopped by adding up to 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS and filtered as indicated above. Quantitation was done by densitometry of the radioactive bands corresponding to TP•dAMP. To analyze the complete elongation of TP•dAMP initiation complex, the incubation mixtures contained, in 25 μl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), either 10 mM MgCl2 or 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mM ammonium sulfate, 20 μM of each dNTP, and 0.25 μM [α-32P]dATP (2.5 μCi), 0.5 μg of TP-DNA, 20 ng of TP, and 20 ng of either wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerase. After incubation for 10 min at 30°C, the reactions were stopped by adding up to 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS and filtered as indicated above. Samples were subjected to alkaline 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Quantitation was done by densitometry of the radioactive bands. To study the truncated elongation of TP•dAMP, the final dATP concentration was varied by adding different concentrations of unlabeled dATP and keeping constant the [α-32P]dATP (2.5 μCi); unlabeled dGTP and dTTP were also added at 10 μM final concentration. The reaction was performed in the presence of Mn2+ as metal activator. For the analysis of the truncated elongation products, electrophoresis was carried out in 0.1% SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gels (360 × 280 × 0.5 mm), conditions in which the different TP•(dNMP)n complexes are resolved. Wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerase were assayed for pyrophosphorolysis essentially as described by Blasco et al.(1991). Aliquots of each reaction mixture were subjected to thin layer chromatography in polygram Cel 300 PEI/UV254 and developed in 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer. After drying, the plates were subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation was done by densitometry of the spot corresponding to 5′-[32P]dATP. A conserved motif characterized by the sequence KK(K/R)Y is present in most eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases (Blanco et al., 1991; Braithwaite and Ito, 1993). In Fig. 1, an updated multiple alignment of this region is presented. According to this new alignment, two of the sequences corresponding to the group of bacterial/viral DNA polymerases considered in Fig. 1 present some differences with the consensus KK(K/R)Y. Thus, channel catfish virus DNA polymerase has the first lysine and the tyrosine changed into leucine, and Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase has the third position in the motif (K/R) changed into asparagine. In the group of cellular enzymes, all of the α DNA polymerases have the motif KKKY, whereas in δ, ϵ, and Rev3 DNA polymerases, the sequence of the motif is always KKRY. In the group of polymerases that use a protein-priming mechanism, the sequence of the conserved motif has two significant differences: (a) the first Lys residue of the motif is not conserved and (b) the third residue is always a non-positively charged amino acid. Therefore, KXY would be a more strict consensus for all the eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases (see Fig. 1). Residues Lys498, Thr499 (not conserved), and Tyr500 form the KXY motif in φ29 DNA polymerase. Mutants K498T, K498R, T499A, and Y500S of this motif have been previously studied using crude fractions (Blasco et al., 1992b). In this paper, mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S were selected for a detailed biochemical characterization. These mutant polymerases were overexpressed and purified as described (see “Materials and Methods”). The 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of the different mutant DNA polymerases was measured as degradation of 32P-dA-tailed DNA (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Table 1, single substitutions of conserved residues Lys498 and Tyr500 produced an increase in the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity that was 3-4-fold higher than that of the wild-type polymerase. A possible explanation of this strong 3′-5′ exonuclease activity will be discussed later.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Pyrophosphorolysis, the reversal reaction of DNA polymerization, occurs only in the presence of high concentrations of PPi, and it is catalyzed at the polymerization active site (Blasco et al., 1990). Mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S resulted severely affected in this reaction (see Table 1). Wild-type and mutant φ29 DNA polymerases were tested in filling-in of EcoRI ends, a polymerization assay in which processivity is not critical. In the presence of Mg2+ as metal activator, mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S showed 8, 1, and 4%, respectively, wild-type activity (see Table 1). When Mn2+ was used, mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S were 61, 3, and 50% active, respectively (see Table 1 and Fig. 2A). The [32P]dAMP released by the 3′-5′ exonuclease after polymerization (turnover) was also determined. The results obtained indicate that, in the presence of Mg2+, the turnover was 6-, 7-, and 3-fold higher in the case of mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S, respectively, than in the case of wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase (Table 1). A similar turnover was obtained when Mn2+ was used as metal activator (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). The ability of the different mutant polymerases to carry out processive DNA polymerization was analyzed in a primed M13 DNA replication assay (see “Materials and Methods”). When Mg2+ was used as metal activator, mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S showed essentially no activity (see Table 1); when Mn2+ was used, mutant polymerases K498R and Y500S partially recovered activity. To study more precisely the balance between polymerase and exonuclease activities, mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S were analyzed in a polymerase/exonuclease assay (see “Materials and Methods”). In this assay, the elongation of a 5′-labeled primer (15-mer) hybridized to a short template molecule (21-mer) was analyzed in the presence of Mg2+ as metal activator. When increasing amounts of unlabeled dNTPs are provided, elongation competes exonucleolysis, and dNTP incorporation is observed as an increase in the size of the labeled primer. Wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase needed 0.05 μM dNTPs to compete out its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Mutant K498R needed 10 μM dNTPs to compete out its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (Fig. 3 and Table 1) and mutant K498T was unable to compete out its exonuclease activity when dNTP concentrations up to 500 μM were added (see Table 1). Mutant Y500S was able to compete out its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity with 1 μM dNTPs (see Table 1). Interestingly, in the absence of dNTPs (see Fig. 3 for mutant K498R), mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S showed a stronger exonuclease activity as compared with the wild-type polymerase. This strong exonuclease on primer-template structures could be reflecting the instability of the primer terminus at the polymerization active site, being then favored its degradation by the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity instead of its processive elongation. This hypothesis is also supported by the increased dNMP turnover coupled to DNA polymerization displayed by all of these mutant polymerases (see above). The affinity of wild-type and mutant φ29 DNA polymerases for primer-template DNA molecules was studied using gel retardation assays. Wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase is able to retard labeled hybrid 15/21-mer molecules, giving rise to a single retardation band; this stable interaction is interpreted to correspond to an enzyme-DNA complex competent for polymerization (Méndez et al., 1994). As shown in Fig. 4, the three mutant DNA polymerases showed a decreased capacity to produce this retardation band, in particular, in the case of mutant K498T. Interestingly, the three mutant DNA polymerases gave rise to a band (below the one corresponding to free 15/21-mer DNA) (see Fig. 4) that is not present in the case of wild-type DNA polymerase. The DNA in this band was extracted from the gel and further analyzed by electrophoresis in a 8 M urea, 20% acrylamide sequencing gel, revealing that it corresponds to small DNA fragments, 3-8 nucleotides long (results not shown). These DNA fragments are probably the consequence of the strong 3′-5′ exonuclease activity on primer-template DNA molecules displayed by these mutant polymerases as a consequence of a poor or null stabilization at the polymerization active site. The ability of the different mutant polymerases to carry out TP•dAMP formation, a template-directed reaction in which the DNA polymerase has to use a free molecule of TP as primer, was studied. In the presence of Mg2+ as metal activator, mutant K498R showed 620% the wild-type initiation activity (see Table 2). The hyperactivity of this mutant polymerase in the initiation reaction is due to a 2-fold decrease in the Km value for dATP and to a 3-fold increase in the Vmax of the reaction as compared with the wild-type enzyme (not shown). In contrast, mutant polymerase K498T showed only 2% of the wild-type activity (see Table 2), indicating that the positive charge of this residue is critical for the initiation activity using a protein as primer. Competition assays for TP between mutant K498T and the wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase (see “Materials and Methods”) showed that mutant K498T was able to inhibit TP•dAMP complex formation by the wild-type enzyme (not shown), ruling out a defect of this mutant polymerase in interaction with the TP. Mutant Y500S showed 60% the wild-type initiation activity in the above conditions (see Table 2). No significant differences in relative activity were obtained when Mn2+ was used as metal activator (not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab TP•dAMP formation can be detected in the absence of template, using Mn2+ as metal activator (Blanco et al., 1992). As shown in Table 2 and in Fig. 5, the TP•dAMP formation by mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S in the absence of TP-DNA was 940, 8, and 145%, respectively, that of the wild-type activity. This result suggests that the mutant phenotype obtained when the TP is used as primer is not derived from the defect of these mutants in template binding. In the φ29 DNA replication process, there is a transition between the use of TP as primer (initiation reaction) to that of DNA as primer (polymerization). Although mutants K498R and Y500S were able to initiate to a higher or similar extent, respectively, than wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase, all of the mutant polymerases were impaired in φ29 DNA replication (see Table 2). Thus, it was interesting to study the transition step, carrying out a truncated elongation assay (see “Materials and Methods”). In this assay, wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase is able to elongate TP•dAMP initiation complex until dCTP (the nucleotide lacking in the assay) has to be incorporated, giving rise to two bands of elongated material, originated at both ends of the TP-DNA (see Fig. 6). Mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S, although able to initiate replication, were unable to elongate the initiation complex (TP•dAMP) to the same extent as the wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase (Fig. 6). In the case of mutant polymerase Y500S, it was possible to detect a band corresponding to TP-(dAMP)2, the first step in which DNA is used as primer. An amino acid motif, characterized by the sequence KK(K/R)Y, can be found in the C-terminal portion of many eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases. However, in the subgroup of enzymes that use a protein-priming mechanism, the first Lys residue of the motif is not conserved, and the third residue is always a non-positively charged amino acid. Therefore, KXY should be the strict consensus for all eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases. To assess the importance of this motif in the synthetic activities of the enzyme, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out in residues Lys498 and Tyr500 of φ29 DNA polymerase. Mutant K498R, in which the positive charge of the residue was increased, showed a 6-fold higher dATP incorporation using the TP as primer (TP•dAMP formation) with respect to the wild-type enzyme. Despite its strong dATP incorporation activity on the primer TP, mutant K498R was strongly affected in DNA polymerization reactions, both in elongation of TP•dAMP initiation complex and DNA polymerization on primer-template molecules. This defect in elongation can be related with the reduced ability of this mutant to stabilize primer-template molecules at the polymerization active site. Consequently, the balance between polymerase and exonuclease activities was clearly altered in favor of the last, as can be deduced from the polymerization/exonuclease-coupled assay and from the high turnover activity detected under polymerization conditions. The importance of the positive charge at position 498 of φ29 DNA polymerase was tested studying mutant K498T. This mutant polymerase resulted severely affected in both initiation and DNA polymerization activities, as well as in normal interaction with a primer template. Despite the low initiation activity of mutant K498T, in some experimental conditions it was possible to determine its strong defect in the elongation of TP•dAMP initiation complex formed, as it was the case for mutant K498R. Moreover, both the turnover coupled to filling-in reactions and the exonuclease activity on primer-template structures were increased, compared with the wild-type enzyme. The role of Tyr500, the other conserved residue of motif KXY, was studied by analysis of mutant Y500S. This mutant DNA polymerase was strongly affected in DNA polymerization reactions and interaction with primer-template DNA but not in the initiation reaction. Again, this mutant showed higher 3′-5′ exonuclease and turnover activities (although less drastic than in the case of mutants in residue Lys498). Taking into account the results summarized above, a direct role of motif KXY of φ29 DNA polymerase in catalysis, dNTP binding, or interaction with the TP can be discarded. On the contrary, a direct role of motif KXY in the stabilization of the primer terminus at the polymerization active site would explain (a) the altered polymerase/exonuclease equilibrium (favoring the latter) observed in mutants of motif KXY; (b) the absence of stable binding of these mutants to a primer-template DNA, as determined by gel retardation assays; (c) the differences observed between the use of either TP or DNA as primer (in the case of mutant polymerases K498R and Y500S) (it should be considered that whereas a DNA primer terminus is substrate of the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, the initiation complex, TP•dAMP, is not (Esteban et al., 1993)); and (d) the inefficient transition from TP priming to normal DNA elongation observed in all the mutant polymerases (TP-(dAMP)2 and longer elongation products would be unstable at the polymerization active site and therefore would be further degraded by the exonuclease activity). In addition, the instability of the primer terminus at the polymerization active site, which would result in a severe impairment of translocation, would explain the inability of the polymerases mutated at the KXY motif to carry out processive DNA polymerization and pyrophosphorolysis. On the other hand, the analysis of mutant polymerase K498T indicates that the elimination of the positive charge at this position probably produces a more drastic distortion at the active site, since no synthetic activity can be detected, even when using the TP as primer. This phenotype cannot be explained either as a consequence of the low affinity for DNA (since the initiation reaction in the absence of template DNA was also severely impaired) or as an inefficient binding to the TP (determined to be normal). Thus, although a direct role of residue Lys498 in catalysis cannot be ruled out, it is possible that the positive charge at position 498 of φ29 DNA polymerase is critical for the correct positioning of the primer terminus (both in the DNA and in the TP) at the polymerization active site. Interestingly, another basic residue of φ29 DNA polymerase (Arg438), belonging to conserved motif TX2GR, has been recently proposed to be involved in binding both types of primer structures (Méndez et al., 1994). It has been reported (Hwang et al., 1992) that a drug-resistant mutant of herpes simplex virus contains a single point mutation in the DNA polymerase gene, exactly in the Tyr residue of the KXY motif (Y941H). The fact that this mutation confers to the polymerase resistance to acyclovir and foscarnet led to the suggestion that this conserved motif could be forming part of the active site of the enzyme, probably contributing to dNTP binding. Actually, mutant polymerases K498R and Y500S recovered part of the DNA polymerization activities when Mn2+ (that reduces the Km for dNTPs in φ29 DNA polymerase) was used as metal activator. This phenotype could well be explained as a secondary effect derived from the instability of the DNA primer terminus at the active site, which would certainly impair the correct positioning and stabilization of the incoming nucleotide. However, none of the mutant polymerases studied in this work showed altered sensitivities to dNTP analogs BuAdATP and BuPdGTP, ( 2M. A. Blasco, J. Méndez, J. M. Lázaro, L. Blanco, and M. Salas, unpublished results. )as it was the case in other φ29 DNA polymerase mutants affected in dNTP binding and/or selection (Blasco et al., 1992a). In conclusion, the phenotypes of mutants K498R, K498T, and Y500S in conserved motif KXY suggest a function of these conserved amino acids in the binding and/or stabilization of primer terminus at the polymerization active site, being the positive charge of residue Lys498 critical for dNTP incorporation on both TP and DNA primer terminus structures.

https://openalex.org/W1756556372,"Structure-function relationships of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH, alpha-melanotropin) were investigated and novel alpha-MSH receptor antagonists were identified. Based on the alpha-MSH-[5-13] peptide sequence, a multi-use peptide library consisting of 31,360 structurally different candidates was generated, and approximately 40% of the peptides were individually screened for their ability to block receptor function. This led to the identification of antagonists with a range of potencies and revealed structural requirements necessary for receptor inactivation. The most potent antagonist Met-Pro-D-Phe-Arg-D-Trp-Phe-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2 has an IC50 value of 11 +/- 7 nM. Analysis revealed that D-Trp5 and Phe6 were crucial to its antagonistic properties which could be potentiated by D-Phe3. This study demonstrates that residues in positions 5-6, 7-9, and 10 of the alpha-MSH sequence constitute crucial determinants for potent antagonist activity."
https://openalex.org/W1577470317,"The transcription initiation factor, TFIIF, is essential not only for the initiation of transcription but also for efficient elongation of mRNA synthesis by mammalian RNA polymerase II and is extensively phosphorylated in vivo. The possible regulation of TFIIF activity by protein phosphorylation was investigated by comparing the biochemical properties of alkaline phosphatase-treated HeLa TFIIF with those of native or bacterially expressed factor. Alkaline phosphatase treatment decreased the size of the large subunit (RAP74) of TFIIF to that of the recombinant protein but did not change the size of the small subunit (RAP30). Both the transcription initiation and elongation stimulating activities of the alkaline phosphatase-treated TFIIF decreased to 15-20% of the native form under conditions in which the amount of TFIIF was rate-limiting for transcription. Furthermore, phosphatase-treated TFIIF assembled the DBPolF complex and bound to RNA polymerase II less efficiently than the native protein. When hybrid TFIIFs were reconstituted using native or recombinant subunits, a native form of RAP74 stimulated both transcription and DBPolF complex formation activity regardless of whether native or recombinant RAP30 was used. We propose that TFIIF activity is regulated by protein phosphorylation, particularly of the RAP74 subunit. The functional role of RAP74 in assembling the preinitiation complex and modulating TFIIF activity is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1546645929,"Mouse and human leukemia inhibitory factor (mLIF and hLIF) have approximately 80% amino acid identity, but mLIF cannot bind to the hLIF receptor (hLIF-R), while hLIF binds to the alpha-chain of the mLIF receptor (mLIF-R) with a much higher affinity than does mLIF. We have previously shown that the same regions confer both these properties of hLIF and map to an area within the predicted third alpha-helix and two of the loops of hLIF (Owczarek, C. M., Layton, M. J., Metcalf, D., Lock, P., Wilson, T. A., Gough, N. M., and Nicola, N. A. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 3487-3495). The present studies, using interspecies chimeras of mLIF and hLIF, have defined 6 residues (Asp57, Ser107, His112, Ser113, Val155, and Lys158) that contribute most of the binding energy involved in the interaction of hLIF and the hLIF-R alpha-chain, and form a surface at one end of the predicted four alpha-helical bundle of the hLIF molecule. Mouse LIF is unable to bind to the hLIF-R alpha-chain or activate the cellular hLIF-R, but when these 6 residues were substituted onto an mLIF framework, they were able to reconstitute both the binding and biological activities specific to hLIF."
https://openalex.org/W1534825972,"The eukaryotic family of type I DNA topoisomerases includes the nuclear type I enzymes and the enzymes encoded by vaccinia and other poxviruses. The small size of the vaccinia topoisomerase (314 amino acids as compared to 765-972 amino acids for the cellular enzymes) makes it likely that this protein constitutes the minimal functional unit of a eukaryotic type I enzyme and provides an opportunity for a comprehensive structure-function analysis through mutagenesis. Two protein subregions were targeted for mutagenesis in the present study. The role of the Ser-Lys-X-X-Tyr sequence present at the active site of all family members was examined by replacing each conserved residue with alanine. Alanine substitution at the active site Tyr abrogated topoisomerase activity. In contrast, mutations at Ser-270 and Lys-271 had no effect on enzyme activity. The region of the vaccinia topoisomerase from amino acids 126-142 (MFFIRFGKMKYLKENET) is highly conserved and contains a residue, Gly-132, shown previously to be essential. Twenty-nine different mutations were generated in this region, with at least one substitution at each position. Point mutations were identified at three positions, Arg-130, Tyr-136, and Leu-137, which either abrogated or severely reduced DNA relaxation. The effects on activity could be attributed to a defect in formation of the covalent intermediate. Alterations of 13 other amino acids, including conserved residues, had little or no effect on topoisomerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1598823566,"To investigate the structure-function relationship of human apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV), several deletion mutants of this protein were constructed by sequentially removing pairs of 22-residue repeats, potentially having an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation. The mutants, produced as recombinant poly-histidine-tagged apolipoproteins (t-apo) in Escherichia coli, assembled with phosphatidylcholine (i.e. dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, or egg lecithin) as did native apoA-IV. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) cofactor function, measured as cholesterol esterification occurring when t-apo-phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol complexes were incubated with purified enzyme, decreased significantly when pairs of repeats between residues 117 and 248 were deleted and most markedly when residues 117-160 were deleted. LCAT cofactor activity decreased by 90 and 75%, respectively, when egg lecithin or palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine was used to form the particles with the delta aa 117-160 mutant. Thus, on the basis of deletion scanning of t-apo, residues 117-160 seem to be involved in the LCAT cofactor function of apoA-IV."
https://openalex.org/W1563088296,"Ethylene oxide, a direct-acting mutagen and carcinogen, produces 3-hydroxyethyldeoxyuridine (3-HE-dU) after initial alkylation at N3 of dC, followed by rapid hydrolytic deamination. The significance of formation of 3-HE-dU in DNA was investigated by in vitro DNA replication of 3-HE-dU. A 55-nucleotide DNA template, containing 3-HE-dU at a single site, was constructed. DNA products, synthesized on the site-modified template, were analyzed and mutagenic bypass at 3-HE-dU estimated. The 3-HE-dU lesion blocked DNA replication by the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli polymerase I (Kf Pol I) and bacteriophage T7 polymerase (T7 Pol) 3' to 3-HE-dU and after incorporating a nucleotide opposite 3-HE-dU. DNA synthesis past 3-HE-dU was negligible ( 5' exonuclease proofreading activity, for Kf Pol I and T7 Pol, respectively, facilitated DNA synthesis past 3-HE-dU. The bypass synthesis by Kf Pol I (exo-) was 60% and 90% by T7 Pol (exo-). These results suggest that the 3-HE-dU lesion could be bypassed, but that the extension at 3-HE-dU is rate-limiting. In the absence of proofreading, the nucleotide incorporated opposite 3-HE-dU is not excised and remains in position long enough for extension to occur. During post-lesion synthesis, both dA and dT were incorporated opposite 3-HE-dU. Since 3-HE-dU is derived from dC alkylation by ethylene oxide, incorporation of dA and dT opposite 3-HE-dU implicates this lesion in G.C-->A.T and G.C-->T.A mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1584774769,"Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin in vivo was examined using a highly specific anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody combined with high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The two major isoforms of calmodulin immunoprecipitated from insulin-treated hepatocytes migrated on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to the same position as nonphosphorylated calmodulin and calmodulin phosphorylated in vitro. Immunoblotting verified the identity of calmodulin. Insulin enhanced the phosphorylation of calmodulin 3.1 +/- 0.4-fold (mean +/- S.E., n = 10), with a stoichiometry in insulin-treated hepatocytes of 0.47 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- S.E., n = 3) mol of phosphate/mol of calmodulin. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of calmodulin immunoprecipitated from rat hepatocytes and calmodulin phosphorylated in vitro by the insulin receptor kinase or casein kinase II revealed several common phosphopeptides. The common phosphopeptides that appeared insulin-sensitive in intact cells comprised 61 and 40% of casein kinase II- and insulin receptor-catalyzed 32P incorporation into calmodulin in vitro, respectively. This suggests that casein kinase II and the insulin receptor kinase are, at least in part, responsible for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin in rat hepatocytes. These data indicate that phosphorylation of calmodulin in intact hepatocytes is significantly enhanced by insulin, supporting a critical role for calmodulin in insulin signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1666782112,"T double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and its single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) counterpart, 23 S RNA, are present in some strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 23 S RNA is identical with the T (+)-strand, and both are cytoplasmically inherited. The T (+)-strand encodes a protein of 104 kilodaltons (kDa) (p104) that has sequences diagnostic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases from (+)-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses. Here we show that p104 is expressed only in yeast strains carrying T dsRNA (and 23 S RNA) and that the ability to produce p104 is co-transmitted from one strain to another by cytoplasmic mixing (cytoduction) along with T dsRNA. Neither T nor 23 S RNA is encapsidated into viral particles; however, the latter was found to be non-covalently associated with p104. This finding was based on the evidence that: (i) both 23 S RNA and p104 cosedimented in sucrose gradients and that (ii) 23 S RNA was immunoprecipitated by a p104-specific polyclonal antiserum. Consistent with this association, p104 shows single-stranded RNA-binding activity in Northwestern blots. We have localized the RNA-binding domain of p104 within its C terminus 234 amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1483580894,"The Na-K-Cl cotransporter of avian salt gland is a membrane-bound 170-kDa protein that is phosphorylated in response to cAMP- and Ca(2+)-dependent secretogogues and is homologous to the Na-K-Cl cotransporter in another Cl-secreting epithelia; the shark rectal gland (Torchia, J., Lytle, C., Pon, D. J., Forbush, B., and Sen, A. K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25444-25450). In the present study we assess the role of Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC) activation on the phosphorylation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter. Although the addition of ionomycin alone did not significantly stimulate cotransporter phosphorylation, concurrent addition of ionomycin plus the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments, using a monoclonal antibody which specifically recognizes the cotransporter, suggested that the response to CCh or ionomycin plus PMA was quantitatively similar (5-fold) and was localized exclusively on serine residues. In contrast, when 4 alpha-phorbol was added in the presence of ionomycin, no stimulation was observed. To further assess the involvement of PKC on cotransporter phosphorylation the effects of protein kinase inhibitors were tested. Both staurosporine and calphostin C inhibited phosphorylation of the cotransporter at concentrations known to inhibit PKC, whereas the calmodulin antagonist W-7 had no significant effect. The requirement for Ca2+ was tested further by removing Ca2+ from the incubation medium and stimulating with CCh. Under these conditions, the CCh-stimulated phosphorylation was transient and, furthermore, could be completely inhibited by preloading the cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid) prior to stimulation. The involvement of protein phosphatases on the phosphorylation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter was also tested. The addition of okadaic acid stimulated phosphorylation by approximately 3-fold. Taken together these results suggest that the phosphorylation state of the cotransporter involves a dynamic interplay between changes in intracellular Ca2+, PKC, and protein phosphatase activities."

https://openalex.org/W1669037342,"To identify consensus sequence motif for a new family of protein kinase termed autophosphorylation-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase (auto-kinase), we have tested several synthetic peptides. The well established protein serine/threonine kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM-kinase), and protein kinase C were found to be inactive toward phosphorylation of syntide-3 (RPRPASVPPSPSLSRHA), which turned out to be an excellent substrate only for auto-kinase, indicating that syntide-3 is a specific substrate for auto-kinase. Modification of syntide-3 to become RPRPASVPPS/T did not affect the activity of auto-kinase. By contrast, autokinase became rather or almost inactive when the peptide was modified to become RPRPASVPPA/G/F/K/R/D/E/Y, indicating that amino acid number 10 in syntide-3 is crucial to the sequence motif recognized by auto-kinase. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) by autokinase revealed that auto-kinase predominantly phosphorylates MBP on one particular site with RT-T(p)HYGS as the phosphorylation site sequence, which could not be phosphorylated by any other reported MBP kinases including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, CaM-kinase, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and kinase FA/GSK-3. Taken together, the results provide initial evidence that -Arg-X-(X)-Ser/Thr-X3-Ser/Thr- may represent a unique consensus sequence motif specifically recognized by autophosphorylation-dependent protein kinase, a new family of multi-substrate/multifunctional protein serine/threonine kinase."
