https://openalex.org/W2010606592,"The cell walls of selected oomycetous fungi are composed primarily of glucans, and cellulose constitutes a relatively small proportion of the total glucan. The noncellulosic constituents consist of acid-soluble glucan or glucans and insoluble glucan or glucans. These noncellulosic glucan fractions contain beta-(1-->3) glucosidic linkages and apparently beta-(1-->6) linkages also."

https://openalex.org/W2034587956,"The hypothesis that the Martian wave of darkening might be a frostheaving phenomenon has been examined. Consideration of the water-vapor sorption characteristics of a silicate mineral surface at temperatures below freezing leads to the conclusion that, without strongly deliquescent salts to attract and retain liquid water in the Martian soil, frost-heaving phenomena are not to be expected on Mars. On the other hand frost-heaving phenomena involving the freezing and thawing of ammonia may be common in the soils of Jupiter."
https://openalex.org/W2093812789,"Scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with cell isolation procedures revealed details of the packing of threads in hagfish slime gland thread cells. Biochemical studies indicate that the thread is largely composed of a protein subunit with a molecular weight of 63,500. Mathematical calculations suggest that the thread may attain lengths of 60 centimeters or more."
https://openalex.org/W2045265251,"We show that the rubidium in amphiboles is generally depleted with respect to potassium. The K:Rb ratios of 50 analyzed amphiboles range from 100 to 5000, averaging 1120. This fractionation effect holds for potassium concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 percent. The K:Rb ratios of abyssal tholeiites do not place unambiguous limits on the K:Rb ratio of the upper mantle, since partial melting of a mantle material such as amphibole peridotite would produce a liquid with a K:Rb ratio higher than that in the initial material. Large-scale mineralogic control of distributions of trace elements in the mantle could produce trends with depth that are the reverse of trends normally attributed to differentiation processes."
https://openalex.org/W1992616778,"Data from a magnetic mass spectrometer flown on the Explorer 31 satellite show that the ionosphere above 1000 kilometers usually consists of hydrogen ions as the predominant species. Between this altitude and perigee (500 kilometers) the dominant ion species shifts to atomic oxygen, with a significant amount of atomic nitrogen ions also present. Helium ions are present in small quantities at all altitudes. Other minor ions observed are those of 2, 7, 8, 15, 18, and 20 atomic mass units."
https://openalex.org/W1986307024,"Six genera of snakes, representing at least three lineages, possess teeth that fold backward against the jaws rather than being firmly ankylosed. This condition, effected by a connective tissue hinge at the base of each tooth, is associated with suites of cephalic modifications that enable the snakes to grasp and to swallow hard-bodied prey."
https://openalex.org/W2037108687,"Male cockroaches Gromphadorhina portentosa were made to run at 0.03, 0.07, and 0.12 kilometer per hour on a miniature treadmill within a small respirometer. Oxygen consumption was directly related to running velocity. The half-time necessary for oxygen consumption to reach a steady state during exercise was about 1 minute and the half-time for recovery was 4 to 6 minutes. The energetic cost of transport was comparable to that for bipedal and quadrupedal vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2003714925,"The formation and the closure of constricting rings by a nematode-trapping fungus were recorded by means of time-lapse cinephotomicrography. Analysis of the film revealed that hyphal rings resulted from a sequence of morphological events not previouisly described. Cell inflation and ring constriction were induced by touch, increased temperature, and electrical stimutlation. The inflation process was not particularly sensitive to metabolic inhibitors and appears to operate without an expenditutre of energy on the part of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2058405008,"Small doses of cycloheximide given at intervals (pulses) cause phase shifts of the circadian clock of Neurospora. The effects of this drug on the clock are mediated through its inhibition of protein synthesis, since two cycloheximide-resistant mutants whose 80S ribosomes are resistant to cycloheximide showed no phase shift after exposure to the durg."

https://openalex.org/W1994142081,"The Mountains of Mitchel and other temporary bright patches observed on the Martian disk may be carbon-dioxide condensations in depressions rather than a water-ice mixture on mountains as previously thought. This interpretation supports the hypothesis that the Martian deserts, that is, the light areas, are lower than their surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W2009110579,It has been believed that marine crustacea do not encyst as adults. The benthic copepod Heteropsyllus nunni has been found to encyst in intertidal sands in the summer; free-living forms are abundant in the winter. A unique platelike structure on the cephalothorax is thought to be the site of cyst formation.
https://openalex.org/W2006440832,Significant differences between populations occur in calcium uptake during growth within one species of freshwater limpet. These are not related to environmental differences and may involve genetically determined physiological races. Such variation is significant in relation to aspects of evolution in freshwater animals and is important in assessing radionuclide contamination.
https://openalex.org/W2030956340,"During the 1960's, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States all experienced periods of rapid growth of research expenditures and of university enrollments followed by declines in growth rates. This sequence has generated the current severe shortages of new academic positions, with a resulting long-range threat to the vitality of academic science. Declines in the 18-year-old cohort in the United States, and especially in Canada, aggravate the problem. The United States is the only one of these countries that has not adopted a modest program to deal with the problems by creating fellowships or new positions."
https://openalex.org/W2015225973,"The study of homing movements of displaced newts (Taricha rivularis) revealed unexpected features of the migratory behavior of amphibians. Newts leaving the breeding stream in the spring move not directly uphill but at an angle carrying them upstream. When they emerge after summer estivation this tendency is not evident in captures made during the autumn and winter. During the latter period, however, newly metamorphosed frogs (Rana boylii) show the same pronounced upstream migration that characterizes T. rivularis in the spring."

https://openalex.org/W2021353849,"The administration's strategic minerals policy will emphasize mining and stockpiling, but there are concerns that national security will be used as justification for destroying public lands. The stockpile effort will raise the current stores of 93 minerals and materials from a value of $15 billion to $18 billion, the estimated requirement for a three-year war. The severity of our minerals crisis is debated because of demand flexibility that could come from conservation, substitution, and recycling and because government agencies disagree on whether the US has many of the resources now imported. Efforts to amend the Wilderness Act by releasing public lands to multiple use and opening up areas to mining are opposed by environmentalists. (DCK)"
https://openalex.org/W1991363593,Plants grown in D(2)O show a decreased tendency to fractionate carbon-13 during photosynthetic incorporation of carbon dioxide. The isotopic ratio C(13)/C(12) of the tissues of deuterated plants appears to be proportional to the deuterium content of the tissue. This effect was found in specimens of the partially deuterated vascular plant Nicotiana tabacum as well as in cultures of the fully deuterated alga Chlorella vulgaris.
https://openalex.org/W1992316178,Some normal-looking chloroplasts of a Nitella cell do not incorporate carbon dioxide into substances insoluble in cold acid. The distribution of such chloroplasts among the rows of normal organelles indicates that the defect is not due to a genetic mutation but probably represents a physiological stage in the development of the organelles.
