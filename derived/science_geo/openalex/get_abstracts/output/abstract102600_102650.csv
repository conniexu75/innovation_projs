https://openalex.org/W2055111778,"Interferons (IFNs) induce antiviral activity in many cell types. The ability of IFN-gamma to inhibit replication of ectromelia, vaccinia, and herpes simplex-1 viruses in mouse macrophages correlated with the cells' production of nitric oxide (NO). Viral replication was restored in IFN-gamma-treated macrophages exposed to inhibitors of NO synthase. Conversely, epithelial cells with no detectable NO synthesis restricted viral replication when transfected with a complementary DNA encoding inducible NO synthase or treated with organic compounds that generate NO. In mice, an inhibitor of NO synthase converted resolving ectromelia virus infection into fulminant mousepox. Thus, induction of NO synthase can be necessary and sufficient for a substantial antiviral effect of IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W2041187882,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulates transcription of specific genes by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of a 91-kilodalton cytoplasmic protein (termed STAT for signal transducer and activator of transcription). Stat91 was phosphorylated on a single site (Tyr701), and phosphorylation of this site was required for nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and gene activation. Stat84, a differentially spliced product of the same gene that lacks the 38 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Stat91, did not activate transcription, although it was phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus and bound DNA. Thus, Stat91 mediates activation of transcription in response to IFN-gamma."

This initial structure defines the helical pitch as single-stranded, fixes the number of residues per turn at six to seven, specifies the helix sense as right-handed, and identifies the hydrogen bonds. Refinement of this initial structure yields reasonable hydrogen-bonding distances with only minimal changes in the torsion angles."
https://openalex.org/W2079791074,"To evaluate the potential of direct transfer of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cDNA for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), we administered an E1-deficient adenovirus, encoding CFTR, to a defined area of nasal airway epithelium of three individuals with CF. This treatment corrected the Cl- transport defect that is characteristic of CF-affected epithelia. After treatment, there was a decrease in the elevated basal transepithelial voltage, and the normal response to a cAMP agonist was restored. We found no evidence of viral replication or virus-associated adverse effects, even at the highest dose tested (25 MOI). These data represent a small step in achieving long-term improvement of CF lung function by gene therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1991022711,"Chloroplast development requires coordinate nuclear and chloroplast gene expression. A putative signal from the chloroplast couples the transcription of certain nuclear genes encoding photosynthesis-related proteins with chloroplast function. We have identified at least three Arabidopsis nuclear genes (GUN1, GUN2, and GUN3) necessary for coupling the expression of some nuclear genes to the functional state of the chloroplast. Homozygous recessive gun mutations allow nuclear gene expression in the absence of chloroplast development and furthermore may interfere with the switch from dark-grown to light-grown development. Other reports suggest this intracellular cross-talk also involves mitochondrial interactions. The GUN genes thus define steps in one specific branch of a complex interorganellar regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W2081081246,"Connexin43 (Cx43) is an integral plasma membrane protein that forms gap junctions between vertebrate cells. We have used sucrose gradient fractionation and chemical cross-linking to study the first step in gap junction assembly, oligomerization of Cx43 monomers into connexon channels. In contrast with other plasma membrane proteins, multisubunit assembly of Cx43 was specifically and completely blocked when endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport was inhibited by 15 degrees C incubation, carbonyl cyanide m-chloro-phenylhydrazone, or brefeldin A or in CHO cell mutants with temperature-sensitive defects in secretion. Additional experiments indicated that connexon assembly occurred intracellularly, most likely in the trans-Golgi network. These results describe a post-ER assembly pathway for integral membrane proteins and have implications for the relationship between membrane protein oligomerization and intracellular transport."
https://openalex.org/W2068488477,"The ligand for the CD40 antigen is a 39-kilodalton protein, gp39, expressed on the surface of activated CD4+ T cells and is essential for thymus-dependent humoral immunity. The role of gp39-CD40 interactions in autoimmune disease was investigated in vivo with the use of an antibody that blocks their interactions (anti-gp39). Arthritis induced in mice by immunization with type II collagen was inhibited by anti-gp39. Anti-gp39 blocked the development of joint inflammation, serum antibody titers to collagen, the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the subsynovial tissue, and the erosion of cartilage and bone. Thus, interference with gp39-CD40 interactions may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W1492833857,"Previous biochemical studies have determined that human saliva contains high and low molecular weight mucin glycoproteins (MG1 and MG2, respectively) that are structurally distinct. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of overlapping cDNA clones which code for the MG2 protein core. DNA sequencing revealed a translated region of 1131 nucleotides encoding a protein of 377 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 39 kDa. The first 20 N-terminal residues were very hydrophobic and probably comprise the MG2 leader peptide. The region encoding the secreted protein can be divided into three distinct domains; unique 5‘- and 3‘-translated regions containing 4 and 1 potential N-glycosylation sites, respectively, and a central region of six almost perfect tandem repeats of 23 amino acid residues with a high number of Thr and Ser. No sequence homology with any other human or animal mucins, and no significant homology to any other proteins was found. MG2 mRNA is about 2.5 kilobases long, and its expression appears to be species-, tissue-, and cell-specific. We propose to name this gene MUC7 in accordance with the mucin genes cloned to date named MUC1-MUC6."
https://openalex.org/W2023130165,"We examined, using physiological and morphological techniques, the distribution of Ca2+-gated K+ (gKca) channels relative to the location of Ca2+ channels and transmitter release sites at the frog neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Charybdotoxin (ChTx) and iberiotoxin, blockers of gKca channels with large conductances, increase transmitter release at the frog NMJ. Intracellular Ca2+ buffers with rapid binding kinetics, dimethyl BAPTA and BAPTA, prevented the effect of ChTx, but EGTA, a Ca2+ buffer with similar affinity for Ca2+ but slower binding kinetics, did not. Dimethyl BAPTA and BAPTA, but not EGTA, caused a temporary increase in transmitter release. Labeling of gKca channels with ChTx-biotin revealed a series of bands located at the sites of Caz+ channels, but this labeling did not occur in denervated preparations. Cross sections of NMJs revealed that gKca channels are clustered in the presynaptic membrane facing the postsynaptic membrane. We conclude that gKca channels are strategically clustered at the neurotransmitter release sites, where they can be quickly activated by Ca2+ entering the terminal."
https://openalex.org/W2001917467,"In the absence of growth factors, hemopoietic cells die rapidly by the process of apoptosis. Transfection of the human bcl-2 gene into an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent, multipotent hemopoietic cell line allowed these cells to survive in the absence of IL-3, both in serum-containing and serum-deprived conditions, and this survival was accompanied by multilineage differentiation. Moreover, single cell experiments showed that differentiation could occur in the absence of cell division. While these data do not rule out the possibility that growth factors can influence the lineage choice of multipotent cells, they suggest that exposure to growth factors may not be obligatory for the differentiation of stem cells. The data also support the hypothesis that differentiation is intrinsically determined and that the role of the hemopoietic growth factors is enabling rather than inductive."
https://openalex.org/W1506729263,"The alpha 5 beta 1 integrin binds fibronectin through the integrin recognition sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). We have used a 6-amino acid peptide library expressed on filamentous phage to identify peptide ligands for alpha 5 beta 1. We found that this integrin selectively binds RGD-containing peptides from the library. Of the 32 different sequences obtained, 28 had the RGD motif, 3 contained sequences related to RGD, and only 1 had a clearly different sequence. One of the RGD-containing phage encoded a potentially cyclic insert CRGDCL. The cyclic peptide GAC*RGDC*LGA (where * denotes cysteines forming a disulfide bond) was 10-fold more efficient than any of the linear RGD-containing hexapeptides in inhibiting the binding of RGD-expressing phage to alpha 5 beta 1 or the attachment of alpha 5 beta 1-expressing cells to fibronectin. This peptide also inhibited cell attachment mediated by the alpha v beta 1, alpha v beta 3, and alpha v beta 5 integrins with about 10-fold higher efficiency than linear GRGDSP. One peptide containing an RGD-related sequence, NGRAHA, was also found to inhibit phage attachment and cell adhesion, especially adhesion mediated by the alpha v beta 5 integrin. These results indicate that novel and high affinity ligands for integrins can be isolated from a random peptide library."
https://openalex.org/W1519301821,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a pleiotropic activation of the immune system which might subsequently result in septic shock. One of the cell surface receptors for LPS is the glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein CD14. Binding of LPS to CD14 induces production of lymphokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-8, and CD14 is subsequently released from the cell surface. However, the mechanism of signaling via CD14 is still not known. We report here that protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) p56lyn is coupled to the LPS receptor CD14 in human monocytes. LPS rapidly activates CD14-associated p56lyn simultaneously with PTKs p58hck and p59c-fgr. Inhibition of PTKs by herbimycin A completely blocks LPS-induced down-modulation of CD14 and production of TNF-alpha and IL-1. These data suggest a critical role of PTKs in the LPS/CD14-mediated signal transduction pathway in human monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1479939900,"Insect defensins are cationic, cysteine-rich peptides (approximately 4 kDa) that appear after bacterial challenge or injury in the hemolymph of insects belonging to a large variety of orders. These peptides possess anti-Gram-positive activity and participate in the potent antibacterial defense reactions of insects. Using recombinant insect defensin and the strain Micrococcus luteus as a test organism, we have investigated the mode of action of this peptide. We show that defensin disrupts the permeability barrier of the cytoplasmic membrane of M. luteus, resulting in a loss of cytoplasmic potassium, a partial depolarization of the inner membrane, a decrease in cytoplasmic ATP, and an inhibition of respiration. Potassium loss is inhibited below the order-disorder transition of the lipid hydrocarbon chains. It is also inhibited by divalent cations and by a decrease in the membrane potential below a threshold of 110 mV. We propose that these permeability changes reflect the formation of channels in the cytoplasmic membrane by defensin oligomers. This proposal is supported by patch-clamp experiments that show that insect defensins form channels in giant liposomes."
https://openalex.org/W2040595594,"Activated autoreactive T cells are potentially pathogenic and regulated by clonotypic networks. Experimental autoimmune diseases can be treated by inoculation with autoreactive T cells (T cell vaccination). In the present study, patients with multiple sclerosis were inoculated with irradiated myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T cells. T cell responses to the inoculates were induced to deplete circulating MBP-reactive T cells in the recipients. Regulatory T cell lines isolated from the recipients inhibited T cells used for vaccination. The cytotoxicity of the CD8+ T cell lines was restricted by major histocompatibility antigens. Thus, clonotypic interactions regulating autoreactive T cells in humans can be induced by T cell vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2057204569,"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a cytokine that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils. The G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) is a member of the hemopoietic growth factor receptor family. A G-CSFR expression plasmid was introduced into interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent mouse myeloid precursor FDC-P1 cells that normally do not respond to G-CSF. G-CSF stimulated proliferation of the transformants, down-regulated Thy-1 and F4/80 antigens on the cell surface, and induced expression of neutrophil-specific genes such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and leukocyte elastase. On the other hand, neither granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) nor IL-3 induced MPO gene expression, but they inhibited G-CSFR-mediated MPO gene expression. These results suggested that the G-CSFR, but not the IL-3/GM-CSF receptors, transduced the neutrophilic differentiation signal into cells. Mutational analysis of the G-CSFR indicated that the N-terminal region of its cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to transduce the proliferation signal into cells, while the C-terminal region plays an essential role in transducing the differentiation signal."
https://openalex.org/W2078362295,"A highly efficient method has been developed for the solid-phase synthesis of an ""unnatural biopolymer"" consisting of chiral aminocarbonate monomers linked via a carbamate backbone. Oligocarbamates were synthesized from N-protected p-nitrophenyl carbonate monomers, substituted with a variety of side chains, with greater than 99 percent overall coupling efficiencies per step. A spatially defined library of oligocarbamates was generated by using photochemical methods and screened for binding affinity to a monoclonal antibody. A number of high-affinity ligands were then synthesized and analyzed in solution with respect to their inhibition concentration values, water/octanol partitioning coefficients, and proteolytic stability. These and other unnatural polymers may provide new frameworks for drug development and for testing theories of protein and peptide folding and structure."
https://openalex.org/W2036369875,"Three threonine residues in the tail region of Dictyostelium myosin II heavy chain have been implicated previously in control of myosin filament formation. Here we report the in vitro and in vivo consequences of converting these sites to alanine residues, which eliminates phosphorylation at these positions, or to aspartate residues, which mimics the negative charge state of the phosphorylated molecule. Alanine substitution allows in vitro assembly and in vivo contractile activity, although this myosin shows substantial over-assembly in vivo. Aspartate substitution eliminates filament assembly in vitro and renders the myosin unable to drive any tested contractile event in vivo. These results demonstrate that heavy chain phosphorylation plays a key modulatory role in controlling myosin function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1997489674,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) depletes T cells expressing CD4 and B cells expressing immunoglobulin (Ig) VH3 gene products. A subpopulation of normal B cells from non-HIV-infected individuals was shown to bind to HIV gp120 by means of membrane Ig; most of these B cells expressed VH3 family Ig. Serum VH3 IgM from uninfected individuals also avidly bound gp120. Finally, gp120 selectively induced Ig secretion by VH3 B cells, indicating that the binding of gp120 functionally activated these cells. These results indicate that naturally occurring VH3 Ig is a second ligand for gp120 and a candidate superantigen for VH3 B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006129103,Divalent cation blockade of cGMP-gated channels in photoreceptor cells ensures the low open channel noise required for a highly sensitive visual transduction process. This study identifies a divalent cation-binding site in the pore of a retinal cGMP-gated channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Substitution of a specific glutamate residue by a neutral amino acid renders the channel insensitive to external Mg2+ and Ca2+ and affects the conduction of Na+. The mutated channels remain sensitive to internal divalent cations. These results place the glutamate residue in the ion conduction pathway close to the extracellular surface.
https://openalex.org/W2056884826,"Syntrophin, a 58 kd extrinsic membrane protein, is concentrated at postsynaptic sites at the neuromuscular junction and may be involved in clustering acetylcholine receptors. In muscle and nonmuscle tissues, syntrophin is associated with dystrophin, utrophin, and two homologs of the dystrophin carboxy-terminal region. We have isolated three cDNAs encoding Torpedo and mouse syntrophins. The Torpedo cDNA encodes a full-length protein, and on Northern blots recognizes a 3.5 kb mRNA. The two mouse syntrophin cDNAs are products of separate genes but encode proteins that share 50% identity. Syntrophin-1 mRNA (2.2 kb) is expressed at highest levels in skeletal muscle. Syntrophin-2 mRNAs (2.2, 5.0, and 10 kb) are expressed in all mouse tissues examined. These patterns of expression suggest that syntrophin-1 and syntrophin-2 may associate with different members of the dystrophin family."

https://openalex.org/W1580762299,"Using the human Intestine 407 cell line as a model, we investigated a possible role for tyrosine kinase(s) in regulating the ion efflux pathways induced by hyposmotic stimulation (regulatory volume decrease, RVD). Pretreatment of 125I(-)-and 86Rb(+)-loaded cells with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (200 microM) potentiated isotope efflux triggered by mild hypotonicity (10-20%) but did not further increase the efflux in response to more vigorous osmotic stimulation (30% hypotonicity). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein largely reduced the osmoshock-induced efflux in both control and vanadate-pretreated cells, while not affecting calcium-activated 86Rb+ efflux. Potentiation of the RVD response by vanadate was confirmed by direct measurements of hypotonicity-induced changes in cell volume. Hypotonic shock alone triggered a rapid and transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins as well as phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, the potentiating effects of vanadate on hypotonicity-induced ion efflux and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation were mimicked by epidermal growth factor. Neither vanadate nor epidermal growth factor provoked a RVD-like ionic response under isotonic conditions. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential step in the RVD response and suggest a novel role of growth factors in the cellular defense against osmotic stress."

https://openalex.org/W2094757867,"Chemical acylation experiments showed that the RNA major groove, often assumed to be too deep and narrow to permit recognition interactions, is accessible at duplex termini. Reactivity extended further into the helix in the 5' than in the 3' direction. Asymmetric and large loops between helices uncoupled them, which yielded both enhanced reactivity at terminal base pairs and weaker stabilization enthalpy compared to that in small loops or symmetric loops of the same size. Uncoupled helices have effective helix ends with accessible major grooves; such motifs are attractive contributors to protein recognition, tertiary folding, and catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1663165115,Genes induced by thyroid hormone (TH) to change their expression in the Xenopus laevis gastrointestinal (GI) tract have been isolated using a subtractive hybridization method. An exhaustive search for down-regulated genes identified a single gene. Thirty-two different cDNA fragments derived from the up-regulated mRNA of tadpole intestine 18 h after addition of TH were cloned. They map to no more than 22 distinct genes. The isolation of multiple cDNA fragments derived from a single mRNA indicates that the complexity of up-regulated genes is limited. Both ubiquitous and intestine-specific up-regulated genes were found in this screen. The majority of these genes respond directly to TH induction as judged by the resistance of up-regulation to inhibitors of protein synthesis. The biological significance of these genes is supported by their dramatic regulation in the GI tract during spontaneous metamorphosis.
https://openalex.org/W2094089753,"To study the role of glutamate uptake at central glutamatergic synapses, we used the uptake blocker L-transpyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC). The effects of PDC on the glutamate uptake current in salamander retinal glia indicated that PDC competes with glutamate for transport on the uptake carrier and that 300 microM PDC should significantly reduce the uptake of glutamate during the synaptic current. In isolated rat hippocampal neurons, 300 microM PDC did not affect non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor currents, but reduced NMDA receptor currents by 30%. In hippocampal and cerebellar slices, whereas 300 microM PDC reduced the NMDA component of excitatory synaptic currents by 50%, it reduced the non-NMDA component only slightly with no change in its decay time constant. Thus, the decay rate of the non-NMDA component is not set by the rate of glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic terminal."
https://openalex.org/W2085547642,"Basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class transcription factors bind DNA as hetero- and homodimers. In murine myogenic cells the HLH network includes multiple members of the E protein, MyoD, and Id families; changes in the network characterize muscle determination and differentiation and have been proposed as causal for these developmental transitions. To test the importance of HLH partner choice in these cellular decisions, we have designed a strategy in which the identity of a bHLH dimer is specified by joining two monomers via a flexible polypeptide linker. A MyoD-E47 polyprotein avidly bound the same DNA targets as its unlinked counterpart, but, unlike intermolecular dimers that are very sensitive to inhibition by Id, MyoD-E47 was resistant to Id challenge. In cells MyoD-E47 acted as a dominant positive myogenic factor, capable of initiating myogenic determination and also substantially bypassing negative regulation of differentiation by serum growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1570043275,"Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel. We previously showed that in vivo PKA phosphorylated 4 serines (Ser-660, Ser-737, Ser-795, and Ser-813) within the R domain. Here we show that a mutant CFTR lacking all 4 serines can still be phosphorylated by PKA to yield an activated Cl- channel, but channel open-state probability was substantially reduced. We also observed phosphorylation and Cl- channel activity in another mutant lacking all 8 consensus PKA serines in the R domain. We were unable to identify the residual phosphorylation sites by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. These data suggest two possible interpretations: (a) additional, as yet unidentified, phosphorylation sites within CFTR may also open the channel, or (b) the 4 serines, previously identified as in vivo PKA phosphorylation sites, are the primary regulatory sites within CFTR, but in their absence, other sites can be phosphorylated to open the channel. The additional sites are likely located within the R domain: CFTR delta R-S660A, which lacks much of the R domain (residues 708-835) and replaces Ser-660 with an alanine, was no longer regulated by PKA. Substitution of aspartate for consensus PKA phosphorylation sites in the R domain mimicked the effect of phosphorylation. Mutants containing six or more serine-to-aspartate substitutions generated Cl- channels that opened without PKA phosphorylation. These results suggest that the R domain keeps the channel closed and that phosphorylation of the R domain or insertion of the negatively charged aspartate opens the channel, perhaps by electrostatic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1533966692,"The endogenous biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO) is increased during gestation. To begin our investigation of a possible tissue source (or sources), we examined the placenta. We postulated that analogous to the endothelium of blood vessels, the syncytiotrophoblast (STr) cell layer that lines the intervillous blood space of the human placenta would express NO synthase. Our results show that human placental villi express a calcium- and calmodulin-sensitive form of NO synthase, located mainly in the microsomal cell fraction. By in situ hybridization using a riboprobe generated from human endothelial NO synthase cDNA, we observe NO synthase mRNA expression in STr. The STr also shows NADPH-diaphorase staining, indicating the presence of NO synthase, and most likely other flavin-containing enzymes involved in sex steroid metabolism. NO synthase activity was also detected in the villi of a complete mole placenta (which lacks fetal vessels), further supporting a trophoblastic origin. Our findings suggest a previously unrecognized role for STr-derived NO in placental function."
https://openalex.org/W2007196307,"In Drosophila, mutations in specific ion channel genes can increase or decrease the level of neural/synaptic activity. We have used these genetic tools, in combination with classical pharmacological agents; to modulate neural activity during embryogenesis and examined effects on the differentiation of an identified neuromuscular junction. We find that electrical activity is required for the neural induction of transmitter receptor expression during synaptogenesis. Likewise, neural electrical activity is required to localize transmitter receptors to the synaptic site. In muscles with activity-blocked synapses, a low level of receptors is expressed homogeneously in the muscle membrane as in muscles developing without innervation. Thus, presynaptic electrical activity is required to mediate the neural induction of the transmitter receptor field in the postsynaptic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1505398616,"At least three distinct ryanodine receptor genes appear to be expressed in mammalian brain. We have used biochemical and immunological methods to characterize the major form of ryanodine binding protein purified from brain. [3H]Ryanodine binding to the purified brain receptor is stimulated by Ca2+, ATP, KCl, and phosphorylation and is inhibited by calmodulin, Mg2+, and ruthenium red. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against skeletal and cardiac muscle ryanodine receptors, and two novel polyclonal antibodies against the brain ryanodine receptor, reveals that the major form of ryanodine receptor expressed in brain is immunologically similar to the cardiac ryanodine receptor, but is distinct from the skeletal muscle receptor. Digestion of cardiac and brain ryanodine receptors with trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin generates similar proteolytic patterns as detected by immunoblot analysis or by autoradiography after labeling with a hydrophobic probe, suggesting that the two proteins are similar in both their large cytoplasmic and hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Taken together, these data indicate that the cardiac ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ release channel is the major form of ryanodine receptor expressed in brain, and that it likely functions in releasing Ca2+ from caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores in neurons by a mechanism of regulated Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release."
https://openalex.org/W1664151389,"Heparin is potently antiproliferative for vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo and in vitro, inhibiting early proto-oncogene expression and blocking proliferation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of serine- and threonine-specific kinases is activated in response to a wide range of mitogenic and other factors and is a key intermediate in cell signaling. We found that heparin inhibits activation of MAPK in response to fetal calf serum and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not epidermal growth factor, revealing heparin-sensitive and -insensitive pathways of MAPK activation. This report tentatively links suppression of early proto-oncogene expression and inhibition of cellular proliferation by heparin with inhibition of a mitogenically relevant kinase in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2301617676,"Isolated stage VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis expressed uridine transport activity after microinjection of mRNA from rat jejunum. Uridine uptake during 30 min (10 microM, 20 degrees C) by mRNA-injected oocytes reached 2.5 pmol/oocyte, compared with endogenous uptake by water-injected oocytes of about 0.05 pmol/oocyte. The expressed transport activity was 96% Na(+)-dependent, saturable (apparent Km = 15 microM) and inhibited by phloridzin (IC50 = 100 microM). Nucleoside inhibition studies resolved the expressed transport activity into two components: 1) a novel Na(+)-dependent system of broad purine and pyrimidine specificity that was inhibited by low concentrations of guanosine, inosine, adenosine, uridine, thymidine, and cytidine and 2) a Na(+)-dependent system of narrower specificity that was inhibited by low concentrations of guanosine, inosine, adenosine, and uridine and by high concentrations of thymidine and cytidine. The characteristics of the latter system are consistent with those of the Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport system N1 (cif), previously identified in a number of cell types and tissues, including intestinal epithelia and cultured cells of intestinal origin. The broad specificity system, which was also detected in mRNA-injected oocytes using thymidine as permeant, has been given the provisional designation N3 to distinguish it from the previously described N1 (purine-selective) and N2 (pyrimidine-selective) Na(+)-linked nucleoside transporters. Rat jejunal transporters N1 and N3 were both expressed maximally by the same mRNA size fraction (1.6-3.0 kb, peak 2.3 kb)."
https://openalex.org/W1585408587,"The hairpin ribozyme catalyzes site-specific cleavage of an RNA substrate using a magnesium-dependent transphosphorylation mechanism. Here, we describe experiments designed to test the importance of ribose 2'-hydroxyl groups for ribozyme function. Ribozymes for this work were synthesized in two segments using solid-phase RNA phosphoramidite chemistry. 2'-Deoxyribonucleotides were systematically introduced at each of the 50 positions within the ribozyme, and the catalytic activity of the resulting mixed RNA-DNA polymers was measured. Deletion of the 2'-hydroxyl group at each of four sites (A10, G11, A24, and C25) was found to result in severe inhibition of cleavage activity (kcat/KM decreased by 100- to 1000-fold), although KM measurements and mobility-shift assays showed that substrate binding was not affected. Identical results were obtained upon substitution of these ribonucleotides with 2'-O-methyl derivatives. Inhibition by 2'-modified sugars at G11 or A24 was rescued by increased Mg2+ concentrations, suggesting that these 2'-hydroxyls may function in magnesium binding. Our results demonstrate that the 2'-hydroxyl groups at A10, G11, A24, and C25 provide essential functions for catalysis, possibly forming important tertiary contacts or magnesium coordination sites that are necessary for active site architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1516555591,"The src family of protein-tyrosine kinases has long been implicated in signal transduction by growth factor receptors. In particular, pp60c-src, the product of the protooncogene c-src, has been shown to associated with the activated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. We demonstrate that, following stimulation of quiescent cells with PDGF, pp60c-src is translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. This phenomenon was better defined utilizing an isolated plasma membrane system. The release of pp60c-src from the membrane in response to PDGF is accompanied by a 4-fold activation of its kinase activity and by phosphorylation at the amino terminus on serine/threonine residues as well as tyrosine residues. This amino-terminal phosphorylation appears to be responsible for a change in hydrophobicity of the pp60c-src molecule and hence for its release from the membrane. The kinase responsible for the serine/threonine phosphorylation and the concomitant release of pp60c-src has been identified as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Thus, PDGF stimulation activates at least two membrane-associated kinases (pp60c-src and cAMP-dependent protein kinase) very early in its signal transduction pathway."

Here we describe novel epitopes that are accentuated when gp120 complexes with its receptor (CD4). The presentation of these epitopes results through conformational rearrangements in the CD4/gp120 complex. Monoclonal antibodies directed to these epitopes inhibit syncytium formation, thus indicating the potential use of these epitopes as subunit vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1559506200,"We studied the consequences of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts as a model for the effects of virally transduced CFTR expression in non-epithelial cells. Fibroblasts were infected with a retrovirus vector that contained the human CFTR and neor cDNAs. We selected and expanded G418-resistant clones that encompassed a range of CFTR expression. CFTR-mediated Cl-conductance function was measured as whole cell current, and CFTR protein was quantitated by immunoblot analysis. Overall, there was a good relationship between CFTR protein levels and CFTR-mediated Cl- conductance. Some clones had consistently high basal levels of CFTR-mediated Cl- conductance. This variation in function was partially explained by CFTR protein levels and was not due to clonal variation in cAMP metabolism. High levels of CFTR expression were associated with depolarization of fibroblast membrane potential. The CFTR-expressing clones with the largest basally active CFTR Cl- conductances and the most depolarized membrane potentials also exhibited slower growth rates. These results suggest that potential side effects of gene replacement therapy for cystic fibrosis include functional consequences of CFTR expression in non-epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1513878219,"Abstract His1237 in the beta subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase marks the 5' face of the active center since it can be cross-linked to the gamma-phosphate of the priming substrate. It is demonstrated that RNA chains up to 9 nucleotides in length can be synthesized using His1237-cross-linked nucleotide as a primer. Thus, a substantial mass of RNA can be accommodated in the active center between His1237 and the site of catalysis that remains juxtaposed to the growing 3' end. The apparent filling of the active center with RNA precedes promoter clearance and suggests a mechanism of coupling between catalysis and saltatory translocation of RNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1565894500,"Depletion of intracellular potassium (K+) induced a 4-fold increase in basal and 1 microM phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport in rat adipose cells. K+ depletion had no effect on the maximum insulin (0.7 microM)-stimulated transport rate but enhanced the sensitivity to insulin 3-fold (EC50 = 0.05 versus 0.15 nM) by a mechanism that did not result from changes in the insulin receptor binding, autophosphorylation, or tyrosine kinase activity. Western blotting analysis revealed that K+ depletion induced a 2.2-fold increase in GLUT4 in plasma membranes from basal cells, enhanced the PMA-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by 4-fold, and increased the 5-fold insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by 15%, indicating the presence of an inactive GLUT4 intermediate. The time course for insulin's stimulation of transport activity was accelerated by K+ depletion (t1/2 = 3 versus 1.5 min). Conversely, the reversal of transport activity, on removal of insulin, was delayed (t1/2 = 11 versus 22 min). The corresponding t1/2 values for the loss of GLUT4 were 22 min in control cells and 40 min in K(+)-depleted cells, again indicating the existence of an inactive intermediate. Photolabeling intact cells with the impermeant, exofacial photolabel 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4 - yloxy)-2-propylamine in the continuous presence of insulin revealed that K+ depletion had no effect on the GLUT4 externalization rate but halved the rate of internalization. K+ depletion elicited entirely analogous effects on the recycling of insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor, strongly supporting the involvement of a coated pit mechanism in the recycling of GLUT4 transporters. An inactive conformation of GLUT4 has been detected in plasma membranes from insulin-stimulated cells, which is enhanced by K+ depletion, suggesting a limitation in the adipose cells' capacity to express active GLUT4 transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1547919289,"The basal hepatocyte phenotype is conferred by the expression of liver-specific genes. In the adult liver, the basal hepatocyte phenotype is further modified by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of genes which result in the appearance of specific proteins in selected hepatocytes. One of these proteins is the erythroid/brain or GLUT-1 glucose transporter. The GLUT-1 protein is detected in the plasma membrane of only one or two hepatocytes located at the end of the liver cell plate, contiguous to the hepatic venule. The objective of this study was to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for the restricted expression of the GLUT-1 protein in rat liver. Hepatocytes were isolated from either the proximal (periportal) or the distal (perivenular) half of the liver cell plate. The GLUT-1 mRNA as well as the GLUT-1 protein content and intracellular distribution were defined after subcellular fractionation of each hepatocyte population. In addition, the location of the GLUT-1 protein in liver tissue was determined by confocal microscopy. We propose that the GLUT-1 gene is transcribed and the mRNA is translated by both periportal and perivenular hepatocytes. However, insertion of the GLUT-1 protein into the plasma membrane occurs only in the last two hepatocytes contiguous to the hepatic venule. In other hepatocytes, the protein remains in a different cellular compartment characterized here as a low density microsomal fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1589662186,"Tumor production of a parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is a common cause of the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, which is frequently associated with renal cell carcinomas. Why certain renal cell carcinomas produce PTHrP while others do not is unknown. Using a system of 12 human renal carcinoma cell lines which either do (n = 6) or do not (n = 6) produce PTHrP, we found that the expression of the PTHrP gene in these cell lines is controlled at the transcriptional level. Transfection studies failed to demonstrate variation in PTHrP promoter activity in these cell lines sufficient to account for the differential PTHrP expression, implicating a cis-acting mechanism. Transcription of the PTHrP gene in these cell lines was found to correlate with the methylation state of specific CpG dinucleotides located within the promoter region but outside a CpG island. The functional importance of this mechanism of control was confirmed by the ability of the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, to induce PTHrP mRNA expression in previously nonexpressing cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W1548745816,"Abstract The connector of bacteriophage phi 29 is known to promote the viral prohead assembly, to bind DNA, and to drive DNA packaging into preformed viral shells in an RNA-dependent process. In this report, the phi 29 connector protein, p10, is shown to bind RNA in a sequence-independent fashion, and to possess an RNA recognition motif comprised approximately the region between residues 21 and 94 of the p10 sequence. Substitution mutants in specific amino acids of the RNA-binding domain obtained by site-directed mutagenesis showed that amino acids Phe23, His57, Phe59, and Tyr61 are critical for RNA binding and, subsequently, for DNA packaging into proheads. Proteolytic modified forms of the phi 29 connector have allowed us to conclude that the DNA- and RNA-binding domains are separated within the p10 sequence. It is also shown that RNA is stably associated to DNA-filled proheads during the DNA-packaging process."

https://openalex.org/W1584026320,"Abstract Although structural features and expression patterns of the src family of tyrosine kinases have been extensively analyzed, there are no direct comparative studies of the putative protein substrates that are tyrosine-phosphorylated by the normal cellular versions of these enzymes. In this report, we have expressed normal and enzymatically activated versions of the fyn, fgr, and src translational products by transfection of appropriate cDNAs into mouse fibroblasts. Because the same parental cell line was used for all transfections, each enzyme was expressed in a similar milieu of potential in vivo substrates. After verification of appropriate expression from each transfected cDNA and assessment of relative transforming potency, a series of putative protein substrates was specifically assayed for expression and tyrosine phosphorylation. Our data indicate that the normal src family kinases display some degree of substrate specificity but that specificity is diminished when these enzymes are constitutively activated. In the course of these studies, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were noted to coimmunoprecipitate with some of these putative in vivo substrates. Some of these coimmunoprecipitating proteins have been reported previously, whereas others, such as the presence of p59fyn in anti-p80/85 immunoprecipitates, are heretofore undescribed."

https://openalex.org/W1505740490,"P1 is a nuclear protein found exclusively in rat liver and binds to a motif that spans nucleotides -310 to -288 of the thyroid hormone responsive gene, S14. We expect P1 to play an important role in regulating gene expression because the binding motif for this factor is contained within a DNase I-hypersensitive site of S14 chromatin. In this report, we have attempted to define the function of P1 by correlating its DNA binding activity with levels of mRNA-S14 in response to aging and obesity. Results of all studies revealed inverse relationships between the activity of P1 and levels of mRNA-S14, thus suggesting that P1 may function as a repressor of S14 gene expression. Accordingly, we tested the repressor hypothesis using cell-free transcription and transient transfection assays to measure the activity of reporter constructs with and without the P1 binding motif. In the presence of the P1 motif, S14 promoter activity was repressed and the negative effect on gene transcription was further enhanced by thyroid hormone. These observations are consistent with P1 being a repressor of S14 gene transcription."
