https://openalex.org/W4283704819,"Abstract Three lineages (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant of concern predominantly drove South Africa’s fourth Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) wave. We have now identified two new lineages, BA.4 and BA.5, responsible for a fifth wave of infections. The spike proteins of BA.4 and BA.5 are identical, and similar to BA.2 except for the addition of 69–70 deletion (present in the Alpha variant and the BA.1 lineage), L452R (present in the Delta variant), F486V and the wild-type amino acid at Q493. The two lineages differ only outside of the spike region. The 69–70 deletion in spike allows these lineages to be identified by the proxy marker of S-gene target failure, on the background of variants not possessing this feature. BA.4 and BA.5 have rapidly replaced BA.2, reaching more than 50% of sequenced cases in South Africa by the first week of April 2022. Using a multinomial logistic regression model, we estimated growth advantages for BA.4 and BA.5 of 0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08–0.09) and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.09–0.11) per day, respectively, over BA.2 in South Africa. The continued discovery of genetically diverse Omicron lineages points to the hypothesis that a discrete reservoir, such as human chronic infections and/or animal hosts, is potentially contributing to further evolution and dispersal of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W4283646162,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved variants with substitutions in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that affect its affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and recognition by antibodies. These substitutions could also shape future evolution by modulating the effects of mutations at other sites—a phenomenon called epistasis. To investigate this possibility, we performed deep mutational scans to measure the effects on ACE2 binding of all single–amino acid mutations in the Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Eta variant RBDs. Some substitutions, most prominently Asn 501 →Tyr (N501Y), cause epistatic shifts in the effects of mutations at other sites. These epistatic shifts shape subsequent evolutionary change—for example, enabling many of the antibody-escape substitutions in the Omicron RBD. These epistatic shifts occur despite high conservation of the overall RBD structure. Our data shed light on RBD sequence-function relationships and facilitate interpretation of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4283712086,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, perturbing neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations. In this study, using single-cell transcriptomics, we mapped all non-immune, non-neuronal cell populations in wild-type and AD model (5xFAD) mouse brains. We identified an oligodendrocyte state that increased in association with brain pathology, which we termed disease-associated oligodendrocytes (DOLs). In a murine model of amyloidosis, DOLs appear long after plaque accumulation, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) alone was not sufficient to induce the DOL signature in vitro. DOLs could be identified in a mouse model of tauopathy and in other murine neurodegenerative and autoimmune inflammatory conditions, suggesting a common response to severe pathological conditions. Using quantitative spatial analysis of mouse and postmortem human brain tissues, we found that oligodendrocytes expressing a key DOL marker (SERPINA3N/SERPINA3 accordingly) are present in the cortex in areas of brain damage and are enriched near Aβ plaques. In postmortem human brain tissue, the expression level of this marker correlated with cognitive decline. Altogether, this study uncovers a shared signature of oligodendrocytes in central nervous system pathologies. We identified an oligodendrocyte signature associated with brain pathology in the 5xFAD model of amyloidosis, which we termed disease-associated oligodendrocytes. This signature was found to be shared by oligodendrocytes across pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W4283691112,"Most methods for single-cell transcriptome sequencing amplify the termini of polyadenylated transcripts, capturing only a small fraction of the total cellular transcriptome. This precludes the detection of many long non-coding, short non-coding and non-polyadenylated protein-coding transcripts and hinders alternative splicing analysis. We, therefore, developed VASA-seq to detect the total transcriptome in single cells, which is enabled by fragmenting and tailing all RNA molecules subsequent to cell lysis. The method is compatible with both plate-based formats and droplet microfluidics. We applied VASA-seq to more than 30,000 single cells in the developing mouse embryo during gastrulation and early organogenesis. Analyzing the dynamics of the total single-cell transcriptome, we discovered cell type markers, many based on non-coding RNA, and performed in vivo cell cycle analysis via detection of non-polyadenylated histone genes. RNA velocity characterization was improved, accurately retracing blood maturation trajectories. Moreover, our VASA-seq data provide a comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing during mammalian development, which highlighted substantial rearrangements during blood development and heart morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4283702425,"Abstract Climate change and urbanization are rapidly increasing human exposure to extreme ambient temperatures, yet few studies have examined temperature and mortality in Latin America. We conducted a nonlinear, distributed-lag, longitudinal analysis of daily ambient temperatures and mortality among 326 Latin American cities between 2002 and 2015. We observed 15,431,532 deaths among ≈2.9 billion person-years of risk. The excess death fraction of total deaths was 0.67% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58–0.74%) for heat-related deaths and 5.09% (95% CI 4.64–5.47%) for cold-related deaths. The relative risk of death was 1.057 (95% CI 1.046–1.067%) per 1 °C higher temperature during extreme heat and 1.034 (95% CI 1.028–1.040%) per 1 °C lower temperature during extreme cold. In Latin American cities, a substantial proportion of deaths is attributable to nonoptimal ambient temperatures. Marginal increases in observed hot temperatures are associated with steep increases in mortality risk. These risks were strongest among older adults and for cardiovascular and respiratory deaths."

https://openalex.org/W4283697488,"Soft-bodied slow-moving sea creatures such as sea stars and sea cucumbers lack an adaptive immune system and have instead evolved the ability to make specialized protective chemicals (glycosylated steroids and triterpenes) as part of their innate immune system. This raises the intriguing question of how these biosynthetic pathways have evolved. Sea star saponins are steroidal, while those of the sea cucumber are triterpenoid. Sterol biosynthesis in animals involves cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol by the oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) enzyme lanosterol synthase (LSS). Here we show that sea cucumbers lack LSS and instead have two divergent OSCs that produce triterpene saponins and that are likely to have evolved from an ancestral LSS by gene duplication and neofunctionalization. We further show that sea cucumbers make alternate sterols that confer protection against self-poisoning by their own saponins. Collectively, these events have enabled sea cucumbers to evolve the ability to produce saponins and saponin-resistant sterols concomitantly."
https://openalex.org/W4283592937,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the deadliest cancers. The retinoblastoma protein (RB1), a regulator of cell proliferation, is functionally inactivated in HCC by CYCLIN D/E-mediated phosphorylation. However, the mechanism of RB1-inactivation is unclear because only small percentages of HCCs exhibit amplification of CYCLIN D/E or mutations in the CDK-inhibitory genes. We show that FOXM1, which is overexpressed and critical for HCC, plays essential roles in inactivating RB1 and suppressing RB1-induced senescence of the HCC cells. Mechanistically, FOXM1 binds RB1 and DNMT3B to repress the expression of FOXO1, leading to a decrease in the levels of the CDK-inhibitors, creating an environment for phosphorylation and inactivation of RB1. Consistent with that, inhibition of FOXM1 causes increased expression of FOXO1 with consequent activation of RB1, leading to senescence of the HCC cells, in vitro and in vivo. Also, repression-deficient mutants of FOXM1 induce senescence that is blocked by depletion of RB1 or FOXO1. We provide evidence that human HCCs rely upon this FOXM1-FOXO1 axis for phosphorylation and inactivation of RB1. The observations demonstrate the existence of a new autoregulatory loop of RB1-inactivation in HCC involving a FOXM1-FOXO1 axis that is required for phosphorylation of RB1 and for aggressive progression of HCC."

https://openalex.org/W4283577973,"This paper develops a regional dataset of change at 381 settlements for Lycia-Pamphylia in southwest Anatolia (Turkey) from volume 8 of the Tabula Imperii Byzantini-a compilation of historical toponyms and archaeological evidence. This region is rich in archaeological remains and high-quality paleo-climatic and -environmental archives. Our archaeological synthesis enables direct comparison of these datasets to discuss current hypotheses of climate impacts on historical societies. A Roman Climatic Optimum, characterized by warmer and wetter conditions, facilitating Roman expansion in the 1st-2nd centuries CE cannot be supported here, as Early Byzantine settlement did not benefit from enhanced precipitation in the 4th-6th centuries CE as often supposed. However, widespread settlement decline in a period with challenging archaeological chronologies (c. 550-650 CE) was likely caused by a ""perfect storm"" of environmental, climatic, seismic, pathogenic and socio-economic factors, though a shift to drier conditions from c. 460 CE appears to have preceded other factors by at least a century."
https://openalex.org/W4283579714,"Background The possibility to better predict the severity of the disease in a patient newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis would allow the treatment strategy to be personalized and lead to better clinical outcomes. Prognostic biomarkers are highly needed. Objective To assess the prognostic value of intrathecal IgM synthesis, cerebrospinal fluid and serum IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, chitinase 3-like 2 and neurofilament heavy chains obtained early after the onset of the disease. Methods 58 patients after the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis were included. After the initial diagnostic assessment including serum and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, all patients initiated therapy with either glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, or interferon beta. To assess the evolution of the disease, we followed the patients clinically and with MRI for two years. Results The IL-2:IL-6 ratio (both in cerebrospinal fluid) &lt;0.48 (p = 0.0028), IL-2 in cerebrospinal fluid ≥1.23pg/ml (p = 0.026), and chitinase 3-like 2 in cerebrospinal fluid ≥7900pg/ml (p = 0.033), as well as baseline EDSS ≥1.5 (p = 0.0481) and age &lt;22 (p = 0.0312), proved to be independent markers associated with shorter relapse free intervals. Conclusion The IL-2:IL-6 ratio, IL-2, and chitinase 3-like 2 (all in cerebrospinal fluid) might be of value as prognostic biomarkers in early phases of multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4283690772,"Trace mineral imbalances can have significant effects on animal health, reproductive success, and survival. Monitoring their status in wildlife populations is, therefore, important for management and conservation. Typically, livers and kidneys are sampled to measure mineral status, but biopsies and lethal-sampling are not always possible, particularly for Species at Risk. We aimed to: 1) determine baseline mineral levels in Northern Mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou; Gmelin, 1788) in northwestern British Columbia, Canada, and 2) determine if hair can be used as an effective indicator of caribou mineral status by evaluating associations between hair and organ mineral concentrations. Hair, liver, and kidney samples from adult male caribou (nHair = 31; nLiver, nKidney = 43) were collected by guide-outfitters in 2016-2018 hunting seasons. Trace minerals and heavy metals were quantified using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and organ and hair concentrations of same individuals were compared. Some organ mineral concentrations differed from other caribou populations, though no clinical deficiency or toxicity symptoms were reported in our population. Significant correlations were found between liver and hair selenium (rho = 0.66, p<0.05), kidney and hair cobalt (rho = 0.51, p<0.05), and liver and hair molybdenum (rho = 0.37, p<0.10). These findings suggest that hair trace mineral assessment may be used as a non-invasive and easily-accessible way to monitor caribou selenium, cobalt, and molybdenum status, and may be a valuable tool to help assess overall caribou health."
https://openalex.org/W4283576315,"Tracking temporal and spatial genomic changes and evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are among the most urgent research topics worldwide, which help to elucidate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and the effect of deleterious variants. Our current study concentrates genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Uzbekistan and their associations with COVID-19 severity. Thirty-nine whole genome sequences (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from PCR-positive patients from Tashkent, Uzbekistan for the period of July-August 2021, were generated and further subjected to further genomic analysis. Genome-wide annotations of clinical isolates from our study have revealed a total of 223 nucleotide-level variations including SNPs and 34 deletions at different positions throughout the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2. These changes included two novel mutations at the Nonstructural protein (Nsp) 13: A85P and Nsp12: Y479N, which were unreported previously. There were two groups of co-occurred substitution patterns: the missense mutations in the Spike (S): D614G, Open Reading Frame (ORF) 1b: P314L, Nsp3: F924, 5`UTR:C241T; Nsp3:P2046L and Nsp3:P2287S, and the synonymous mutations in the Nsp4:D2907 (C8986T), Nsp6:T3646A and Nsp14:A1918V regions, respectively. The “Nextstrain” clustered the largest number of SARS-CoV-2 strains into the Delta clade (n = 32; 82%), followed by two Alpha-originated (n = 4; 10,3%) and 20A (n = 3; 7,7%) clades. Geographically the Delta clade sample sequences were grouped into several clusters with the SARS-CoV genotypes from Russia, Denmark, USA, Egypt and Bangladesh. Phylogenetically, the Delta isolates in our study belong to the two main subclades 21A (56%) and 21J (44%). We found that females were more affected by 21A, whereas males by 21J variant (χ2 = 4.57; p ≤ 0.05, n = 32). The amino acid substitution ORF7a:P45L in the Delta isolates found to be significantly associated with disease severity. In conclusion, this study evidenced that Identified novel substitutions Nsp13: A85P and Nsp12: Y479N, have a destabilizing effect, while missense substitution ORF7a: P45L significantly associated with disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W4283585246,"Independent component analysis (ICA) has been shown to be a powerful blind source separation technique for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets. ICA can extract independent spatial maps and their corresponding time courses from fMRI data without a priori specification of time courses. Some popular ICA algorithms such as Infomax or FastICA generate different results after repeated analysis from the same data volume, which is generally acknowledged as a drawback for ICA approaches. The reliability of some ICA algorithms has been explored by methods such as ICASSO and RAICAR (ranking and averaging independent component analysis by reproducibility). However, the exact algorithmic reliability of different ICA algorithms has not been examined and compared with each other. Here, the quality index generated with ICASSO and spatial correlation coefficients were used to examine the reliability of different ICA algorithms. The results demonstrated that Infomax running 10 times with ICASSO could generate consistent independent components from fMRI data sets."
https://openalex.org/W4283590141,"Revegetation of exposed sub-soil, while a desirable strategy in the recovery processes, often fails due to extreme soil chemical properties, such as low organic matter and pH levels inhospitable to biological activities such as nutrients cycling and plant establishment. This is the case for approximately 800 ha of the Cerrado biome in Brazil, where erecting the embankment of a hydroelectric dam in the 1960's stripped vegetation, soil, and subsoil layers thereby distorting the soil properties. This work evaluates the effectiveness of restoration management (RM) treatments, to restore the soil quality, including biological activity and chemical attributes. In a factorial scheme, RM treatments include the addition of organic residue from aquatic macrophytes (AM) at 3 rates (0, 16 and 32 t ha-1), combined with ash from sugar cane bagasse of agroindustrial origin (BA) at 4 rates (0, 15, 30 and 45 t ha-1). RM samples contrasted samples collected from undisturbed Cerrado (CER) as well as a degraded area without intervention (DAWI). The mechanized RM plots received amendments and reforestation of 10 Cerrado native tree species. After 5 years, vegetation covered up to 60% of the surface in RM treatments receiving AM32 + BA45. AM and BA residues promoted height increases in the introduced plants. All RM treatments promoted lower levels of Al3+ than DAWI and CER. The combination of AM32 over the rates of incorporated ash increased soil pH and K values similarly to CER. Microbial-related variables, such as microbial biomass-C was the largest in CER, followed by the RM treatments, and the lowest in DAWI. The microbial quotient was no different between CER and RM treatments. The addition of residues such as AM and BA increased the vegetation covered, improved chemical and microbiological indicators. Thus, the residues used aided the recovery process of intensely degraded soils in the Cerrado area."
https://openalex.org/W4283591857,"Background Fatigue is a common and burdensome symptom in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), yet is poorly understood. Currently, clinicians rely solely on fatigue questionnaires, which are inherently subjective measures. For the effective development of future therapies and stratification, it is of vital importance to identify biomarkers of fatigue. In this study, we identify brain differences between RA patients who improved and did not improve their levels of fatigue based on Chalder Fatigue Scale variation (ΔCFS≥ 2), and we compared the performance of different classifiers to distinguish between these samples at baseline. Methods Fifty-four fatigued RA patients underwent a magnetic resonance (MR) scan at baseline and 6 months later. At 6 months we identified those whose fatigue levels improved and those for whom it did not. More than 900 brain features across three data sets were assessed as potential predictors of fatigue improvement. These data sets included clinical, structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. A genetic algorithm was used for feature selection. Three classifiers were employed in the discrimination of improvers and non-improvers of fatigue: a Least Square Linear Discriminant (LSLD), a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a SVM with Radial Basis Function kernel. Results The highest accuracy (67.9%) was achieved with the sMRI set, followed by the DTI set (63.8%), whereas classification performance using clinical features was at the chance level. The mean curvature of the left superior temporal sulcus was most strongly selected during the feature selection step, followed by the surface are of the right frontal pole and the surface area of the left banks of the superior temporal sulcus. Conclusions The results presented evidence a superiority of brain metrics over clinical metrics in predicting fatigue changes. Further exploration of these methods may support clinicians to triage patients towards the most appropriate fatigue alleviating therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4283578912,"Purpose The current study aimed to investigate the time course of changes in choroidal circulation hemodynamics and their relationship to systemic circulation dynamics during the normal menstrual cycle in young, healthy women using laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG). Methods This prospective study included 26 eyes from 13 young, healthy women (21.3 ± 4.0 years) with a normal menstrual cycle and 24 eyes from 12 young, healthy men (21.8 ± 4.4 years) as a control group. The macular mean blur rate (MBR), a quantitative index of relative blood flow velocity in the choroid, was measured using LSFG. MBR, intraocular pressure (IOP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) were evaluated in the late follicular phase and mid-luteal phase in women and at baseline and 10 days after baseline in men, respectively. Results In the female group, IOP, SBP, DBP, MBP, and OPP values were significantly higher in the mid-luteal phase than those observed in the late follicular phase ( P = 0.035, P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.041, P = 0.001, P = 0.014, respectively). The average macular MBR values in the late follicular phase and mid-luteal phase were 12.7 ± 5.3 and 13.7 ± 6.6 (+7.7 ± 19.4%), representing a significant increase in the mid-luteal phase ( P = 0.041). The rate of change in MBR exhibited a significant positive correlation with changes in DBP and MBP ( R = 0.456, P = 0.019 and R = 0.474, P = 0.014). However, there were no significant changes in any of the factors in the male group during the study period. Conclusions Our results suggest that in young, healthy women with a normal menstrual cycle, choroidal blood flow velocity decreases during the late follicular phase and increases during the mid-luteal phase, depending on systemic circulatory dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4283647276,"Background Individuals with respiratory conditions, such as asthma, are particularly susceptible to adverse health effects associated with higher levels of ambient air pollution and temperature. This study evaluates whether hourly levels of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and dry bulb globe temperature (DBGT) are associated with the lung function of adult participants with asthma. Methods and findings Global positioning system (GPS) location, respiratory function (measured as forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV 1 )), and self-reports of asthma medication usage and symptoms were collected as part of the Exposure, Location, and Lung Function (ELF) study. Hourly ambient PM 2.5 and DBGT exposures were estimated by integrating air quality and temperature public records with time-activity patterns using GPS coordinates for each participant (n = 35). The relationships between acute PM 2.5 , DBGT, rescue bronchodilator use, and lung function collected in one week periods and over two seasons (summer/winter) were analyzed by multivariate regression, using different exposure time frames. In separate models, increasing levels in PM 2.5 , but not DBGT, were associated with rescue bronchodilator use. Conversely DBGT, but not PM 2.5 , had a significant association with FEV 1 . When DBGT and PM 2.5 exposures were placed in the same model, the strongest association between cumulative PM 2.5 exposures and the use of rescue bronchodilator was identified at the 0–24 hours (OR = 1.030; 95% CI = 1.012–1.049; p-value = 0.001) and 0–48 hours (OR = 1.030; 95% CI = 1.013–1.057; p-value = 0.001) prior to lung function measure. Conversely, DBGT exposure at 0 hours (β = 3.257; SE = 0.879; p-value&gt;0.001) and 0–6 hours (β = 2.885; SE = 0.903; p-value = 0.001) hours before a reading were associated with FEV 1 . No significant interactions between DBGT and PM 2.5 were observed for rescue bronchodilator use or FEV 1 . Conclusions Short-term increases in PM 2.5 were associated with increased rescue bronchodilator use, while DBGT was associated with higher lung function (i.e. FEV 1 ). Further studies are needed to continue to elucidate the mechanisms of acute exposure to PM 2.5 and DBGT on lung function in asthmatics."
https://openalex.org/W4283697437,"Numerous studies demonstrated the lack of transferability of polygenic score (PGS) models across populations and the problem arising from unequal presentation of ancestries across genetic studies. However, even within European ancestry there are ethnic groups that are rarely presented in genetic studies. For instance, Russians, being one of the largest, diverse, and yet understudied group in Europe. In this study, we evaluated the reliability of genotype imputation for the Russian cohort by testing several commonly used imputation reference panels (e.g. HRC, 1000G, HGDP). HRC, in comparison with two other panels, showed the most accurate results based on both imputation accuracy and allele frequency concordance between masked and imputed genotypes. We built polygenic score models based on GWAS results from the UK biobank, measured the explained phenotypic variance in the Russian cohort attributed to polygenic scores for 11 phenotypes, collected in the clinic for each participant, and finally explored the role of allele frequency discordance between the UK biobank and the study cohort in the resulting PGS performance."
https://openalex.org/W4283698465,"Background The global rise of adolescent overweight and obesity is posing a new challenge to the public health sector by determining the forthcoming generation for the most awful and upsetting quality of social life by inducing bantering, social isolation, and stigmatization among children that contribute to the mental wellbeing of the growing adolescents. Risk factors for overweight and/or obesity might not be the same across different regions due to differences in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, ethnicity, and geographical location. Moreover, in this study area, no report has been documented so far on the determinant factors of overweight and/or obesity among school adolescents. Hence, this study aimed at identifying context-specific determinants of overweight and/or obesity among adolescents in the study area. Methods and materials School-based unmatched case-control study design was employed from March 1–30, 2019, in Butajira town, Southern Ethiopia. Data were collected regarding sociodemographic, dietary practice, physical activity, nutritional knowledge-related factors, and anthropometric measurements. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify independent predictors of overweight/obesity. Results We enrolled 297 adolescents: 99 cases, 198 controls. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis revealed that those in high socioeconomic status [AOR = 5.8, 95% CI (2.66, 12.5)], consumed soft drinks 3 and above times per week [AOR = 3.7, 95% CI (1.8, 7.3)], physically inactive [AOR = 4.4 95% CI (1.68, 11.6)], spent free time by watching television/movies for 3 and above hours per day [AOR = 8.6, 95% CI (4.3, 17)] and with poor nutritional knowledge [AOR = 3.4, 95%CI (1.7, 6.9)] were significantly associated with overweight and/obesity. Conclusion High socioeconomic status, consumption of soft drinks, physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and poor nutritional knowledge were significantly associated with overweight/obesity. Therefore, strengthening parent and school-based health education in healthy nutrition behaviors and promotion tactics such as enhancing physical activity, limiting watching television, and soft drinks will be helpful to minimize overweight and obesity among adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4283712646,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common in sexually active women, but cervical cancer only develops in a small fraction of HPV-infected women, suggesting that unknown intrinsic factors associated with the unique genetic/genomic background of the high-risk population play a critical role in cervical carcinogenesis. Although our previous studies have identified the hyperactivated YAP1 oncogene as a critical contributor to cervical cancer, the molecular mechanism by which YAP1 drives cervical cancer is unknown. In the present study, we found that although the hyperactivated YAP1 caused a malignant transformation of immortalized cervical epithelial cells, it induced cellular senescence in cultures of primary human cervical epithelial cells (HCvECs). However, the hyperactivated YAP1 induced malignant transformation of HCvECs in the presence of high-risk HPV E6/E7 proteins, suggesting that the hyperactivated YAP1 synergizes with HPV to initiate cervical cancer development. Our mechanistic studies demonstrate that YAP1, via up-regulating LATS2, formed a YAP1-LATS2 negative feedback loop in cervical epithelial cells to maintain homeostasis of cervical tissue. Intriguingly, we found that high-risk HPV targets LATS2 to disrupt the feedback loop leading to the malignant transformation of cervical epithelial cells. Finally, we report that mitomycin C, an FDA-approved drug that could upregulate LATS2 and drive cellular senescence in vitro and in vivo, induced a regression of cervical cancer in a pre-clinial animal model. Thus, high-risk HPV targeting the YAP1-LATS2 feedback loop represents a new mechanism of cervical cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W4285743230,"The salmon-eating Southern Resident killer whale (SRKW) (Orcinus orca) population currently comprises only 73 individuals, and is listed as 'endangered' under the Species at Risk Act in Canada. Recent evidence suggests that the growth of this population may be limited by food resources, especially Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We present spatio-temporal bioenergetics model for SRKW in the Salish Sea and the West Coast of Vancouver Island from 1979-2020 with the objective of evaluating how changes in the abundance, age-structure, and length-at-age of Chinook salmon populations has influenced the daily food consumption of the SRKW population. Our model showed that the SRKW population has been in energetic deficit for six of the last 40 years. Our results also suggested that the abundance of age-4 and age-5 Chinook salmon are significant predictors of energy intake for SRKW. We estimated that the annual consumption (April-October) of Chinook salmon by the whales between 1979 and 2020 ranged from 166,000 216,300. Over the past 40 years, the model estimated that the contribution in the predicted SRKW diet of Chinook salmon originating from the Columbia River has increased by about 34%, and decreased by about 15% for Chinook salmon stocks originating from Puget Sound. Overall, our study provides an overview of the requirements and availability of prey for SRKW over the last 40 years, while supporting the hypothesis that SRKW were limited by prey abundance in the study period."
https://openalex.org/W4283457813,"Sulfonolipids are unusual lipids found in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes. Sulfonolipid and its deacylated derivative, capnine, are sulfur analogs of ceramide-1-phosphate and sphingosine-1-phosphate, respectively; thus, sulfonolipid biosynthesis is postulated to be similar to the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Here, we identify the first enzyme in sulfonolipid synthesis in Alistipes finegoldii as the product of the alfi_1224 gene, cysteate acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) transferase (SulA). We show SulA catalyzes the condensation of acyl-ACP and cysteate (3-sulfo-alanine) to form 3-ketocapnine. Acyl-CoA is a poor substrate. We show SulA has a bound pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) cofactor that undergoes a spectral redshift in the presence of cysteate, consistent with the transition of the lysine-aldimine complex to a substrate-aldimine complex. Furthermore, the SulA crystal structure shows the same prototypical fold found in bacterial serine palmitoyltransferases (Spts), enveloping the PLP cofactor bound to Lys251. We observed the SulA and Spt active sites are identical except for Lys281 in SulA, which is an alanine in Spt. Additionally, SulA(K281A) is catalytically inactive but binds cysteate and forms the external aldimine normally, highlighting the structural role of the Lys281 side chain in walling off the active site from bulk solvent. Finally, the electropositive groove on the protein surface adjacent to the active site entrance provides a landing pad for the electronegative acyl-ACP surface.

In the absence of any intervention, the decomposition of these macroalgae over time can disrupt the balance of recipient ecosystems. Attention has been given to the potential use of U. reticulata as a supplier of nutrients for crop species such as tomatoes as a possible solution to the buildup of this unusable seaweed species, which is usually left to decompose in affected seagrass ecosystems; this is the case in the Merambong seagrass meadow in the Sungai Pulai estuary in Gelang Patah, southwestern Johor, Malaysia. We analyzed the macro- and micronutrient contents in U. reticulata to determine nutrient availability. We also performed greenhouse studies to test the effects of crude extracts from dried U. reticulata-Extract ""A"" and fresh U. reticulata-Extract ""B"" on plant growth, total yield, and quality vine-ripened fruits. Compared to other seaweed extracts used as plant growth promoters, U. reticulata extracts have higher nitrogen (N), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) contents. The application of 30% Extracts ""A"" and ""B"" and 50% Extracts ""A"" and ""B"" significantly affected tomato plant height. However, extract concentrations that promoted plant height and hastened flowering and fruiting did not increase total fruit yields. Both treatments that positively affected tomato plant height and hastened flowering and fruiting resulted in increased contents of total soluble solids (TSS), beta-carotene, lycopene, ascorbic acid and total titratable acidity (TTA) in the vine-ripened fruits. Agronomically, the application of 5% Extracts ""A"" and ""B"", 10%-20% Extracts ""A"" and ""B"", and 50% Extract ""A"" doubled the total yield compared to those of the control, and 40% Extract ""A"" resulted in the highest total fruit yield. In general, tomato plants responded well to Extract ""A"" than Extract ""B"" and presented good total fruit yield and quality."
https://openalex.org/W4283591664,"Ambient air pollution has been associated with adverse neurological health outcomes. Ambient pollutants are thought to trigger oxidative stress and inflammation to which vulnerable populations, such as elderly may be particularly susceptible. Our study investigated the possible association between concentrations of ambient air pollutants and the number of emergency department (ED) visits for nervous system disorders among people residing in a large Canadian city. A time-stratified case-crossover study design combining data from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) and the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) between 2004 and 2015 was used. Two air quality health indices were considered in additional to specific pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Weather condition data were included in the models. ED visits with a discharge diagnosis were identified using ICD-10 codes (G00-G99). The analysis was stratified by sex and age, also by seasons. The associations were investigated in arrays organized as 18 strata and 15 time lags (in days) for each pollutant. Overall, 140,511 ED visits were included for the analysis. Most ED visits were related to episodic and paroxysmal diagnoses (G40-G47, 64%), with a majority of visits for migraines (G43, 39%). Among females, an increase of 0.1ppm ambient CO was associated with an increased risk of paroxysmal diagnoses at day 1 (RR = 1.019 (95%CI 1.004-1.033)), day 6 (1.024 (1.010-1.039)) and day 7 (1.022 (1.007-1.036). PM2.5 and SO2, and air quality indices were similarly associated with ED visits for episodic and paroxysmal disorders in days 6 and 7. Findings highlight that ambient air pollution is associated with an increased number of ED visits for nervous system disorders, particularly visits for paroxysmal diagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W4283690254,"Rationale Despite the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and concurrent use of opioid therapy, no large-scale population studies have investigated whether opioid use and pre-existing OSA may interact synergistically to increase the risk of adverse health consequences. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using provincial health administrative data to evaluate whether the combined presence of opioid use and OSA increases the risk of adverse health consequences, such as mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits; and if it does, whether this co-occurrence has synergistic clinical relevance. Methods We included all adults who underwent a diagnostic sleep study in Ontario, Canada, between 2013 and 2016. Individuals were considered exposed to opioids if they filled a prescription that overlapped with the date of their sleep study (Opioid+). Individuals with at least a 50% probability of having a diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA (OSA+) were identified using a previously externally validated case-ascertainment model. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were all-cause or ischemic heart disease hospitalizations, all-cause ED visits, and motor vehicle collisions (MVC) requiring hospital or ED visit. We used multivariable Cox regression models to compare hazards between four mutually exclusive groups: (1) Opioid+ OSA+; (2) Opioid+ OSA-; (3) Opioid- OSA+, and (4) OSA- Opioid- (reference for comparison). Relative excess risks due to interaction (RERI) were calculated to test for additive interaction. Results Of 300,663 adults who underwent a sleep study, 15,713 (5.2%) were considered as Opioid+ and 128,351 (42.7%) as OSA+. Over a median of two years, 6,223 (2.1%) died from any cause. Regardless of OSA status, opioid use at the date of the sleep study was associated with an increased hazard for all-cause mortality with the greatest hazard associated with Opioid+ OSA- (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.75, 95% CI 1.57–1.94), but not Opioid+ OSA+ (aHR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.02–1.27) as hypothesized. Regardless of OSA status, opioid use at the date of the sleep study was associated with an increased hazard for all secondary outcomes. Opioid+ OSA+ was associated with the greatest hazards of all-cause hospitalizations (aHR 1.55, 95% CI 1.49–1.61) and MVC (aHR of 1.39; 95% CI 1.09–1.77); however, no statistically significant synergistic effects were observed. Conclusions Adults referred for sleep disorder assessment who used opioids had a significantly increased hazard of adverse health outcomes than those who did not, regardless of whether they had a high probability of moderate to severe OSA. The use of opioids and OSA was associated with the greatest hazard of all-cause hospitalizations and MVC requiring hospital or ED visit. The interaction of opioids and OSA did not confer a synergistic risk for poor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4283696719,"Background The burden of HPV-related cancers in different regions worldwide varies according to several factors. This study aims to measure inequality in the risk of incidence of HPV-related cancers in term of geographical risk patterns in northern Thailand using a population-based cancer registry data. Methods Trends in age-standardized HPV-related cancer incidence were calculated for the 2008–2017 time period. The Besag-York-Molli´e model was used to explore the spatial distribution of the relative risk (RR) of HPV-related cancers at the district level. A higher RR reflects a larger disparity. The geographical risk pattern of the diseases in two periods, 2008–2012 and 2013–2017 were described and compared. Results From 2008 to 2017, the incidence of oropharyngeal and anal cancers showed a slightly increased trend in males but remained stable in females, the incidence of vulvar, vaginal and penile cancers were stable while the incidence of cervical cancer decreased. The RR range was closer to 1 in the second period compared to the first period. This suggests a decrease in the disparities of incidence of cervical cancer. However, in some areas near the Thai-Myanmar border, the RR values remained high. Conclusion The incidence rate of most HPV-related cancers remained low and stable over the study period in northern Thailand. For the most common HPV-related malignancy, cervical cancer, the incidence rate steadily decreased but with marked geographic disparities, possibly reflecting health inequity especially in the border areas."
https://openalex.org/W4283710613,"Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of preterm preeclampsia (PE) screening versus routine screening based on maternal characteristics in Germany and Switzerland. Methods A health economic model was used to analyse the cost-effectiveness of PE screening versus routine screening based on maternal characteristics. The analysis was conducted from the healthcare perspective with a time horizon of one year from the start of pregnancy. The main outcome measures were incremental health care costs and incremental costs per PE case averted. Results The incremental health care costs for PE screening versus routine screening per woman were €14 in Germany, and -CHF42 in Switzerland, the latter representing cost savings. In Germany, the incremental costs per PE case averted were €3,795. In Switzerland, PE screening was dominant. The most influential parameter in the one-way sensitivity analysis was the cost of PE screening (Germany) and the probability of preterm PE in routine screening (Switzerland). In Germany, at a willingness-to-pay for one PE case avoided of €4,200, PE screening had a probability of more than 50% of being cost-effective compared to routine screening. In Switzerland, at a willingness-to-pay of CHF0, PE screening had a 78% probability of being the most cost-effective screening strategy. Conclusion For Switzerland, PE screening is expected to be cost saving in comparison to routine screening. For Germany, the additional health care costs per woman were expected to be €14. Future cost-effectiveness studies should be conducted with a longer time horizon."
https://openalex.org/W4283579197,"Matschie's tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus matschiei) is an endangered arboreal marsupial native to Papua New Guinea. Detailed field studies of its behavior and ecology are scarce due largely to its occupation of remote cloud forests and cryptic nature. Although this species has been in human care since the 1950s, much of its biology is still unknown. The current ex situ population is not sustainable due to health and reproductive problems, believed to stem largely from issues with diet and obesity. To better assess potential discrepancies between energy requirements and energy intake, we sought to 1) quantify total energy expenditure (TEE) of two zoo-housed Matschie's tree kangaroos (body mass = 9.0-9.7 kg) on a diet composed largely of leafy browse; 2) quantify food and macronutrient intake, apparent dry matter macronutrient digestibility, and metabolizable energy (ME) intake over a 14-month period; and 3) test for seasonal changes in ME intake due to seasonal differences in the varieties of leafy browse offered. Using the doubly labeled water method, we determined TEE for the female (288 kcal day -1) and male (411 kcal day -1). Resulting mean TEE was well below the expected value for marsupials and macropods (i.e., ~60% of the expected value based on body mass). The mean calculated ME intakes for the female and male were 307 kcal day-1 and 454 kcal day-1, respectively. There were significant seasonal differences in ME intakes, driven by reduced intake in the autumn. These results demonstrate that Matschie's tree kangaroos can be maintained at healthy body weights and conditions on fiber-rich and browse-heavy diets. Our findings contribute important insights into tree kangaroo energetics and physiology and can be applied to help reformulate the diet of Matschie's tree kangaroos at captive facilities to improve population health and sustainability."

https://openalex.org/W4283465282,"In human cells, ATP is generated using oxidative phosphorylation machinery, which is inoperable without proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The DNA polymerase gamma (Polγ) repairs and replicates the multicopy mtDNA genome in concert with additional factors. The Polγ catalytic subunit is encoded by the POLG gene, and mutations in this gene cause mtDNA genome instability and disease. Barriers to studying the molecular effects of disease mutations include scarcity of patient samples and a lack of available mutant models; therefore, we developed a human SJCRH30 myoblast cell line model with the most common autosomal dominant POLG mutation, c.2864A>G/p.Y955C, as individuals with this mutation can present with progressive skeletal muscle weakness. Using on-target sequencing, we detected a 50% conversion frequency of the mutation, confirming heterozygous Y955C substitution. We found mutated cells grew slowly in a glucose-containing medium and had reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics compared with the parental cell line. Furthermore, growing Y955C cells in a galactose-containing medium to obligate mitochondrial function enhanced these bioenergetic deficits. Also, we show complex I NDUFB8 and ND3 protein levels were decreased in the mutant cell line, and the maintenance of mtDNA was severely impaired (i.e., lower copy number, fewer nucleoids, and an accumulation of Y955C-specific replication intermediates). Finally, we show the mutant cells have increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial toxicant 2'-3'-dideoxycytidine. We expect this POLG Y955C cell line to be a robust system to identify new mitochondrial toxicants and therapeutics to treat mitochondrial dysfunction."

The PtdIns repertoire on lysosomes is tightly regulated by the actions of diverse PtdIns kinases and phosphatases; however, specific roles for PtdIns in lysosomal functions and dynamics are currently unclear and require further investigation. It was previously shown that PIKfyve, a lipid kinase that synthesizes PtdIns(3,5)P2 from PtdIns(3)P, controls lysosome “fusion-fission” cycle dynamics, autophagosome turnover, and endocytic cargo delivery. Furthermore, INPP4B, a PtdIns 4-phosphatase that hydrolyzes PtdIns(3,4)P2 to form PtdIns(3)P, is emerging as a cancer-associated protein with roles in lysosomal biogenesis and other lysosomal functions.

Through confocal fluorescence imaging, we observed the formation of massively enlarged lysosomes, accompanied by exacerbated reduction of endocytic trafficking, disrupted lysosome fusion-fission dynamics, and inhibition of autophagy. Finally, HPLC scintillation quantification of 3H-myo-inositol labeled PtdIns and PtdIns immunofluorescence staining, we observed that lysosomal PtdIns(3)P levels were significantly elevated in Inpp4b-deficient cells due to the hyperactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit VPS34 enzymatic activity.

PtdIns(3,5)P2 depletion and lysosome enlargement in various cell lines can be effectively induced by the pharmacological PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod (16Saffi G.T. Tang E. Mamand S. Inpanathan S.

Emerging evidence suggests that other PtdIns including PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(3,4)P2 may also play important roles in regulating lysosomal homeostasis. For instance, PtdIns(3)P has been implicated in regulating lysosomal positioning and lysosomal mTORC1 activity (22Hong Z. Pedersen N.M. Wang L. Torgersen M.L. Stenmark H. Raiborg C.

VPS34, a class III PtdIns 3-kinase, is recruited by active GTP-bound Rab5 and Rab7 in complex with VPS15, toward early and late endosomes. VPS34-induced PtdIns(3)P generation regulates early and late endosomal morphology (23Law F. Seo J.H. Wang Z. DeLeon J.L. Bolis Y.

PtdIns(4)P has demonstrated important functions in lysosomal membrane fusion in late endocytic trafficking (26Jeschke A. Haas A. Sequential actions of phosphatidylinositol phosphates regulate phagosome-lysosome fusion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29: 452-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4)P2 was also demonstrated to promote repression of mTORC1 activity and cell growth through functions on lysosomal membranes (27Marat A.L. Wallroth A. Lo W.-T. Müller R. Norata G.D.

Overall, roles for PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3)P in lysosomal function and dynamics are currently unclear and require further investigation. To better understand a role for INPP4B in lysosome homeostasis, we investigated the consequences of PIKfyve inhibition in Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Surprisingly, PIKfyve inhibition with apilimod in Inpp4b−/− fibroblasts leads to the formation of very massively enlarged lysosomes, compared to the typically enlarged lysosomes produced in Inpp4b+/+ fibroblasts. Our results suggest that exacerbated lysosomal enlargement was, at least in part, a result of aberrantly elevated levels of lysosomal PtdIns(3)P generated by increased activity of the Class III PtdIns 3-kinase VPS34 in Inpp4b−/− cells. Together, these point to a novel role for Inpp4b in suppressing VPS34 activity and the existence of coordinated functions for Inpp4b, PIKfyve, and VPS34 in maintaining normal lysosomal homeostasis, dynamics, and function. Treatment of Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF with the specific PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod generated the formation of enlarged cellular vacuoles at 48 h of apilimod treatment in Inpp4b+/+ MEF by light microscopy; strikingly, Inpp4b−/− MEF demonstrated an exacerbated vacuolation phenotype with many more massively enlarged vacuoles (Fig. 1A). Ectopic expression of the lysosomal specific membrane protein (LAMP1) tagged to mCherry (LAMP1-mCherry) followed by fluorescence microscopy revealed that nearly all the enlarged vacuoles in Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF were membrane positive for LAMP1 indicating a lysosomal origin for enlarged vacuoles (Figs. 1B and S1A). Quantitation of LAMP1 immunofluorescence (IF) confirmed that enlarged vacuoles were average significantly larger and significantly more abundant in apilimod-treated Inpp4b−/− MEFs than in Inpp4b+/+ MEF (Fig. 1, C–E). Total LAMP1 staining demonstrated that vehicle-treated Inpp4b−/− MEF had less lysosomal content compared to Inpp4b+/+ MEF (Fig. 1F). Apilimod treatment significantly increased total LAMP1 staining in both Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF in a proportional manner, indicating that induction of lysosomal content was not compromised in Inpp4b−/− MEF (Fig. 1, F, S1, E and F). These findings were corroborated with Lysotracker Red (LTR; Fig. S1, D–F) and ectopic expression of a LAMP1-mCherry in Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF (Fig. S1, A–C). To confirm that the aberrant vacuolation response upon apilimod treatment was indeed a result of Inpp4b deficiency, we transduced Inpp4b−/− MEF with constructs that express Inpp4b-EGFP, catalytically dead Inpp4bC845A-EGFP, and control EGFP and treated with apilimod or vehicle and measured vacuole size and number (Fig. S1, G–I). Inpp4b-EGFP expression in Inpp4b−/− MEF generated significantly reduced numbers and average size of enlarged vacuoles upon apilimod treatment compared to nontransduced and EGFP negative controls (Fig. S1, G–I). Notably, transduction of Inpp4bC845A-EGFP in Inpp4b−/− MEF was unable to rescue the number and size of enlarged vacuoles upon apilimod treatment (Fig. S1, G–I). Exacerbated lysosomal enlargement observed with INPP4B deficiency was also generalizable to human cells, as determined in U2OS cells upon INPP4B knockdown with RNAi (Fig. S2, A–E). We also evaluated the effect of Inpp4b suppression on late endosomes. Inpp4b−/− MEF displayed reduced CD63+ late endosome puncta number (Fig. S3). Notably, apilimod treatment did not alter CD63+ late endosome levels, indicating that late endosomes do not reflect the changes observed in lysosomal levels. This suggests that CD63+ late endosomes are not affected by apilimod, and that PIKfyve inhibition may selectively disrupt lysosomal homeostasis and dynamics (Fig. S3). Overall, apilimod treatment in Inpp4b−/− MEF demonstrate an exacerbated lysosomal vacuolation phenotype compared to Inpp4b+/+ MEF that can be rescued by WT Inpp4b, but not a catalytically dead Inpp4b. These data suggest an important role for Inpp4b phosphatase function in maintaining lysosomal dynamics and homeostasis. We attempted to measure lysosome dynamics using Lucifer yellow (LY), a membrane impermeable fluorescent dye that is internalized by endocytosis and accumulates within lysosomes. LY fluorescence provides an effective tool to specifically delineate lysosomes for accurate measurement of lysosome number and volume (30Baluska F. Samaj J. Hlavacka A. Kendrick-Jones J. Volkmann D.

Ackroyd P.C. Christensen K.A. Lucifer Yellow as a live cell fluorescent probe for imaging water transport in subcellular organelles.Appl. Spectrosc. 2011; 65: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). MEF were treated with vehicle or apilimod prior to LY pulses of 1, 2, and 4 h. Flow cytometry was used to measure LY uptake which demonstrated that apilimod elevated total intracellular LY-fluorescence similarly in both Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF for up to 4 h (Fig. S4). To monitor specific LY trafficking to lysosomes, we labeled lysosomes with ectopic expression of LAMP1-mCherry and measured colocalization with LY (Fig. S5A). Apilimod treatment demonstrated a markedly reduced accumulation of LY to lysosomes in Inpp4b+/+ MEF. Comparatively, Inpp4b−/− MEF has significantly less LY accumulation at lysosomes compared to Inpp4b+/+ MEF for up to 2 h, indicating a slower colocalization of LY with lysosomes with Inpp4b deficiency (Fig. S5, A and B). We performed the same assay but replaced LY with DQ-BSA, bovine serum albumin labeled with a self-quenched BODIPY TR-X dye that upon lysosomal delivery is cleaved by lysosomal hydrolases, resulting in bright green fluorescent signal (32Marwaha R. Sharma M. DQ-red BSA trafficking assay in cultured cells to assess cargo delivery to lysosomes.Bio Protoc. 2017; 7e2571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gray M.A. Choy C.H. Dayam R.M.

Biol. 2016; 26: 1955-1964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We observed that DQ-BSA activation was delayed but not inhibited in apilimod-treated Inpp4b−/− MEF (Fig. S5C), suggesting that degradation of lysosomal cargo was not compromised. These findings indicate that PIKfyve inhibition reduces the ability of endocytosed cargo to reach terminal lysosomes, with no major effects on lysosomal proteolysis. Interestingly, like the vacuolation phenotype, apilimod-mediated accumulation was exacerbated in Inpp4b−/− MEF, further indicating a role for Inpp4b in lysosomal trafficking (11Bissig C. Hurbain I.

Given that apilimod blocks lysosomal accumulation of endocytic cargo such as LY, we adjusted our treatment conditions so that MEF were first pulsed with LY followed by acute treatment with apilimod (Fig. 2A). In these experiments, quantitation of LY-labeled lysosomes revealed that individual basal lysosome size was similar in Inpp4b+/+ or Inpp4b−/− MEF. Apilimod induced significant lysosomal enlargement compared to vehicle, and lysosome enlargement in Inpp4b−/− MEF was significantly larger than Inpp4b+/+ MEF (Fig. 2, A and B). Inpp4b−/− MEF have fewer total lysosomes than Inpp4b+/+ MEF; and apilimod treatment reduced lysosome numbers in both Inpp4b+/+ or Inpp4b−/− MEF (Fig. 2, A and C). Notably, total lysosomal content as measured by total cellular LY accumulation was significantly lower in Inpp4b−/− MEF and remained unchanged upon apilimod treatment (Fig. 2, A and D). These data conform to a model whereby apilimod treatment promotes lysosomal coalescence, which is manifested as increased individual lysosome volume and reduced total lysosome numbers (16Saffi G.T.

Notably, Inpp4b deficiency exacerbates apilimod-induced lysosomal enlargement, thus providing further evidence of a role for Inpp4b in lysosomal homeostasis and dynamics which is revealed upon apilimod treatment. Inhibition of lysosomal fission has been proposed as an explanation for apilimod-induced lysosome enlargement (16Saffi G.T. Tang E. Mamand S. Inpanathan S. Fountain A. Salmena L. et al.Reactive oxygen species prevent lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition.PLoS One. 2021; 16e0259313Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 17Choy C.H. Saffi G. Gray M.A. Wallace C.

To investigate the specific consequence of Inpp4b deficiency on “kiss-and-run” and/or “fusion-and-fission” cycles, live-imaging of LY-labeled lysosomes was recorded. Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF treated with either vehicle or apilimod were monitored for up to 15 min and lysosomal fission events were recorded. Despite presenting similar fission rates in vehicle-treated Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF, apilimod significantly reduced lysosome fission rates in Inpp4b+/+ MEF, and remarkably fission was nearly abrogated in Inpp4b−/− MEF (Fig. 3, A and B and Movies S1–S4). This suggests that the enhanced lysosomal coalescence observed in Inpp4b−/− MEF upon apilimod treatment is due to an exacerbated inhibition of lysosomal fission and Inpp4b deficiency alters lysosome dynamics such that they are sensitized to the lysosomal fission-inhibiting effects of apilimod. To shed light on the exacerbated vacuolation phenotypes observed with Inpp4b deficiency, we assessed the effects of apilimod treatment on lysosomal biogenesis in Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF. Firstly, evaluation of nuclear translocation of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) (36Sardiello M. Palmieri M. di Ronza A. Medina D.L. Valenza M. Gennarino V.A. et al.A gene network regulating lysosomal biogenesis and function.Science. 2009; 325: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar), a key regulator of lysosomal gene transcription that undergoes nuclear translocation upon apilimod treatment, did not reveal any difference between Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, transcript levels of representative lysosomal genes including LAMP1, MCOLN1, CTSB, CTSD, ATP6V1D, and ATP6V1H were measured by TaqMan qPCR after vehicle or apilimod treatment. In vehicle-treated cells, Inpp4b−/− MEF demonstrated modest, but significantly reduced expression of all lysosomal genes, except for CTSD (Fig. 4C). Strikingly, apilimod treatment led to a ∼3-fold increase of all lysosomal transcripts tested in Inpp4b−/− MEF, whereas Inpp4b+/+ MEF showed no significant changes under the same conditions (Fig. 4C). Immunoblotting of representative lysosomal proteins demonstrated that Inpp4b−/− MEF have reduced steady state expression of LAMP1, pre- and mature-cathepsin B, and V-ATPase V1H, similar to transcript expression profiles (Fig. 4, D and E). However, apilimod treatment of Inpp4b+/+ MEF demonstrated elevated levels of the lysosomal membrane-bound LAMP1 and V-ATPase V1H proteins, but no significant change in cathepsin proteins. By contrast, apilimod treatment demonstrated significantly elevated expression of all lysosomal proteins tested in Inpp4b−/− MEF (Fig. 4, D and E). To quantify the differential effects of apilimod on lysosomal proteolytic function, we used the membrane permeable cathepsin B substrate-Magic Red which upon hydrolysis forms membrane impermeable fluorescent cresyl-violet and accumulates within functional lysosomes (37Bright N.A. Davis L.J. Luzio J.P. Endolysosomes are the principal intracellular sites of acid hydrolase activity.Curr. Biol. 2016; 26: 2233-2245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of this assay paralleled the transcript and protein expression levels of cathepsin B, where apilimod treatment had no effect in Inpp4b+/+ MEF, and in Inpp4b−/− MEF, despite having a reduced steady state cathepsin B activity, apilimod treatment led to a more than 3-fold induction of cathepsin B activity (Fig. 4, F and G). Although activation of nuclear translocation of TFEB by apilimod was no different in Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF, lysosomal gene expression, protein expression, and proteolytic function of lysosomes are differentially impacted by apilimod treatment in Inpp4b+/+ and Inpp4b−/− MEF. PIKfyve inhibition has been demonstrated to inhibit autophagy in various physiological and pathological settings upon extended PIKfyve inhibition, but not upon acute exposure (12Sharma G.

In this case-control study we aim to identify risk markers for acute and chronic aortic syndromes of the ascending aorta (ACAS-AA). Furthermore, to develop a predictive model for ACAS-AA.We collected data of 188 cases of ACAS-AA and 376 controls standardized to age- and sex of the background population. Medical history and CT-derived aortic morphology were collected. For the dependent outcome ACAS-AA, potential independent risk factors were identified by univariate logistic regression and confirmed in multivariate logistic regression. As post-dissection tubular ascending aortic diameter is prone to expand, this factor was not included in the first model. The individual calculated adjusted odds ratios were then used in ROC-curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the model. To test the influence of post-ACAS-AA tubular ascending aortic diameter, this was added to the model.The following risk factors were identified as independent risk factors for ACAS-AA in multivariate analysis: bicuspid aortic valve (OR 20.41, p = 0.03), renal insufficiency (OR 2.9, p<0.01), infrarenal abdominal aortic diameter (OR 1.08, p<0.01), left common carotid artery diameter (OR 1.40, p<0.01) and aortic width (OR 1.07, p<0.01). Area under the curve was 0.88 (p<0.01). Adding post-ACAS-AA tubular ascending aortic diameter to the model, negated the association of bicuspid aortic valve, renal insufficiency, and left common carotid artery diameter. Area under the curve changed to 0.98 (p<0.01).A high performing predictive model for ACAS-AA, free of ascending aortic diameter, can be achieved. Furthermore, we have identified abdominal aortic ectasia as an independent risk factor of ACAS-AA. Integration of potential biomarkers and morphologic variables, derived from undissected aortas, would probably improve the model."

As obligate beach spawners, surf smelt embryos are exposed to wide-ranging marine and terrestrial environmental conditions. Despite this fact, very few studies have assessed surf smelt tolerance to climate stressors. The purpose of this study was to examine the interactive effects of climate co-stressors ocean warming and acidification on the energy demands of embryonic and larval surf smelt. Surf smelt embryos and larvae were collected from spawning beaches and placed into treatment basins under three temperature treatments (13°C, 15°C, and 18°C) and two pCO2 treatments (i.e. ocean acidification) of approximately 900 and 1900 μatm. Increased temperature significantly decreased yolk size in surf smelt embryos and larvae. Embryo yolk sacs in high temperature treatments were on average 7.3% smaller than embryo yolk sacs from ambient temperature water. Larval yolk and oil globules mirrored this trend. Larval yolk sacs in the high temperature treatment were 45.8% smaller and oil globules 31.9% smaller compared to larvae in ambient temperature. There was also a significant positive effect of acidification on embryo yolk size, indicating embryos used less maternally-provisioned energy under acidification scenarios. There was no significant effect of either temperature or acidification on embryo heartrates. These results indicate that near-future climate change scenarios may impact the energy demands of developing surf smelt, leading to potential effects on surf smelt fitness and contributing to variability in adult recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W4283640159,"Understanding the evolution of fatty liver metabolism of ducks is a recurrent issue for researchers and industry. Indeed, the increase in weight during the overfeeding period leads to an important change in the liver metabolism. However, liver weight is highly variable at the end of overfeeding within a batch of animals reared, force-fed and slaughtered in the same way. For this study, we performed a proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) analysis on two classes of fatty liver samples, called low-weight liver (weights between 550 and 599 g) and high-weight liver (weights above 700 g). The aim of this study was to identify the differences in metabolism between two classes of liver weight (low and high). Firstly, the results suggested that increased liver weight is associated with higher glucose uptake leading to greater lipid synthesis. Secondly, this increase is probably also due to a decline in the level of export of triglycerides from the liver by maintaining them at high hepatic concentration levels, but also of hepatic cholesterol. Finally, the increase in liver weight could lead to a significant decrease in the efficiency of aerobic energy metabolism associated with a significant increase in the level of oxidative stress. However, all these hypotheses will have to be confirmed in the future, by studies on plasma levels and specific assays to validate these results."

When offered in primary care, screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment (SBIRT), and medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) can effectively address UAU. However, these interventions are not yet routine in primary care clinics. Therefore, our study evaluates tailored implementation support to increase SBIRT and MAUD in primary care.ANTECEDENT is a pragmatic implementation study designed to support 150 primary care clinics in Oregon adopting and optimizing SBIRT and MAUD workflows to address UAU. The study is a partnership between the Oregon Health Authority Transformation Center-state leaders in Medicaid health system transformation-SBIRT Oregon and the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network. We recruited clinics providing primary care in Oregon and prioritized reaching clinics that were small to medium in size (<10 providers). All participating clinics receive foundational support (i.e., a baseline assessment, exit assessment, and access to the online SBIRT Oregon materials) and may opt to receive tailored implementation support delivered by a practice facilitator over 12 months. Tailored implementation support is designed to address identified needs and may include health information technology support, peer-to-peer learning, workflow mapping, or expert consultation via academic detailing. The study aims are to 1) engage, recruit, and conduct needs assessments with 150 primary care clinics and their regional Medicaid health plans called Coordinated Care Organizations within the state of Oregon, 2) implement and evaluate the impact of foundational and supplemental implementation support on clinic change in SBIRT and MAUD, and 3) describe how practice facilitators tailor implementation support based on context and personal expertise. Our convergent parallel mixed-methods analysis uses RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance). It is informed by a hybrid of the i-PARIHS (integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) and the Dynamic Sustainability Framework.This study will explore how primary care clinics implement SBIRT and MAUD in routine practice and how practice facilitators vary implementation support across diverse clinic settings. Findings will inform how to effectively align implementation support to context, advance our understanding of practice facilitator skill development over time, and ultimately improve detection and treatment of UAU across diverse primary care clinics."

https://openalex.org/W4283652401,"Ring artifact elimination is one of the popular problems in computed tomography (CT). It appears in the reconstructed image in the form of bright or dark patterns of concentric circles. In this paper, based on the compressed sensing theory, we propose a method for eliminating the ring artifact during the image reconstruction. The proposed method is based on representing the projection data by a sum of two components. The first component contains ideal correct values, while the latter contains imperfect error values causing the ring artifact. We propose to minimize some sparsity-induced norms corresponding to the imperfect error components to effectively eliminate the ring artifact. In particular, we investigate the effect of using different sparse models, i.e. different sparsity-induced norms, on the accuracy of the ring artifact correction. The proposed cost function is optimized using an iterative algorithm derived from the alternative direction method of multipliers. Moreover, we propose improved versions of the proposed algorithms by incorporating a smoothing penalty function into the cost function. We also introduce angular constrained forms of the proposed algorithms by considering a special case as follows. The imperfect error values are constant over all the projection angles, as in the case where the source of ring artifact is the non-uniform sensitivity of the detector. Real data and simulation studies were performed to evaluate the proposed algorithms. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms with incorporating smoothing penalty and their angular constrained forms are effective in ring artifact elimination."

Especially the role of dimensions of affect can be easily studied with this paradigm. In the current study, we were interested in the role of the complexity of emotional stimuli (origin). We also aimed at searching for activation-like factors that impair (arousal) or improve (subjective significance) the effectiveness of cognitive control. We have used an orthogonal manipulation of all the above dimensions in words. We expected to find the contrastive effects of arousal and subjective significance on reaction times and Event Related Potential’s amplitudes. On a behavioural level, we observed the reduction of reaction times with increasing subjective significance of stimuli and reflective origin. We also found a correlation between subjective significance and reduction of amplitude polarisation in the N450 component associated with cognitive control execution effort. This experiment shows that subjective significance has an improving role for cognitive control effectiveness, even when valence, arousal and origin levels are controlled. This guides us to conclude that external stimuli may drive not only disruption of control but also its improvement."

https://openalex.org/W4283704521,"Swallowing is a complex process that involves precise coordination among oral and pharyngeal structures, which is essential to smooth transition of bolus and adequate airway protection. Tongue base retraction and hyolaryngeal excursion are two significant swallowing movements, and their related events can be examined using ultrasound imaging, which is physically and radioactively non-invasive. The present study aimed to 1) establish the temporal sequences and timing of swallowing events identified using ultrasound imaging, and 2) investigate the variability of the above temporal sequences and 3) investigate the effect of bolus type on the variability of temporal sequences in non-dysphagic individuals. Forty-one non-dysphagic young adults of both genders (19 males and 22 females) participated in the study. Ultrasound images were acquired mid-saggitally at their submental region during swallowing of boluses with different volume (i.e. 5mL or 10mL) and consistencies (i.e. IDDSI Levels 0 and 4). Timing and sequence of six events 1) displacement onset (TBOn), 2) maximum displacement (TBMax) and 3) displacement offset of tongue base retraction (TBOff); and, 4) displacement onset (HBOn), 5) maximum displacement (HBMax) and 6) displacement offset of the hyoid bone excursion (HBOff) were extracted from the ultrasound images. Out of the 161 swallows, 85.7% follow a general sequence of HBOn < TBOn < HBMax < TBMax < HBOff < TBOff. Percentage adherence to six anticipated paired-event sequences was studied. Results suggested the presence of individual variability as adherence ranged from 75.8% to 98.1% in four of the anticipated sequences, leaving only two sequences (HBOn < TBMax and TBMax < HBOff) obligatory (i.e. 100% adherence). For non-obligatory sequences, it was found that bolus type may have an effect on the level of adherence. Findings of the present study lay the groundwork for future studies on swallowing using ultrasound imaging and also the clinical application of ultrasonography."
