https://openalex.org/W3127910502,"Introduction COVID-19 complications can include neurological, psychiatric, psychological, and psychosocial impairments. Little is known on the consequences of SARS-COV-2 on cognitive functions of patients in the sub-acute phase of the disease. We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on cognitive functions of patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). Material and methods 87 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit from March 27 th to June 20 th 2020 were included. Patients underwent Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Data were divided in 4 groups according to the respiratory assistance in the acute phase: Group1 (orotracheal intubation), Group2 (non-invasive ventilation using Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure), Group3 (Venturi Masks), Group4 (no oxygen therapy). Follow-ups were performed at one month after home-discharge. Results Out of the 87 patients (62 Male, mean age 67.23 ± 12.89 years), 80% had neuropsychological deficits (MoCA and MMSE) and 40% showed mild-to-moderate depression. Group1 had higher scores than Group3 for visuospatial/executive functions (p = 0.016), naming (p = 0.024), short- and long-term memory (p = 0.010, p = 0.005), abstraction (p = 0.024), and orientation (p = 0.034). Group1 was younger than Groups2 and 3. Cognitive impairments correlated with patients’ age. Only 18 patients presented with anosmia. Their data did not differ from the other patients. FIM (&lt;100) did not differ between groups. Patients partly recovered at one-month follow-up and 43% showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusion Patients with severe functional impairments had important cognitive and emotional deficits which might have been influenced by the choice of ventilatory therapy, but mostly appeared to be related to aging, independently of FIM scores. These findings should be integrated for correct neuropsychiatric assistance of COVID-19 patients in the subacute phase of the disease, and show the need for long-term psychological support and treatment of post-COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3127531363,"This study aims to understand tourists’ willingness to pay a price premium for a local green hotel certification, and is one of only a few in the literature for small-island tourism destinations in emerging economies with their unique and pressing sustainability challenges. In a survey of 535 tourists visiting Gili Trawangan, Indonesia, facing numerous waste management and coral reef conservation issues, the willingness to pay extra for sustainable hotel services was elicited. There were five discrete pricing levels across the surveys that ranged from $0.75 USD to $7.50 USD extra per night. We examined the relationship of the respondents’ payment choice to their socio-demographic attributes and attitudes regarding environmental issues such as climate change. The main findings and practical implications of the study are: (1) to demonstrate the broad willingness to pay for sustainable hotel services. Findings indicate at all price levels (between $0.75 USD and $7.50 USD), more than 50% of tourists are willing to pay. (2) To estimate a lower bound mean willingness to pay per night for a local green hotel certificate of $1.55USD and 1.34€ EUR, and (3) To identify individual attributes that influence willingness to pay. Findings indicate environmental knowledge and preferences play a role. These results can be used generally to incorporate evidence-based practices into the development of a green hotel marketing strategy, and to help define the target market for small-scale green hotel certification. Additionally, we propose a finance strategy for funding local and sustainable initiatives that support the hotel industry and the island’s infrastructure through the premiums collected from the ’Gili Green Award’ certificate."

Success rate of treatment currently 56% at global level, 48% in Indonesia and 36% in West Java province, the most populated province and surround Jakarta, the capitol of Indonesia. Objective This study aimed to evaluate factors affecting success of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in patients using longer treatment regimen in West Java Indonesia. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients treated with longer regimen at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017. Potential risk factors associated with the treatment outcome were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Results A total of 492 patients were enrolled during the study period. Fifty percents multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients had successful treatment outcome. Age ≤45 years, male, normal body mass index, no previous tuberculosis treatment, culture conversion ≤2 months, acid fast bacilli sputum smear ≤+1 were independent factors associated with increased treatment success. Sputum culture conversion ≤2 months was the major factor affecting successful outcome (RR 2.79; 95% CI: 1.61–4.84; p-value&lt;0.001). Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, chronic kidney disease, and cavitary lesion were independent risk factors for unfavourable outcome. Conclusion Age, gender, body mass index, tuberculosis treatment history, time of sputum conversion, acid fast bacilli sputum smear, HIV infection, chronic kidney disease, and cavitary lesion can be used as predictors for longer multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment regimen outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3128521231,"Growth modelling is a fundamental component of fisheries assessments but is often hindered by poor quality data from biased sampling. Several methods have attempted to account for sample bias in growth analyses. However, in many cases this bias is not overcome, especially when large individuals are under-sampled. In growth models, two key parameters have a direct biological interpretation: L 0 , which should correspond to length-at-birth and L ∞ , which should approximate the average length of full-grown individuals. Here, we present an approach of fitting Bayesian growth models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with informative priors on these parameters to improve the biological plausibility of growth estimates. A generalised framework is provided in an R package ‘BayesGrowth’, which removes the hurdle of programming an MCMC model for new users. Four case studies representing different sampling scenarios as well as three simulations with different selectivity functions were used to compare this Bayesian framework to standard frequentist growth models. The Bayesian models either outperformed or matched the results of frequentist growth models in all examples, demonstrating the broad benefits offered by this approach. This study highlights the impact that Bayesian models could provide in age and growth studies if applied more routinely rather than being limited to only complex or sophisticated applications."
https://openalex.org/W3128663616,"Wild genetic resources and their ability to adapt to environmental change are critically important in light of the projected climate change, while constituting the foundation of agricultural sustainability. To address the expected negative effects of climate change on Robusta coffee trees ( Coffea canephora ), collecting missions were conducted to explore its current native distribution in Uganda over a broad climatic range. Wild material from seven forests could thus be collected. We used 19 microsatellite (SSR) markers to assess genetic diversity and structure of this material as well as material from two ex-situ collections and a feral population. The Ugandan C . canephora diversity was then positioned relative to the species’ global diversity structure. Twenty-two climatic variables were used to explore variations in climatic zones across the sampled forests. Overall, Uganda’s native C . canephora diversity differs from other known genetic groups of this species. In northwestern (NW) Uganda, four distinct genetic clusters were distinguished being from Zoka, Budongo, Itwara and Kibale forests A large southern-central (SC) cluster included Malabigambo, Mabira, and Kalangala forest accessions, as well as feral and cultivated accessions, suggesting similarity in genetic origin and strong gene flow between wild and cultivated compartments. We also confirmed the introduction of Congolese varieties into the SC region where most Robusta coffee production takes place. Identified populations occurred in divergent environmental conditions and 12 environmental variables significantly explained 16.3% of the total allelic variation across populations. The substantial genetic variation within and between Ugandan populations with different climatic envelopes might contain adaptive diversity to cope with climate change. The accessions that we collected have substantially enriched the diversity hosted in the Ugandan collections and thus contribute to ex situ conservation of this vital genetic resource. However, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to enhance complementary in-situ conservation of Coffea canephora in native forests in northwestern Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W3126662709,"Background Extracorporeal cytokine adsorption is an option in septic shock as an additional measure to treat a pathological immune response. Purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption on hemodynamic parameters in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and septic shock after cardiac surgery. Methods In this retrospective study, a total of 98 patients were evaluated. Hemoadsorption was performed by the CytoSorb® adsorber. In all patients cytokine adsorption was applied for at least 15 hours and at least one adsorber was used per patient. To compare cumulative inotrope need in order to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mmHg, we applied vasoactive score (VAS) for each patient before and after cytokine adsorption. A paired t-test has been performed to determine statistical significance. Results Before cytokine adsorption the mean VAS was 56.7 points. This was statistically significant decreased after cytokine adsorption (27.7 points, p&lt; 0.0001). Before cytokine adsorption, the mean noradrenalin dose to reach a MAP of ≥ 65 mmHg was 0.49 μg/kg bw/min, the mean adrenalin dose was 0.12 μg/kg bw/min. After cytokine adsorption, significantly reduced catecholamine doses were necessary to maintain a MAP of ≥ 65 mmHg (0.24 μg/kg bw/min noradrenalin; p&lt; 0.0001 and 0.07 μg/kg bw/min adrenalin; p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, there was a significant reduction of serum lactate levels after treatment (p&lt; 0.0001). The mean SOFA-score for these patients with septic shock and AKI before cytokine adsorption was 16.7 points, the mean APACHE II-score was 30.2 points. The mean predicted in-hospital mortality rate based on this SOFA-score of 16.7 points was 77,0%, respectively 73,0% on APACHE II-score, while the all-cause in-hospital mortality rate of the patients in this study was 59.2%. Conclusion In patients with septic shock and AKI undergoing cardiac surgery, extracorporeal cytokine adsorption could significantly lower the need for postoperative inotropes. Additionally, observed versus SOFA- and APACHE II-score predicted in-hospital mortality rate was decreased."
https://openalex.org/W3128414155,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) help replenish fish assemblages, though different trophic levels may show diverse recovery patterns. Long-term protection is required to achieve total recovery but poaching events may prevent the achievement of full carrying capacity. Here, we have analysed the effect of long-term protection on the entire reef fish community and the different trophic levels in the Cabo de Palos-Islas Hormigas MPA (SE Spain; SW Mediterranean Sea) in order to assess their recovery patterns after 23 years of protection. We compared the values for carrying capacity obtained with the maximum values achieved at regional scale, and we assessed the effect of a reduction in the surveillance over a few years, during which poaching events increased, on the recovery patterns. We found that, overall, biomass of fishes increased with time while density diminished. In particular, piscivorous and macro-invertivore fish increased while the other trophic groups remained constant or declined, suggesting top-down processes. For the entire study period, those trophic groups were approaching carrying capacity; however, when accounting only for the period in which enforcement was high and constant, they grew exponentially, indicating that full carrying capacity may have not been achieved yet. When compared to other Mediterranean MPAs, the Cabo de Palos-Islas Hormigas MPA showed values for biomass that were disproportionately higher, suggesting that local factors, such as habitat structure and associated oceanographic processes, may be responsible for the dynamics found. Our results help to understand the potential trajectories of fish assemblages over a consolidated MPA and highlight empirically how the reduction of surveillance in a period may change the recovery patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3126497800,"Background Data on microcirculatory pattern of COVID-19 critically ill patients are scarce. The objective was to compare sublingual microcirculation parameters of critically ill patients according to the severity of the disease. Methods The study is a single-center prospective study with critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU. Sublingual microcirculation was assessed by IDF microscopy within 48 hours of ICU admission. Microcirculatory flow index (MFI), proportion of perfused vessel (PPV), total vessel density (TVD), De Backer score (DBS), perfused vessel density (PVD) and heterogeneity index (HI) were assessed. Patients were divided in 2 groups (severe and critical) according to the World health organization definition. Findings From 19 th of March to 7 th of April 2020, 43 patients were included. Fourteen patients (33%) were in the severe group and twenty-nine patients (67%) in the critical group. Patients in the critical group were all mechanically ventilated. The critical group had significantly higher values of MFI, DBS and PVD in comparison to severe group (respectively, PaCO 2 : 49 [44–45] vs 36 [33–37] mmHg; p&lt;0,0001, MFI: 2.8 ± 0.2 vs 2.5 ± 0.3; p = 0.001, DBS: 12.7 ± 2.6 vs 10.8 ± 2.0 vessels mm -2 ; p = 0.033, PVD: 12.5 ± 3.0 vs 10.1 ± 2.4 mm.mm -2 ; p = 0.020). PPV, HI and TVD were similar between groups Correlation was found between microcirculatory parameters and PaCO 2 levels. Conclusion Critical COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation seem to have higher red blood cell velocity than severe non-ventilated patients."
https://openalex.org/W3127385278,"Background Vaccination is a proven tool in preventing and eradicating childhood infectious diseases. Each year, vaccination averts an estimated 2–3 million deaths from vaccine preventable diseases. Even though immunization coverage is increasing globally, many children in developing countries still dropout vaccination. The objective of this study was to identify determinants of vaccination dropout among children age 12–23 months in North Gondar, North west Ethiopia. Methods Community based unmatched case-control study was conducted in north Gondar from March 1–27, 2019 among 366 children age 12–23 months (92 cases and 274 controls). Multistage sampling was used for reaching to the community. Data were collected from mothers who had 12–23 months age children using a pretested structured face to face interview. Data were entered using Epi info v. 7 and exported to SPSS v. 20 for analysis. On multivariable logistic regression variables with P-value &lt;0.05 at 95% CI were considered statistically significant. Result Counseling for mothers about vaccination (AOR = 7.2, 95% CI: (2.93–17.5)); fear of vaccine side effects (AOR = 3.5, 95% CI: (1.56–8.12)); PNC attended (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI: (1.52–8.39)) and mothers not received tetanus toxoid vaccination (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: (1.03–5.35)) were found risk factors of vaccination dropout. Conclusion Counseling on vaccination, fear of vaccine side effects, PNC attended and mothers’ tetanus toxoid vaccination status during ANC visit were found risk factors. Management bodies and health workers need to consider “reaching every community” approach, Counsel every mother at any opportunity, and provide TT vaccination for all pregnant mothers helps to reduce vaccination dropout among children."
https://openalex.org/W3127781135,"With the rapid global urbanization, the unlimited increasing transportation infrastructure has met the needs of urban expansion, but it has caused a series of ecological problems lacking consideration of ecological conservation. The land suitability assessment for supporting transport planning based on carrying capacity and demand for construction is an effective way to promote urban socioeconomic development and ecological conservation. Therefore, we constructed a logical framework of resources and environment supporting, traffic construction demand driving, and ecological protection red line and basic farmland constraining, and applied the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), GIS, three-dimensional magic cube method, and gravity model to evaluate the suitability of expressway development in Sichuan Province, China. The results showed that the spatial difference in the carrying capacity of resources and environment and the demand for expressway construction was relatively high in Sichuan, and those in eastern cities were even higher. The land suitability for supporting transport planning was relatively high, and the suitable areas with a grade from 8 to 10, accounted for 20.77% of the total study area, which could almost meet the demand for transportation infrastructure construction. The land suitability performed a circle structure with Chengdu as the core and gradually decreasing to the periphery. Overall, this study adds new insights to transport planning reform in other similar regions around the world and can provide important references for regional development planning and environmental protection."
https://openalex.org/W3128394938,"Several Greenland seaweed species have potential as foods or food ingredients, both for local consumption and export. However, knowledge regarding their content of beneficial and deleterious elements on a species specific and geographical basis is lacking. This study investigated the content of 17 elements (As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, I, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Se and Zn) in 77 samples of ten species ( Agarum clathratum , Alaria esculenta , Ascophyllum nodosum , Fucus distichus , Fucus vesiculosus , Hedophyllum nigripes , Laminaria solidungula , Palmaria palmata , Saccharina latissima and Saccharina longicruris ). Element profiles differed between species but showed similar patterns within the same family. For five species, different thallus parts were investigated separately, and showed different element profiles. A geographic origin comparison of Fucus species indicated regional differences. The seaweeds investigated were especially good sources of macrominerals (K &gt; Na &gt; Ca &gt; Mg) and trace minerals, such as Fe. Iodine contents were high, especially in macroalgae of the family Laminariaceae. None of the samples exceeded the EU maximum levels for Cd, Hg or Pb, but some exceeded the stricter French regulations, especially for Cd and I. In conclusion, these ten species are promising food items."
https://openalex.org/W3128477556,"COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on clinical care and lifestyles globally. The State of Michigan reports over 80,000 positive COVID-19 tests between March 1, 2020 and July 29, 2020. We surveyed 8,041 Michigan Medicine biorepository participants in late June 2020. We found that 55% of COVID-19 cases reported no known exposure to family members or to someone outside the house diagnosed with COVID-19. A significantly higher rate of COVID-19 cases were employed as essential workers (45% vs 19%, p = 9x10 -12 ). COVID-19 cases reporting a fever were more likely to require hospitalization (categorized as severe; OR = 4.4 [95% CI: 1.6–12.5, p = 0.005]) whereas respondents reporting rhinorrhea was less likely to require hospitalization (categorized as mild-to-moderate; OR = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.04–0.73, p = 0.018]). African-Americans reported higher rates of being diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR = 4.0 [95% CI: 2.2–7.2, p = 5x10 -6 ]), as well as higher rates of exposure to family or someone outside the household diagnosed with COVID-19, an annual household income &lt; $40,000, living in rental housing, and chronic diseases. During the Executive Order in Michigan, African Americans, women, and the lowest income group reported worsening health behaviors and higher overall concern for the potential detrimental effects of the pandemic. The higher risk of contracting COVID-19 observed among African Americans may be due to the increased rates of working as essential employees, lower socioeconomic status, and exposure to known positive cases. Continued efforts should focus on COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies, as well as address the inequality gaps that result in higher risks for both short-term and long-term health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3128378077,"Background Exclusive breastfeeding promotes beneficial modifications on the microbiota of cesarean born infants, but little is known about the role of specific breast milk components in this modulation. Women with an active FUT2 gene (called secretors ) secrete α1–2 fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which promote Bifidobacterium in the infant’s gut and may modulate the microbiota of cesarean born infants. Objective To compare the microbiota composition of cesarean and vaginally born infants breastfed by secretor mothers. Methods Maternal secretor status was determined by the occurrence of 4 different α1–2 fucosylated HMOs in breast milk by LC-MS. The fecal microbiota composition from cesarean and vaginally born infants was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, stratified by the maternal secretor status, and compared. Results Alpha and beta diversity were not significantly different in cesarean born, secretor-fed infants (CSe+) compared to vaginally born, secretor-fed infants (VSe+). There were no significant differences in the fecal relative abundance of Bifidobacterium between CSe+ and VSe+ infants, but the prevalence of the species B . longum was lower in CSe+. The fecal relative abundance of Bacteroides was also lower, while Akkermansia and Kluyvera were higher in CSe+ infants. Conclusion Cesarean and vaginally born infants fed with breast milk containing the α1–2 fucosylated HMOs fraction present similar amounts of Bifidobacterium in the feces, but differences are observed in other members of the microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3126985252,"A major bottleneck in the study of human liver physiology is the provision of stable liver tissue in sufficient quantity. As a result, current approaches to modelling human drug efficacy and toxicity rely heavily on immortalized human and animal cell lines. These models are informative but do possess significant drawbacks. To address the issues presented by those models, researchers have turned to pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). PSCs can be generated from defined genetic backgrounds, are scalable, and capable of differentiation to all the cell types found in the human body, representing an attractive source of somatic cells for in vitro and in vivo endeavours. Although unlimited numbers of somatic cell types can be generated in vitro , their maturation still remains problematic. In order to develop high fidelity PSC-derived liver tissue, it is necessary to better understand the cell microenvironment in vitro including key elements of liver physiology. In vivo a major driver of zonated liver function is the oxygen gradient that exists from periportal to pericentral regions. In this paper, we demonstrate how cell culture conditions for PSC-derived liver sphere systems can be optimised to recapitulate physiologically relevant oxygen gradients by using mathematical modelling. The mathematical model incorporates some often-understated features and mechanisms of traditional spheroid systems such as cell-specific oxygen uptake, media volume, spheroid size, and well dimensions that can lead to a spatially heterogeneous distribution of oxygen. This mathematical modelling approach allows for the calibration and identification of culture conditions required to generate physiologically realistic function within the microtissue through recapitulation of the in vivo microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W3127145109,"Hepatitis A, an acute type of hepatitis caused by the hepatitis A virus, occurs worldwide. Following the 2009 hepatitis A epidemic in South Korea, patient outbreak reports were collectively converted to an “all-patient report” in 2011, and national immunization programs were introduced for children in 2015. In this study, we aimed to analyze the changes and characteristics of hepatitis A antibody titers in South Korea following the epidemic. The results of hepatitis A antibody tests performed at clinical laboratories from 2009 to 2019 were analyzed based on year, age, region, sex, and medical institution. The average 2009–2018 positive anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin G rate was 51.8%, but it increased (56.06%) in 2019. Significantly different antibody-positive rates were observed based on age: &lt;10 years, 54.5%; 20–29 years, 19.5%; ≥50 years, almost 100%. The positive rate of individuals in their teens and 20s gradually increased, whereas that of those in their 30s and 40s gradually decreased. Males had higher antibody-positive rates than females, and samples from higher-level general hospitals exhibited higher antibody rates. The positive anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M rates gradually decreased after 2009 and were &lt;1% after 2012. However, a high positive rate of 3.69% was observed in 2019 when there was an epidemic. Anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin G-positive rates were similar throughout the year, but the anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M-positive rates increased from January, peaked in April, and decreased from July, exhibiting distinct seasonality. This is considered to be related to groundwater pollution during the spring drought season. The introduction of the “all-patient report” and national vaccination program for children has had an effective influence on hepatitis A management. However, for hepatitis A prevention, policy considerations for high-risk age groups with low antibody-positive rates will be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3128985361,"Circadian rhythms are entrained by light and influenced by non-photic stimuli, such as feeding. The activity preceding scheduled mealtimes, food anticipatory activity (FAA), is elicited in rodents fed a limited amount at scheduled times. FAA is thought to be the output of an unidentified food entrained oscillator. Previous studies, using gene deletion and receptor pharmacology, implicated dopamine type receptor 1 (D1R) signaling in the dorsal striatum as necessary for FAA in mice. To further understand the role of D1R in promoting FAA, we utilized the Cre-lox system to create cell type-specific deletions of D1R, conditionally deleting D1R in GABA neurons using Vgat-ires-Cre line. This conditional deletion mutant had attenuated FAA, but the amount was higher than expected based on prior results using a constitutive knockout of D1R, D1R KO Drago . This result prompted us to re-test the original D1R KO Drago line, which expressed less FAA than controls, but only moderately so. To determine if genetic drift had diminished the effect of D1R deletion on FAA, we re-established the D1R KO Drago knockout line from cryopreserved samples. The reestablished D1R KO Drago-cryo had a clear impairment of FAA compared to controls, but still developed increased activity preceding mealtime across the 4 weeks of timed feeding. Finally, we tested a different deletion allele of D1R created by the Knockout Mouse Project. This line of D1R KO KOMP mice had a significant impairment in the acquisition of FAA, but eventually reached similar levels of premeal activity compared to controls after 4 weeks of timed feeding. Taken together, our results suggest that D1R signaling promotes FAA, but other dopamine receptors likely contribute to FAA given that mice lacking the D1 receptor still retain some FAA."
https://openalex.org/W3126439670,"Winter turnip rape (Brassica rapa L.) is an important overwintering oil crop that is widely planted in northwestern China. It considered to be a good genetic resource for cold-tolerant research because its roots can survive harsh winter conditions. Here, we performed comparative transcriptomics analysis of the roots of two winter turnip rape varieties, Longyou7 (L7, strong cold tolerance) and Tianyou2 (T2, low cold tolerance), under normal condition (CK) and cold stress (CT) condition. A total of 8,366 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected between the two L7 root groups (L7CK_VS_L7CT), and 8,106 DEGs were detected for T2CK_VS_T2CT. Among the DEGs, two ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (FAD3), two delta-9 acyl-lipid desaturase 2 (ADS2), one diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), and one 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 2 (KCS2) were differentially expressed in the two varieties and identified to be related to fatty acid synthesis. Four glutamine synthetase cytosolic isozymes (GLN), serine acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), and serine acetyltransferase 3 (SAT3) were down-regulated under cold stress, while S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme 1 (AMD1) had an up-regulation tendency in response to cold stress in the two samples. Moreover, the delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), δ-ornithine aminotransferase (δ-OAT), alanine-glyoxylate transaminase (AGXT), branched-chain-amino-acid transaminase (ilvE), alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and arginine decarboxylase related to amino acid metabolism were identified in two cultivars variously expressed under cold stress. The above DEGs related to amino acid metabolism were suspected to the reason for amino acids content change. The RNA-seq data were validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR of 19 randomly selected genes. The findings of our study provide the gene expression profile between two varieties of winter turnip rape, which lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of the highly complex regulatory mechanisms in plants during cold treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3126548594,"Anopheles stephensi with three different biotypes is a major vector of malaria in Asia. It breeds in a wide range of habitats. Therefore, safer and more sustainable methods are needed to control its immature stages rather than chemical pesticides. The larvicidal and antibacterial properties of the Pelargonium roseum essential oil (PREO) formulations were investigated against mysorensis and intermediate forms of An . stephensi in laboratory conditions. A series of nanoemulsions containing different amounts of PREO, equivalent to the calculated LC 50 values for each An . stephensi form, and various quantities of surfactants and co-surfactants were developed. The physical and morphological properties of the most lethal formulations were also determined. PREO and its major components, i.e. citronellol (21.34%), L-menthone (6.41%), linalool (4.214%), and geraniol (2.19%), showed potent larvicidal activity against the studied mosquitoes. The LC 50/90 values for mysorensis and intermediate forms were computed as 11.44/42.42 ppm and 12.55/47.69 ppm, respectively. The F48/F44 nanoformulations with 94% and 88% lethality for the mysorensis and intermediate forms were designated as optimized formulations. The droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta-potential for F48/F44 were determined as 172.8/90.95 nm, 0.123/0.183, and -1.08/-2.08 mV, respectively. These results were also confirmed by TEM analysis. Prepared formulations displayed antibacterial activity against larval gut bacteria in the following order of decreasing inhibitory: LC 90 , optimized nanoemulsions, and LC 50 . PREO-based formulations were more effective against mysorensis than intermediate. Compared to the crude PREO, the overall larvicidal activity of all nanoformulations boosted by 20% and the optimized formulations by 50%. The sensitivity of insect gut bacteria may be a crucial factor in determining the outcome of the effect of toxins on target insects. The formulations designed in the present study may be a good option as a potent and selective larvicide for An . stephensi ."
https://openalex.org/W3127631143,"The objectives were to describe treatment sequences for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), use of second-line FOLFIRI (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) plus antiangiogenic drug (bevacizumab, ramucirumab, aflibercept beta) therapy, and the factors associated with the duration of antitumor drug treatment from second-line antiangiogenic therapy in Japan. This retrospective observational study was conducted using a Japanese hospital-based administrative database. Patients were enrolled if they started adjuvant therapy (and presumably experienced early recurrence) or first-line treatment for advanced CRC between May 2016 and July 2019, and were analysed until September 2019. Factors associated with overall treatment duration from second-line treatment with FOLFIRI plus antiangiogenic drugs were explored with multivariate Cox regression analysis. The most common first-line treatments were FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin) or CAPOX (capecitabine, oxaliplatin) with bevacizumab (presumed RAS -mutant CRC) and FOLFOX with panitumumab (presumed RAS -wild type CRC). The most common second-line treatments were FOLFIRI-based. Many patients did not transition to subsequent lines of therapy. For second-line treatment, antiangiogenic drugs were prescribed more often for patients with presumed RAS -mutant CRC, right-sided CRC, and independent activities of daily living (ADL). The median duration of second-line FOLFIRI plus antiangiogenic drug treatment was 4.5 months; 66.2% of patients transitioned to third-line therapy. Low body mass index and not fully independent ADL were significantly associated with shorter overall duration of antitumor drug treatment from second-line therapy. Left-sided CRC, presumed RAS- wild type CRC, previous use of oral fluoropyrimidines and use of proteinuria qualitative tests, antihypertensives, or anticholinergics during second-line therapy were significantly associated with longer treatment. Treatment of advanced CRC in Japan is consistent with both international and Japanese guidelines, but transition rates to subsequent therapies need improvement. In addition to antitumor drug treatment, better ADL, higher body mass index, management of hypertension, and proteinuria tests were associated with continuation of sequential therapy that included antiangiogenic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3127818077,"Compared with root-associated habitats, little is known about the role of microbiota inside other rice organs, especially the rhizome of perennial wild rice, and this information may be of importance for agriculture. Oryza longistaminata is perennial wild rice with various agronomically valuable traits, including large biomass on poor soils, high nitrogen use efficiency, and resistance to insect pests and disease. Here, we compared the endophytic bacterial and archaeal communities and network structures of the rhizome to other compartments of O . longistaminata using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Diverse microbiota and significant variation in community structure were identified among different compartments of O . longistaminata . The rhizome microbial community showed low taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity as well as the lowest network complexity among four compartments. Rhizomes exhibited less phylogenetic clustering than roots and leaves, but similar phylogenetic clustering with stems. Streptococcus , Bacillus , and Methylobacteriaceae were the major genera in the rhizome. ASVs belonging to the Enhydrobacter , YS2, and Roseburia are specifically present in the rhizome. The relative abundance of Methylobacteriaceae in the rhizome and stem was significantly higher than that in leaf and root. Noteworthy type II methanotrophs were observed across all compartments, including the dominant Methylobacteriaceae , which potentially benefits the host by facilitating CH 4 -dependent N 2 fixation under nitrogen nutrient-poor conditions. Our data offers a robust knowledge of host and microbiome interactions across various compartments and lends guidelines to the investigation of adaptation mechanisms of O . longistaminata in nutrient-poor environments for biofertilizer development in agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W3126350202,"Discrimination and prejudice against overweight people is common in Western societies. In this article we aim to understand whether these attitudes reverberate into the school setting, by investigating whether teachers grade overweight students more severely than comparable normal weight students. By relying on the Attribution-Value Model of Prejudice (AVMP) and previous studies, we test a series of hypotheses using data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS SC3) on a sample of students enrolled in the 7 th grade (lower secondary education). We used hierarchical ordered logit regression to assess whether overweight and obese students receive systematically lower grades by their teachers in German and mathematics, adjusting for subject-specific competences measured with a standardized test, and a rich set of socio-demographic and socio-psychological students’ characteristics (e.g. the “big five”). Results suggested that overweight and obese students were more severely graded in both subjects. The penalty for overweight students, and especially for obese students, was slightly larger in German and in the lowest part of the grade distribution. There was also indication of heterogeneous penalties by gender, with overweight male students being especially penalized in math. Possible ways to help teachers in assigning grades in a fairer way are discussed at the end."
https://openalex.org/W3126645296,"Objectives To determine if the presence of microorganisms in follicular fluid of women undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) adversely affects the outcome of the treatment cycles. Methods Follicular fluid was collected from 86 women enrolled for IVF-ET at the National Hospital, Abuja from June 1, 2018 to December 1, 2018. Microscopy imaging and cultures were performed to identify bacteria and fungi in the follicular fluid and the vagina. Women with follicular fluid microorganisms were the test group while the controls were those without follicular fluid microorganisms. Fertilization and pregnancy rates were subsequently determined and their association with the presence of follicular fluid microorganisms was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression modelling. Results The mean age and mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of the participants were 35(± 3.5) years and 28(± 4.9) kg/m 2 respectively. Bacteria and fungi were isolated in 17% of the follicular fluid samples collected (n = 15/86). Most common isolates were Streptococcus spp. (n = 4/15), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 7/15), Enterococcus spp. (n = 4/15), Lactobacillus species (n = 2/15) and Candida albicans (n = 2/15). There was no statistically significant difference in the fertilization rates (adjusted odds ratio [AdjOR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04–7.34; P = 0.10) and pregnancy rates (AdjOR 4.02, 95% CI 0.56–28.92; P = 0.19) between the group of women with positive follicular fluid bacterial /fungal colonization as compared against those with negative follicular fluid colonization. Conclusion Isolation of microorganisms from follicular fluid did not adversely affect fertilization and pregnancy rates following IVF-ET treatment cycles at the fertility centre of National Hospital, Abuja."
https://openalex.org/W3127166351,"Acetaminophen ( N -acetyl- p -aminophenol, APAP) overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Although the primary hepatic damage is induced by APAP-derived toxic intermediates resulting from cytochrome P450 metabolism, immune components also play an important role in DILI pathophysiology. Aedes aegypti saliva is a source of bioactive molecules with in vitro anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. However, evidences on the therapeutic use of Ae . aegypti salivary preparations in animal models of relevant clinical conditions are still scarce. Thus, the present study was designed to evaluate the protective role of Ae . aegypti saliva in a murine model of APAP-induced DILI. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to Ae . aegypti bites 2 hours after APAP overdose. Biochemical and immunological parameters were evaluated in blood and liver samples at different time points after APAP administration. Exposure to Ae . aegypti saliva attenuated liver damage, as demonstrated by reduced hepatic necrosis and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase in APAP-overdosed mice. The levels of hepatic CYP2E1, the major enzyme responsible for the bioactivation of APAP, were not changed in Ae . aegypti exposed animals, suggesting no effects in the generation of hepatotoxic metabolites. On the other hand, mice treated with Ae . aegypti saliva following APAP overdose presented lower serum concentration of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-10, as well as reduced frequency of inflammatory cell populations in the liver, such as NKT cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. These findings show that Ae . aegypti saliva has bioactive molecules with therapeutic properties and may represent a prospective source of new compounds in the management of DILI-associated inflammatory disorders and, perhaps, many other inflammatory/autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3128396492,"Background Personalized medicine requires finding relationships between variables that influence a patient’s phenotype and predicting an outcome. Sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis identifies relationships between different groups of variables. This method requires establishing a model of the expected interaction between those variables. Describing these interactions is challenging when the relationship is unknown or when there is no pre-established hypothesis. Thus, our aim was to develop a method to find the relationships between microbiome and host transcriptome data and the relevant clinical variables in a complex disease, such as Crohn’s disease. Results We present here a method to identify interactions based on canonical correlation analysis. We show that the model is the most important factor to identify relationships between blocks using a dataset of Crohn’s disease patients with longitudinal sampling. First the analysis was tested in two previously published datasets: a glioma and a Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis dataset where we describe how to select the optimum parameters. Using such parameters, we analyzed our Crohn’s disease data set. We selected the model with the highest inner average variance explained to identify relationships between transcriptome, gut microbiome and clinically relevant variables. Adding the clinically relevant variables improved the average variance explained by the model compared to multiple co-inertia analysis. Conclusions The methodology described herein provides a general framework for identifying interactions between sets of omic data and clinically relevant variables. Following this method, we found genes and microorganisms that were related to each other independently of the model, while others were specific to the model used. Thus, model selection proved crucial to finding the existing relationships in multi-omics datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3128421670,"Background Infant morbidity is a topic of interest because it is used globally as an indicator of the status of health care in a country. A large body of evidence supports an association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and infant morbidity. When estimating the relationship between the predictors and the estimated variable of morbidity severity, the latter exhibits imbalanced data, which means that violation of symmetry is expected. Two competing methods of analysis, that is, (1) probit and (2) logit techniques, can be considered in this context and have been applied to model such outcomes. However, these models may yield inconsistent results. While non-normal modeling approaches have been embraced in the recent past, the skewed logit model has been given little attention. In this study, we exemplify its usefulness in analyzing imbalanced longitudinal responses data. Methodology While numerous non-normal methods for modeling binomial responses are well established, there is a need for comparison studies to assess their usefulness in different scenarios, especially under a longitudinal setting. This is addressed in this study. We use a dataset from Kenya about infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive mothers, who are also screened for BV. We aimed to investigate the effect of BV on infant morbidity across time. We derived a score for morbidity incidences depending on illnesses reported during the month of reference. By adjusting for the mother’s BV status, the child’s HIV status, sex, feeding status, and weight for age, we estimated the standard binary logit and skewed logit models, both using Generalized Estimating Equations. Results Results show that accounting for skewness in imbalanced binary data can show associations between variables in line with expectations documented by the literature. In addition, an in-depth analysis accounting for skewness has shown that, over time, maternal BV is associated with multiple health conditions in infants. Interpretation Maternal BV status was positively associated with infant morbidity incidences, which highlights the need for early intervention in cases of HIV-infected pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3126336830,"The settlement of Iceland in the Viking Age has been the focus of much research, but the composition of the founding population remains the subject of debate. Some lines of evidence suggest that almost all the founding population were Scandinavian, while others indicate a mix of Scandinavians and people of Scottish and Irish ancestry. To explore this issue further, we used three-dimensional techniques to compare the basicrania of skeletons from archaeological sites in Iceland, Scandinavia, and the British Isles. Our analyses yielded two main results. One was that the founding population likely consisted of roughly equal numbers of Scandinavians and people from the British Isles. The other was that the immigrants who originated from the British Isles included individuals of southern British ancestry as well as individuals of Scottish and Irish ancestry. The first of these findings is consistent with the results of recent analyses of modern and ancient DNA, while the second is novel. Our study, therefore, strengthens the idea that the founding population was a mix of Scandinavians and people from the British Isles, but also raises a new possibility regarding the regions from which the settlers originated."
https://openalex.org/W3126854618,"Despite significant modern medicine progress, having an infectious disease is a major risk factor for humans. Mucosal vaccination is now widely considered as the most promising strategy to defeat infectious diseases; however, only live-attenuated and inactivated mucosal vaccines are used in the clinical field. To date, no subunit mucosal vaccine was approved mainly because of the lack of safe and effective methodologies to either activate or initiate host mucosal immune responses. We have recently elucidated that intranasal administration of enzymatically polymerised caffeic acid potentiates antigen-specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses in mice. However, our earlier study has not confirmed whether these effects are specific to the polymer synthesised from caffeic acid. Here, we show that enzymatically polymerised polyphenols (EPPs) from various phenolic compounds possess mucosal adjuvant activities when administered nasally with an antigen to mice. Potentiation of antigen-specific immune responses by all EPPs tested in this study showed no clear difference among the precursors used. We found that intranasal administration of ovalbumin as the antigen, in combination with all enzymatically polymerised polyphenols used in this study, induced ovalbumin-specific mucosal IgA in the nasal cavity, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, vaginal fluids, and systemic IgG, especially IgG1, in sera. Our results demonstrate that the mucosal adjuvant activities of polyphenols are not limited to polymerised caffeic acid but are broadly observable across the studied polyphenols. These properties of polyphenols may be advantageous for the development of safe and effective nasal vaccine systems to prevent and/or treat various infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3127431393,"In this study, based on the regional land-use risk space division (regional ecological risk source/receptor space identification) using production–living–ecology analysis, three spatial function indexes, i.e., production, living, and ecology function indexes, were proposed for regional ecological risk assessment (RERA) with respect to human disturbance. The first two indexes can be regarded as regional ecological risk source indexes, whereas the final index can be regarded as a regional ecological risk receptor index. Using an artificial assignment method based on the land-use types and Defense Meteorological Program Operational Line-Scan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light intensity data, these three spatial function indexes were effectively manifested. By incorporating these indexes with eco-environmental vulnerability proxies, an RERA framework was established and applied in the Poyang Lake Eco-economic Zone (PLEZ), which is an ecological-protection and economic-development coordination-oriented region in China. The results suggest that (1) the DMSP/OLS nighttime light intensity data correlated well with the spatial distribution of regional urban/town areas; consequently, it was reasonable to use this dataset for representing regional production-living function space (urban/town area). (2) Overall, the forestlands and winter waterbodies of Poyang Lake were in the high-risk grade, and so did the Nanchang City construction land area; in contrast, the final risk levels of winter wetlands and croplands were relatively low. (3) Owing to the highest human disturbance (including both production and consumption human activities) and eco-environmental vulnerability level, urban/town areas such as Nanchang City had the highest final risk grade. (4) The low, medium, high, and very high-risk grades accounted for 21.22%, 39.53%, 36.31%, and 2.94% of the region, respectively. I believe that the proposed land use function indexes will be helpful in conducting human-caused RERA research in the future. Furthermore, the assessment results can provide a scientific basis for regional ecological risk management within the PLEZ."
https://openalex.org/W3127763265,"Objective To assess General Practitioner (GP) and pediatrician adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for diagnosis, treatment and management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method Medical records for 306 children aged ≤15 years from 46 GP clinics and 20 pediatric practices in Australia were reviewed against 34 indicators derived from CPG recommendations. At indicator level, adherence was estimated as the percentage of indicators with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ responses for adherence, which were scored ‘Yes’. This was done separately for GPs, pediatricians and overall; and weighted to adjust for sampling processes. Results Adherence with guidelines was high at 83.6% (95% CI: 77.7–88.5) with pediatricians (90.1%; 95% CI: 73.0–98.1) higher than GPs (68.3%; 95% CI: 46.0–85.8; p = 0.02). Appropriate assessment for children presenting with signs or symptoms of ADHD was undertaken with 95.2% adherence (95% CI: 76.6–99.9), however ongoing reviews for children with ADHD prescribed stimulant medication was markedly lower for both pediatricians (51.1%; 95% CI: 9.6–91.4) and GPs (18.7%; 95% CI: 4.1–45.5). Conclusion Adherence to CPGs for ADHD by pediatricians was generally high. Adherence by GPs was lower across most domains; timely recognition of medication side effects is a particular area for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3128368554,"Objective We aimed to determine the risk of postpartum infection and increased pain associated with use of condom-catheter uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) among women diagnosed with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in three low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also sought women’s opinions on their overall experience of PPH care. Methods This prospective cohort study compared women diagnosed with PPH who received and did not receive UBT (UBT group and no-UBT group, respectively) at 18 secondary level hospitals in Uganda, Egypt, and Senegal that participated in a stepped wedge, cluster-randomized trial assessing UBT introduction. Key outcomes were reported pain (on a scale 0–10) in the immediate postpartum period and receipt of antibiotics within four weeks postpartum (a proxy for postpartum infection). Outcomes related to satisfaction with care and aspects women liked most and least about PPH care were also reported. Results Among women diagnosed with PPH, 58 were in the UBT group and 2188 in the no-UBT group. Self-reported, post-discharge antibiotic use within four weeks postpartum was similar in the UBT (3/58, 5.6%) and no-UBT groups (100/2188, 4.6%, risk ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45–3.35). A high postpartum pain score of 8–10 was more common among women in the UBT group (17/46, 37.0%) than in the no-UBT group (360/1805, 19.9%, relative risk ratio = 3.64, 95% CI:1.30–10.16). Most women were satisfied with their care (1935/2325, 83.2%). When asked what they liked least about care, the most common responses were that medications (580/1511, 38.4%) and medical supplies (503/1511, 33.3%) were unavailable. Conclusion UBT did not increase the risk of postpartum infection among this population. Women who receive UBT may experience higher degrees of pain compared to women who do not receive UBT. Women’s satisfaction with their care and stockouts of medications and other supplies deserve greater attention when introducing new technologies like UBT."
https://openalex.org/W3126249636,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). Face shields are an important component of PPE for front-line workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing protection of the face from splashes and sprays of virus-containing fluids. Existing face shield designs and manufacturing procedures may not allow for production and distribution of face shields in sufficient volume to meet global demand, particularly in Low and Middle-Income countries. This paper presents a simple, fast, and cost-effective curved-crease origami technique for transforming flat sheets of flexible plastic material into face shields for infection control. It is further shown that the design could be produced using a variety of manufacturing methods, ranging from manual techniques to high-volume die-cutting and creasing. This demonstrates the potential for the design to be applied in a variety of contexts depending on available materials, manufacturing capabilities and labour. An easily implemented and flexible physical-digital parametric design methodology for rapidly exploring and refining variations on the design is presented, potentially allowing others to adapt the design to accommodate a wide range of ergonomic and protection requirements."

The aim of the study was to validate the inhibitory effect of Cornus mas on the TAS2R3 and TAS2R13 bitter taste receptors and to assess the effect of masking the bitter taste of dark chocolate with the help of the sensory panel. Dark chocolate was prepared with an addition of 5% of freeze-dried cornelian cherry fruits and 10 8 CFU/g of Bacillus coagulans probiotic strains. Effect on the TAS2R receptors was evaluated in specially transfected HEK293T cells, and the inhibition ratio was measured using the calcium release test. Moreover, the total polyphenol content, antioxidant activity and simulated intestinal in vitro digestion were determined for the samples. The tested chocolate products were rich in chlorogenic, caffeic and sinapic acids. The addition of cornelian cherry positively affected the antioxidant activity. The phytochemicals of Cornus mas decreased the TAS2R13 activity by 132% after a 2-minute interaction and, % at the same time, inhibited the TAS2R3 activity by 11.5. Meanwhile, chocolate with the addition of fruit was less bitter according to the sensory panel."
https://openalex.org/W3128185908,"The management of ecosystem has been a major contributor to the control of diseases that are transmitted by snail intermediate hosts. The ability of freshwater snails to self-fertilize, giving rise to thousands of hatchlings, enables them to contribute immensely to the difficulty in reducing the endemicity of some infections in the world. One of the effects of land use/land cover change (LU/LCC) is deforestation, which, in turn, leads to the creation of suitable habitats for the survival of freshwater snails. This study was aimed at studying the land use/land cover change, physico-chemical parameters of water bodies and to understand the interplay between them and freshwater snails in an environment where a new industrial plant was established. Landsat TM, 1984, Landsat ETM+ 2000 and Operational land Imager (OLI) 2014 imageries of the study area were digitally processed using ERDAS Imagine. The land use classification includes settlement, water bodies, wetlands, vegetation and exposed surface. Dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, total dissolved solids and conductivity were measured with multipurpose digital meters. Snail sampling was done at each site for 30 minutes along the littoral zones, using a long-handled scoop (0.2mm mesh size) net once every month for 24 months. Independent t -test was used to determine the variation between seasons, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between physico-chemical parameters and snail species while regression was used to analyze the relationship between LU/LCC and freshwater snails. Species’ richness, diversity and evenness were examined using Margalef, Shannon Weiner and Equitability indexes. Snail species recovered include: Bulinus globosus , Bulinus jousseaumei , Bulinus camerunensis , Bulinus senegalensis , Bulinus forskalii , Amerianna carinatus , Ferrissia spp., Segmentorbis augustus , Lymnaea natalensis , Melanoides tuberculata , Physa acuta , Gyraulus costulatus , Indoplanorbis exuxtus and Gibbiella species. Out of the total snails recovered, M . tuberculata (2907) was the most abundant, followed by Lymnaea natalensis (1542). The highest number of snail species was recovered from Iho River while the least number of snails was recovered from Euro River. The mean and standard deviation of physico-chemical parameters of the water bodies were DO (2.13±0.9 mg/L), pH (6.80±0.4), TDS (50.58±18.8 mg/L), Temperature (26.2±0.9°C) and Conductivity (74.00±27.5 μS/cm). There was significant positive correlation between pH and B . globosus (r = 0.439; P&lt;0.05). Dissolved oxygen showed significant positive correlation with B . globosus (r = 0.454; P&lt;0.05) and M . tuberculata (r = 0.687; P&lt;0.01). There was a positive significant relationship between LULCC and B . camerunensis (p&lt;0.05). The positive relationship between LULCC and the abundance of B . globosus , B . jousseaumei was not significant. The area covered by water bodies increased from 3.72 to 4.51 kilometers; this indicates that, more suitable habitats were being created for the multiplication of freshwater snails. We therefore conclude that, increase in areas suitable for the survival of freshwater snails could lead to an increase in water-borne diseases caused by the availability of snail intermediate hosts."
https://openalex.org/W3128327388,"Universal primary education is critical for individual academic growth and overall adult productivity of nations. Estimates indicate that 25% of 59 million primary age out of school children drop out and early grade failure is one of the factors. An objective and feasible screening measure to identify at-risk children in the early grades can help to design appropriate interventions. The objective of this study was to use a Machine Learning algorithm to evaluate the power of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected at age 4 in predicting academic achievement at age 8 among rural children in Pakistan. Demographic and EEG data from 96 children of a cohort along with their academic achievement in grade 1–2 measured using an academic achievement test of Math and language at the age of 7–8 years was used to develop the machine learning algorithm. K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier was used on different model combinations of EEG, sociodemographic and home environment variables. KNN model was evaluated using 5 Stratified Folds based on the sensitivity and specificity. In the current dataset, 55% and 74% failed in the mathematics and language test respectively. On testing data across each fold, the mean sensitivity and specificity was calculated. Sensitivity was similar when EEG variables were combined with sociodemographic, and home environment (Math = 58.7%, Language = 66.3%) variables but specificity improved (Math = 43.4% to 50.6% and Language = 32% to 60%). The model requires further validation for EEG to be used as a screening measure with adequate sensitivity and specificity to identify children in their preschool age who may be at high risk of failure in early grades."

Involving both joint replenishment decisions and supplier selection decisions makes the problem to be NP-hard. In particular, the consideration of non-instantaneous deterioration makes it more challenging to handle. We first construct a mathematical model integrated with a supplier selection system and a joint replenishment program for non-instantaneous deteriorating items to formulate the problem. Then we develop a novel swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, the Improved Moth-flame Optimization (IMFO) algorithm, to solve the proposed model. The results of several numerical experiments analyses reveal that the IMFO algorithm is an effective algorithm for solving the proposed model in terms of solution quality and searching stableness. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to further investigate the performance of the proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W3126339248,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a widespread viral infection of the central nervous system with increasing incidence in Europe and northern Asia. Post-infectious sequelae are frequent, and patients with TBE commonly experience long-term fatigue and subjective sleep disturbances. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be a contributing factor, and objective sleep studies with polysomnography (PSG) are lacking. Forty-two adults, 22 TBE patients (cases), diagnosed in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, between 2012 and 2015, and 20 controls without a known TBE history, underwent an overnight PSG, respectively. All participants responded to questionnaires. The cases and controls were similar regarding age, sex, obesity, concomitant diseases, smoking, and alcohol habits. Despite similar PSG characteristics such as total sleep time and OSA severity indices, the TBE cases reported statistically more sleep-related functional impairment on the Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) compared with the controls (median scores 18.1 vs . 19.9; p &lt;0.05). In a multivariate analysis, TBE correlated significantly with the lower FOSQ scores (unstandardized β −1.80 [%95 confidence interval −3.02 - −0.58]; p = 0 . 005 ) independent of age, sex, total sleep time and apnea-hypopnea-index. TBE cases with OSA reported the lowest scores on the FOSQ compared with the other subgroups with TBE or OSA alone, and the ones with neither TBE nor OSA. TBE is associated with impaired functional outcomes, in which concomitant OSA may worsen the subjective symptoms. Further studies are warranted to determine the effect of treatment of concomitant OSA on functional outcomes with regard to optimal rehabilitation of TBE."

Adequate knowledge and attitude about insulin self-administration could also improve the management of diabetes and eventually improve the quality of life. This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards insulin self-administration and associated factors among diabetic patients at Zewditu Memorial Hospital (ZMH), Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 245 diabetic patients who were selected by systematic random sampling during follow-up at ZMH. The data was collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS v.20. Binary logistic regression was used to identify associated factors of patients’ knowledge and P &lt; 0 . 05 was used to declare the association. Results Among 245 patients enrolled, 53.9% were male with a mean age of 53.26 ±13.43 years and more than 84% of the patients can read and write. The overall patients’ knowledge was 63.4%. Better knowledge was observed concerning timing (78.4%) and site of insulin injection (89.4%), while knowledge on the angle of inclination during insulin administration (43.3%) and complications of insulin therapy (49%) were low. Patients who were male gender, never married, government or NGO employees, urban residents, who completed elementary and higher education had a higher knowledge than their comparators. The majority (62%) of the study patients had a favorable attitude on insulin self-administration. Although the majority 177(72.2%) of the study patients have administered insulin themselves, only 120(49.0%) of the patients injected insulin appropriately at 45 0 . Frequent repetition of the injection site was practiced among 176(71.8%) patients and 139(56.7%) injected insulin before or immediately after food intake. Conclusion Patients’ knowledge and attitude seem suboptimal and malpractice of insulin self-administration was reported. Therefore, the gaps should be addressed through patient education and demonstration of insulin injection during each hospital visit."

In our method, experiment-specific networks are learned from the data and then combined by weighted averaging to construct a consensus network. Through empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets, we found that for most of the larger-sized network datasets that we analyzed, our method is more accurate than state-of-the-art network inference approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3128587854,"Background Processes for transferring patients to higher acuity facilities lack a standardized approach to prognostication, increasing the risk for low value care that imposes significant burdens on patients and their families with unclear benefits. We sought to develop a rapid and feasible tool for predicting mortality using variables readily available at the time of hospital transfer. Methods and findings All work was carried out at a single, large, multi-hospital integrated healthcare system. We used a retrospective cohort for model development consisting of patients aged 18 years or older transferred into the healthcare system from another hospital, hospice, skilled nursing or other healthcare facility with an admission priority of direct emergency admit. The cohort was randomly divided into training and test sets to develop first a 54-variable, and then a 14-variable gradient boosting model to predict the primary outcome of all cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day and 90-day mortality and transition to comfort measures only or hospice care. For model validation, we used a prospective cohort consisting of all patients transferred to a single, tertiary care hospital from one of the 3 referring hospitals, excluding patients transferred for myocardial infarction or maternal labor and delivery. Prospective validation was performed by using a web-based tool to calculate the risk of mortality at the time of transfer. Observed outcomes were compared to predicted outcomes to assess model performance. The development cohort included 20,985 patients with 1,937 (9.2%) in-hospital mortalities, 2,884 (13.7%) 30-day mortalities, and 3,899 (18.6%) 90-day mortalities. The 14-variable gradient boosting model effectively predicted in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality (c = 0.903 [95% CI:0.891–0.916]), c = 0.877 [95% CI:0.864–0.890]), and c = 0.869 [95% CI:0.857–0.881], respectively). The tool was proven feasible and valid for bedside implementation in a prospective cohort of 679 sequentially transferred patients for whom the bedside nurse calculated a SafeNET score at the time of transfer, taking only 4–5 minutes per patient with discrimination consistent with the development sample for in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality (c = 0.836 [95%CI: 0.751–0.921], 0.815 [95% CI: 0.730–0.900], and 0.794 [95% CI: 0.725–0.864], respectively). Conclusions The SafeNET algorithm is feasible and valid for real-time, bedside mortality risk prediction at the time of hospital transfer. Work is ongoing to build pathways triggered by this score that direct needed resources to the patients at greatest risk of poor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3128859846,"The performance of nearest-neighbor feature selection and prediction methods depends on the metric for computing neighborhoods and the distribution properties of the underlying data. Recent work to improve nearest-neighbor feature selection algorithms has focused on new neighborhood estimation methods and distance metrics. However, little attention has been given to the distributional properties of pairwise distances as a function of the metric or data type. Thus, we derive general analytical expressions for the mean and variance of pairwise distances for L q metrics for normal and uniform random data with p attributes and m instances. The distribution moment formulas and detailed derivations provide a resource for understanding the distance properties for metrics and data types commonly used with nearest-neighbor methods, and the derivations provide the starting point for the following novel results. We use extreme value theory to derive the mean and variance for metrics that are normalized by the range of each attribute (difference of max and min). We derive analytical formulas for a new metric for genetic variants, which are categorical variables that occur in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The genetic distance distributions account for minor allele frequency and the transition/transversion ratio. We introduce a new metric for resting-state functional MRI data (rs-fMRI) and derive its distance distribution properties. This metric is applicable to correlation-based predictors derived from time-series data. The analytical means and variances are in strong agreement with simulation results. We also use simulations to explore the sensitivity of the expected means and variances in the presence of correlation and interactions in the data. These analytical results and new metrics can be used to inform the optimization of nearest neighbor methods for a broad range of studies, including gene expression, GWAS, and fMRI data."
https://openalex.org/W3128860535,"We used complementary stable isotope (SIA) and stomach content (SCA) analyses to investigate feeding relationships among species of the nektobenthic communities and the potential ecological effects of the bottom trawling of a coastal ecosystem in northeastern Brazil. Carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) compositions were determined for five basal sources and 28 consumers, from zooplankton to shrimp and fish species. Fishes and basal sources showed a broad range of δ 15 N (fishes: 6.49–14.94‰; sources: 2.58–6.79‰) and δ 13 C values (fishes: -23.86 to -13.71‰; sources: -24.32 to -13.53‰), while shrimps and crabs exhibited similar nitrogen and carbon ratios. Six trophic consumer groups were determined among zooplankton, crustaceans and fishes by SIA, with trophic pathways associated mostly with benthic sources. SCA results indicated a preference for benthic invertebrates, mainly worms, crabs and shrimps, as prey for the fish fauna, highlighting their importance in the food web. In overall, differences between SCA and the SIA approaches were observed, except for groups composed mainly for shrimps and some species of high δ 15 N values, mostly piscivorous and zoobenthivores. Given the absence of regulation for bottom trawling activities in the area, the cumulative effects of trawling on population parameters, species composition, potentially decreasing the abundance of benthic preys (e.g., shrimps, worms and crabs) may lead to changes in the trophic structure potentially affect the food web and the sustainability of the fishery."
https://openalex.org/W3129046909,"Osteosarcoma is a rare disease in children but is one of the most common cancers in adult large breed dogs. The mutational landscape of both the primary and pulmonary metastatic tumor in two dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma (OSA) was comprehensively evaluated using an automated whole genome sequencing, exome and RNA-seq pipeline that was adapted for this study for use in dogs. Chromosomal lesions were the most common type of mutation. The mutational landscape varied substantially between dogs but the lesions within the same patient were similar. Copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity in mutant TP53 was the most significant driver mutation and involved a large region in the middle of chromosome 5. Canine and human OSA is characterized by loss of cell cycle checkpoint integrity and DNA damage response pathways. Mutational profiling of individual patients with canine OSA would be recommended prior to targeted therapy, given the heterogeneity seen in our study and previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W3126185802,"In 2006 and 2007, sheep and cattle farms in the Netherlands were affected by an epidemic of bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8). In order to obtain insight into the within-farm spread of the virus, five affected cattle and five affected sheep farms were longitudinally monitored between early 2007 and mid or late 2008. The farms were visited between four and seven times to collect blood samples. During each visit, all animals present in the flock or herd were sampled. The samples were analysed for the presence of BTV-8 antibodies (ELISA) and BTV-8 antigen (rRT-PCR). The observed patterns of RT-PCR positives indicate a rapid within-farm virus spread during the vector season. During vector-free periods we observed a complete rRT-PCR positivity decline within a few months. During the vector season a lower bound estimate of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) ranges from 2.9–6.9 in the cattle herds (one herd not analysed), and from 1.3–3.2 in the sheep flocks in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3129033170,"Functional proprioceptive information is required to allow an individual to interact with the environment effectively for everyday activities such as locomotion and object manipulation. Specifically, research suggests that application of compression garments could improve proprioceptive regulation of action by enhancing sensorimotor system noise in individuals of different ages and capacities. However, limited research has been conducted with samples of elderly people thus far. This study aimed to examine acute effects of wearing knee-length socks (KLS) of various compression levels on ankle joint position sense in community-dwelling, older adults. A total of 26 participants (12 male and 14 female), aged between 65 and 84 years, were randomly recruited from local senior activity centres in Singapore. A repeated-measures design was used to determine effects on joint position awareness of three different treatments–wearing clinical compression socks (20–30 mmHg); wearing non-clinical compression socks (&lt; 20 mmHg); wearing normal socks, and one control condition (barefoot). Participants were required to use the dominant foot to indicate 8 levels of steepness (2.5°, 5°, 7.5°, 10°, 12.5°, 15°, 17.5°, and 20°), while standing on a modified slope box, in a plantar flexion position. Findings showed that wearing clinical compression KLS significantly reduced the mean absolute errors compared to the barefoot condition. However, there were no significant differences observed between other KLS and barefoot conditions. Among the KLS of various compression levels, results suggested that only wearing clinical compression KLS (20–30 mmHg) improved the precision of estimation of ankle joint plantar flexion movement, by reducing absolute performance errors in elderly people. It is concluded that wearing clinical compression KLS could potentially provide an affordable strategy to ameliorate negative effects of ageing on the proprioception system to enhance balance and postural control in community-dwelling individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3127440666,"Background The effect of the period before a mother’s death on child survival has been assessed in only a few studies. We conducted a comparative investigation of the effect of the timing of a mother’s death on child survival up to age five years in rural South Africa. Methods We used discrete time survival analysis on data from two HIV-endemic population surveillance sites (2000–2015) to estimate a child’s risk of dying before and after their mother’s death. We tested if this relationship varied between sites and by availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed if related adults in the household altered the effect of a mother’s death on child survival. Findings 3,618 children died from 2000–2015. The probability of a child dying began to increase in the 7–11 months prior to the mother’s death and increased markedly in the 3 months before (2000–2003 relative risk = 22.2, 95% CI = 14.2–34.6) and 3 months following her death (2000–2003 RR = 20.1; CI = 10.3–39.4). This increased risk pattern was evident at both sites. The pattern attenuated with ART availability but remained even with availability at both sites. The father and maternal grandmother in the household lowered children’s mortality risk independent of the association between timing of mother and child mortality. Conclusions The persistence of elevated mortality risk both before and after the mother’s death for children of different ages suggests that absence of maternal care and abrupt breastfeeding cessation might be crucial risk factors. Formative research is needed to understand the circumstances for children when a mother is very ill or dies, and behavioral and other risk factors that increase both the mother and child’s risk of dying. Identifying families when a mother is very ill and implementing training and support strategies for other members of the household are urgently needed to reduce preventable child mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3129027986,"The purpose of this study was to identify performance measures of racially underrepresented minority (RUM) Ph.D. trainees who needed additional training initiatives to assist with completing the UAMS biomedical science degree. A sample of 37 trainees in the 10-year NIH-NIGMS funded Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) program at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) were examined. Descriptive statistics and correlations examined process measures (GRE scores, GPAs, etc.) and outcome measures (time-to-degree, publications, post-doctoral fellowship, etc.) While differences were found, there were no statistically significant differences between how these two groups (Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominately White Institutions (PWIs)) of students performed over time as Ph.D. students. Graduates who scored lower on the verbal section of the GRE also had a higher final graduate school grade point average in graduates who received their undergraduate training from HBCUs. Of the graduates who received their undergraduate training from PWIs, graduates who scored lower on the quantitative section of the GRE had higher numbers of publications. These findings stimulate the need to 1) reduce reliance on the use of the GRE in admission committee decisions, 2) identify psychometrically valid indicators that tailored to assess outcome variables that are relevant to the careers of biomedical scientists, and 3) ensure the effective use of the tools in making admission decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3121502947,"Objectives To assess the feasibility of radiologic measurements and find out whether hearing outcome could be predicted based on computer tomography (CT) scan evaluation in patients with temporal bone fractures and suspected ossicular joint dislocation. Methods We assessed 4002 temporal bone CT scans and identified 34 patients with reported ossicular joint dislocation due to trauma. We excluded those with no proven traumatic ossicular dislocation in CT scan and patients with bilateral temporal bone fractures. We measured four parameters such as malleus-incus axis distance, malleus-incus angle at midpoints, malleus- incus axis angle and ossicular joint space. The contralateral healthy side served as its own control. Hearing outcome 1–3 months after the index visit was analyzed. We assessed diagnostic accuracy and performed a logistic regression using radiologic measurement parameters for outcome prediction of conductive hearing loss (defined as &gt;20dB air-bone gap). Results We found excellent inter-rater agreement on the measurement of axis deviation between incus and malleus in CT scans (interclass correlation coefficient 0.81). The larger the deviation of incus and malleus axis, the higher probability of poor hearing outcome (odds ratio (OR) 2.67 per 0.1mm, p = .006). A cut-off value for the axis deviation of 0.25mm showed a sensitivity of 0.778 and a specificity of 0.94 ( p &lt; .001) for discrimination between poor and good hearing outcome in terms of conductive hearing loss. Conclusion Adequate assessment of high resolution CT scans of temporal bone in which ossicular chain dislocation had occurred after trauma was feasible. Axis deviations of the incus and the malleus were strongly predictive for poor hearing outcome in terms of air conduction 1–3 months after trauma. We propose a 3-level classification system for hearing outcome prediction based on radiologic measures."
https://openalex.org/W3128179240,"Background The Chronic Pain Coping Inventory (CPCI) has been widely used to measure coping with pain, however, the psychometric properties of the Brazilian CPCI are unknown. Aim To verify the validity and reliability of the CPCI-Brazilian version. Materials and methods A sample of 705 outpatients with chronic pain participated in the study. Cronbach’s alpha, corrected item-total correlations, and confirmatory factor analysis were performed, using the method of Diagonally Weighted Least Squares. Results Construct validity was supported with a factor loading range of 0.36–0.90 (9 factors) corroborating original loads. The final model had adequate fit with items 42 and 54 excluded, D.F = 2174, TLI = 0.96; CFI = 0.96 and RMSEA = 0.051(p = 0.067). Eight of the nine CPCI scales showed satisfactory reliability (Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.70 to 0.92). The Relaxation scale obtained a low alpha value (0.53). Conclusion The CPCI-Brazilian version, after exclusion of items 42 and 54, is valid to measure chronic pain coping in Brazilian adults."
https://openalex.org/W3128821997,"The C-type lectin-like receptor NKG2D contributes to the immunosurveillance of virally infected and malignant cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes. A peculiar and puzzling feature of the NKG2D-based immunorecognition system is the high number of ligands for this single immunoreceptor. In humans, there are a total of eight NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) comprising two members of the MIC (MICA, MICB) and six members of the ULBP family of glycoproteins (ULBP1 to ULBP6). While MICA has been extensively studied with regard to its biochemistry, cellular expression and function, very little is known about the NKG2DL ULBP4. This is, at least in part, due to its rather restricted expression by very few cell lines and tissues. Recently, constitutive ULBP4 expression by human monocytes was reported, questioning the view of tissue-restricted ULBP4 expression. Here, we scrutinized ULBP4 expression by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes by analyzing ULBP4 transcripts and ULBP4 surface expression. In contrast to MICA, there was no ULBP4 expression detectable, neither by freshly isolated monocytes nor by PAMP-activated monocytes. However, a commercial antibody erroneously indicated surface ULBP4 on monocytes due to a non-ULBP4-specific binding activity, emphasizing the critical importance of validated reagents for life sciences. Collectively, our data show that ULBP4 is not expressed by monocytes, and likely also not by other peripheral blood immune cells, and therefore exhibits an expression pattern rather distinct from other human NKG2DL."
