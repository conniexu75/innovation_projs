https://openalex.org/W2132888849,"The tumor suppressor p53 gene is mutated in minimally half of all cancers. It is therefore reasonable to assume that naturally occurring polymorphic genetic variants in the p53 stress response pathway might determine an individual's susceptibility to cancer. A central node in the p53 pathway is the MDM2 protein, a direct negative regulator of p53. In this report, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP309) is found in the MDM2 promoter and is shown to increase the affinity of the transcriptional activator Sp1, resulting in higher levels of MDM2 RNA and protein and the subsequent attenuation of the p53 pathway. In humans, SNP309 is shown to associate with accelerated tumor formation in both hereditary and sporadic cancers. A model is proposed whereby SNP309 serves as a rate-limiting event in carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2040650438,"The mammalian circadian timing system is composed of a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain and subsidiary oscillators in most peripheral cell types. While oscillators in SCN neurons are known to function in a self-sustained fashion, peripheral oscillators have been thought to damp rapidly when disconnected from the control exerted by the SCN. Using two reporter systems, we monitored circadian gene expression in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts in real time and in individual cells. In conjunction with mathematical modeling and cell co-culture experiments, these data demonstrated that in vitro cultured fibroblasts harbor self-sustained and cell-autonomous circadian clocks similar to those operative in SCN neurons. Circadian gene expression in fibroblasts continues during cell division, and our experiments unveiled unexpected interactions between the circadian clock and the cell division clock. Specifically, the circadian oscillator gates cytokinesis to defined time windows, and mitosis elicits phase shifts in circadian cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1988715808,"Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface membrane is critical in order for the receptors to recognize their ligands. However, mammalian GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells, are poorly expressed on the cell surface. Here we show that the transmembrane proteins RTP1 and RTP2 promote functional cell surface expression of ORs expressed in HEK293T cells. Genes encoding these proteins are expressed specifically in olfactory neurons. These proteins are associated with OR proteins and enhance the OR responses to odorants. Similar although weaker effects were seen with a third protein, REEP1. These findings suggest that RTP1 and RTP2 in particular play significant roles in the translocation of ORs to the plasma membrane as well as in the functioning of ORs. We have used this approach to identify active odorant ligands for ORs, providing a platform for screening the chemical selectivity of the large OR family."
https://openalex.org/W2089456325,"Histone lysine methylation is a key regulator of gene expression and heterochromatin function, but little is known as to how this modification impinges on other chromatin activities. Here we demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized SET domain protein, Set9, is responsible for H4-K20 methylation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Surprisingly, H4-K20 methylation does not have any apparent role in the regulation of gene expression or heterochromatin function. Rather, we find the modification has a role in DNA damage response. Loss of Set9 activity or mutation of H4-K20 markedly impairs cell survival after genotoxic challenge and compromises the ability of cells to maintain checkpoint mediated cell cycle arrest. Genetic experiments link Set9 to Crb2, a homolog of the mammalian checkpoint protein 53BP1, and the enzyme is required for Crb2 localization to sites of DNA damage. These results argue that H4-K20 methylation functions as a “histone mark” required for the recruitment of the checkpoint protein Crb2."

https://openalex.org/W1998018574,"Cell survival under severe thermal stress requires the activity of the ClpB (Hsp104) AAA+ chaperone that solubilizes and reactivates aggregated proteins in concert with the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone system. How protein disaggregation is achieved and whether survival is solely dependent on ClpB-mediated elimination of aggregates or also on reactivation of aggregated proteins has been unclear. We engineered a ClpB variant, BAP, which associates with the ClpP peptidase and thereby is converted into a degrading disaggregase. BAP translocates substrates through its central pore directly into ClpP for degradation. ClpB-dependent translocation is demonstrated to be an integral part of the disaggregation mechanism. Protein disaggregation by the BAP/ClpP complex remains dependent on DnaK, defining a role for DnaK at early stages of the disaggregation reaction. The activity switch of BAP to a degrading disaggregase does not support thermotolerance development, demonstrating that cell survival during severe thermal stress requires reactivation of aggregated proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1974676736,"Cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced mRNA translation is a hallmark of early animal development. In Xenopus oocytes, where the molecular mechanism has been defined, the core factors that control this process include CPEB, an RNA binding protein whose association with the CPE specifies which mRNAs undergo polyadenylation; CPSF, a multifactor complex that interacts with the near-ubiquitous polyadenylation hexanucleotide AAUAAA; and maskin, a CPEB and eIF4E binding protein whose regulation of initiation is governed by poly(A) tail length. Here, we define two new factors that are essential for polyadenylation. The first is symplekin, a CPEB and CPSF binding protein that serves as a scaffold upon which regulatory factors are assembled. The second is xGLD-2, an unusual poly(A) polymerase that is anchored to CPEB and CPSF even before polyadenylation begins. The identification of these factors has broad implications for biological process that employ polyadenylation-regulated translation, such as gametogenesis, cell cycle progression, and synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2046673154,"The interplay between discrete vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom directly influences the chemical and physical properties of molecular systems. This coupling is typically studied through optical methods such as fluorescence, absorption, and Raman spectroscopy. Molecular electronic devices provide new opportunities for exploring vibration-electronic interactions at the single molecule level. For example, electrons injected from a scanning tunneling microscope tip into a metal can excite vibrational excitations of a molecule in the gap between tip and metal. Here we show how current directly injected into a freely suspended individual single-wall carbon nanotube can be used to excite, detect, and control a specific vibrational mode of the molecule. Electrons inelastically tunneling into the nanotube cause a non-equilibrium occupation of the radial breathing mode, leading to both stimulated emission and absorption of phonons by successive electron tunneling events. We exploit this effect to measure a phonon lifetime on the order of 10 nanoseconds, corresponding to a quality factor well over 10000 for this nanomechanical oscillator."

https://openalex.org/W2059880102,"The importance of long-term synaptic plasticity as a cellular substrate for learning and memory is well established. By contrast, little is known about how learning and memory are regulated by voltage-gated ion channels that integrate synaptic information. We investigated this question using mice with general or forebrain-restricted knockout of the HCN1 gene, which we find encodes a major component of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih) and is an important determinant of dendritic integration in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Deletion of HCN1 from forebrain neurons enhances hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, augments the power of theta oscillations, and enhances long-term potentiation (LTP) at the direct perforant path input to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, but has little effect on LTP at the more proximal Schaffer collateral inputs. We suggest that HCN1 channels constrain learning and memory by regulating dendritic integration of distal synaptic inputs to pyramidal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2131081669,"The amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) ending at 42 plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have reported previously that intracellular Abeta42 is associated with neuronal apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that intracellular Abeta42 directly activated the p53 promoter, resulting in p53-dependent apoptosis, and that intracellular Abeta40 had a similar but lesser effect. Moreover, oxidative DNA damage induced nuclear localization of Abeta42 with p53 mRNA elevation in guinea-pig primary neurons. Also, p53 expression was elevated in brain of sporadic AD and transgenic mice carrying mutant familial AD genes. Remarkably, accumulation of both Abeta42 and p53 was found in some degenerating-shape neurons in both transgenic mice and human AD cases. Thus, the intracellular Abeta42/p53 pathway may be directly relevant to neuronal loss in AD. Although neurotoxicity of extracellular Abeta is well known and synaptic/mitochondrial dysfunction by intracellular Abeta42 has recently been suggested, intracellular Abeta42 may cause p53-dependent neuronal apoptosis through activation of the p53 promoter; thus demonstrating an alternative pathogenesis in AD."

https://openalex.org/W1971690300,"Neuronal plasticity relies on tightly regulated control of protein levels at synapses. One mechanism to control protein abundance is the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system. Recent studies have implicated ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in synaptic development, function, and plasticity, but little is known about the regulatory mechanisms controlling ubiquitylation in neurons. In contrast, ubiquitylation has long been studied as a central regulator of the eukaryotic cell cycle. A critical mediator of cell-cycle transitions, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Although the APC/C has been detected in several differentiated cell types, a functional role for the complex in postmitotic cells has been elusive. We describe a novel postmitotic role for the APC/C at Drosophila neuromuscular synapses: independent regulation of synaptic growth and synaptic transmission. In neurons, the APC/C controls synaptic size via a downstream effector Liprin-α; in muscles, the APC/C regulates synaptic transmission, controlling the concentration of a postsynaptic glutamate receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2101296091,"Thrombin is the final protease in the blood coagulation cascade and serves both pro- and anticoagulant functions through the cleavage of several targets. The ability of thrombin to specifically recognize a wide range of substrates derives from interactions that occur outside of the active site of thrombin. Thrombin possesses two anion binding exosites, which mediate many of its interactions with cofactors and substrates, and although many structures of thrombin have been solved, few such interactions have been described in molecular detail. Glycosaminoglycan binding to exosite II of thrombin plays a major role in switching off the procoagulant functions of thrombin by mediating its irreversible inhibition by circulating serpins and by its binding to the endothelial cell surface receptor thrombomodulin. Here we report the 1.85-A structure of human alpha-thrombin bound to a heparin fragment of eight monosaccharide units in length. The asymmetric unit is composed of two thrombin dimers, each sharing a single heparin octasaccharide chain. The observed interactions are fully consistent with previous mutagenesis studies and illustrate on a molecular level the cofactor interaction that is critical for the restriction of clotting to the site of blood vessel injury."
https://openalex.org/W1974702668,"Hemoglobin A (HbA), the oxygen delivery system in humans, comprises two alpha and two beta subunits. Free alpha-hemoglobin (alphaHb) is unstable, and its precipitation contributes to the pathophysiology of beta thalassemia. In erythrocytes, the alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds alphaHb and inhibits its precipitation. The crystal structure of AHSP bound to Fe(II)-alphaHb reveals that AHSP specifically recognizes the G and H helices of alphaHb through a hydrophobic interface that largely recapitulates the alpha1-beta1 interface of hemoglobin. The AHSP-alphaHb interactions are extensive but suboptimal, explaining why beta-hemoglobin can competitively displace AHSP to form HbA. Remarkably, the Fe(II)-heme group in AHSP bound alphaHb is coordinated by the distal but not the proximal histidine. Importantly, binding to AHSP facilitates the conversion of oxy-alphaHb to a deoxygenated, oxidized [Fe(III)], nonreactive form in which all six coordinate positions are occupied. These observations reveal the molecular mechanisms by which AHSP stabilizes free alphaHb."
https://openalex.org/W2001186370,"The unusually low 78% amino acid identity between the orthologous human SLC26A6 and mouse slc26a6 polypeptides prompted systematic comparison of their anion transport functions in Xenopus oocytes. Multiple human SLC26A6 variant polypeptides were also functionally compared. Transport was studied as unidirectional fluxes of 36Cl-, [14C]oxalate, and [35S]sulfate; as net fluxes of HCO3− by fluorescence ratio measurement of intracellular pH; as current by two-electrode voltage clamp; and as net Cl- flux by fluorescence intensity measurement of relative changes in extracellular and intracellular [Cl-]. Four human SLC26A6 polypeptide variants each exhibited rates of bidirectional [14C]oxalate flux, Cl−/HCO3− exchange, and Cl-/OH- exchange nearly equivalent to those of mouse slc26a6. Cl−/HCO3− exchange by both orthologs was cAMP-sensitive, further enhanced by coexpressed wild type cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator but inhibited by cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ΔF508. However, the very low rates of 36Cl- and [35S]sulfate transport by all active human SLC26A6 isoforms contrasted with the high rates of the mouse ortholog. Human and mouse orthologs also differed in patterns of acute regulation. Studies of human-mouse chimeras revealed cosegregation of the high 36Cl- transport phenotype with the transmembrane domain of mouse slc26a6. Mouse slc26a6 and human SLC26A6 each mediated electroneutral Cl−/HCO3− and Cl-/OH- exchange. In contrast, whereas Cl-/oxalate exchange by mouse slc26a6 was electrogenic, that mediated by human SLC26A6 appeared electroneutral. The increased currents observed in oocytes expressing either mouse or human ortholog were pharmacologically distinct from the accompanying monovalent anion exchange activities. The human SLC26A6 polypeptide variants SLC26A6c and SLC26A6d were inactive as transporters of oxalate, sulfate, and chloride. Thus, the orthologous mouse and human SLC26A6 proteins differ in anion selectivity, transport mechanism, and acute regulation, but both mediate electroneutral Cl−/HCO3− exchange.

Cl−/HCO3− exchange plays important roles in cell pH and volume regulation. In polarized epithelial cells, Cl−/HCO3− exchange mediates transepithelial secretion of acid and base and contributes to fluid and volume secretion and reabsorption. Two gene superfamilies encode Na+-independent Cl−/HCO3− exchangers, SLC4 and SLC26. The SLC4 family includes, in addition to the electroneutral AE anion exchangers, electrogenic and electroneutral Na+-bicarbonate cotransporters, and Na+-dependent Cl−/HCO3− and Cl-/base exchangers (1Alper S.L.

Unlike the high degree of amino acid identity between orthologous mouse and human SLC4 bicarbonate transporters, orthologous mouse and human SLC26 polypeptide sequences (with the notable exception of the cochlear outer hair cell mechanotransducer, SLC26A5/prestin) diverge to a much greater degree. Mouse slc26a6 and human SLC26A6 share only 78% aa identity. A single demonstration of unidirectional isotopic influx has been reported for the human SLC26A6 (25Lohi H. Lamprecht G. Markovich D.

Ishibashi, personal communication). The functional properties of the novel human SLC26A6 variant BAC56861 remain unreported. after an earlier report failed to detect evidence of function in Xenopus oocytes (38Waldegger S. Moschen I. Ramirez A. Smith R.J. Ayadi H. Lang F. Kubisch C. Genomics. 2001; 72: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined systematically the functional properties of several human SLC26A6 polypeptide variants and compared them with the only functionally studied mouse slc26a6 polypeptide variant, also known as the chloride/formate exchanger, CFEX (23Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We found that four active human SLC26A6 polypeptide variants exhibit similar functional properties in Xenopus oocytes. All differed from mouse slc26a6/CFEX most prominently in their very low rates of 36Cl- transport in Cl-/Cl- exchange assays and in their very low rates of 35SO42− transport. However, these same polypeptides mediated bidirectional [14C]oxalate fluxes as well as Cl−/HCO3−, Cl-/OH-, and oxalate/HCO3− exchange activities (measured as dpHi/dt) at rates approaching those of mouse slc26a6/CFEX. Wild-type CFTR, but not CFTR ΔF508, stimulated Cl−/HCO3− and Cl-/OH- exchange by human SLC26A6 and enhanced its cAMP sensitivity. High rates of 36Cl- transport cosegregated with the transmembrane domain of mouse slc26a6 in studies with chimeric proteins. The orthologous polypeptides of both species mediated electroneutral Cl−/HCO3− and Cl-/OH- exchanges, although expression was accompanied by oocyte current with pharmacological properties distinct from those of the corresponding anion exchange activities. In marked contrast, Cl-/oxalate exchange by mouse slc26a6/CFEX was clearly electrogenic, whereas that mediated by human SLC26A6 appeared electroneutral. Two unusual human variant SLC26A6 polypeptides previously reported to be functional (25Lohi H. Lamprecht G. Markovich D. Heil A. Kujala M. Seidler U. Kere J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C769-C779Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were nonfunctional as anion transporters. These data emphasize the complexity of SLC26A6-mediated anion exchange. They suggest an experimental path toward definition of amino acid residues important for Cl- binding and/or translocation, provide an unusual example of a single polypeptide able to exchange different substrates with either electroneutral or electrogenic mechanisms, and suggest reexamination of current hypotheses of epithelial HCO3− secretion.

Human SLC26A6 L-Q was obtained in pCMV-SPORT6 from the Mammalian Genome Collection (MGC_21068, IMAGE:4398446, BC017697) and was resequenced in entirety. In Fig. 1, Gln632 (Q632) is numbered as in the long N-terminal (L) sequence. The corresponding short N-terminal (S) position is Gln611 (Q611). The codon encoding this Gln can be retained (L+Q, S+Q) or excluded (L-Q, S-Q) from the 5′-end of its exon by elective utilization of an alternate 3′ splice-acceptor splice site (3Xie Q. Welch R.

Mutagenized PCR products were ligated into appropriately engineered host plasmids to reconstruct the desired open reading frame, and recombination was confirmed by diagnostic restriction digestion.

https://openalex.org/W2063224834,"Membrane fusion and fission are antagonistic reactions controlled by different proteins. Dynamins promote membrane fission by GTP-driven changes of conformation and polymerization state, while SNAREs fuse membranes by forming complexes between t- and v-SNAREs from apposed vesicles. Here, we describe a role of the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1p in fusion of yeast vacuoles. Vps1p forms polymers that couple several t-SNAREs together. At the onset of fusion, the SNARE-activating ATPase Sec18p/NSF and the t-SNARE depolymerize Vps1p and release it from the membrane. This activity is independent of the SNARE coactivator Sec17p/α-SNAP and of the v-SNARE. Vps1p release liberates the t-SNAREs for initiating fusion and at the same time disrupts fission activity. We propose that reciprocal control between fusion and fission components exists, which may prevent futile cycles of fission and fusion."

The ABC transporter family is currently divided into seven classes (A–G) with the A and C classes containing the largest number of members (12 each). A and C class transporters are full transporters that contain two ATP-binding cassettes and two multiple-membrane-spanning domains encoded by a single cistron. The A class of transporters shares considerable sequence homology that we and others have shown leads to a topological configuration in which the two largest loops of the protein are positioned on the exoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (2Fitzgerald M.L.

Recently, children suffering from neonatal respiratory failure and defective pulmonary surfactant secretion were found to have genetic mutations mapping to the ABCA3 gene locus (15Shulenin S. Nogee L.M. Annilo T. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Thus, based on sequence homology and functional activity, it seems likely that all of the ABCA class transporters will play a role in lipid trafficking in one or more tissues. Of the 12 A class members, ABCA7 and ABCA1 are among the most closely related, sharing 50% sequence identity. Recent studies in transfected cell lines have indicated that ABCA7 also shares the functional attributes of ABCA1 of phospholipid and cholesterol transport in response to stimulation with apoA-I, although the magnitude of the sterol transport activity is disputed (16Wang N. Lan D. Gerbod-Giannone M. Linsel-Nitschke P. Jehle A.W. Chen W. Martinez L.O. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Like ABCA1, ABCA7 is widely expressed in vertebrate tissues with the highest levels reported in brain, lung, macrophages, and platelets (16Wang N. Lan D. Gerbod-Giannone M. Linsel-Nitschke P. Jehle A.W. Chen W. Martinez L.O. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42906-42912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Sasaki M. Shoji A. Kubo Y. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Liver expression of ABCA7, however, does not mimic that seen with ABCA1. Because the loss of ABCA1 alone in mice or humans leads to a dramatic decline in circulating HDL levels and a near absence of apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux, it is clear that the activity of ABCA7 cannot compensate for the loss of ABCA1. Thus, the significance of the lipid efflux measured in ABCA7-transfected cells is uncertain, and the physiologic role of the transporter is unknown. To explore this function, we generated Abca7-/- null mice and performed an initial characterization of their phenotype. From intercrosses of heterozygous Abca7+/- mice, homozygous null animals were born at the expected one in four frequency. In controlled feeding studies, these mice fed normally and gained weight in a manner indistinguishable from their wild type littermates. However, female Abca7-/- mice had lower white adipose mass than their wild type littermates and lower total serum and HDL cholesterol levels. These serum lipid differences were much less profound than those seen in comparisons of wild type and Abca1-/- mice. We also found no disruption in macrophage efflux of phosphatidylcholine or cholesterol efflux to apoA-I, as might have been predicted from the published ABCA7 cell transfection experiments. These results indicate that ABCA7 does not recapitulate ABCA1 function but rather has distinct activities that will require further investigation of wild type and null mice to elucidate. Generation of Abca7 Null Mice—129/SvEv mouse genomic DNA was PCR-amplified using primers pairs (5′-GGCGCGCCGTGTGGAATTCCAGCCTAAG-3′, 5′-GCGGCCGCAGCAGGTTGGTCTGACACTGC-3′ and (5′-GGCCGGCCACTCATAGCAACAGAACTCAAGAGC-3′ 5′-CCTGCAGGGAGACTGGAGTTACAGGTTATGAGC-3′) to generate 5.2- and 4.6-kb fragments that encompassed exons 9–19 and 22–33 of Abca7. Using introduced restriction sites (AscI, NotI and FseI, SseI, respectively), the 5.2 and- 4.6-kilobase pair products were cloned into the KO3 targeting vector (19Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Ingalls R.R. Monks B.G. Li R. Arnaout M.A. Golenbock D.T. Freeman M.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The resulting targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into J1 embryonic stem cells derived from 129/SvEv mice. After selecting against nonhomologous recombinants, 180 G418/gancyclovir-resistant clones were selected and expanded. Genomic DNA from these clones was restricted with SpeI/DraI, separated on 0.7% agarose gels, and transferred to hybridization membranes (Gene Screen Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were probed with a radiolabeled cDNA fragment encompassing exons 3–8 of the ABCA7 cDNA (nucleotides 217–815). This probe detects an 11.2-kb fragment in the endogenous Abca7 allele and an 8.0-kb fragment in the targeted allele. Correctly targeted embryonic stem cells were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice that were back-crossed into the C57BL/6 strain to obtain heterozygous Abca7+/- null mice. These animals were then intercrossed to produce Abca7-/- mice, as well as wild type littermates. Animal Procedures and Lipid Analysis—C57BL/6 and 129/Sv mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All of the animal procedures were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care and were conducted in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service Policy for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions on a standard 12-h light/dark cycle and were given free access to a standard chow diet and water. For feeding and weight gain measurements, after weaning mice at 4 weeks of age, the mice were housed singly and monitored for food intake and weight gain every 3 days. At 10 weeks of age, the mice were fasted overnight and anesthetized, and blood samples were drawn by the retro-orbital method using nonheparinized microcapillary tubes. Serum was collected from the clotted blood after spinning at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Total cholesterol (Thermo Electron) and triglycerides (Sigma) were determined by enzymatic assays following the protocols of the manufacturer. Sera, pooled by genotype and gender, were fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superose-6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Cholesterol, apoA-I, and apoE content were determined in the fractions. Levels of free fatty acids in the serum (100 μl) of individual animals were determined by esterification; samples were mixed with methanol: methylene chloride and acetyl chloride, incubated for 1 h at 75 °C, and cooled, and then 7% potassium carbonate was added. Lipids were extracted with hexane, washed with acetonitrile, and injected (splitless) into an Agilent 6890 gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (G2613A system; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a Supelcowax-10 column (30-m × 0.25-mm × 0.25-μm film; Supelco, Bellafonte, PA). The temperature program for the gas chromatography oven was as follows: initial temperature was 150 °C for 2 min, increased to 200 °C (10 °C/min), held at 200 °C for 4 min, increased to 240 °C (5 °C/min), held at 240 °C for 3 min, and finally increased to 270 °C (10 °C/min) and held at 270 °C for 5 min. A model 5973N mass-selective detector (Agilent Technologies) in scan mode and coupled with Enhanced Chemstation G1701CA version C software was used to identify the generated mass spectra by comparison with a spectral library created from known fatty acids. The amount of each fatty acid species was quantified relative to an internal standard of heptadecanoic acid (17:0) added to the samples before extraction. Cell Culture—Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared from wild type and Abca7-/- mice as described previously (20Bjorkbacka H. Kunjathoor V.V. Moore K.J. Koehn S. Ordija C.M. Lee M.A. Means T. Halmen K. Luster A.D. Golenbock D.T. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Femurs were flushed with cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and bone marrow was collected by centrifugation at 2200 rpm. Red blood cells were lysed with 0.17 m NH4Cl, and bone marrow was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 15% L929-conditioned medium. After 24 h, the nonadherent cells were collected and cultured for an additional 6 days to obtain mature macrophages. 3T3-L1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere (37 °C). At 80% confluency, the cells were differentiated by the addition of 1 mm dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylmethylxanthine to the media for 8 days before harvest of cells (21Richon V.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee Jr., R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10117-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For fractionation, the adipocytes were homogenized by treating with a Dounce apparatus in sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) including protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Three fractions (fat cake, supernatant, and pellet) were separated. Protein from fat cake was acquired by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid after delipidation overnight at 4 °C with cold acetone. An equivalent amount of protein, as determined by BCA assays, was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. ABCA7 cDNA and Antibody—The mouse ABCA7 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from a macrophage cDNA library, and its sequence was verified on both strands by dideoxy sequencing. The ABCA7 and ABCA1 cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. An anti-ABCA7 antiserum was raised against the C-terminal 128 amino acids of mouse ABCA7 as we described previously for ABCA1 (2Fitzgerald M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The specificity of the sera obtained was confirmed by immunoblotting of lysates from 293 cells transfected with either ABCA7 or ABCA1 cDNAs using either ABCA7 antiserum (1:500 dil) or preimmune control serum (1:500). For immunoblotting, monolayer cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The total cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) were electrophoresed on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 1× PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 1% bovine serum albumin and were probed with the anti-ABCA7 or anti-ABCA1 antiserum diluted 1:500 at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were washed in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) for 2 h. Western immunoblotting signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence Super Signal (Pierce) and x-ray films. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed using the Discovery System (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the mouse brain was harvested following perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde, and paraffin-embedded tissue slides were prepared. To generate the probes, a fragment of Abca7 cDNA (214–815 bp) was cloned into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene). Sense and antisense riboprobes were generated using digoxigenin-labeled UTP. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 6 h, and the slides were washed in 0.1× SSC at 75 °C for 6 min. The hybridized probe was detected with biotinylated anti-digoxigenin antibody, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and the substrate nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The slides were counterstained with nuclear Fast Red. Cholesterol and Phospholipid Efflux Assays—Studies of cholesterol and phospholipid efflux were performed in bone marrow-derived macrophages or 293 and 293-EBNA T cells transfected with ABCA7 or ABCA1 cDNAs as we have described previously (22Fitzgerald M.L. Okuhira K.I. Short G.F. II I Manning J.J. Bell S.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48477-48485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, cells in 24-well plates were loaded with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol or 1 μCi/ml [3H]methyl-choline for 24 h, washed twice with warm PBS, incubated for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin), and then washed twice with warm PBS. The cells were then incubated with apoA-I (10 μg/ml), HDL (7.5 μg/ml), or medium alone for 20 h. Medium was collected and cleared of cellular debris by 800 × g spin for 10 min. For cholesterol efflux, the cell layers were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, and the amount of radioactivity in the media and cell lysates were measured by scintillation counting. For phosphatidylcholine efflux, the media and cell layers were subjected to hexane/isopropanol (3:2 v/v) extraction, and the radioactivity in the organic phase was determined by scintillation counting as described previously and expressed as a percentage of efflux (media cpm/(media + cell cpm) × 100) (23Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To load cells with excess cholesterol and activate the LXR/RXR transcriptional network, cholesterol (10 μg/ml), 22-R-hydroxycholesterol (10 μm), and 9-cis-retinoic acid (10 μm) were added to the cells at the beginning of the labeling step. For comparison of ABCA7 and ABCA1 phospholipid efflux, the data were normalized to cell surface expression using a 9-amino acid FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) introduced after amino acid position 155 of the mouse ABCA7 cDNA or 207 of ABCA1, as we have described previously (22Fitzgerald M.L. Okuhira K.I. Short G.F. II I Manning J.J. Bell S.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48477-48485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Comparison of wild type and FLAG-ABCA7 transporters demonstrated that this tag had no measurable impact on protein expression and phospholipid efflux. Generation of ABCA7-/- Mice—The targeting strategy to produce mice lacking ABCA7 is shown in Fig. 1A. Exons 20 and 21 were targeted for deletion because they encode the signature and Walker B motifs of the first ATP-binding domain, elements that are known to be critical for ABCA1 function. The splicing of exons 19–22 would be predicted to cause a frame shift mutation, leading to a stop codon encoded by nucleotides 9–11 of exon 22. The targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into 129/SvEv embryonic stem cells. After positive and negative antibiotic selections, 180 clones were selected and screened for homologous recombination at the Abca7 locus. Nine clones were confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis to be correctly targeted, giving a targeting efficiency of 5%. Embryonic stem cells from two clones were expanded and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, resulting in chimeric mice that transmitted the targeted allele (Fig. 1, B and C). Mating of heterozygous offspring of the chimeric mice produced Mendelian frequencies of the three expected genotypes (wild type:heterozygous:null, 60:102:55).Fig. 1Targeting strategy and generation of Abca7-/- mice. A, exons 20 and 21 were deleted by homologous recombination in 129/SvEv embryonal stem cells using a targeting vector that contained sequences homologous to exons 9–19 and 22–33. B, homologous recombination generates a unique 8.0-kb SpeI/DraI fragment that can be distinguished from the 11.2-kb wild type (wt) fragment by Southern blot. C, correct targeting was also determined by multiplex PCR analysis using primers that distinguish the targeted and wild type alleles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ABCA7 Expression and Regulation—To confirm that homologous recombination had disrupted ABCA7 protein expression, immunoblots of tissue lysates were performed with an ABCA7 antiserum that we generated. The specificity of this ABCA7 antiserum was first validated, given the sequence similarity of the ABCA1 and ABCA7 transporters. This antiserum bound ABCA7 but did not cross-react with ABCA1 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the antiserum we previously raised to ABCA1 did not recognize ABCA7 expressed by transfected 293 cells (Fig. 2A). By Western blotting, we confirmed that the deletion of exons 20 and 21 had indeed abrogated ABCA7 protein expression in mice homozygous for the targeted allele (Fig. 2B). ABCA1 levels, as detected by immunoblotting, did not appear to be altered in the Abca7-/- null mouse, suggesting that there is no compensation by ABCA1 for the loss of the activity of ABCA7 (Fig. 2B). As we observed the highest level of ABCA7 tissue expression in the brain, we further characterized its localization in that tissue. Using in situ hybridization analysis, strong neuronal staining was evident throughout the brain using an antisense probe, whereas the sense probe from the same construct yielded no signal. Staining is particularly evident in the densely packed neurons of the hippocampus (Fig. 2C). A second site of robust ABCA7 expression was the white adipose tissue. We assessed whether ABCA7 expression was up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation using a 3T3L1 adipocyte differentiation model. Upon differentiation of 3T3L1 preadipocytes to mature adipocyte-like cells, ABCA7 expression was greatly increased, suggesting that this protein may play a role in lipid transport in these cells (Fig. 2D). Subcellular fractionation showed that the ABCA7 transporter colocalized in part with perilipin in the lipid droplet and microsomal fractions, a distribution clearly distinct from that of ABCA1 (Fig. 2D). Feeding Behavior and Weight Gain Analysis of Abca7 Null Mice—Having established that we had generated mice lacking ABCA7 expression and produced evidence for its potential involvement in fat metabolism, we next examined the impact of the loss of the transporter on parameters of growth and metabolism. In these studies, littermate, gender-matched wild type and null mice were compared. Abca7-/- mice fed and gained weight similarly to their wild type counterpart (Fig. 3). At 10 weeks of age, internal organs were found to be of similar weights in both groups (Table I), with the exception of female white adipose tissue and male kidneys, both of which were found to be smaller in Abca7-/- mice. Although the differences in kidney size were quite modest (< 10%), the adipose mass of the Abca7-/- female mice was approximately half that of the wild type females. Despite the reduction in size of both of these tissues, histologic examination failed to reveal any overt pathology (data not shown).Table IWeights of wild type and Abca7-/- mice and major organs at 10 weeks of age The body and tissue weights are in grams ± S.D.FemaleMaleWild type (n = 13)Null (n =13)t testWild type (n = 11)Null (n = 11)t testTotal body20.65 ± 1.9319.91 ± 2.010.3327.11 ± 2.9826.66 ± 3.370.75Brain0.47 ± 0.060.43 ± 0.070.140.42 ± 0.040.40 ± 3.370.61Lung0.18 ± 0.050.16 ± 0.040.290.17 ± 0.060.15 ± 0.040.37White adipose0.47 ± 0.270.28 ± 0.180.040.52 ± 0.230.54 ± 0.040.86Heart0.11 ± 0.030.11 ± 0.010.480.15 ± 0.020.15 ± 0.030.67Liver0.84 ± 0.140.82 ± 0.080.591.04 ± 0.391.07 ± 0.150.83Kidney0.28 ± 0.030.29 ± 0.030.390.40 ± 0.040.36 ± 0.150.03Spleen0.07 ± 0.020.06 ± 0.020.470.08 ± 0.030.08 ± 0.150.54 Open table in a new tab Quantification of Serum and Tissue Lipids in Abca7 Null Mice—We next tested whether the loss of ABCA7 expression significantly affected serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acid levels. Total triglycerides were similar in wild type and Abca7-/- mice of both genders; however, total cholesterol was significantly lower in female Abca7-/- mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Serum was fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography, and the cholesterol was measured in each fraction to determine the source of the cholesterol difference in the Abca7-/- females. The reduction in total cholesterol levels could be accounted for by a drop in the cholesterol carried in the HDL peak (Fig. 4C). Male wild type and Abca7-/- mice, whose total cholesterol levels were similar, had similar cholesterol levels across the lipoprotein fractions, as expected (Fig. 4D). Immunoblotting of the lipoprotein fractions from females showed that despite a drop in cholesterol content, apoA-I and ApoE protein levels were similar in the fractions from wild type and Abca7-/- mice (Fig. 4, E and F), indicating that no major redistribution of these apoproteins had occurred in the serum lipoproteins. Having found significant ABCA7 expression in white adipose tissue, we also measured the serum levels of free fatty acids by gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry to determine whether they were altered by the absence of the transporter. In both genders, the levels and distribution of serum-free fatty acids did not appear to be altered in Abca7-/- mice (Fig. 5). ABCA7-/- Macrophage Efflux of Lipid to ApoA-I and HDL Is Normal—The decline in HDL cholesterol in females, coupled with data from previous studies on ABCA7 activity in transfected cells, suggested that apolipoprotein or HDL stimulated cholesterol efflux might be impaired in Abca7-/- macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we isolated bone marrow macrophages from wild type mice and verified that ABCA7 was expressed in these cells under our conditions of isolation and proliferation (Fig. 6A). Stimulation of these cells with cholesterol loading and LXR/RXR agonist treatment markedly up-regulated ABCA1, as expected, but had little or no impact on ABCA7 expression (Fig. 6A). ApoA-I d"

We have reported that in macrophages, H. pylori up-regulates inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and antimicrobial NO production, but in parallel there is induction of arginase II, generating ornithine, and of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), generating polyamines. Spermine, in particular, has been shown to restrain immune response in activated macrophages by inhibiting proinflammatory gene expression. We hypothesized that spermine could prevent the antimicrobial effects of NO by inhibiting iNOS in macrophages activated by H. pylori. Spermine did not affect the up-regulation of iNOS mRNA levels but in a concentration-dependent manner significantly attenuated iNOS protein levels and NO production. Reduction in iNOS protein was due to inhibition of iNOS translation and not due to iNOS degradation. ODC knockdown with small interfering (si) RNA resulted in increased H. pylori-stimulated iNOS protein expression and NO production without altering iNOS mRNA levels. When macrophages were cocultured with H. pylori, killing of bacteria was enhanced by transfection of ODC siRNA and prevented by addition of spermine. These results identify a mechanism of immune dysregulation induced by H. pylori in which stimulated spermine synthesis by the arginase-ODC pathway inhibits iNOS translation and NO production, leading to persistence of the bacterium and risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.

H. pylori is considered a noninvasive pathogen, but it can disrupt epithelial integrity, and its antigens are present in the lamina propria (3Mai U.E. Perez-Perez G.I. Allen J.B. Wahl S.M.

H. pylori can induce iNOS and other innate immune response genes in macrophages even when separated by filter supports or when water extracts are used (6Gobert A.P. Mersey B.D. Cheng Y. Blumberg D.R.

Production of NO by macrophages can be limited by H. pylori arginase that competes with iNOS for the same substrate, l-arginine (7Gobert A.P. McGee D.J. Akhtar M. Mendz G.L. Newton J.C. Cheng Y.

However, this effect is overwhelmed by increased substrate (7Gobert A.P. McGee D.J. Akhtar M. Mendz G.L. Newton J.C. Cheng Y. Mobley H.L. Wilson K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

H. pylori induces both arginase II and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in macrophages (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J.

Arginase converts l-arginine to l-ornithine, which is metabolized by ODC to produce the polyamine putrescine that is converted to the polyamines spermidine and spermine. Spermine has been shown to inhibit the immune effector function of monocytes and macrophages in response to LPS (11Zhang M. Caragine T. Wang H. Cohen P.S. Botchkina G. Soda K. Bianchi M. Ulrich P.

We now report that spermine inhibits H. pylori-stimulated NO production in macrophages by a post-transcriptional effect on iNOS translation. Our studies are the first to show a bacterial survival strategy in which the effectiveness of the host innate immune response is attenuated by inhibition of iNOS due to spermine synthesis. Reagents—Reagents for cell culture, RNA extraction, and RT-PCR were obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Bacteria, Cells, and Culture Conditions—H. pylori SS1 was grown and used as described (4Wilson K.T. Ramanujam K.S. Mobley H.L.T. Musselman R.F. James S.P. Meltzer S.J.

For bactericidal studies, H. pylori were separated from macrophages by filter supports (0.4-μm pore size; Transwell; Corning Inc.), and colony-forming units determined by serial dilution and culture (7Gobert A.P. McGee D.J. Akhtar M. Mendz G.L. Newton J.C. Cheng Y. Mobley H.L. Wilson K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13844-13849Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was maintained in complete DMEM (13Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol.

For coculture experiments, RAW 264.7 cells were plated in medium without antibiotics for 1 h prior to addition of H. pylori. Experiments were also conducted with peritoneal macrophages isolated from male C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Cells were harvested 5 days after intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml Bio-Gel P-100 polyacrylamide beads (14Fauve R.M. Jusforgues H. Hevin B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 64: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Measurement of NO—Concentration of the oxidized metabolite of NO, nitrite (NO2−), was assessed by the Griess reaction (4Wilson K.T. Ramanujam K.S. Mobley H.L.T. Musselman R.F. James S.P. Meltzer S.J.

After 6-h stimulation, total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR for iNOS performed exactly as described (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C.

Immunoblotting Analysis for iNOS, ODC—After coculture with H. pylori, RAW 264.7 macrophages were lysed and 100 μg of protein/lane separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked overnight at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk. iNOS (130 kDa), ODC (53 kDa), and β-actin (42 kDa) proteins were detected with a rabbit polyclonal iNOS Ab (1/1000; Pharmingen), a goat polyclonal ODC Ab (1/1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and a mouse polyclonal β-actin Ab (1/5000; Sigma), respectively. Chemiluminescent detection was performed as described (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 6002-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Analysis for iNOS—After 18-h coculture of RAW 264.7 macrophages with or without H. pylori, and in the presence or absence of spermine, cells were washed and placed in methionine-depleted medium for 2 h in the presence or absence of spermine. Then, [35S]methionine (0.2 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) was added for 4 h and cells lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors. For pulse-chase analysis, RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated and proteins labeled with [35S]methionine. Spermine (12.5 μm) was added and cells harvested and lysed as above. For immunoprecipitation, equivalent counts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable [35S]methionine-labeled proteins (2 × 108 cpm) were incubated overnight with monoclonal iNOS Ab (Pharmingen) and protein G-Sepharose (Calbiochem). After the immunoprecipitated complexes were washed, pellets were dissolved in gel-loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and imaged using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840 Phosphor Screen, Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfection of ODC siRNA in Macrophages—Four siRNA duplexes targeting ODC were designed and synthesized by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). These were tested for knockdown of ODC. The most effective siRNA duplex targeted nucleotides 1980–1998 (sense, 5′-CUCAUGAAACAGAUCCAGA-3′; antisense, 5′-UCUGGAUCUGUUUCAUGAG-3′). Scrambled control siRNA that had no sequence homology to any known genes was used as a control. Conditions for transfection and activation were exactly as described (13Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M.

Measurement of ODC Activity and Polyamines—Cells were lysed and ODC activity was determined by a radiometric analysis of 14CO2 liberated from l -[14C]ornithine as described (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4692-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M.

Polyamine levels were determined by precolumn dansylation reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography as reported previously (15Casero Jr., R.A. Ervin S.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 639-643PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Quantitative data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made by using analysis of variance with the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test. Spermine Inhibits NO Production from H. pylori-stimulated Macrophages by Inhibiting iNOS Protein Translation—Since we have reported that NO production, measured as NO2−, peaks at 24 h after H. pylori stimulation (4Wilson K.T. Ramanujam K.S. Mobley H.L.T. Musselman R.F. James S.P. Meltzer S.J. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1524-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4692-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of spermine on NO2− levels at that time point. As shown in Fig. 1A, addition of spermine resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of NO2− production in RAW 264.7 cells (left panel) and Bio-Gel-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages (right panel). These data show an IC50 for spermine of 9.2 μm in RAW 264.7 cells and 9.0 μm in peritoneal macrophages. We then determined the effect of spermine on iNOS in RAW 264.7 cells. Because H. pylori-stimulated iNOS mRNA expression peaks at 6 h (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4692-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of spermine at that time point. Addition of spermine (5–100 μm) did not inhibit H. pylori-stimulated iNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). By Western blot analysis, spermine inhibited iNOS protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C) that paralleled the decrease in NO levels. This effect was not attributable to toxicity of spermine or its serum-mediated oxidation, since we measured cell viability by XTT assay and found that at a spermine concentration of 25 μm where cells had maximal inhibition of iNOS protein, there was still 90% viability in the presence of H. pylori. Additionally, incorporation of [35S]methionine into total protein was unaffected by spermine, indicating that the effect on iNOS translation was specific. Because we identified that spermine was inhibiting iNOS via an effect on iNOS protein, we directly tested the effect of spermine on de novo iNOS protein synthesis. H. pylori stimulated translation of iNOS that was significantly attenuated by spermine (Fig. 1E). We then conducted pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1F) to determine whether spermine affected iNOS protein stability; addition of spermine to cells after 24-h stimulation with H. pylori did not inhibit levels of immunoprecipitated iNOS protein. Taken together, these results indicate that the inhibition of iNOS protein expression by spermine occurs at the level of protein translation and not by an effect on stability. To confirm this conclusion, we stimulated cells with H. pylori for 24 h, washed the cells to remove bacteria, and incubated them for an additional 24 h in the presence of spermine. Both NO2− and iNOS protein levels were identical in the presence and absence of spermine, indicating that spermine had no effect on preformed iNOS (data not shown). We also assessed the effect of the two other biogenic polyamines on H. pylori-stimulated NO production and iNOS protein levels. Putrescine had no inhibitory effect, while spermidine had a modest effect that was less marked than spermine. At 12.5 μm, spermidine inhibited NO2− levels by 36.0 ± 2.6% versus 74.1 ± 7.6% for spermine (p < 0.01). A similar difference was detected by Western blotting (data not shown). Specific Knockdown of ODC by siRNA Increases H. pylori-stimulated iNOS Protein Expression and NO Production—We have reported that H. pylori induces ODC expression and activity (13Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40161-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We therefore transfected cells with an siRNA duplex specific for ODC or scrambled control siRNA. Transfection of ODC siRNA caused a significant reduction in H. pylori-stimulated ODC activity (Fig. 2A) and spermine levels (Fig. 2B) that resulted in a significant potentiation of NO production (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D) demonstrated that in H. pylori-stimulated macrophages, transfection of ODC siRNA resulted in a significant knockdown of ODC protein expression and a concomitant marked increase in iNOS protein levels. Consistent with the data in Fig. 1, ODC siRNA had no effect on H. pylori-stimulated iNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 2E). Spermine Prevents Killing of H. pylori by Macrophages— Since we have reported that H. pylori are killed by macrophages by an NO-dependent mechanism (7Gobert A.P. McGee D.J. Akhtar M. Mendz G.L. Newton J.C. Cheng Y. Mobley H.L. Wilson K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13844-13849Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), we determined whether inhibition of H. pylori-stimulated macrophage iNOS expression and NO production by spermine impairs host defense against H. pylori. When H. pylori were cocultured in complete DMEM with macrophages for 24 h, there was a 3-log order killing of H. pylori compared with bacteria cultured in medium alone (Fig. 3A). Addition of spermine to cocultures prevented this killing. Spermine added to H. pylori alone in the absence of macrophages had no effect on H. pylori levels. There was an inverse correlation between bacterial concentration and NO production, such that killing was associated with increased NO2− levels and spermine rescue with loss of NO generation (Fig. 3B). When macrophages were transfected with ODC siRNA and cocultured with H. pylori, there was a significant enhancement of bacterial killing compared with scrambled siRNA control (Fig. 3C). There was again a clear correlation between killing and NO levels generated in these cells (Fig. 3D). We demonstrated that spermine inhibits H. pylori-stimulated NO production by inhibition of iNOS protein translation. Production of polyamines by ODC in H. pylori-stimulated macrophages acts to down-regulate iNOS, since knockdown of ODC by RNA interference resulted in increased iNOS protein expression and NO production. We have shown in macrophages that putrescine synthesis is not induced by H. pylori, while spermidine and spermine are increased (13Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40161-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since addition of spermine had a greater inhibitory effect on iNOS than spermidine, it is most likely that the main effect of the ODC siRNA on iNOS is due to inhibition of spermine generation. Consistent with this, addition of spermine (25 μm) to macrophages transfected with ODC siRNA (data not shown), or prevention of spermine catabolism, discussed below, potently inhibited NO generation. Spermine has been reported to inhibit NO production in LPS-stimulated J774 macrophages (12Szabo C. Southan G.J. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Szabo C. Southan G.J. Wood E. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, in these studies, the effect on iNOS itself was not studied. Also in this model NO production and inhibition with spermine depended on the presence of serum. In our model, H. pylori stimulates iNOS by an LPS-independent mechanism (4Wilson K.T. Ramanujam K.S. Mobley H.L.T. Musselman R.F. James S.P. Meltzer S.J. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1524-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When we replaced serum with bovine serum albumin, there was no loss of H. pylori stimulated NO production, and the inhibitory effect of spermine was maintained (data not shown). Polyamine oxidation can occur by acetylation of spermine or spermidine by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase prior to back-conversion by acetyl polyamine oxidase (17Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 810-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Casero Jr., R.A. Wang Y. Stewart T.M. Devereux W. Hacker A. Smith R. Woster P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 361-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by direct conversion of spermine to spermidine by polyamine oxidase 1 (PAO1), also called spermine oxidase (19Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that H. pylori up-regulates expression and activity of PAO1 in macrophages, which acts to regulate intracellular spermine levels in activated cells (13Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40161-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Inhibition of polyamine oxidation with MDL 72527 resulted in a significant inhibition of H. pylori stimulated NO production and enhanced the inhibitory effect of spermine (data not shown). Similarly, we have found that in macrophages stimulated with H. pylori, cells transfected with PAO1 siRNA that prevents spermine metabolism have a marked inhibition of NO production, and conversely, transfection with PAO1 cDNA that causes spermine oxidation to spermidine results in potentiation of NO levels. 2R. Chaturvedi, F. I. Bussière, M. Asim, Y. Cheng, H. Xu, R. A. Casero, Jr., and K. T. Wilson, manuscript in preparation. These findings indicate that it is spermine itself and not an oxidized product or spermidine that inhibits iNOS. Knockdown of ODC could lead to increased iNOS and NO levels by shunting of l-arginine substrate away from the arginase-ODC pathway and back toward iNOS, since increased l-arginine availability has been reported to increase iNOS translation (21Lee J. Ryu H. Ferrante R.J. Morris Jr., S.M. Ratan R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4843-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22El-Gayar S. Thuring-Nahler H. Pfeilschifter J. Rollinghoff M. Bogdan C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4561-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, since spermine has a negative feedback effect on ODC (23Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), if this were true, addition of spermine or prevention of spermine degradation would be expected to increase iNOS, whereas we have observed the opposite effect. We used RNA interference to inhibit ODC, because α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), the pharmacologic inhibitor of ODC can increase spermine levels, which has been attributed to increasing S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (24Shirahata A. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9583-9588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have observed that in H. pylori-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, DFMO inhibited putrescine and spermidine generation and increased spermine levels; in parallel there was inhibition of iNOS protein expression and NO production (data not shown). While there is a report of DFMO increasing iNOS protein and NO levels in LPS-stimulated J774.2 macrophages (25Baydoun A.R. Morgan D.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but the effect only occurred when cells were pretreated for at least 24 h with DFMO, and the same group also reported inhibition of iNOS when DFMO was used concurrently with LPS stimulation (26Morgan D.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 389SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The increase in iNOS and NO levels with ODC siRNA could be due to rescue of macrophages from apoptosis. We reported that inhibition of ODC (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J.

However, we have strong evidence that changes in iNOS and NO levels occur independently of effects on apoptosis in H. pylori-stimulated cells: 1) inhibition of PAO1 by siRNA or MDL 72527 reduces apoptosis (13Chaturvedi R.

Moreover, our Western blot analysis in Fig. 2 utilized equal amounts of protein loaded per lane that was verified by blotting for β-actin, indicating that the increase in iNOS protein levels cannot be explained simply by more cells contributing to the amount of iNOS. Similar to our results, spermine has been shown to inhibit TNF-α and MIP-1α generation in monocytes by a post-transcriptional effect that was independent of the presence of serum or an oxidized product (11Zhang M. Caragine T. Wang H. Cohen P.S. Botchkina G. Soda K. Bianchi M. Ulrich P. Cerami A. Sherry B. Tracey K.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). While spermine is known to inhibit the translation of its own biosynthetic enzymes (23Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we are the first to report that spermine regulates protein translation of an important immune response gene, namely iNOS. Although iNOS is a transcriptionally regulated gene (27MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar), evidence of translational control has emerged, such that reduction of l-arginine availability by arginase (21Lee J. Ryu H.

We have found that spermine inhibits H. pylori-induced l-arginine uptake, 2R. Chaturvedi, F. I. Bussière, M. Asim, Y. Cheng, H. Xu, R. A. Casero, Jr., and K. T. Wilson, manuscript in preparation. but spermine may have direct effects on iNOS translation because arginase inhibitors did not result in increased NO production in H. pylori stimulated macrophages in DMEM with serum (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4692-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We show that H. pylori are killed by macrophages separated from the bacteria by a filter, mimicking the situation in vivo, and that NO levels (measured as NO2−) are inversely correlated with bacterial levels, consistent with our previous report that iNOS–/– macrophages failed to kill H. pylori (7Gobert A.P.

When combined with our studies implicating spermine and its oxidation product, H2O2, in apoptosis (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2055684459,"Here we describe the initial functional characterization of a cyclic nucleotide regulated ion channel from the bacterium Mesorhizobium loti and present two structures of its cyclic nucleotide binding domain, with and without cAMP. The domains are organized as dimers with the interface formed by the linker regions that connect the nucleotide binding pocket to the pore domain. Together, structural and functional data suggest the domains form two dimers on the cytoplasmic face of the channel. We propose a model for gating in which ligand binding alters the structural relationship within a dimer, directly affecting the position of the adjacent transmembrane helices."
https://openalex.org/W2131238747,"Cough is a common and protective reflex, but persistent coughing is debilitating and impairs quality of life. Antitussive treatment using opioids is limited by unacceptable side effects, and there is a great need for more effective remedies. The present study demonstrates that theobromine, a methylxanthine derivative present in cocoa, effectively inhibits citric acid-induced cough in guinea-pigs in vivo. Furthermore, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in man, theobromine suppresses capsaicin-induced cough with no adverse effects. We also demonstrate that theobromine directly inhibits capsaicin-induced sensory nerve depolarization of guinea-pig and human vagus nerve suggestive of an inhibitory effect on afferent nerve activation. These data indicate the actions of theobromine appear to be peripherally mediated. We conclude theobromine is a novel and promising treatment, which may form the basis for a new class of antitussive drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1970766736,"The subunit compositions of two types of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complexes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, NDH-1L and NDH-1M, were studied by two-dimensional blue-native/SDS-PAGE followed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Fifteen proteins were observed in NDH-1L including hydrophilic subunits (NdhH, -K, -I, -J, -M, and -N) and hydrophobic subunits (NdhA, -B, -E, -G, -D1, and -F1). In addition, NdhL and a novel subunit, Ssl1690 (designated NdhO), were shown to be components of this complex. All subunits mentioned above were present in the NDH-1M complex except NdhD1 and NdhF1.

Diagnostic sequence motifs were found for both NdhL and NdhO homologous proteins. Analysis of ndhL deletion mutant (M9) revealed the presence of assembled NDH-1L and NDH-1M complexes, but these complexes appear to be functionally impaired in the absence of NdhL.

The proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone linked with proton translocation across the membrane (1Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Subunit composition of the enzyme varies among organisms. In complex I originating from mammalian mitochondria, 45 different proteins were discovered (2Smeitink J. Sengers S. van den Trijbels F. Heuvel L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembranes. 2001; 33: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Carrol J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the corresponding complex NDH-1 consists of 14 different polypeptides. Homologues of these 14 proteins are found among subunits of the mitochondrial complex I, and therefore bacterial NDH-1 might be considered as a model proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase with a minimal set of subunits (4Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli NDH-1 readily disintegrates into 3 subcomplexes: a water-soluble NADH dehydrogenase fragment (NuoE, -F, and -G), the connecting fragment (NuoB, -C, -D, and -I), and the membrane fragment (NuoA, -H, -J, -K, -L, -M, -N) (5Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria and their descendents, chloroplasts of green plants, the subunit composition of NDH-1 remains obscure. The genes for eleven subunits NdhA-NdhK, homologous to the NuoA-NuoD and NuoH-NuoN of the E. coli complex, have been found in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803) (9Ohkawa H. Pakrasi H.B. Ogawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 182: 31630-31634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Further, Synechocystis 6803 has a family of 6 ndhD genes and a family of 3 ndhF genes. It was proposed (7Ohkawa H. Sonoda M. Katoh H. Ogawa T. Canad. J. Botany. 1998; 76: 1035-1042Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Klughammer B. Sültemeyer D. Badger M.R. Price G.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that multiple forms of NDH-1, which vary in NdhD/NdhF composition, exist in cyanobacteria. Genetic approach suggests that NDH-1 containing NdhF1 together with either NdhD1 or NdhD2 is involved in cyclic electron flow passing electrons from PSI back to the plastoquinone pool whereas the enzymes containing NdhF3/NdhD3 or NdhF4/NdhD4 play important roles in CO2 uptake (9Ohkawa H. Pakrasi H.B. Ogawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 182: 31630-31634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Shibata M. Ohkawa H. Kaneko T. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S. Kaplan A. Ogawa T.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 604-1608Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) suggested that the Ssr1386 protein also belongs to cyanobacterial NDH-1 and designated it NdhL. Attempts to isolate intact NDH-1 complexes from cyanobacteria have met with serious difficulties (12Berger S. Ellersiek U. Kinzelt D. Steinmüller K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Matsuo M. Endo T. Asada K Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently Prommeenate et al. (14Prommeenate P. Lennon A.M. Markert C. Hippler M. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28165-28173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) purified the largest NDH-1 (460 kDa) from Synechocystis 6803 using His-tagged NdhJ. Both hydrophilic (NdhH, -I, -J, and -K) and hydrophobic (NdhA, -B, -C, -D1, -F1, and -G) subunits were identified in this complex. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex contains additional subunits, NdhM and NdhN, compared with the minimal set of the bacterial enzyme. However, NdhL has not been detected in any of purified preparations of cyanobacterial NDH-1. Thus, the complete subunit composition of NDH-1 from organisms capable of photosynthesis still remains uncertain. Recently we reported two multisubunit complexes, NDH-1L and NDH-1M, which represent distinct NDH-1 complexes in the thylakoid membrane of Synechocystis 6803 (15Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A. Sirpiö S. Paakkarinen V. Aro E-M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 1P. Zhang, N. Battchikova, T. Jansen, J. Appel, T. Ogawa, and E.-M. Aro, submitted manuscript.1P. Zhang, N. Battchikova, T. Jansen, J. Appel, T. Ogawa, and E.-M. Aro, submitted manuscript. NDH-1L was shown to be essential for photoheterotrophic cell growth, whereas expression of NDH-1M was a prerequisite for CO2 uptake and played an important role in growth of cells at low CO2. Here we report the subunit composition of these two complexes. Fifteen proteins were discovered in NDH-1L including NdhL, a new component of the membrane fragment, and Ssl1690 (designated as NdhO), a novel peripheral subunit. NDH-1M comprised the same subunits as NDH-1L except NdhD1 and NdhF1. We also show that deletion of NdhL does not prevent the assembly of the NDH-1L and NDH-1M complexes although it is known to severely hamper their function.

Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the ndhB gene inactivation mutants M55 (18Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4272-4279Google Scholar) were grown in BG-11 medium (19Williams J.K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar) at 32 °C under 50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 with gentle agitation, in conditions of high CO2 (3% CO2 in air) or low CO2 (air level) at pH 7.5. For mutant strains, the appropriate antibiotics were supplemented. Isolation of Crude Thylakoid Membranes—The cells were harvested at the logarithmic phase, washed twice with 20 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 30 mm CaCl2). The thylakoids were isolated according to Gombos et al. (20Gombos Z. Wada H. Murata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) as follows. The cells were suspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 30 mm CaCl2, 800 mm sorbitol, 1 mm ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid), supplemented by the same volume of glass beads and disrupted by vortexing eight times at the highest speed for 1 min at 4 °C with 1–2 min cooling on ice between runs. The crude extract was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min to remove the glass beads and unbroken cells. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in storage buffer (50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 600 mm sucrose, 30 mm CaCl2, 1 m glycinebetaine). Separation of NDH-1 Protein Complexes and Their Subunits—The blue-native PAGE (BN-PAGE) of Synechocystis 6803 membranes was performed basically as described earlier (21Kügler M. Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 53: 35-44Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with modifications for cyanobacteria (15Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A. Sirpiö S. Paakkarinen V. Aro E-M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed with 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 250 μg/ml Pefabloc, and subsequently suspended at the final concentration of 20 μg of protein/μl in 20% glycerol w/v, 25 mm BisTris pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.002 units/μl RNase-Free DNase RQ1 (Promega, Madison, WI). The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and the equal volume of 3% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in the same buffer was added. Solubilization was performed by incubation on ice for 10 min and followed at room temperature for 20 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min. Solubilized membranes were mixed with 1:10 volume of 0.1 m EDTA and 1:10 volume of sample buffer (5% Serva blue G, 200 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 75% sucrose, 1 m ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid) and directly applied to 0.75 mm-thick 5–12.5% acrylamide gradient gel (Hoeffer Mighty Small mini-vertical unit) in amounts of ∼150 μg of protein per well. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C with a gradual increase of voltage (50 V for 30 min, 75 V for 30 min, 100 V for 1 h, 125 V for 30 min, 150 V for 1 h, 175 V for 1 h, and 200 V for 1 h). For electrophoresis in the second dimension, a lane of the BN gel was cut out and incubated in Laemmli SDS sample buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 6 m urea for 1 h at 23 °C. The lane was then laid onto a 1-mm thick 14% SDS-PAGE gel with 6 m urea (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Prestained protein markers, broad range (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were used for estimation of apparent molecular masses of proteins in SDS/PAGE. The proteins were visualized by silver staining (23Blum H. Beier H. Gross J.H. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). N-terminal Protein Sequencing—Proteins separated by two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The corresponding protein spots from four gels were excised, combined, and destained. Sequencing was performed by Dr. Jukka Hellman at the University of Turku using the Edman degradation method. Preparation of Protein Samples for Mass Spectrometry Analysis— Silver-stained protein spots were excised from gels and digested with Trypsin Gold (Promega) according to Shevchenko et al. (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). Spots with low intensity of staining were collected from several gels (up to six) and combined. After digestion, peptides were eluted by 1-h washing of gel pieces first with 5% formic acid, then with 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile, and finally with 5% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile. The extracts were combined, dried, and stored at –20 °C until further use. Identification of Proteins by MALDI-TOF—Eluted and dried protein digests were purified from salts using self-made reverse-phase POROS R3 (Perseptive Biosystems) microcolumns according to Gobom et al. (25Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted from a column directly onto the MALDI plate with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 60% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed in reflector mode on the Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Calibration of spectra was based on masses of trypsin autodigestion products (842.510, 1045.564, and 2211.105 Da). Proteins were identified by searching in the NCBI data base using Mascot (www.matrixscience.com), or MS-Fit in ProteinProspector (prospector.ucsf.edu). The search parameters allowed for carbamidomethylation of cysteine, one miscleavage of trypsin, and 50 ppm mass accuracy. Liquid Chromatography-ESI MS/MS—Tandem mass spectrometry was performed on API QSTAR (Applied Biosystems) equipped with nano electrospray source (Protana, Toronto, Canada) and connected in-line with the nano-HPLC system and the autosampler (Ultimate, Switchos and Famos) (LC Packing, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Eluted and dried protein digests were dissolved in 12 μl of 2% formic acid, centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and transferred into an autosampler vial. Aliquots (5 μl) of samples were loaded onto a C18 PepMap, 5 μm, 1 mm × 300 μm I.D. nano-precolumn (LC Packing), desalted for 1.5 min, and subjected to reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 PepMap, 3 μm, 15 cm × 75 μm I.D. nanoscale LC column (LC Packing). The gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid was applied for 50 min with the flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. The acquisition of MS/MS data was performed on-line using the fully automated IDA feature of the Analyst QS software (Applied Biosystems). The acquisition parameters were 1 s for TOF MS survey scans and 2–3 s for the product ion scans of two most intensive doubly or triply charged peptides. The major trypsin peptides were excluded from MS/MS acquisition. Analyses of MS/MS data were performed with Analyst QS software followed by protein identification by Mascot with search parameters allowing for carbamidomethylation of cysteine, one miscleavage of trypsin, oxidation of methionine, and 200 ppm mass accuracy. Bioinformatic Tools—NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), Cyanobase (www.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase), MIPS (mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/), and TAIR (arabidopsis.org) were used as sequence information resources. BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) searches were performed to search for homologous sequences. To compare protein sequences or a protein sequence with an EST sequence, FASTA and FASTX (fasta.bioch.virginia.edu) were applied, respectively. Various ExPASy links (au.expasy.org) were used for characterization of protein sequences including Prosite (au.expasy.org/prosite), ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw), TMHMM (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0), and Predotar (www.inra.fr/predotar). Separation of NDH-1L and NDH-1M Complexes and Their Subunits from Synechocystis 6803—Membrane protein complexes isolated from Synechocystis 6803 cells were separated by BN-PAGE in the first dimension followed by denaturing SDS-PAGE in the second direction. Sections of silver-stained gels containing NDH-1L and NDH-1M complexes are presented in Fig. 1. The identification of the major photosynthetic complexes, PSI, PSII, and ATP synthase, has been described in detail by Herranen et al. (15Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A. Sirpiö S. Paakkarinen V. Aro E-M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Approximate molecular masses of NDH-1L and NDH-1M appeared to be ∼490 and 350 kDa, respectively, based on the mobility of photosynthetic complexes in BN-PAGE. In WT cells the relative amounts of NDH-1 complexes varied depending on growth conditions. The abundant NDH-1M complex was the characteristic feature of cells grown photoautotrophically under air level of CO2 (Fig. 1A). In WT cells grown in high CO2 (3%) the relative amount of NDH-1M drastically decreased. NDH-1L, conversely, was slightly up-regulated in high CO2-grown cells (Fig. 1B). Protein patterns of NDH-1L and NDH-1M closely resembled each other. Fifteen protein spots were resolved in NDH-1L by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). The subunit composition of NDH-1M was more difficult to access in WT cells since the complex overlapped with the PSI monomer and partially with the PSII monomer. The better resolution of NDH-1M subunits was obtained using the membrane preparation from the PSI-less mutant of Synechocystis 6803 (26Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1856-1863Google Scholar) despite the relatively low amount of NDH-1M compared with NDH-1L (data not shown). The diffuse spot in NDH-1L moving at the level of CP43 (PsbC) of PSII corresponded to two unresolved proteins, and the subunits of NDH-1L were numbered as shown in Fig. 1C. The distinct difference between NDH-1L and NDH-1M was the absence of spots 2 and 8 in the NDH-1M complex. To exclude the possibility that NDH-1L overlapped with an unknown complex, the membrane preparation of Synechocystis 6803 strain M55 (ΔndhB) (18Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4272-4279Google Scholar) grown at high CO2 was analyzed under the same conditions. Both NDH-1L and NDH-1M complexes were absent in this strain (Fig. 1D), and none of the spots depicted in Fig. 1C was detected, demonstrating that all 15 proteins indeed belonged to the NDH-1L complex. Mass Spectrometry Identification of NDH-1 Subunits—Earlier NDH-1L and NDH-1M were recognized as NDH-1 complexes since MALDI-TOF analysis demonstrated the presence of NdhH, -K, -I, and -J subunits in both of them (15Herranen M.

Open table in a new tab Spots 1, 5, 6, and 7 corresponded to NdhH, -K, -I, and -J, respectively. The proteins did not possess transmembrane regions, and they were efficiently digested by trypsin providing many peptides to ensure the reliable identification by MALDI-TOF MS alone (15Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A. Sirpiö S. Paakkarinen V. Aro E-M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). ESI MS/MS analysis was nevertheless performed to exclude the possibility of the existence of co-migrating unknown proteins. Spot 10 corresponded to one of the additional (compared with minimal bacterial complex) subunits Sll1262 (NdhN) recently identified by Prommeenate et al. (14Prommeenate P. Lennon A.M. Markert C. Hippler M. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28165-28173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) whereas spot 11 represented Slr1623 (NdhM), another additional subunit originally found by Berger et al. (12Berger S. Ellersiek U. Kinzelt D. Steinmüller K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Spots 3, 4, 9, 13, and 15 corresponded to NdhB, -A, -G, -E, and -L, respectively. For these subunits, only a few tryptic peptides were seen in MALDI-TOF spectra, most probably because transmembrane proteins are not effectively cleaved by trypsin and/or highly hydrophobic peptides are lost during sample preparation. However, results obtained by ESI MS/MS allowed the identification of these proteins. For NdhE and NdhL, assigned on the basis of the sequence of a single peptide, the complete series of y ions were obtained allowing unambiguous reading of the whole peptide sequence. Further, the corresponding peptides were also detected in MALDI-TOF spectra (data not shown). The MS/MS spectrum of the NdhL peptide is shown in Fig. 2, the peptide appeared to be modified (formaldehyde adduct of Trp residue) during the silver staining procedure. The NdhL was identified in spot 15 originating from the NDH-1M complex of cells grown under carbon-limiting conditions when the complex is most abundant. Under no growth conditions the NDH-1L complex was expressed as strongly as NDH-1M at low CO2, and therefore the amount of the NdhL protein from this complex was not sufficient for analysis. There was a clear difference between the protruding spot 2/3 in NDH-1L and spot 3 in NDH-1M. Peptides of only the NdhB subunit were detected (by MALDI-TOF and ESI MS/MS) in spot 3 derived from NDH-1M. In contrast, both mass spectrometry techniques demonstrated the presence of two proteins, NdhB and NdhD1, in spot 2/3 derived from NDH-1L. ESI-QTOF MS/MS identified spot 8 specific for the NDH-1L complex as NdhF1. To explain the discrepancy between the predicted molecular mass of the NdhF1 (74.4 kDa) and the apparent molecular mass (20 kDa), spot 8 was N-terminally sequenced after blotting of the protein from two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The sequence obtained (AMXVXXL-) demonstrated that the NdhF1 was cleaved between Gly482 and Ala483, and spot 8 was formed by the C-terminal fragment of NdhF1. To further investigate the occurrence of NdhF1 protein in the NDH-1L complex, we made an attempt to diminish the probable unspecific proteolysis of NdhF1 by including a mixture of protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and EDTA) instead of pefablock in all steps from disruption of cells to the SDS-PAGE loading buffer during preparation of the thylakoid samples. We could not significantly prevent the proteolysis of NdhF1 and the C-terminal part of NdhF1 (spot 8) was still prominent. However, an additional spot of ∼60 kDa was observed under these conditions (Fig. 3). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the peptides typical for spot 8 in the spectrum of this protein (data not shown). Spot 14 was identified as the unknown protein Ssl1690 by both MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-MS/MS. Spot 12 failed both techniques. However, the only peak observed in MALDI-TOF spectrum (besides trypsin peaks) with m/z of 654.43 might belong to NdhC subunit (marked with brackets in the Fig. 1C). High hydrophobicity of NdhC (3 membrane-spanning regions) might explain the lack of other tryptic peptides suitable for mass spectrometry analysis. Sequence Analysis of Ssl1690 and NdhL and Search for Homologous Proteins in Other Organisms—NdhL of Synechocystis 6803 encoded by ssr1386 contains 80 amino acids. Two transmembrane helices were found in this protein by TMHMM ver. 2.0 (27Krogh A. von Larsson B. Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol.

The alignment of cyanobacterial NdhL sequences (Fig. 4) revealed 16 identical and 16 conserved amino acid residues.

CoaA from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCoaA) has a distinct primary sequence that is more similar to the mammalian pantothenate kinases than the prototypical bacterial CoaA of Escherichia coli. In contrast to all known pantothenate kinases, SaCoaA activity is not feedback-regulated by CoA or CoA thioesters. Metabolic labeling of S. aureus confirms that CoA levels are not controlled by CoaA or at steps downstream from CoaA. The pantothenic acid antimetabolite N-heptylpantothenamide (N7-Pan) possesses potent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and has multiple cellular targets. N7-Pan is a substrate for SaCoaA and is converted to the inactive butyldethia-CoA analog by the downstream pathway enzymes. The analog is also incorporated into acyl carrier protein and d-alanyl carrier protein, the prosthetic groups of which are derived from CoA. The inactivation of acyl carrier protein and the cessation of fatty acid synthesis are the most critical causes of growth inhibition by N7-Pan because the toxicity of the drug is ameliorated by supplementing the growth medium with fatty acids. The absence of feedback regulation at the pantothenate kinase step allows the accumulation of high concentrations of intracellular CoA, consistent with the physiology of S. aureus, which lacks glutathione and relies on the CoA/CoA disulfide reductase redox system for protection from oxidative damage.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Helicobacter pylori do not have recognizable pantothenate kinases in their genomes, although all other components of the biosynthetic pathway are present. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis possess an alternate isoform of pantothenate kinase that is more closely related to the mammalian enzymes than it is to EcCoaA (Fig. 1).

More recently, the incorporation of these analogs into ACP was demonstrated, and the blockade of fatty acid synthesis by the accumulation of inactive ACP is the root cause for growth inhibition in the E. coli model system (26Zhang Y-M.

This suggests that the pantothenate antimetabolites have a different mechanism of action in S. aureus than in E. coli. This study reports the unique regulatory properties of SaCoaA and the mechanism of action of the pantothenamide antimetabolites in S. aureus. Materials—Materials were purchased from the following suppliers: molecular biology reagents from Qiagen; restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase from Promega; pCR2.1 vector from Invitrogen; pET-15b and pET-28a vectors and thrombin kit from Novagen; oligonucleotides for PCR from the Hartwell Center at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; d-[1-14C]pantothenate (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol), β-[3-3H]alanine (specific activity, 50 Ci/mmol), [1-14C]acetate (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol), l-3H-labeled amino acid mixture (specific activity, 30–60 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 6000 Ci/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; Bradford dye-binding protein assay solution from Bio-Rad; lysostaphin from AMBI; 250-μm silica gel H plates from Analtech, Inc.; ScintiSafe 30% and Taq DNA polymerase from Fisher; DE81 filters from Whatman; and HA filters from Millipore. All other reagents were of analytical grade or better and were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. N-Pentylpantothenamide and N-heptylpantothenamide were synthesized as described previously (13Ivey R.A. Zhang Y-M. Virga K.G. Hevener K. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35622-35629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis by electrospray (ES-MS) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry of protein samples was performed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Construction of SaCoaA and ACP Expression Vectors—The coaA and acpP genes were amplified by PCR from S. aureus strain RN4220 genomic DNA, using Taq DNA polymerase and the following sets of forward and reverse primers, respectively: 5′-GCTAGCATGAAAGTTGGCATTGACGCTGGC and 5′-GGATCCCTATTTTTCTAAATATAATGCACC for coaA, 5′-CATATGGAAAATTTCGATAAAGTAAAAGATATC and 5′-GGATCCGAGTCGACAATACTGACGACCCAG for acpP. Amplified coaA was ligated into the pCR2.1 vector and subcloned into pET-28a within NheI/BamHI restriction sites. The resultant plasmid, pSC4, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 Star(DE3) (Invitrogen). Similarly, acpP was first ligated into the pCR2.1 vector and then subcloned into pET-15b within NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. The pET-15b-derived plasmid was named pRL002 and transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen). CoaA and ACP were expressed from pSC4 and pRL002, respectively, as His6-tagged fusion proteins. LB medium was supplemented with kanamycin (30 μg/ml) for the expression of CoaA or with carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloroamphenicol (30 μg/ml) for the expression of ACP from the respective strains. Overnight cultures of strains BL21 Star(DE3)/pSC4 or Rosetta(DE3)/pRL002 at the early to mid-log phase were used as 1% inoculum into fresh LB medium (0.2–1 liter), and cells were cultured at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5–0.7. Expression of ACP was induced at this point by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), whereas cultures of strain BL21 Star(DE3)/pSC4 were incubated at 42 °C for 10 min followed by 20 min of incubation at room temperature prior to the addition of the same inducer (0.1 mm). Cells were grown for 3 h postinduction and harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall SLA-3000, 6000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). Cell pellets were stored at –20 °C. Protein Purification and Preparation of ACP—E. coli AcpS was expressed as a His6-tagged protein and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography following the general procedure described below. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard. Protein purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis on precast 10% bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). A cell pellet from 0.2 liters of culture of strain BL21 Star(DE3)/pSC4 was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml DNase, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol (5 ml). The suspension was frozen at –70 °C for 2 h and thawed on ice, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (Sorvall 70.1 TI, 50,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was applied onto a nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column (2 ml) charged previously with 50 mm NiSO4 (8 ml) and equilibrated in loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH, 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 12 ml). The column was first washed with loading buffer (20 ml) and then with loading buffer containing 40 mm imidazole (20 ml) and finally eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The purest fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration, applied onto a Superdex 200 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and eluted at 1 ml/min. The fractions containing purified SaCoaA were pooled, concentrated, and stored in 50% glycerol at –20 °C. The same chromatographic system, calibrated with ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbulin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), was used to estimate the molecular weight of SaCoaA. Strain Rosetta(DE3)/pRL002 cell pellets from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in loading buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml DNase, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (20 ml) and lysed by using a French press. His6-tagged ACP was purified by scaling up the procedure described above and obtained with a high purity (>98%) from the nitrilotriacetic acid column. The protein was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (4 liters) and concentrated by ultrafiltration, and an aliquot (0.5 ml, 12 mg/ml) was treated with thrombin as per the manufacturer's instructions. Thrombin-cleaved apoACP (0.4 ml, 8 mg/ml) was converted to ACP in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 55 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8 ml) containing 4 μm AcpS and 2 mm CoA (28Flugel R.S.

After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was applied onto a PD-10 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and ACP was then eluted and stored at –20 °C. Effect of CoA and CoA Thioesters on E. coli and S. aureus CoaAs— E. coli CoaA was expressed as a His6-tagged fusion protein from a pET-15b-derived vector and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography in a single step, as described under “Protein Purification and Preparation of ACP.” The pantothenate kinase activity of EcCoaA and SaCoaA was measured in reaction mixtures containing 85 μm d-[1-14C]pantothenate (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol), 250 μm ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, increasing concentrations of CoA, acetyl-CoA, or malonyl-CoA, as indicated, and either 100 ng of EcCoaA or 20 ng of SaCoaA. Reaction mixtures were analyzed as described previously (5Song W-J. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Intracellular and Extracellular β-Alanine-derived Metabolites—β-[3-3H]Alanine mixtures of increasing concentration were prepared by diluting β-[3-3H]alanine (20 μm, specific activity 50 Ci/mmol) with non-radioactive β-alanine. This resulted in a 2-fold decrease of the isotope specific activity (from 50 to 0.78 Ci/mmol) for each successively higher concentration. S. aureus strain RN4220 was cultured in 1% tryptone medium overnight at 37 °C and used as 1% inoculum into fresh medium (10 ml). 1-ml aliquots were then transferred to 15-ml tubes containing increasing concentrations of β-[3H]alanine from 0.5 to 32 μm as indicated. After 4 h at 37 °C, cells were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and harvested by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed and stored at –20 °C. The cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml lysostaphin (50 μl). Cells were lysed after 30 min of incubation at room temperature, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The total radioactivity in the cleared lysates was estimated by scintillation counting. The β-[3H]alanine-derived products were separated on silica gel H thin layer chromatography plates developed with butanol:acetic acid: water (5/2/4, v/v) and detected by a Bioscan imaging detector (30Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3961-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of the MIC—The MICs of N5-Pan and N7-Pan against S. aureus strain RN4220 were determined by a broth microdilution method. Briefly, S. aureus was cultured at 37 °C in 1% tryptone to mid-log phase, diluted 30,000 times, and used to inoculate (10 μl, 3,000–5,000 colony-forming units) the wells of a 96-well plate (U-bottom with low evaporation lid) containing fresh 1% tryptone medium (100 μl) supplemented with the indicated concentrations of pantothenate analogs or Me2SO (negative control). The same experiments were repeated in the presence of 50 μm pantothenate. After 20 h of incubation at 37 °C, the A600 of the cell suspensions in the wells was measured with a Fusion™ universal microplate analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). The optical density measured in negative controls was taken as 100% growth. Determination of IC50 Values and Kinetic Parameters for the Pantothenate Analogs—The inhibitory effect of N5-Pan and N7-Pan on the kinase activity of SaCoaA was estimated by measuring the amount of radioactive 4′-phosphopantothenate produced in standard reaction mixtures containing 45 μm d-[1-14C]pantothenate (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol), 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (13Ivey R.A. Zhang Y-M. Virga K.G. Hevener K. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.-W. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then stopped and analyzed as described previously (13Ivey R.A. Zhang Y-M. Virga K.G. Hevener K. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.-W. J.

The kinetic constants were obtained from duplicate experiments by nonlinear regression analysis of initial velocities using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software). The constants for pantothenate and ATP were determined under standard conditions by fixing the ATP concentration at 250 μm and increasing the d-[1-14C]pantothenate concentration from 5.6 to 90 μm or by fixing the d-[1-14C]pantothenate concentration to 90 μm and increasing the ATP concentration from 15.6 to 250 μm. The possibility that CoaA phosphorylated the substrate analogs N5-Pan and N7-Pan was investigated by omitting d-[1-14C]pantothenate from the reaction mixtures, and non-radioactive ATP was substituted with [γ-32P]ATP (13Ivey R.A.

The kinetic parameters were determined in the presence of 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 1 Ci/mmol), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and increasing concentrations of N5-Pan (0.63 to 20 μm) and N7-Pan (25 to 40 μm). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the products were analyzed as described previously (13Ivey R.A. Zhang Y-M. Virga K.G. Hevener K. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.-W.

Growth Inhibition by N7-Pan and Cerulenin and Effect of Exogenous Fatty Acids—Oleate and palmitate stock solutions (10 mg/ml) were prepared in 20% aqueous ethanol containing sufficient KOH to neutralize the corresponding acids. S. aureus strain RN4220 was cultured in 1% tryptone medium (45 ml) at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.1–0.2. The cell suspension was then divided into two sets of two 10-ml aliquots each; 10 μl of Me2SO (negative control) were added to one set of cultures and 10 μl of N7-Pan (1.6 μm final concentration) to the other. One culture per set was also supplemented with oleate (15 μg/ml) and palmitate (40 μg/ml) (32Altenbern R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1977; 11: 574-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the same volume of 20% aqueous ethanol was added to the other samples. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C, and cell growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm. After 1 h of incubation (A600 = 0.6–0.8) a 1-ml aliquot per sample was diluted into 9 ml of fresh medium of identical composition and the A600 measured at set intervals, as indicated. A similar experiment was conducted to monitor the extent of cell growth inhibition caused by 100 μg/ml cerulenin in the presence or absence of fatty acids. However, unlike the experiment with N7-Pan, cell cultures were not diluted after 1 h of incubation in the presence of either Me2SO or cerulenin. Labeling of Fatty Acid and Protein Biosynthesis—An overnight culture of S. aureus strain RN4220 in 1% tryptone was used as 1% inoculum into fresh medium (20 ml) and cells were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.1. The cell culture was then divided into two aliquots to which 10 μl of N7-Pan (1.6 μm final concentration) or Me2SO (negative control) were added. The cultures were returned to 37 °C and incubated for a further 3 h and 15 min. 1-ml aliquots were then removed and labeled with either [1-14C]acetate (73 μm, specific activity 55 mCi/mmol) or a l-3H-labeled amino acid mixture (1 μCi) for 15 min at 37 °C. At the end of the labeling experiment, the A600 was measured, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. To determine the extent of [1-14C]acetate incorporation into membrane lipids, the cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in water (100 μl), the cellular lipids were then extracted with chloroform, and the incorporation of the 14C isotope into this phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. S. aureus cultures with 3H-labeled amino acids were harvested by filtration through HA filters. The filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and transferred to vials for scintillation counting. In both labeling experiments, the total radioactivity was normalized to the A600 of the samples and converted to percent of biosynthesis with respect to the negative control. Isolation and Identification of N7-ACP and N7-Dcp by ES-MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF Analyses—N7-ACP and N7-Dcp were partially purified from the cleared lysate of N7-Pan-treated S. aureus strain RN4220. Briefly, S. aureus was cultured overnight in 1% tryptone medium at 37 °C, diluted 100-fold into fresh medium (2 liters), and grown until the A600 reached 0.1. N7-Pan was then added to a final concentration of 1.6 μm, and cells were incubated for 3.5 h before being harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall SLA-3000, 9000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The cell paste was resuspended in 10 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3 mg/ml lysostaphin (6 ml) and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The cell suspension was cleared by centrifugation (Sorvall 70.1 TI, 50,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C), and the cleared lysate was applied onto a HiTrap DEAE FF column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated previ"
https://openalex.org/W2087250116,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is regulated post-transcriptionally by the AU-rich element (ARE) within the 3′-untranslated region of its mRNA. This regulation modulates translational efficacy and mRNA stability. By using a cRNA probe containing the TNF ARE sequence, we screened a macrophage protein expression library and identified FXR1P. Macrophages that we generated from FXR1 knock-out mice had enhanced TNF protein production compared with wild type macrophages following activation. Expression of several other proteins that are regulated by ARE sequences was also affected by FXR1P deficiency. A GFP-ARE reporter that has green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression under control of the 3′-untranslated region of TNF mRNA had enhanced expression in transfected macrophages deficient in FXR1P. Finally, we found that the ablation of FXR1P led to a dramatically enhanced association of the TNF mRNA with polyribosomes demonstrating the important role of FXR1P in the post-transcriptional regulation of TNF expression. Our data suggest that release of this repression by FXR1P occurs during lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage activation. Finally, complementation of the knock-out macrophages with recombinant FXR1P resulted in decreased TNF protein production, supporting our findings that FXR1P operates as a repressor of TNF translation."
https://openalex.org/W2000855005,"Although aluminum is known to be toxic to most organisms, its precise biochemical interactions are not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that aluminum promotes the inhibition of aconitase (Acn) activity via the perturbation of the Fe-S cluster in <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>. Despite the significant decrease in citrate isomerization activity, cellular survival is assured by the overexpression of isocitrate lyase and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-NADP<sup>+</sup>. <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopic studies, Blue Native PAGE, and Western blot analyses indicated that although the decrease in Acn activity is concomitant with the increase of aluminum in the culture, the amount of Acn expressed is not sensitive to the concentration of the trivalent metal. A 6-fold decrease in Acn activity and no discernable change in protein content in aluminum-stressed cultures were observed. The addition of Fe(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in a reducing environment led to a significant recovery in Acn activity. This enzymatic activity reverted to normal levels when aluminum-stressed cells were transferred to either a control or an iron-supplemented medium. The overexpression of the two isocitrate-metabolizing enzymes isocitrate lyase and IDH-NADP<sup>+</sup> appears to mitigate the deficit in Acn activity. The levels of these enzymes are dependent on the aluminum content of the culture and appear to be under transcriptional control. Hence, the regulation of the enzymes involved in the homeostasis of isocitrate constitutes a pivotal component of the global metabolic strategy that ensures the survival of this organism in an aluminum citrate environment."
https://openalex.org/W2038303633,"The ATP-gated P2X7 receptor is a plasma membrane receptor belonging to the family of P2X purinoceptors. Its activation leads to multiple downstream events including influx of ions, pore formation to allow the passage of larger molecular weight species, and cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis. The cell death is thought to be correlated with the pore formation but does not directly result from the dilatation of pores. We have generated and characterized a clone of chicken DT40 lymphocytes stably transfected with the rat P2X7 receptor. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of P2X7 receptor-induced cell death using this clone. Treatment with P2X7 receptor agonist, 2′-3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP induced depolarization of membrane potential, pore formation, and cell shrinkage, an early hallmark of apoptosis in the buffer containing physiological concentrations of ions. Analysis by flow cytometry revealed that the activity of pore formation in shrunk cells was much higher than in non-shrunk cells. The activation of P2X7 receptor also caused the release of lactate dehydrogenase from cells. The P2X7 receptor-mediated cell shrinkage and lactate dehydrogenase release were blocked when media Cl– was replaced with gluconate. However, removal of extracellular Cl– did not affect plasma membrane depolarization and pore formation by treatment with 2′-3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP. Therefore we concluded that pore formation plays a critical role in the P2X7 receptor-induced apoptotic cell death and that this is mediated by extracellular Cl– influx.

The P2X7 receptor, previously designated as P2Z receptor and now the seventh member of P2X receptors, utilizes extracellular ATP to increase cationic permeability with consecutive plasma membrane depolarization, and its intense or prolonged activation leads to the opening of a large non-selective pore allowing the passage of hydrophilic molecules of up to 900 Da in size. This receptor shares 35–40% homology with other members of the P2X family, all with the same predicted topology of two transmembrane regions, a cysteine-rich extracellular loop, and intracellular N and C termini. The C terminus is more than 100 amino acids longer than that of any other member of the family and is essential for the opening of the large pore (5Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A.

Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar) and subsequently from human monocytes (9Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Expression of its mRNA, detected by Northern blot analysis, was found in bone marrow and in tissues containing abundant macrophages or monocytes (11Collo G. Neidhart S. Kawashima E. Kosco-Vilbois M. North R.A. Buell G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Thus the cellular events caused by the P2X7 receptor are thought to play a significant role in the regulation of immune and central nervous systems.The mechanism of activation and repression of apoptosis has been a central focus of studies examining the role of programmed cell death in both normal and pathological conditions. The longer C terminus is required for cell death because no cell death occurs in HEK293 cells expressing a truncated receptor lacking the final 177 residues (5Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). P2X7 receptor-induced cell death has been thought to be correlated with the pore formation (7Virginio C. MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism. We have generated a clone of chicken DT40 B cell line stably transfected with the rat P2X7 receptor (DT40/P2X7 cells) and reported apoptotic cell death mediated via the P2X7 receptor (12Hillman K.A. Harada H. Chan C.M. Townsend-Nicholson A. Moss S.E. Miyamoto K. Suketa Y. Burnstock G. Unwin R.J. Dunn P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). There are three reasons why we selected DT40 cells for the host cells. First, the P2X7 receptors were present on human B cells (15Sluyter R. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the polymorphisms were reported in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (16Di Virgilio F. Wiley J.S. Lancet. 2002; 360: 1898-1899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Gu B.J. Zhang W. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, DT40 cells appear to lack functional P2X7 purinoceptors. Second, they provide an excellent model system for the analysis of the B cell signaling (13Yasuda T. Yamamoto T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 271: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar). Third, stable transfections of this cell line are unique in that they demonstrate an unexpectedly high ratio of targeted to random integration into the homologous gene loci, rendering them highly genetically tractable (14Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by the activation of P2X7 receptor in this clone was measured by exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outside of the cell membrane and DNA laddering. We also detected the activation of caspase-3 when the cloned cells were exposed to P2X7 receptor agonist, 2′-3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP). 1The abbreviations used are: BzATP, 2′-3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DMEM/F-12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 Ham; DiBAC4(3), bis(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)-trimethine oxonol; HBSS, Hanks' based salt solution; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: BzATP, 2′-3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DMEM/F-12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 Ham; DiBAC4(3), bis(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)-trimethine oxonol; HBSS, Hanks' based salt solution; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase. Caspase-3 activation plays a key role in apoptosis. However, the BzATP-induced cell death in this clone could not be prevented by the treatment with a general caspase blocker, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone. This suggested an unidentified system of cell death mediated by the P2X7 receptor. Although cell shrinkage or loss of cell volume has traditionally been viewed as a passive event during apoptosis, recent studies from several laboratories have shown that cell shrinkage or more specifically flux of ions associated with the change in cell size plays a critical role in the regulation of the cell death machinery (18Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Pflügers Arch. 2004; 448: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cell death caused by the activation of P2X7 receptor in heterologous expression systems (including our system) and P2Z receptor in native cells have been documented (1Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ferrari D. Sanz J.M. Venketaraman V. Baricordi O.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Chow S.C. Kass G.E. Orrenius S.

Dunn P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the cell shrinkage and its significance in the cell death mediated by P2X7 receptor have not been reported. In the present study, to understand the molecular mechanism by which P2X7 receptor-induced cell death occurs, we investigated the essential role of pore formation in the apoptotic cell death induced by the activation of P2X7 receptor in DT40/P2X7 cells and its ionic dependence and selectivity by measuring cell size, an early distinction between apoptosis and necrosis, with a flow cytometer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—4,4′-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), phenol red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F-12), fetal bovine serum, chicken serum, penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, BzATP, and ethidium bromide were purchased from Sigma. Bis(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)-trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan). The cytotoxicity detection kit was purchased from Roche Applied Science. All other chemicals used for the experiments were of the highest purity available.Cell Culture—DT40 cells stably transfected with rat P2X7 receptors (DT40/P2X7) have been established and characterized as detailed previously (12Hillman K.A. Harada H. Chan C.M. Townsend-Nicholson A. Moss S.E. Miyamoto K. Suketa Y. Burnstock G. Unwin R.J. Dunn P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells used in this study were routinely maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% heat-inactivated chicken serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C.Buffer Solution—Physiological salt buffer (Hanks' based salt solution (HBSS)) was made with the following composition: 136.9 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). In some studies, Na+ or K+ was replaced with choline, and Cl– was replaced with gluconate. To remove Ca2+, Mg2+, HPO42−, and HCO3−, we made HBSS without CaCl2, MgSO4, Na2HPO4, KH2PO4, and NaHCO3, respectively. For high K+ HBSS, HBSS was initially made minus KCl and NaCl (solution A), and the experimental media were made up of solution A with NaCl and KCl to a total concentration of 142.4 mm.Determination of Ethidium Bromide Uptake by Flow Cytometry— Cells were washed with and resuspended in the indicated buffer at 1 × 106 cells/ml and then incubated with BzATP and ethidium bromide (25 μm) at 37 °C. After incubation, the sample was analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Epics XL and System II software version 3.0) with laser excitation at 488 nm and examined at 620 nm for ethidium fluorescence. The forward and side scatter signals from 50,000 particles were collected. With cellular debris and aggregates gated out by forward and side scatter, the fluorescence signals from ethidium were analyzed. Some data were converted to density plots using WIN-MDI software version 2.8. (J. Trotter, Scripps Institute, San Diego, CA).Quantification of Lactate Dehydrogenase Release—Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into cell culture supernatant was quantified by a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science), following the instructions. Cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were incubated in a 96-well plate at 37 °C for 9 h with BzATP in DMEM/F-12, HBSS, or Cl–-free HBSS. At the end of incubation, supernatants were collected, and the LDH content was measured. Lactate dehydrogenase release is expressed as the percentage of the total content determined by lysing an equal number of cells with 1% Triton X-100.Determination of Cell Size by Flow Cytometry—Cell size and changes in the light scattering properties of the cells were determined by flow cytometry. Cells were washed with and resuspended in the indicated buffer at 1 × 106 cells/ml and then incubated with BzATP at 37 °C. After incubation, 100,000 cells for each sample were examined with a flow cytometer by exciting the cells with a 488-nm argon laser and determining their distribution on a forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot. Light scattered in the forward direction is proportional to cell size, whereas light scattered at a 90° angle (side scatter) is proportional to cell density (19Scoltock A.B. St. Bortner J.C.D. Bird G. Putney Jr., J.W. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30586-30596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a cell shrinks a decrease in the amount of forward scattered light is observed. A gate based on the properties of the control cells was set on each forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot to separate the normal and shrunk populations of cells and remained constant throughout the analysis. Cell shrinkage is expressed as the percentage of shrunk cells in total cells determined by statistical analysis of the dot plots using Beckman Coulter System II software version 3.0. Some data were converted to density plots using WINMDI software version 2.8 for presentation.Measurement of Plasma Membrane Potential—Alternations in the plasma membrane potential were measured using a fluorescent potential-sensitive anionic dye, DiBAC4(3) (20Epps D.E. Wolfe M.L. Groppi V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 69: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice and resuspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were incubated with 1 μm DiBAC4(3) for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of stimulants. Fluorescence was monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths of 493/516 nm with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-2000, Hitachi). For analysis with a flow cytometer, the sample was analyzed with laser excitation at 488 nm and examined at 520 nm for DiBAC4 (3North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar) fluorescence.Statistical Analysis—Values are given as mean ± S.E. Comparison between two values was performed by unpaired Student's t test. For multiple comparisons among different groups of data, significant differences were determined by the Bonferroni method. Significance was defined at p < 0.001 using the Instat version 3.0 statistical package (GraphPad Software).RESULTSApoptotic Cell Death During P2X7 Receptor Activation—The activation of P2X7 receptor initially leads to the opening of ionic channels, which in turn results in the secondary opening of membrane pores that allow the passage of larger molecular species (5Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the BzATP-induced ethidium bromide uptake and LDH release after 10 min and 9 h incubation of DT40 cells expressing rat P2X7 receptors (DT40/P2X7 cells), respectively, in the normal physiological solution (DMEM/F-12). Treatment with BzATP induced ethidium uptake and LDH release in a similar dose-dependent manner. These results confirm our report that apoptosis is induced by the activation of P2X7 receptor in DT40/P2X7 cells (12Hillman K.A. Harada H. Chan C.M. Townsend-Nicholson A. Moss S.E. Miyamoto K. Suketa Y. Burnstock G. Unwin R.J. Dunn P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, cell volume loss or cell shrinkage has been demonstrated to be an early detectable event in the apoptotic program (18Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Pflügers Arch. 2004; 448: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of activation of P2X7 receptor on the change in cell size of DT40/P2X7 cells by flow cytometry. When cells were incubated in DMEM/F-12 and exposed to BzATP (100 μm for 90 min), cell shrinkage was detected (Fig. 2A). This cell shrinkage was completely prevented in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 2A) that is known to block the activation of P2X7 receptor. The BzATP-induced cell shrinkage was time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 2, B and C). Moreover, the simultaneous analysis of pore formation and cell shrinkage by flow cytometry revealed that the ethidium uptake was much higher in the shrunk cells than in the non-shrunk cells (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Flow cytometric analysis of BzATP-induced cell shrinkage. A, DT40/P2X7 cells were incubated for 90 min with vehicle (control) or 100 μm BzATP in DMEM/F-12 or DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2. B, DT40/P2X7 cells were incubated with vehicle (control) or 100 μm BzATP for the indicated time. C, DT40/P2X7 cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of BzATP for 90 min. At the end of incubation, the sample was analyzed with a flow cytometer as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Gates were set up based on the control cells to determine the percentage of cells that had a decrease in forward scatter light (cell size) compared with the entire population of cells. The gates and the percentages of shrunk cells in total cells are indicated on each panel in A. The percentage of shrunk cells in total cells was determined from four independent experiments ± S.E.

Pflügers Arch. 2004; 448: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of ions to P2X7 receptor-mediated apoptotic cell death, we investigated the effects of ions on the BzATP-induced cell shrinkage of DT40/P2X7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, BzATP also induced cell shrinkage in the minimum and essential ion solution including Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl–, PO43− and HCO3− (HBSS). Replacing Na+ with choline, removing PO43− or HCO3− in HBSS did not affect the BzATP-induced cell shrinkage (Fig. 4, B–D). On the other hand, removing Ca2+ or Mg2+ or replacing K+ with choline stimulated the BzATP-induced cell shrinkage (Fig. 4, E–G). Interestingly, when Cl– in HBSS was replaced with gluconate, the BzATP-induced cell shrinkage was suppressed (Fig. 4H).Fig. 4Ionic effects on BzATP-induced cell shrinkage. DT40/P2X7 cells were incubated with vehicle (control) or 100 μm BzATP for 90 min in normal HBSS (A), replacing Na+ with choline (B), removing PO43− (C), removing HCO –, (D) removing Ca2+ (E), removing Mg2+ (F), replacing K+ with choline (G) or replacing Cl– with gluconate (H).

Removal of extracellular Cl– inhibited the BzATP-induced cell shrinkage in a concentration-dependent fashion and was significant at less than 90 mm of extracellular concentration (Fig. 5A). Removal of extracellular Cl– could not block the BzATP-induced pore formation but did block cell shrinkage and LDH release (Fig. 5, B–D). The activation of P2X7 receptor also triggers plasma membrane depolarization caused by transmembrane cation influx (25Solini A. Chiozzi P. Morelli A. Fellin R. Di Virgilio F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 297-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we monitored the change in membrane potential using a fluorescent potential-sensitive anionic dye, DiBAC4(3). As shown in Fig. 6, the treatment with BzATP evoked fast membrane depolarization, and it was not suppressed by removal of extracellular Cl–.Fig. 5Effects of removal of extracellular Cl– on BzATP-induced ethidium uptake, cell shrinkage, and LDH release. A, DT40/P2X7 cells were incubated for 90 min with vehicle (control) or 100 μm BzATP in HBSS containing various concentrations of Cl–, and the cell shrinkage was measured by flow cytometry. B, DT40/P2X7 cells were incubated for 10 min with 25 μm ethidium bromide and vehicle (control) or 100 μm BzATP in HBSS or Cl–-free HBSS. The ethidium uptake was measured with a flow cytometer.

The cells were incubated in buffers with differing concentrations of K+, where concentrations of Na+ were varied reciprocally to maintain osmolarity and a univalent cation concentration of 142.4 mm. Increasing the extracellular K+ concentration up to 70 mm had no effect on the BzATP-induced cell shrinkage (data not shown). Interestingly, high extracellular K+ concentrations (over 70 mm) induced cell shrinkage of our clone and even normal DT40 cells. Treatment with high extracellular K+ (100 mm) for 90 min induced cell shrinkage and membrane depolarization but not ethidium uptake (Fig. 7A) in normal DT40 cells. The high K+-induced cell shrinkage was concentration-dependent and was completely inhibited by removal of extracellular Cl– (Fig. 7B). Moreover, treatment with an anion channel/exchanger inhibitor, DIDS, blocked the cell shrinkage induced by high extracellular K+ (100 mm) (Fig. 7C).Fig. 7High K+-induced cell shrinkage and its inhibition by removal of extracellular Cl–.

The change in cell size, plasma membrane potential, and ethidium uptake were examined with a flow cytometer. B, DT40 cells were incubated for 90 min in HBSS or Cl–-free HBSS containing various concentrations of K+, and the cell shrinkage was measured by flow cytometry. C, DT40 cells were incubated for 90 min with 50 or 100 μm DIDS in HBSS (5 mm K+) or HBSS containing 100 mm K+, and the percentage of shrunk cells in total cells was determined from four independent experiments. * (p < 0.001) indicates statistically significant differences compared with data in HBSS containing 100 mm K+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONActivation of P2X7 receptor has been reported to induce cell death by necrosis and/or apoptosis in a variety of cells (1Di Virgilio F.

Here we provide genetic evidence that several of the Coq polypeptides interact with one another. Deletions in any of the COQ genes affect the steady-state expression of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p. Antibodies that recognize Coq1p, a hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase, were generated and used to determine that Coq1p is peripherally associated with the inner membrane on the matrix side.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, dietary Q leads to a shorter lifespan and this observation has been hypothesized to be the result of an enhanced generation of superoxide by the Q semiquinone radical (Q⋅¯) produced during electron transport (6Larsen P.L.

A polyisoprenyl tail anchors Q to membranes, and the length of this tail varies among different organisms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae synthesizes Q6 bearing six isoprene units, Escherichia coli synthesizes Q8, C. elegans synthesizes Q9, and humans synthesize Q10. The proposed Q biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae and E. coli is shown in Fig. 1. In yeast, there are eight COQ genes required for Q biosynthesis and mutations or deletions in any of these genes result in the loss of Q production and failure to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources (12Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast COQ1 gene encodes a hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase (13Ashby M.N. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13157-13164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) responsible for determining the tail length of Q (14Okada K. Suzuki K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Coq2p, the polyprenyl diphosphate transferase, then attaches this tail to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid to make 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHB, Fig. 1) (15Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coq2p is promiscuous and is capable of utilizing polyprenyl tails of different lengths (16Melzer M. Heide L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and polyprenyl diphosphate synthases from different organisms are capable of rescuing coq1 null mutants for Q synthesis and growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (17Okada K. Kainou T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Yeast strains harboring a mutation in the coq3, coq4, coq5, coq6, coq7, or coq8 gene each accumulate the same intermediate, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (18Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: S121-S127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Deletions in any of the COQ genes reduce Coq3 protein levels and enzymatic activity (19Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This interdependence of Coq3p and the presence of other COQ genes suggest that the proteins involved in Q biosynthesis might form a polypeptide complex for proper activity. In this work, steady-state levels of the other Coq proteins are examined to determine whether they too are affected in coq null strains. The role of Coq1p in a possible protein complex is also explored. Strains and Growth Media—All of the yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Growth media for yeast were prepared as described previously (20Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Open table in a new tab Deletion of the COQ1 ORF—A complete deletion of the COQ1 ORF was accomplished with a PCR-targeting strategy. A 1.422-kb fragment containing LEU2 was generated from the YEp13 vector (GenBank™ accession number U03498) using forward primer pPG1DLF, 5′-ACACAAGAAGTGTGCCATTCAGTCCGAATTGAGTACAGTGGGACGAGAGGTCGCCTGACGCATA-3′, and reverse primer pPG1DLR, 5′-TTCATTTTCTCTTTATTCTTCACCCTTTATTTGAAATTTCAAGGTGTTTCTATTATGAATTTCA-3′. The 5′ end of the forward primer contained 45 nucleotides corresponding to –45 to –1 upstream of the COQ1 ORF followed by 19 nucleotides corresponding to 5579–5597 of YEp13. The reverse primer contained to 45 nucleotides from +1422 to +1378 of the reverse strand of the COQ1 ORF followed by 19 residues from 7000 to 6982 of the reverse strand of YEp13. W303–1A cells were transformed with 1 μg of the PCR fragment as described previously (22Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown on SD-Leu plates at 30 °C for 2 days. Gene disruption was verified by PCR using forward primer Coq1SeqF1, 5′-TAGGGGATTAGAAGATTAAA-3′, from –100 to –81 and reverse primer Coq1SeqR1, 5′-ACATATAAAAACTATTTACA-3′, from +1422 to +1403 and produced a product of 1.622-kb for both the wild type and disrupted strains. The PCR product was then digested using the restriction enzyme ClaI, which digested the wild type product and produced two products of 903 and 719 bp, whereas the ClaI digestion fragments of the disrupted product were 516 and 1106 bp. Construction of COQ1 Plasmids—The pRSQ-1 plasmid (Table II) was made by PCR amplification to create a 2.21-kb fragment using forward primer pBC1–1, 5′-CGCGGGATCCCATGCAAGATTTCTTCCCTG-3′, from –752 to –733 upstream of the COQ1 ORF and reverse primer JST2, 5′-GCTCTAGATTACTTTCTTCTTGTTAGTA-3′, from +1422 to +1403. This fragment was then ligated into pRS316 (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the BamHI and XbaI sites. The single and multi-copy HA-tagged plasmids were both created by PCR using forward primer pHAC1–1, 5′-ACGCACGCGTCGACTTATGTTTCAAAGGTCTGGCGC-3′, from 1 to 20 of the COQ1 ORF and reverse primer pHAC1–2, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAGCTTTCTTCTTGTTAGTATAC-3′, from +1419 to +1400 to create a 1.456-kb fragment spanning the COQ1 ORF. This fragment was then cut with SalI and NotI and ligated into pRSHA1 and pADCL (24Spain B.H. Koo D. Ramakrishnan M. Dzudzor B. Colicelli J. J. Biol.

The pRSHA1 plasmid was created by digesting the pADCL plasmid with BamHI and ligating a 1.5-kb fragment containing the ADH1 promoter and hemagglutin antigen (HA) epitope into pRS316 (23Sikorski R.S.

The product was then digested with BamHI and inserted into PET15b (Novagen) at the BamHI site to generate the plasmid PETQ1 encoding a fusion protein containing a His6 tag at the N terminus. The fusion protein was expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) under induction by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and was purified over His-Bind resin (Novagen) and used to generate antiserum in rabbits (Cocalico). Isolation of Mitochondria and Submitochondrial Localization of Coq1p—Yeast cultures were grown in YPGal to an A600 nm of 4, and mitochondria were isolated and purified according to Yaffe (25Yaffe M.P.

Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations: anti-Coq1p, 1:10,000; anti-Coq3p, 1:1000; anti-Coq4p, 1:1000; anti-Coq5p, 1:1000; anti-Coq6p, 1:500; anti-β-subunit of F1-ATPase, 1:10,000; anti-cytochrome c1, 1:1000; anti-cytochrome c, 1:10,000; anti-cytochrome b2, 1:1000; and anti-Hsp60p, 1:10,000. Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem) were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Steady-state Levels of Coq3, Coq4, and Coq6 Polypeptides Are Decreased in coq Null Mutant Strains—Coq3p levels are reduced when any COQ gene is deleted (19Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and it seemed probable that the steady-state levels of some of the other Coq proteins were similarly affected in this mutant panel. The levels of Coq1, Coq3, Coq4, Coq5, and Coq6 polypeptides in the mitochondria were evaluated by immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies to these proteins. Fig. 2 shows that, in addition to Coq3p, the steady-state levels of Coq4p and Coq6p were also decreased by the deletion of other COQ genes. However, the levels of Coq1p and Coq5p were not affected by the deletion of other COQ genes. Mutants harboring Δatp2 or Δcor1 were used as respiratory-deficient controls, and steady-state levels of Coq proteins were not affected, indicating that the Coq protein decrease cannot be solely attributed to the loss of respiratory electron transport. The levels of Coq6p decreased almost evenly in each coq mutant. In agreement with previous data, the steady-state levels of Coq3p were most affected in the Δcoq5 mutant (19Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Baba S.W. Belogrudov G.I. Lee J.C. Lee P.T. Strahan J. Shepherd J.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10052-10059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The levels of Coq4p were also severely decreased in this Δcoq5 mutant, although Coq4p levels decreased differentially in each coq null mutant. Cytochrome c, cytochrome c1, and the β-subunit of F1-ATPase levels were not decreased by the deletion of any of the COQ genes (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The Coq1 Polypeptide Is Peripherally Associated on the Matrix Side of the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane—The submitochondrial localization of Coq1p was examined to determine whether it colocalized with the other Coq proteins. Coq1p cofractionates with Nycodenz-purified mitochondria as did the β-subunit of F1-ATPase (Fig. 3a). Purified mitochondria were osmotically shocked to release intermembrane space components and produce mitoplasts. These mitoplasts were subsequently sonicated to separate matrix and membrane components, and Coq1p was found to be a membrane-bound protein (Fig. 3b). To determine whether Coq1p is an inner or outer membrane protein, mitochondria and mitoplasts were subjected to treatment with proteinase K with or without 1% Triton X-100. Coq1p was determined to face the matrix side of the inner membrane, because it was not digested by proteinase K in the absence of the detergent (Fig. 3c). Finally, to determine whether Coq1p is an integral or peripherally associated membrane protein, mitoplasts were treated with 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5. This alkaline treatment was able to release Coq1p from the membrane (Fig. 3d). Therefore, Coq1p is a peripheral inner membrane protein on the matrix side as are Coq3p, Coq4p, Coq5p, and Coq6p (21Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A. Lee P.T. Shepherd J.N. Myles D.C.

Polyprenyl Diphosphate Synthases from Other Organisms Partially Restore Coq Protein Levels—Because the levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p were decreased in the coq1 null mutant, it was possible that the Coq1 polypeptide, its hexaprenyl diphosphate product, or a combination of both was necessary for normal steady-state levels of these proteins. Polyprenyl diphosphate synthases from a variety of prokaryotic organisms are able to rescue Δcoq1 mutants for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (17Okada K. Kainou T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that each of these orthologs of Coq1p shares seven conserved regions. However, the overall sequence identity to Coq1p was rather low, ranging from 22.7 to 30.2%. When plasmids containing these orthologs (Table II) are transformed into a Δcoq1 mutant, each resulting strain is rescued for growth on media containing a non-fermentable carbon source and produces isoforms of Q with distinct isoprenoid tail length (17Okada K. Kainou T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, the steady-state levels of the other Coq proteins were re-examined in these Δcoq1-rescued strains to determine whether the expression of these divergent polyprenyl diphosphate synthases and the production of distinct Qn isoforms also restored Coq protein levels (Fig. 5). The levels of Coq5p remain unchanged in all of the samples. However, steady-state levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p were partially restored in some of the rescued strains, although in most cases the prokaryotic Coq1 orthologs did not restore levels to that of wild type. The steady-state levels of these proteins were different in each strain. Coq3p and Coq4p levels were highest in the coq1 null strain harboring the pYD11 (Q10) plasmid, whereas Coq6p was most increased by the pYH7 (Q7) plasmid. In addition, a strain harboring a multi-copy HA-tagged Coq1p contained increased levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p as compared with the corresponding low copy HA-tagged version. Despite a high expression of Coq1 protein from the pHA1–1 plasmid, the rescue of the other Coq proteins was very similar to the rescue by pRSQ1–1, a low copy plasmid that carries COQ1 and a 752-bp promoter region upstream of the ATG start site. The addition of 2 μm exogenous Q6 to the growth medium also increased the levels of Coq3p but had little effect on the levels of Coq4p or Coq6p.Fig. 5Steady-state levels of Coq1, Coq3, Coq4, Coq5, and Coq6 polypeptides in yeast strains producing distinct Qn isoforms. Samples of mitochondria (10 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The wild type strain W303–1A (W) was compared with the W303–1AΔCOQ1 (Δ) and rescued strains producing Qn isoforms with different tail lengths. W303–1AΔCOQ1 was transformed with Y-GGPSmut3 (Q5), pYH7 (Q7), pYE6 (Q8), pYD10 (Q9), or pYD11 (Q10), and these strains are indicated in the figure by their respective prenyl tail lengths. Alternatively, the coq1 null mutant was allowed to grow in media supplemented with 2 μm Q6 or was transformed with the following S. cerevisiae plasmids containing COQ1: a low copy plasmid, pRSQ1–1 (sc); a low copy HA-tagged COQ1, psHA1–1 (sH); or a multi-copy HA-tagged COQ1, pHA1–1 (mH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This work characterizes the mitochondrial localization of Coq1p and establishes the interdependence of several of the Coq polypeptides. Similar to Coq3p, Coq4p, Coq5p, and Coq6p, Coq1p was also found to localize to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 3). This agrees with a sequence analysis that noted the mitochondrial targeting sequence of Coq1p and hypothesized this protein to be peripherally associated to the inner membrane (13Ashby M.N. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13157-13164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here show a decrease in the steady-state levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p in isolated mitochondria from coq null yeast strains. Additionally, the levels of cytochrome c, cytochrome c1, and the β-subunit of F1-ATPase were unchanged, indicating that the decrease in Coq proteins, subsequent loss of Q, and respiratory activity do not necessarily affect the steady-state levels of other mitochondrial proteins involved in the electron transport chain. These results suggest that previously observed decreases in cytochromes c and c1 associated with decreased mitochondrial Q levels may depend on the genetic background of the yeast strain (3Santos-Ocana C.

Null mutants in coq3, coq4, coq5, coq6, coq7, or coq8 fail to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, do not produce Q6, and accumulate 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (18Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: S121-S127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previously, it had been shown that steady-state levels of Coq3p decrease and that Coq3 O-methyl-transferase activity is also greatly reduced in these coq null strains (19Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the steady-state levels of Coq1p and Coq5p remain unchanged in the mitochondria of the null strains, the decrease in steady-state levels of Coq3p and Coq4p was differential in nature and the coq5 null strain caused the greatest instability for both of these proteins. Although Coq5p is necessary for the stability Coq3p and Coq4p, two coq5 mutants bearing point mutations within or adjacent to methyl-transferase motifs can also stabilize these proteins but a point mutant located near the C terminus cannot (28Baba S.W. Belogrudov G.I. Lee J.C. Lee P.T. Strahan J. Shepherd J.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10052-10059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similarly, an E226K coq4 point mutant fails to produce Q but has a stable Coq3p (29Belogrudov G.I. Lee P.T. Jonassen T. Hsu A.Y. Gin P. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The differential stability of Coq3 and Coq4 polypeptides in certain point mutants compared with coq null mutants provides strong evidence of interaction among some of the Coq proteins. Surprisingly, none of the plasmids containing S. cerevisiae COQ1 restored wild type levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, or Coq6p. In the case of the pRSQ1–1 plasmid, it is probable that the 752-bp sequence upstream of the ATG initiation site is insufficient as a COQ1 promoter because the levels of Coq1p are lower than they are in the wild type parental strain. In the case of the two HA-tagged plasmids, the strong ADH1 promoter drives the expression of Coq1 and there is an increase in the levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p in the multi-copy plasmid over the single copy. However, the multi-copy HA-tagged Coq1p may have formed aggregates in membranes and thus have reduced enzymatic activity and/or impaired interactions with other Coq proteins. Is Coq1p itself required for normal steady-state levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p, or is the lipid product of Coq1p sufficient? Previous work has demonstrated that yeast coq1 mutants are rescued by polyprenyl diphosphate synthases from other organisms and that the Q isoforms produced contain the polyprenyl tails of distinct lengths (17Okada K. Kainou T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In some cases, these orthologs are from organisms that do not produce Q. For example, Haemophilus influenzae produces demethylmenaquinone bearing a heptaprenyl tail (31Hollander R. Mannheim W. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1975; 25: 102-107Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas Sulfolobus acidocaldarius makes calderiellaquinone with a hexaprenyl tail (32Thurl S. Witke W. Buhrow I. Schafer W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Coq1p ortholog taken from S. acidocaldarius is a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase that has been mutagenized and selected for the ability to produce longer prenyl products, in this case pentaprenyl diphosphate (33Ohnuma S. Hirooka K. Hemmi H. Ishida C. Ohto C. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18831-18837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems unlikely that these diverse polyprenyl diphosphate synthases from prokaryotic organisms would interact with the yeast Coq polypeptides. In fact, Coq4p is profoundly stabilized by the presence of each of the diverse Coq1 orthologs and, to our knowledge, has no homolog in prokaryotic genomes. Instead, it appears far more likely that the lipid product of these polyprenyl diphosphate synthases, a Q biosynthetic intermediate, or Q itself is involved in stabilizing steady-state Coq polypeptide levels. When these Coq1p orthologs were expressed in the coq1 null mutant, the steady-state levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p were differentially rescued. The coq1 null strain transformed with pYD11 (Q10) restored levels of Coq3p and Coq4p to almost those of wild type, whereas the coq1 null transformed with pYH7 (Q7) showed partial restoration of Coq4p and Coq6p and very little restoration of Coq3p. What could account for the differential rescue of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p in the coq1 null mutant rescued with the prokaryotic orthologs of Coq1? It is possible that either the quantity or the tail length of the polyprenyl diphosphate-derived product could differentially impact the stability of the Coq polypeptides in the Q-biosynthetic complex. The amount of Qn isoforms produced is known to be variable for both yeast and E. coli rescued with prokaryotic Coq1 orthologs (17Okada K. Kainou T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Jonassen T. Davis D.E. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51735-51742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is possible that Coq2p may be sensitive to the prenyl tail length. Although it has been observed that the human homolog of COQ2 can likewise rescue yeast cells harboring a coq2 null mutation, the rate of Q biosynthesis was also lower in these rescued cells compared with that of wild type (35Forsgren M. Attersand A. Lake S. Grunler J. Swiezewska E. Dallner G. Climent I. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This could have been attributed to a lower activity in a foreign host, or perhaps the enzyme was sensitive to tail length. Similarly, Coq3p, Coq4, and Coq6p themselves may also be sensitive to prenyl length and are destabilized under these conditions. Coqp steady-state levels could also be stabilized differentially through their interaction with the polyprenyl diphosphate-derived lipid as either substrate or product. There is precedence for the stabilization of enzymes by their substrate as in the case of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in E. coli (36Guenther B.D. Sheppard C.A. Tran P. Rozen R. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Whereas Coq4 has no identified catalytic function, Coq3 (a methyltransferase) and Coq6 (a flavin-dependent monooxygenase) could be stabilized through their affinity for the polyprenyl diphosphate-derived Q-intermediate. In this regard, it is interesting that exogenous Q6 restored levels of Coq3p but had very little effect on Coq4p and Coq6p. Because Q6 is the direct product of the final methyltransferase reaction, Q itself may play a role in stabilizing steady-state levels of Coq3p. This study provides genetic evidence for the interactions among the Coq proteins in yeast, as indicated by the effects of steady-state stability in coq null mutants. In the case of the coq1 null mutant, polyprenyl diphosphate synthases from a wide variety of prokaryotic organisms are able to restore Q synthesis. Although a direct role of Coq1p in stabilizing the Coq polypeptides cannot be excluded, the findings presented here argue for the involvement of polyprenyl diphosphate itself or a Q-intermediate derived from it in stabilizing the Coq3, Coq4, and Coq6 polypeptides. The identity of this lipid product and the nature of its interaction with Coq polypeptide Q-biosynthetic complex will require further study. We thank P. T. Lee for the construction of pRSQ1–1, pRSHA1–1, and pHA1–1 plasmids. We also thank Dr. M. Kawamukai for the gift of plasmids containing Coq1 homologs."

The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) mediates both PDZ binding to Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor/ezrin/radixin/moesin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa (NHERF/EBP50) family proteins and non-PDZ binding to the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). We have investigated whether PDZ interaction(s) are actually sufficient to promote rapid recycling of endocytosed receptors and, if so, whether PDZ-mediated sorting is restricted to the β2AR tail or to sequences that bind NHERF/EBP50. The trafficking effects of short (10 residue) sequences differing in PDZ and NSF binding properties were examined using chimeric mutant receptors. The recycling activity of the β2AR-derived tail sequence was not blocked by a point mutation that selectively disrupts binding to NSF, and naturally occurring PDZ ligand sequences were identified that do not bind detectably to NSF yet function as strong recycling signals. The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β1-adrenergic receptor, which does not bind either to NSF or NHERF/EBP50 and interacts selectively with a distinct group of PDZ proteins, promoted rapid recycling of chimeric mutant receptors with efficiency similarly high as that of the β2AR tail. These results indicate that PDZ domain-mediated protein interactions are sufficient to promote rapid recycling of GPCRs, independent of binding to NSF. They also suggest that PDZ-directed recycling is a rather general mechanism of GPCR regulation, which is not restricted to a single GPCR, and may involve additional PDZ domain-containing protein(s) besides NHERF/EBP50.

Endocytosed β2ARs can recycle to the plasma membrane rapidly and efficiently after agonist removal, and receptors are capable of undergoing multiple rounds of continuous endocytosis/recycling without detectable proteolysis (9von Tsao P.I.

Rapid recycling of the β2AR is well established to promote functional resensitization of signal transduction (3Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G.

Lysosomal trafficking of δOR to lysosomes contributes to the essentially opposite process of agonist-induced proteolytic down-regulation (13Tsao P. von Cao T. Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol.

Despite the physiological importance of these opposite regulatory processes, the molecular mechanisms that determine the sorting of distinct GPCRs remain poorly understood. Plasma membrane recycling of many integral membrane proteins is thought to occur via bulk membrane flow, without requiring any specific sorting information (16Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 17Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol.

However, efficient recycling of the β2AR requires a specific structural determinant present in a distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (20Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. von Bretscher A. Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). A tetrapeptide sequence derived from the β2AR carboxyl terminus forms a minimal structural determinant that is both necessary for efficient recycling of the β2AR and sufficient to promote rapid recycling when fused to a distinct GPCR, thereby fulfilling functional criteria of a modular endocytic sorting signal (21Gage R.M. Kim K.A. von Cao T.T. Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This sequence conforms to a classical type I PDZ ligand and interacts with a PDZ domain present in NHERF/EBP50 family proteins (22Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that PDZ domain-mediated protein interaction(s) with the β2AR-derived recycling sequence is sufficient to mediate its postendocytic sorting activity (21Gage R.M. Kim K.A. von Cao T.T. Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The β2AR tail can also interact with other cytoplasmic proteins in addition to PDZ proteins such as NHERF/EBP50 (26Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), a cytoplasmic protein that does not contain recognizable PDZ domains but also requires a distal portion of the β2AR tail for detectable binding (27Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A number of mutations of the β2AR tail that alter the endocytic membrane trafficking of receptors also disrupt receptor interaction with NSF, and in vitro studies indicate that NSF and PDZ proteins bind to the β2AR tail competitively. This has led to the alternative hypothesis that NSF, and not PDZ, interactions with the β2AR tail are important for its endocytic sorting activity (27Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A potential limitation of the previous studies is that they rely on a loss-of-function approach. In the present study, the ability of the β2AR-derived recycling signal to function as an autonomous membrane trafficking signal was used, in a gain-of-function design, to define sequences that are actually sufficient to promote plasma membrane recycling of endocytosed receptors. These results verify that PDZ domain-mediated protein interaction(s) with the cytoplasmic tail are indeed sufficient to promote rapid and efficient recycling of endocytosed GPCRs and can do so in the absence of detectable NSF binding. Interestingly, these results demonstrate further that PDZ-mediated endocytic sorting activity is not limited to the β2AR-derived cytoplasmic tail or to sequences that interact with NHERF/EBP50. Instead it appears that PDZ domain-mediated protein interaction(s) play a more general role in controlling postendocytic sorting of GPCRs than previously anticipated. cDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—Several epitope-tagged versions of the cloned murine δOR (28Evans C.J.

NSF Binding via GST Pull-down—Wild type His6-NSF and His6-soluble NSF attachment protein (His6-α-SNAP) were produced as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and purified as described (32Nagiec E.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of GST fusion proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked 1 h with 5% (w/v) fat-free milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST; 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a solution containing 100 nm purified NSF. Blots were then washed three times with TBST buffer and incubated with anti-NSF monoclonal antibody (2E5) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The blots were washed again with TBST, and protein bands were detected using Super Signal (Pierce). Band intensities were quantified in the linear range by direct imaging via chemiluminescence detection on a FluorChem 8000 instrument (AlphaInnotech Corp.). Assay of Receptor Recycling—Recycling of endocytosed GPCRs was measured by a ratiometric fluorescence assay, as described previously (34von Tanowitz M. Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and summarized briefly below. Transiently transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody (prepared by standard methods using Alexa-fluor 488 N-hydroxysuccinimide ester; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) to selectively label FLAG-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane at the beginning of the experiment. Then cells were incubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) in the presence of 10 μm DADLE or 10 μm isoproterenol to drive internalization. At the end of this incubation, cells were quickly washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) lacking Ca2+ or Mg2+ and supplemented with 0.04% EDTA to dissociate FLAG antibody bound to residual surface receptors remaining in the plasma membrane, thereby leaving antibody bound only to the internalized pool of receptors. EDTA-stripped cells were then incubated (at 37 °C for 45 min) in the presence of 10 μm naloxone or 10 μm alprenolol to prevent subsequent receptor activation (from possible residual agonist not removed by washing). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS under nonpermeabilizing conditions, quenched with Tris-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin (but no Triton X-100), and incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody to detect recycled, antibody-labeled receptors. In each experiment and for each receptor construct examined, two parallel control coverslips were included, one in which cells were fixed after a 30-min incubation in the absence of agonist and without an EDTA stripping step (100% surface receptor control) and one in which cells were fixed immediately after the EDTA-mediated stripping step (0% recycled control). Cells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy using a Nikon inverted microscope with a ×60 numerical aperture 1.4 objective and appropriate filter sets to selectively detect Alexa488 or Cy3. Staining intensities of each fluor in individual cells were integrated using a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) and IPLab Image software (Scanalytics). This analysis indicated that the efficiency of the EDTA strip (reduction of Cy3 staining intensity in the 0% recycled control relative to the 100% surface receptor control) was >95%, consistent with previous measures using fluorescence flow cytometry. The percentage of receptors recycled in individual cells following agonist washout was then calculated from the red/green ratios determined from the control conditions according to the following formula: (E – Z)/(C – Z) × 100, where E represents the mean ratio for the experimental coverslip, Z is the mean ratio for the zero surface control, and C is the mean ratio for the 100% surface control. 20–30 cells/construct/condition were analyzed at random in this manner for each experiment, and average values reported under “Results” represent mean recycling percentages derived from 5–8 independent experiments. Assay of Receptor Degradation—To determine the effect of agonist treatment on steady state levels of total receptor protein, immunoblotting was performed as described previously (9von Tsao P.I. Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells stably transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged receptors were grown in 10-cm dishes and treated for 0, 1, or 4 h with the appropriate agonist (10 μm isoproterenol or DADLE) at 37 °C. Dishes of cells containing stably transfected cells were washed with 2.5 ml of PBS, and the cells were dissociated and harvested in 1.5 ml of PBS/EDTA for 3 min at 4 °C. After pelleting the cells by centrifugation (1000 rpm for 5 min on a benchtop microcentrifuge), the cells were lysed by placing them in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis solution (25 mm Tris-HCl or 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) while vortexing for 2 min. The crude membrane fraction was separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min on a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of resuspension buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl or 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml, pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100). The nonsoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation as above at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatant was decanted and analyzed for protein content by the Bradford method (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lysate from the samples corresponding to ∼40 μg of total protein was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations, Inc.) and placed in TBSTM (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% dry nonfat milk) for 60 min. Detection of receptors containing FLAG epitope was carried out by incubation of the blots with M1 anti-FLAG antibody (15 μg/ml in TBSTM) for 60 min, washing in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), and incubation for 60 min in TBSTM containing 400 ng/ml goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing in TBST, proteins bands were detected using Super Signal (Pierce). Band intensities were quantitated by direct imaging via chemiluminescence detection on a FluorChem 8000 instrument (AlphaInnotech Corp.) using a 16-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera and analyzed using FluorChem 2.0 software (AlphaInnotech Corp.). Immunoprecipitations—To detect in vivo binding between NSF and FLAG-tagged receptors, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Briefly, cells stably transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged receptors were grown in 10-cm dishes and treated for 30 min with the appropriate agonist (10 μm isoproterenol or DADLE) at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS/HEPES (PBS, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Next, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in cross-linking buffer (PBS/HEPES, 123 μg/ml dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)) before quenching with PBS/HEPES/glycine (PBS/HEPES, 19 mm glycine). Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2-pyrophosphate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1× complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. After equalizing protein concentrations across all samples, lysates were added to M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) and allowed to rotate for 16 h. After washing three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer, FLAG tag-containing proteins were specifically eluted off of the beads by 40 μl of 1× FLAG peptide (600 μg/ml peptide in PBS; Sigma). Proteins were incubated for 30 min in SDS sample buffer containing 100 μm dithiothreitol and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (Fisher) and separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions. Resolved proteins and lysate representing 1% of co-immunoprecipitation input were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations, Inc.) and placed in TB-STM (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% dry nonfat milk) for 60 min. Identical gels were run and transferred for separate detection of receptor and NSF. Detection of receptors containing FLAG epitope was carried out by incubation of the blots with M1 anti-FLAG antibody (15 μg/ml in TBSTM) for 60 min, washing in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubation for 60 min in TBSTM containing 400 ng/ml goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing in TBST, protein bands were detected using Super Signal (Pierce). Detection of co-immunoprecipitated NSF was carried out as above using 1 μg/ml 2E5 mouse anti-NSF antibody in TBSTM and TBSTM containing 400 ng/ml goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Band intensities were recorded by direct imaging via chemiluminescence detection on a FluorChem 8000 instrument (AlphaInnotech Corp.) using a 16-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera and analyzed using FluorChem version 2.0 software (AlphaInnotech Corp.). Fluorescence Microscopy—To investigate the subcellular localization of endogenous NSF and FLAG-tagged receptors in response to agonist, confocal microscopy was conducted. HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the indicated receptor were grown on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells were treated with agonist (10 μm of isoproterenol or DADLE) for 0, 5, 10, or 30 min and then fixed and washed in PBS. Cells were permeabilized and blocked for 45 min at room temperature in Blotto (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 3% (w/v) dry milk). Next, the coverslips were incubated for 45 min in Blotto containing 2E5 at 1 μg/ml and rabbit anti-FLAG at 1 μg/ml (Sigma). After washing three times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2), the coverslips were incubated for 30 min in Blotto containing Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody at 1.4 μg/ml (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody 2 μg/ml (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium following three washes in TBS. Endogenous NSF and FLAG-tagged receptors were visualized on an upright Zeiss LSM-5 Pascal confocal microscope and analyzed using Image Exa"
https://openalex.org/W2145251958,"Jingzhaotoxin-I (JZTX-I), a 33-residue polypeptide, is derived from the Chinese tarantula Chilobrachys jing-zhao venom based on its ability to evidently increase the strength and the rate of vertebrate heartbeats. The toxin has three disulfide bonds with the linkage of I-IV, II-V, and III-VI that is a typical pattern found in inhibitor cystine knot molecules. Its cDNA determined by rapid amplification of 3′- and 5′-cDNA ends encoded a 62-residue precursor with a small proregion of eight residues. Whole-cell configuration indicated that JZTX-I was a novel neurotoxin preferentially inhibiting cardiac sodium channel inactivation by binding to receptor site 3. Although JZTX-I also exhibits the interaction with channel isoforms expressing in mammalian and insect sensory neurons, its affinity for tetrodotoxin-resistant subtype in mammalian cardiac myocytes (IC50 = 31.6 nm) is ∼30-fold higher than that for tetrodotoxin-sensitive subtypes in latter tissues. Not affecting outward delay-rectified potassium channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels in mammal sensory neurons, JZTX-I hopefully represents a potent ligand to discriminate cardiac sodium channels from neuronal tetrodotoxin-resistant isoforms. Furthermore, different from any reported spider toxins, the toxin neither modifies the current-voltage relationships nor shifts the steady-state inactivation of sodium channels. Therefore, JZTX-I defines a new subclass of spider sodium channel toxins. JZTX-I is an α-like toxin first reported from spider venoms.

Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VGSC, voltage-gated sodium channel; Kv, voltage-gated potassium channel; TTX, tetrodotoxin; TTX-R, TTX-resistant; TTX-S, TTX-sensitive; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ICK, inhibitor cystine knot; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; TCEP, Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; HNTX, Hainantoxin.1The abbreviations used are: VGSC, voltage-gated sodium channel; Kv, voltage-gated potassium channel; TTX, tetrodotoxin; TTX-R, TTX-resistant; TTX-S, TTX-sensitive; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ICK, inhibitor cystine knot; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; TCEP, Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; HNTX, Hainantoxin. are integral plasma membrane proteins composed of a pore-forming α-subunit (260 kDa) associated with up to four auxiliary β subunits (21–23 kDa) (1.Ogata N. Tatebayashi H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 466: 9-37Google Scholar, 2.Catteral W.A. Neuron. 2002; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). VGSCs play a vital role in the initiation and propagation of exciting signals on most excitable tissues. Similar to the “shaker” potassium channel, the three-dimensional structure of sodium channel is a bell-shaped molecule (3.Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N. Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 4.Sato C. Ueno Y. Asai K. Takahashi K. Sato M. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2001; 409: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). From mammals, over ten mammalian subtypes (Nav1.1–1.9 and Navx) exhibiting relatively similar pharmacological properties in different expression systems have been identified and characterized. Sequence analysis demonstrates that they have been highly conserved during evolution. Furthermore, to be beneficial for catching their prey, the properties of sodium channels in many animals even have evolved geographically in a coevolutionary arms race with their toxic prey (5.Geffeney S. Brodie Jr., E.D. Ruben P.C. Brodie III, E.D. Science. 2002; 297: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6.Huey R.B. Moody W.J. Science. 2002; 297: 1289-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Many polypeptides targeting VGSCs have been identified in many kinds of animal venoms, such as those from scorpions, spiders, snakes, and marine animals. With different critical residues and distinct functional characterization, these naturally occurring toxins are proved to be important tools in distinguishing the different subtypes and disclose the function-structure relationships of VGSCs. Over six neuronal receptor sites are suggested to elucidate such relationships (7.Cestele S. Ben, Khalifa R.B. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on the analysis of precursor organization and gene structure combined with a three-dimensional fold, Zhu et al. (8.Zhu S. Darbon H. Dyason K. Verdonck F. Tytgat J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1765-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) suggest that inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) peptides from animals shared a common evolutionary origin. Compared with scorpion and snake toxins, spider peptides are shorter ones containing around 35 residues with three/four disulfide bonds. Despite distinct amino acid compositions, most spider peptides have also been found to share a clear homological ICK fold determined structurally by NMR and homology modeling techniques (9.Shu Q. Lu S.Y. Gu X.C. Liang S.P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The majority of them such as δ-atracotoxins (δ-ACTXs) and μ-agatoxins share a common mode of inhibiting inactivation kinetics of sodium currents on vertebrate or/and insect VGSCs by binding to receptor site 3 (10.Grolleau F.

Darbon H. Dyason K. Verdonck F. Tytgat J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1765-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14.Zhu S. Bosmans F. Tytgat J. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Many significant evidences appear in scorpions, snakes, and marine animals, but similar evidence still remains to be found in spiders. The remarkable functional difference between spider site-3 toxins and other animal toxins is that spider site 3 toxins evidently depress current amplitudes, whereas other animal toxins enhance current amplitudes evoked under whole-cell patch clamp recording (10.Grolleau F.

Spider site 3 toxins show no effects on tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) sodium channels such as Nav1.5 and Nav1.8–1.9. New emerging ligands will play an important role in elucidating their subtle difference. Moreover, they have been proven to be potential valuable pharmaceutics or insecticides (13.Peng K. Shu Q. Liu Z. Liang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 49: 47564-47571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation, cDNA sequence determination, and functional characterization of a novel sodium channel toxin, Jingzhaotoxin-I (JZTX-I), from the venom of Chinese tarantula Chilobrachys jingzhao (Araneae:Theraphosidae:Chi-lobrachys) (15.Zhu M.S. Song D.X. Li T.H. J. Baoding Teachers College. 2001; 14: 1-6Google Scholar). The toxin is composed of 33 residues stabilized by three disulfide bridges (I-IV, II-V, and III-VI) assigned by partial reduction, sequencing, and multi-enzymatic digestion. JZTX-I shows no effect on neuronal TTX-R VGSCs and Kv1 channels, but it inhibits channel inactivation of neuronal TTX-S subtypes and cardiac TTX-R subtypes. To the best of our knowledge, JZTX-I is an α-like toxin first reported to date from spider venoms. It provides an important witness for studying the convergent and divergent functional evolution of animal venoms. Toxin Purification and Sequencing—JZTX-I was fractionated from Chinese tarantula C. jingzhao venom using a combination of ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previous described (13.Peng K. Shu Q. Liu Z. Liang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 49: 47564-47571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Lyophilized venom (10 mg in 2 ml in distilled water) was applied to a Waters protein-Pak CM 8 H column (5 × 50 mm) initially equilibrated with 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.25 (buffer A). The column then was eluted with a linear gradient (see Fig. 1A) at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. The fraction of interest collected was applied to a Vydac C18 (C4) analytical reverse-phase HPLC column (218TP54, 4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min by a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid (see Fig. 1B). The molecular mass and purity of toxin were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The full amino acid sequence (Swiss-Prot accession numbers P83974 and AJ854060) was obtained from a single sequencing run on an Applied Procise™ 491-A protein sequencer by automated Edman degradation. Assignment of the Disulfide Bridges of JZTX-I—Native peptide (0.1 mg) was partially reduced in 20 μl of citrate buffer (1 m, pH 3.0) containing 6 m guanidine-HCl and 0.05 m Tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at 40 °C for 10 min. The fractions monitored at 280 nm were separated on a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column with a linear gradient elution (25–50% acetonitrile in 40 min). The masses of all of the fractions collected were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The intermediate with free thiols were lyophilized and then alkalized by adding 100 μl of 0.5 m iodoacetamide, pH 8.3. The alkalized peptide was desalted by reverse-phase HPLC and then submitted to an Applied Biosystems Model 491 gas-phase sequencer. The Edman degradation was performed with a normal automatic cycle program. Concerning the protease digestion strategy, native JZTX-I (0.1 mg) was dissolved in 0.2 ml of Tris-HCl (0.2 m, pH 7.5) buffer containing trypsin (4 μg), chymotrypsin (4 μg), and V8 protease (4 μg). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The masses of enzymolytic products then were analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Identification of JZTX-I cDNA—The full-length of JZTX-I cDNA was obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods as described previously (27.Diao J.B. Lin Y. Tang J.Z. Liang S.P. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). First, according to the manufacturer's instruction, the total RNA was extracted from 0.1 g of fresh venom glands of female spiders using TRIzol reagent kit. 5 μg of RNA was taken to convert mRNA into cDNA using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase with a universal oligo(dT)-containing adapter primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC(dT)17-3′). The cDNA then was used as template for PCR amplification in 3′-RACE. Degenerate primer 1 (5′-GC(A/T/C/G)AA(C/T)TT(T/C)GC(A/C/G/T)TG(T/C)AA(G/A)AT(A/C/T)-3′) was designed corresponding to the N-terminal residues (18ANFACKI24) of mature JZTX-I. The partial cDNA of mature toxin was amplified by PCR technique using primer 1. Second, based on the partial cDNA sequence of JZTX-I determined by 3′-RACE, the antisense primers were designed and synthesized for 5′-RACE as gene-specific primer 2 (5′-GGCCTAAGGGCTCCAGATACA-3′). With the strategy described by the RACE kit supplier, the 5′-end cDNA of JZTX-I was amplified using its gene-specific primer 2. Amplified products in both 3′- and 5′-RACE were precipitated and cloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector for sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed by Bioasia Inc. Nucleic acid sequences were analyzed using the software of DNAclub (by Xiongfong Chen) and DNAman (by Nynnon Biosoft). Cell Preparation—Rat DRG neurons were acutely dissociated and maintained in a short-term primary culture according to the procedures adapted from Xiao et al. (16.Xiao Y. Tang J. Yang Y. Wang M. Hu W. Xie J. Zeng X. Liang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26220-26226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 30-day-old adult Sprague-Dawley rats of either sex, in adherence with protocols approved by the Hunan Normal University Animal Care and Use Committee, were killed by decapitation without anesthetization, the dorsal root ganglia were removed quickly from the spinal cord, and then they were transferred into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing trypsin (0.5 g/liter, type III), collagenase (1.0 g/liter, type IA), and DNase (0.1 g/liter, type III) to incubate at 34 °C for 30 min. Trypsin inhibitor (1.5 g/liter, type II-S) was used to terminate enzyme treatment. The DRG cells were transferred into 35-mm culture dishes (Corning, Sigma) containing 95% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% newborn calf serum, hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine supplement, and penicillin-streptomycin and then incubated in the CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% air, 37 °C) for 1–4 h before the patch clamp experiment. Single ventricular cardiomyocytes were enzymatically dissociated from adult rats according to the procedures adapted from Xiao and Liang (17.Xiao Y.C. Liang S.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 477: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g) of either sex were killed by decapitation without anesthetization, and the heart was rapidly removed and rinsed in ice-cold Tyrode's solution containing (in mm): 143.0 NaCl; 5.4 KCl; 0.3 NaH2PO4; 0.5 MgCl2; 10.0 glucose; 5.0 HEPES; and 1.8 CaCl2 at pH 7.2. The heart then was mounted on a Langendorff apparatus for retrograde perfusion via the aorta with non-recirculating Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution bubbled at 37 °C by 95% O2 and 5% CO2. After 10 min, perfusate was switched to a Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution supplemented with 0.3% collagenase IA and 0.7% bovine serum albumin and the hearts were perfused in a recirculated mode for 5 min. After the enzymatic solution was replaced by KB buffer ((in mm) 70.0 l-glutanic; 25.0 KCl; 20.0 taurine; 10.0 KH2PO4; 3 MgCl2; 0.5 EGTA; 10.0 glucose; and 10.0 HEPES at pH 7.4), the partially digested hearts were cut, minced, and gently triturated with a pipette in the KB buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. The single cells were obtained after undigested tissues filtered through a 200-μm nylon mesh. All of the cells were used within 8 h of isolation. Cotton bollworm central nerve ganglion neurons were acutely dissociated and maintained in a short-term primary culture as described previously (18.He B.J. Liu A.X. Chen J.T. Sun J.S. Rui C.H. Meng X.Q. Acta Entomol. Sin. 2001; 44: 422-427Google Scholar). 10-day-old cotton bollworms were killed in 75% alcohol and washed in saline containing the following (in mm): 90 NaCl; 6 KCl; 2 MgCl2; 10 HEPES; and 140 d-glucose at pH 6.6. After being wiped off the enteron, the central nerve ganglia were removed quickly. The nerve ganglia torn then were incubated at room temperature (20–25 °C) in enzyme solution for 20 min containing the following: 90 mm NaCl; 6 mm KCl; 10 mm HEPES; 25 mm d-glucose; 115 mm d-mannitol; 0.3% trypsin; and 0.15% collagenase IV at pH 6.6. Their enzymatic digestion was stopped in 35-mm-culture dishes containing 45% TC-100 (Invitrogen), 45% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mm d-glucose, 0.6 mm glutamine, glutathione, and penicillin-streptomycin at pH 6.6. After the cells in the ganglia were gently dispersed using a suction tube, they were incubated in CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% air, 28 °C) for 2–3 h before the patch clamp experiment. Whole-cell Recording—Sodium currents were recorded from experimental cells using whole-cell patch clamp technique at room temperature (22–25 °C). Recording pipettes (2–3 μm in diameter) were made from borosilicate glass capillary tubing, and its resistances were 1.0–2.0 megohms when filled with internal solution contained the following (in mm): 135 CsF; 10 NaCl; and 5 HEPES at pH 7.0. The external bathing solution contained the following (in mm): 30 NaCl; 5 CsCl; 25 d-glucose; 1 MgCl2; 1.8 CaCl2; 5 HEPES; 20 triethanolamine chloride; and 70 tetramethylammonium chloride at pH 7.4. After establishing the whole-cell recording configuration, the resting potential was held at –80 mV for at least 4 min to allow adequate equilibration between the micropipette solution and the cell interior. Ionic currents were filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 3 kHz on EPC-9/10 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). The P/4 protocol was used to subtract linear capacitive and leakage currents. Experimental data were acquired and analyzed by the program Pulse+Pulsefit8.0 (HEKA). The needed concentrations of toxin dissolved in external solution were applied onto the surface of experimental cells by low-pressure injection with a microinjector (IM-5B, Narishige). Concerning DRG neurons containing TTX-S and TTX-R sodium channels, the cells with diameters of 30–40 μm were chosen for the experiments. Larger DRG cells (>30 μm) tended to express TTX-S VGSCs, whereas the smaller ones (<10 μm) tended to express TTX-R VGSCs (19.Su X. Wachtel R.E. Gebhart G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 277: 1180-1188Google Scholar). TTX-R currents were separated from total currents using 0.2 μm TTX blocking TTX-S channels completely. Evolutionary Tree of Spider Sodium Channel Toxins—The phylogeny of spider sodium channel toxins was constructed as described previously (14.Zhu S. Bosmans F. Tytgat J. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In our study, we focused on the spider toxins from the species in the family Mygalomorphae. Two groups of well known spider toxins (μ-agatoxin I-VI and δ-paluIT 1–4) were chosen as typical representations of the family Araneomorphae to outline the phylogeny clearly (12.Omecinsky D.O. Holub K.E. Adams M.E. Reily M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2836-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20.Corzo G. Escoubas P. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Kristensen C.P. Nakajima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5783-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Multiple sequences of spider toxins were edited using the Bioedit Sequence Alignment Editor software and then aligned and refined manually using ClustalW1.8 program (21.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (34817) Google Scholar). A pairwise distance matrix was calculated on the basis of the proportions of different amino acids. The matrix was then used to construct trees by the neighbor-joining method (MEGA2.1) (22.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). The reliability of branching patterns was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replications. Purification and Sequence Analysis of JZTX-I—The fraction of interest (JZTX-I) was purified using a combination method of ion-exchange HPLC and reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1) based on its ability to evidently increase the strength and the rate of vertebrate heartbeats (figure not shown). The molecular mass of naturally occurring toxin was determined to be 3675.64 Da by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Its full amino acid sequence was performed by N-terminal Edman degradation and found to be composed of 33 residues including six cysteines (Fig. 3A). Six cysteines were assayed to form three disulfide bridges by the molecular mass of alkalized sample, which increased 58 × 6 Da. The calculated molecular mass (3675.4 Da) corresponding to the primary sequence was consistent with the measured mass, suggesting that the C-terminal residue (Pro33) was not amidated. JZTX-I was a novel tarantula toxin exhibiting limited sequence similarity with any reported peptide but 50.0% with JZTX-III. Despite the significant sequence divergence, sequence alignment indicated that all six cysteines in JZTX-I were strictly conserved at similar positions in most spider peptides adopting a typical ICK fold such as HWTX-I, ProTx-I, and HNTX-I. Assignment of the Disulfide Bridges of JZTX-I—Fig. 2A showed the typical reverse-phase HPLC separation of the partially reduced mixture of JZTX-I by TECP. As MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis pointed out, only one intermediate was obtained and further resolved to contain one disulfide bridge in peak II, whereas peaks I and III represented intact peptide and completely reduced peptide, respectively, because their molecular masses increased by 0 (peak I), 4 (peak II), and 6 Da (peak III) compared with that of native peptide, respectively. Peak II then was collected and alkalized immediately with iodoacetamide followed by further purification using reverse-phase HPLC. Molecular mass determination and sequencing indicated that the free thiols of the fraction of interest had been alkylated. The sequencing results showed that the signals of Pth-CM-Cys signals were observed except at the 16th and 29th cycles, positively supporting that the remaining disulfide bridge was cross-linked by Cys16-Cys29. In Fig. 2B, when JZTX-I was exposed to multi-enzymes (trypsin, chromotrypsin, and V8 protease) in the buffering solution, a series of smaller enzymolytic fragments was produced and their molecular masses were measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The reverse-phase HPLC separation of the enzymolytic mixture could produce a 2176-Da fragment, which was sequenced to be Ala1-Trp6 (containing Cys2), Gly12-Phe20 (Cys16 and Cys17), and Leu28-Trp31 (Cys29), as described in Fig. 2B, inset. Thus two disulfide bridges should be paired among Cys2, Cys16, Cys17, and Cys29. Because a disulfide bridge between Cys16 and Cys29 had been determined above, we concluded that the second was cross-linked between Cys2 and Cys17. Accordingly, by process of elimination, the third disulfide bond was between Cys9 and Cys22. Therefore, the disulfide linkage of JZTX-I was homologous to that for ICK peptides from spider venoms, such as ProTxs, HWTX-IV, and HNTX-I, as well as conotoxins (δ-, μ-, κ-, and ω-), although the positions of six cysteines were not conserved between them (13.Peng K.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing JZTX-I cDNA—The full-length cDNA sequence of JZTX-I was completed by overlaying two fragments resulting from 3′- and 5′-RACE. As shown in Fig. 3B, the oligonucleotide sequence of the cDNA was a 383-bp bond found to comprise a 5′-untranslated region, open reading frame, and 3′-untranslated region. The open reading frame encoded a 63-residue peptide (Swiss-Prot accession number AJ854060) corresponding to the JZTX-I precursor that contained a signal peptide of 21 residues, a propeptide of 8 residues, and a mature peptide of 33 residues. The pre-proregion composed of a signal peptide and a propeptide is a hydrophobic peptide common to all spider toxins. Furthermore, its homology is important proof that spider toxins can be grouped into different superfamilies to analyze their evolutionary relationship. The pre-propeptide of JZTX-I precursor showed limited sequence identity with that of other reported precursors but 66.7 and 57.1% with JZTX-III and GsMTx-4 (16.Xiao Y. Tang J. Yang Y. Wang M. Hu W.

Chino N. Gottlieb P.A. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), respectively. Different from most spider sodium channel toxins, JZTX-I had no extra amino acid residues Gly or (Gly + Arg/Lys) at its C terminus known to allow “post-modification” and α-amidation at the C-terminal residue (27.Diao J.B. Lin Y. Tang J.Z. Liang S.P. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), also implying that the C-terminal residue of mature toxin is not amidated. A polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) emerged in the 3′-untranslated region at position 17 upstream of the poly(A). Effects of JZTX-I on Sodium Currents—TTX-S and TTX-R VGSCs co-express in adult rat DRG neurons (1.Ogata N. Tatebayashi H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 466: 9-37Google Scholar), whereas only TTX-S type is distributed in cotton bollworm central nerve ganglion neurons (18.He B.J. Liu A.X. Chen J.T. Sun J.S. Rui C.H. Meng X.Q. Acta Entomol. Sin. 2001; 44: 422-427Google Scholar). TTX-R VGSCs are the primary type in adult rat ventricular myocytes, although Maier et al. (28.Maier S.K. Westenbroek R.E. Schenkman K.A. Feigl E.O. Scheuer T. Catterall A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4073-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) suggest that some brain TTX-S subtypes are situated in its transverse tubules (28.Maier S.K. Westenbroek R.E. Schenkman K.A. Feigl E.O. Scheuer T. Catterall A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4073-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The sodium channels expressing in these tissues have been defined as different isoforms based on their divergent amino acid sequences. Generally, TTX-R sodium currents activated and inactivated more slowly than TTX-S types under whole-cell configuration. JZTX-I at 1 μm in the bath solution was resistant to control TTX-R sodium currents in rat DRG neurons (Fig. 4A, n = 5) but sensitive to TTX-R currents in ventricular myocytes and TTX-S currents in sensory neurons (Fig. 4, B–D). JZTX-I evidently inhibited channel inactivation with distinct affinity on three tested tissues without changing peak current amplitudes or the time of current peak. A similar result was detected after the application of β-pompilidotoxin, which was considered to selectively interfere with sodium channel inactivation process without affecting the activation (29.Kinoshita E. Maejima H. Yamaoka K. Konno K. Kawai N. Shimizu E. Yokote S. Nakayama H. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the toxin then was assayed by measuring the I5ms/Ipeak ratio, which gave an estimate of the probability for the channel not to be inactivated after 5 ms. JZTX-I at 1 μm inhibited channel inactivation of TTX-S currents in rat DRG neurons by 51.2 ± 8.0% (Fig. 4B, n = 20), whereas an equal inhibition of TTX-R currents was achieved in rat cardiac myocytes exposed to the toxin only at 50 nm (Fig. 4C, n = 5). The toxin at 1 μm could slow the decay of TTX-S sodium currents in cotton bollworm neurons by 52.4 ± 6.8% (Fig. 4D, n = 11). All of the inhibitions above were in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner, and their IC50 values were assessed to be 0.13 μm, 31.6 nm, and 0.76 μm, respectively (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, we checked the ion component of the inward currents maintained at the ending of depolarizing pulse. Because they could be eliminated in both rat DRG and insect neurons by TTX (0.2 μm) completely in Fig. 4B (n = 8), ion currents were still conducted through sodium chan"

As such, these molecules are the focus of much research with the ultimate aim of developing novel therapies. We have described previously a non-competitive small molecule antagonist of CCR1 (UCB 35625), which we hypothesized interacted with amino acids located within the receptor transmembrane (TM) helices (Sabroe, I., Peck, M. J., Jan Van Keulen, B., Jorritsma, A., Simmons, G., Clapham, P. R., Williams, T. J., and Pease, J. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 25985-25992). Here we describe an approach to identifying the mechanism by which the molecule antagonizes CCR1. Thirty-three point mutants of CCR1 were expressed transiently in L1.2 cells, and the cells were assessed for their capacity to migrate in response to CCL3 in the presence or absence of UCB 35625. Cells expressing the mutant constructs Y41A (TM helix 1, or TM1), Y113A (TM3), and E287A (TM7) were responsive to CCL3 but resistant to the antagonist, consistent with a role for the TM helices in CCR1 interactions with UCB 35625. Subsequent molecular modeling successfully docked the compound with CCR1 and suggests that the antagonist ligates TM1, 2, and 7 of CCR1 and severely impedes access to TM2 and TM3, a region thought to be perturbed by the chemokine amino terminus during the process of receptor activation. Insights into the mechanism of action of these compounds may facilitate the development of more potent antagonists that show promise as future therapeutic agents in the treatment of inflammatory disease.

Chemokines represent a family of ∼50 proteins that are involved in the cellular migration of leukocytes under basal conditions and in situations of underlying inflammation (1Zlotnik A. Yoshie O.

Because the chemokine system is implicated in many disease processes involving chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, allergy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and tumor metastasis (2Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat.

Initially this receptor was identified as the CCL3/MIP-1α and CCL5/RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) receptor, but later studies have shown it to bind and signal in response to a variety of chemokines including CCL8/MCP-2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein), CCL7/MCP-3, CCL15/Lkn-1, CCL24/MPIF-1 (myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor), and CCL14/HCC-1 (hemofiltrate CC-chemokine) (5Gong X.

Thus, antagonism of CCR1 is an attractive therapeutic ambition for the treatment of a wide range of diseases.Several studies have been published to date on the interactions of chemokine receptors with small molecule antagonists. Certain features, typical of antagonists, are apparent. In general, chemokine receptor antagonists possess an halogen-modified aromatic ring system and a basic region (18Onuffer J.J. Horuk R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Antagonism of the CCL2 receptor, CCR2, by spiropiperidine-derived compounds has been postulated to involve an interaction between a glutamic acid residue found in TM7 of the receptor and a basic nitrogen atom within the compound (19Mirzadegan T. Diehl F. Ebi B. Bhakta S. Polsky I. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Weatherhead G.S. Lapierre J.M. Dankwardt J. Morgans Jr., D. Wilhelm R. Jarnagin K. J. Biol.

Similarly, a glutamate residue in an analogous location in CCR5 and CXCR4 has been shown to be important for interactions with the antagonists TAK-779 and AMD3100 respectively (20Dragic T. Trkola A.

Horuk R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar and 22Horuk R. Ernst. Schering Res. Found. Workshop. 2004; 44: 169-190Google Scholar), including a compound named UCB 35625 (the trans-isomer J113863 published by Banyu Pharmaceutical Company, patent WO98/04554). We have previously characterized this compound as a potent inhibitor of CCR1 that is effective at low nanomolar concentrations despite an apparent inability to displace CCL3 from the receptor (23Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This characterization led us to hypothesize that the molecule exerts its antagonistic effects by interacting with amino acids within an intra-helical binding pocket of CCR1 and stabilizing the receptor in an inactive conformation that cannot induce signal transduction but can still bind ligand. We report here the findings from a large scale mutagenesis study directed at the TM domains of CCR1 to examine this hypothesis directly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen, unless stated otherwise. Recombinant CCL3 was purchased from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, United Kingdom). The monoclonal anti-human CCR1 antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was purchased from DAKO (Ely, United Kingdom).Generation of a Model Structure of CCR1—A computer model of the human CCR1 receptor was built on the solved structure of bovine rhodopsin (24Palczewski K.

The modeling software used was QUANTA (release 4.0; MSI) running on a Silicon Graphics INDIGO2 work station under the UNIX operating system. The “Modeler” option (26Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10390) Google Scholar) within QUANTA was used to build 20 models of the CCR1 receptor, including a conserved disulfide bridge. The different models were calculated by varying the initial model and optimizing the objective function using conjugate gradients and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing that employed the CHARMm force field (27Brooks B.

The model with the lowest objective function was chosen for further study and allowed the estimation of which TM residues of CCR1 were likely to project their side chains into the helix bundle of the receptor and therefore be available for interactions with the compound. This facilitated the design of relevant point mutations within CCR1.A structural model of the TM regions of human CCR1 was subsequently built using the program DeepView/Swiss-Pdb Viewer (ca.expasy.org/spdbv/), which was also used for the manual docking of UCB 35625 to the receptor. Energy minimization was performed using the Gromos96 implementation of the Swiss-Pdb Viewer. The final representations of the TM regions of CCR1 were obtained with the program PyMol (www.pymol.org).Generation of Hemagglutinin-tagged CCR1—CCR1 cDNA was excised from CCR1.pREP9 (4Gao J-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), a kind gift of Dr. Philip Murphy, Laboratory of Host Defenses, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. The amino terminus of CCR1 was tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope by PCR using the sense primer 5′-GCGCATAAGCTTGCCACCATGTATCCATAT GATGTCCCAGATTATGCCAAAGAATTCGAAACTCCAAACACCACAGAGGA-3′and the antisense primer SP6 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATAC-3′. The PCR product was then inserted back into pcDNA3.1 at the HindIII and XhoI sites, and its authenticity was verified by fluorescent DNA sequencing of both strands (MWG-Biotech, Milton Keynes, UK).Generation of Point Mutants—Point mutants of CCR1 were generated by PCR using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fidelity of each construct was verified by DNA sequencing on both strands.Tissue Culture—L1.2 cells were maintained as described previously (29Martinelli R. Sabroe I. LaRosa G. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42957-42964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in suspension at 37 °C with 5% CO2 at a density of no more than 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation as described previously (29Martinelli R. Sabroe I. LaRosa G. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42957-42964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼1 × 106 cells per microgram of DNA were electroporated and incubated overnight with medium supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were harvested and assayed the following day.Flow Cytometry—Approximately 5 × 105 cells were harvested, washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated with the primary antibody or the corresponding IgG isotype control for 15 min in a final volume of 100 μl. Cells were then washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer and incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibody for 15 min in a final volume of 50 μl. Subsequently, cells were washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer and resuspended in a final volume of 400 μl before being analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (30Auger G.A. Pease J.E. Shen X. Xanthou G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The anti-CCR1 antibody was used at 10 μg/ml, the anti-hemagglutinin antibody was used at 5 μg/ml, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was used at a 1:50 dilution. All incubations were carried out on ice.Chemotaxis Assay—Assays of chemotactic responsiveness were performed using ChemoTx™ plates (Receptor Technologies Limited, Oxon, UK) as described previously (29Martinelli R. Sabroe I. LaRosa G. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42957-42964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, different concentrations of CCL3 in the presence or absence of a fixed concentration of UCB 35625 were loaded onto the bottom wells in a final volume of 31 μl. The 5-μm pore filter was placed on top of the wells, and 2 × 105 cells in a volume of 20 μl were loaded onto the filter. Following incubation for 5 h in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the numbers of cells migrating into the well were counted using a hemocytometer. In a primary screen, all 33 point mutants were assessed at least three times in duplicate using concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nm CCL3. Mutants of interest were further characterized over a greater concentration range of CCL3. In every experiment, cells transiently expressing the wild-type CCR1 construct were employed as a positive control.Competitive Radioligand Binding Assays—[125I]CCL3 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and had a specific activity of ∼ 2000 Ci/mmol. Whole cell binding assays on transiently transfected L1.2 cells were performed as described previously (31Xanthou G. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using 0.05 nm radiolabeled CCL3 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor. In all experiments, each data point was assayed in duplicate. Data are presented as the percentage of counts obtained in the absence of cold competing ligand. Curve fitting and subsequent data analyses were carried out using the program PRISM, and IC50 values were deducted from non-linear regression analysis.RESULTSPreviously, we have described the compound UCB 35625 (Fig. 1A) as a potent inhibitor of CCR1 at nanomolar concentrations, concentrations at which it is unable to displace the ligand from the receptor (23Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that the compound interacts with the TM helices of the receptor, thereby inhibiting the conformational changes necessary to initiate intracellular signaling (23Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To examine this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate a large panel of TM mutants. These constructs were expressed in a leukocyte cell line, and the effects of mutation upon the migratory response to ligand and sensitivity to UCB 35625 were determined.UCB 35625 Inhibits the Chemotaxis of L1.2 Cells Transiently Expressing CCR1—To examine such a large panel of mutants, a means of transiently expressing the constructs was desirable. Previously, we have described the transient expression of the receptors CCR3 and CXCR3 in the L1.2 murine pre-B cell background (30Auger G.A. Pease J.E. Shen X. Xanthou G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Xanthou G. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32Xanthou G. Duchesnes C.E. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Using this system, CCR1 was transiently expressed at high levels on the surface of L1.2 cells as detected by flow cytometry after incubation with the anti-CCR1 antibody (Fig. 1B). CCR1-transfected cells were then assayed in a chemotaxis assay to determine their ability to migrate in response to increasing concentrations of CCL3 in the presence or absence of UCB 35625 (Fig. 1C). CCR1-transfected L1.2 cells migrated in response to low nanomolar concentrations of CCL3, and this response was inhibited by the presence of 100 nm UCB 35625. Naïve cells were unresponsive to similar concentrations of CCL3, and no detectable cell surface expression of CCR1 was evident (Fig. 1B).Residue Glu-287 Is Important for the Interaction of UCB 35625 with CCR1—An initial screen targeted four acidic amino acids (Asp-80, Asp-92, Glu-120, and Glu-287) in the TMs of CCR1, because we hypothesized that one of these residues was likely to act as the counterion for the positively charged quaternary nitrogen of UCB 35625 (Fig. 1A) (19Mirzadegan T. Diehl F. Ebi B. Bhakta S. Polsky I. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Weatherhead G.S. Lapierre J.M. Dankwardt J. Morgans Jr., D. Wilhelm R. Jarnagin K. J. Biol.

Sakmar T.P. Moore J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5639-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Residue Asp-80 is highly conserved among G protein-coupled receptors, and mutation of this residue in CCR5 has been reported previously to lead to the loss of certain intracellular responses without affecting ligand binding (33Farzan M. Choe H. Martin K.A. Sun Y. Sidelko M. Mackay C.R. Gerard N.P. Sodroski J. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6854-6857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Each residue was mutated in turn to its amide counterpart to minimize undue conformation changes within the receptor.All four mutant receptors were expressed at the cell surface at levels comparable with those observed for wild-type CCR1, as deduced by flow cytometry (Fig. 2, A, C, E, and G). Migration in response to CCL3 was also observed for all four mutant receptors, albeit with some reduction in efficacy compared with that of wild-type CCR1 (Fig. 2, B, D, F, and H). UCB 35625 inhibited CCL3-induced migration of these mutants in all but one case. Cells expressing the mutant receptor E287Q migrated in response to CCL3, but this response was not inhibited in the presence of 100 nm UCB 35625 (Fig. 2H), suggesting that E287 in TM7 interacts with the compound. Interestingly, the highly conserved Asp-80 residue does not seem to be essential for chemotaxis mediated by CCR1, as cells expressing the mutant D80N still migrated in a dose-dependent manner to CCL3 (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Residue Glu-287 is required for the interaction of UCB 35625 with CCR1. L1.2 cells were transiently transfected separately with the cDNAs for D80N, D92N, E120Q, or E287Q. 24 h post-transfection, cells were stained with the anti-CCR1 antibody to detect expression of these constructs on the surface of the cells. Expression of the mutant receptors is shown in gray and is compared with the staining profile of the untransfected L1.2 cells in black (A, C, E, and G). All four constructs were capable of migrating in response to CCL3 (B, D, F, and H). In the presence of 100 nm UCB, only cells expressing the E287Q mutant were capable of chemotaxis (H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mapping the Site of Interaction for CCR1-UCB 35625—The structure of CCR1 was initially modeled upon the published crystal structure of rhodopsin (24Palczewski K.

The resulting model allowed us to estimate which TM residues of CCR1 were likely to project their side chains into the helix bundle of the receptor and be available for interactions with the compound (Fig. 3). Candidate residues within each TM domain were individually mutated to alanine. These mutants were generated and transfected into L1.2 cells as detailed above. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, expression of the constructs was visualized by flow cytometry. With the exception of the construct Y118A, all of the mutants examined were expressed on the surface of L1.2 cells at respectable levels approaching those of wild-type CCR1 (Fig. 4). Permeabilization of Y118A-transfected cells showed that this mutant receptor was expressed intracellularly (data not shown), suggesting that its trafficking to the membrane is compromised as a result of mutation.Fig. 3The amino acid sequence of CCR1.

For practical reasons, only the responses of the constructs to 10 nm CCL3 are shown (Fig. 5). For the vast majority of the constructs assayed, chemotaxis to CCL3 was abolished in the presence of UCB 35625 with the exception of cells expressing the mutants Y41A, Y113A, and E287Q, which were significantly resistant to the compound. The majority of constructs assayed presented with a chemotactic profile similar to that of wild-type (data not shown), with the exception of the L87A construct. Cells expressing this mutant were completely unable to migrate in response to CCL3 (Fig. 6A), despite flow cytometry studies suggesting that it was expressed on the surface of L1.2 cells at levels comparable of those observed for CCR1 (Fig. 4). Subsequent experiments employing 125I-CCL3 in a competitive binding assay confirmed that the L87A mutant was expressed at the cell surface and bound CCL3 with an affinity very similar to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 6B).Fig. 5The ability of UCB 35625 to inhibit CCL3-induced chemotactic responses of L1.2 cells transiently expressing the CCR1 point mutants. The panel of CCR1 mutants was tested for the ability to migrate in response to a limited concentration range of 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 nm CCL3 in the presence or absence of a fixed 100 nm concentration of UCB 35625. The percentage of inhibition was calculated using an equation in which the percentage of inhibition = 100 - (the number of cells migrating in the presence of the agonist ÷ the number of cells migrating in the absence of the antagonist × 100). Where no chemotaxis was observed in the presence of the antagonist, inhibition was described as 100%. For practical reasons, only the inhibition of the responses of each construct to a 10 nm concentration of CCL3 is illustrated.

https://openalex.org/W1998813225,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. The GABA receptor type C (GABAC) is a ligand-gated ion channel with pharmacological properties distinct from the GABAA receptor. To date, only three binding domains in the recombinant ρ1 GABAC receptor have been recognized among six potential regions. In this report, using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we scanned three potential regions previously unexplored in the ρ1 GABAC receptor, corresponding to the binding loops A, E, and F in the structural model for ligand-gated ion channels. The cysteine accessibility scanning and agonist/antagonist protection tests have resulted in the identification of residues in loops A and E, but not F, involved in forming the GABAC receptor agonist binding pocket. Three of these newly identified residues are in a novel region corresponding to the extended stretch of loop E. In addition, the cysteine accessibility pattern suggests that part of loop A and part of loop E have a β-strand structure, whereas loop F is a random coil. Finally, when all of the identified ligand binding residues are mapped onto a three-dimensional homology model of the amino-terminal domain of the ρ1 GABAC receptor, they are facing toward the putative binding pocket. Combined with previous findings, a complete model of the GABAC receptor binding pocket was proposed and discussed in comparison with the GABAA receptor binding pocket. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.

GABAA 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, GABA receptor, type A; GABAC, GABA receptor, type C; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; 3-APA, 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid; MTSET, methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium.1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, GABA receptor, type A; GABAC, GABA receptor, type C; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; 3-APA, 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid; MTSET, methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium. and GABAC receptors are both GABA-gated chloride channels but with very different pharmacological properties. In fact, that is the basis for their classification. Although both types of receptors can be activated by GABA, the GABAA receptor can be specifically antagonized by bicuculline. In contrast, the GABAC receptor is insensitive to bicuculline but can be selectively antagonized by 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (1Johnston G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 319-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional properties of these two types of GABA receptors are also different. For example, the GABAC receptor has higher GABA sensitivity but slower activation and deactivation kinetics than the GABAA receptor (2Amin J. Weiss D. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar). The GABAC receptor also shows almost no desensitization (2Amin J. Weiss D. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the GABAA receptor exhibits strong desensitization (3Chang Y. Gansah E. Chen Y. Ye J. Weiss D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7982-7990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the functional differences could arise from differences in the structural architecture of the GABA binding pockets, distinct antagonist profiles of GABAA and GABAC receptors indicate that their agonist/antagonist binding pockets are not the same. Studies over the last 15 years have shaped a relatively complete model for the GABAA receptor (4Amin J. Weiss D. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Sigel E.

Society for Neuroscience 33rd Annual Meeting, New Orleans, Nov. 8–12, 2003, Program Number 50.10. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar). In contrast, structural information on the GABAC receptor agonist binding pocket is far from complete. Some candidate binding residues in several potential “binding loops” are still undefined. GABA-gated ion channels belong to the ligand-gated ion channel family, which also includes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin-3 receptors, and glycine receptors. The study of nicotinic receptors in the past two decades has shaped a structural model for the ligand-gated ion channel family. In this model, six loops designated A–F have been identified to participate in the formation of the agonist binding pocket (10Corringer P. Le Novère N. Changeux J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). This structural model was further confirmed and extended by the crystal structure of the homologous acetylcholine-binding protein, AChBP (11Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Cumulating evidence suggests a similar general structural architecture for all members of this ligand-gated ion channel family. For example, in the GABA receptor, two ligand binding domains identified in the β2 subunit (4Amin J. Weiss D. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and the ρ1 subunit (2Amin J. Weiss D. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar) can be mapped to the homologous residues in loops B and C. One binding domain identified in the α1 subunit (5Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Smith G. Olsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also in the ρ1 subunit (13Torres V. Weiss D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43741-43748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) can be mapped to loop D in the complementary face. More recently, two residues contributed from loop A of the β2 subunit (7Boileau A. Glen Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2931-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), three residues from loop F (8Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13166-13172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and two residues from loop E of the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor have been identified as binding residues (9Holden J. Czajkowski C. Society for Neuroscience 33rd Annual Meeting, New Orleans, Nov. 8–12, 2003, Program Number 50.10. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar). Furthermore, the secondary structure of the GABA receptor is in agreement with the AChBP-based structural model (6Boileau A. Evers A. Davis A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Boileau A. Glen Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2931-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13166-13172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Due to agonist specificity and sequence diversity, key residues involved in agonist binding in different ligand-gated ion channels are not the same. Nevertheless, the similarity of the general architecture in this receptor family suggests that the AChBP-based structural model can be used as a guideline in search of the complete model of the GABA receptor agonist binding pocket. The substituted cysteine accessibility method was first implemented in ion channels to identify pore-lining residues in nicotinic and GABA receptors (14Akabas M. Stauffer D. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 15Xu M. Akabas M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Wilson G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This approach is based on a functional effect of modification of the substituted cysteine by a water-soluble sulfhydryl-reactive compound. If such a modification occurs in a functionally important domain of the receptor, it is likely to produce a change in receptor function. By testing the functional effect of a water-soluble cysteine modification reagent and blockability of this effect by agonist and antagonist, the substituted cysteine accessibility method has also been successfully used to probe the binding sites of the GABAA (6Boileau A. Evers A. Davis A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Holden J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Sullivan D. Cohen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12651-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). With this approach, novel residues involved in agonist binding were identified, and the secondary structures of the newly identified domain were predicted (6Boileau A. Evers A. Davis A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Boileau A. Glen Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2931-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, using cysteine accessibility scanning and agonist/antagonist protection tests, we have identified amino acid residues involved in agonist binding in novel regions of the ρ1 GABAC receptor subunit corresponding to loops A and E in nicotinic receptor subunits. The newly identified binding residues in loop A and part of loop E are in comparable positions as in the GABAA receptor. Moreover, in the extended stretch of loop E, a region previously unexplored in GABA-gated ion channels, we have identified three novel binding residues in the ρ1 GABAC receptor. In contrast to the GABAA receptor, loop F in the ρ1 homomeric GABAC receptor does not appear to be involved in agonist binding. Using the AChBP crystal structure as a template, we have built a homology model for the amino-terminal domain of the ρ1 GABA receptor. These newly discovered binding residues, along with previously identified binding residues, are mapped to the homology model to construct a complete agonist binding pocket for the GABAC receptor. Mutagenesis and cRNA Preparation—The cDNA encoding the human ρ1 GABA receptor subunit was cloned into the pGEMHE vector in the T7 orientation (20Chang Y. Weiss D.

The residues in the amino-terminal segments corresponding to loops A, E, and F in nicotinic receptor subunits were mutated to cysteine, one at a time, using the PCR-based QuikChange method of site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, Hercules, CA). The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The fragments containing individual mutations were subcloned and resequenced to avoid additional mutations. The wild type and mutant cDNAs were then linearized by NheI digestion. The cRNAs were transcribed by standard in vitro transcription protocols. Briefly, RNase-free DNA templates were prepared by treating linearized DNA with proteinase K. cRNAs then were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. After degradation of the DNA template by RNase-free DNase I, the cRNAs were purified and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. cRNA yield and integrity were examined on a 1% agarose gel. Oocyte Preparation and Receptor Expression—Female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI) were anesthetized by 0.2% MS-222. The ovarian lobes were surgically removed from the frog and placed in calcium-free oocyte Ringer (OR2) incubation solution consisting of (in mm) 82.5 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 Na2HPO4, and 5 HEPES; 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.5. The frog was then allowed to recover from surgery before being returned to the incubation tank. The lobes were cut into small pieces and digested with 0.3% collagenase A (Roche Applied Science) with constant stirring at room temperature for 1.5–2 h. The dispersed oocytes were thoroughly rinsed with the above solution plus 1 mm CaCl2. The stage VI oocytes were selected, and the follicular layer (if still present) was manually removed with fine forceps. The oocytes were incubated at 16 °C before injection. Micropipettes for cRNA injection were pulled from borosilicate glass (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) on a Sutter P87 horizontal puller, and the tips were cut with forceps to ≈40 μm in diameter. The cRNA, with proper dilution in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, was drawn up into the micropipette and injected into oocytes with a Nanoject microinjection system (Drummond Scientific) at a total volume of 20–60 nl. Electrophysiology—One to three days after cRNA injection, the oocyte was placed in a 100-μl chamber with continuous oocyte Ringer perfusion. The oocyte Ringer was used as an extracellular solution, which consisted of (in mm) 92.5 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5. The chamber was grounded through an agarose bridge to prevent the influence of the cysteine modification reagent on the reference electrode. The oocytes were voltage-clamped at -70 mV to measure GABA-induced currents using a GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For the cysteine accessibility test, 1 mm MTSET was applied for 1 min. The current responses to GABA at a concentration inducing ∼20% of the maximum GABA response (∼EC20) were examined before and after MTSET modification. For agonist/antagonist protection, a super-saturation concentration (>100-fold of EC50) of agonist/antagonist was co-applied with 1 mm MTSET for 1 min to ensure adequate protection in the binding pocket. Drug Preparation—GABA (Calbiochem) stock solution (100 mm) was prepared daily from the solid. 3-Aminopropylphosphonic acid (3-APA, Sigma) stock solution (100 mm) was prepared and frozen in aliquots before use. MTSET (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) stock solution (100 mm) was prepared in pure water and frozen in aliquots. MTSET (1 mm in OR2) was freshly prepared from the stock solution for each oocyte immediately before use. Data Analysis—The dose-response relationship of the GABA-induced current in recombinant GABAC receptors was least squares fit to the following Hill equation I=Imax1+(EC50/[GABA]) n(Eq. 1) where the GABA-induced current (I) is a function of the GABA concentration, EC50 is the GABA concentration required for inducing a half-maximal current, n is the Hill coefficient, and Imax is the maximum current. The maximum current was then used to normalize the dose-response curve for each individual oocyte. The average of the normalized currents for each GABA concentration was used to plot the data. All the data were presented as mean ± S.E. (standard error). Statistics—The statistical significance of the effect of MTSET on the GABA-induced current in wild type and mutant receptors was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with the Dunnett post test. The significance of agonist/antagonist protection of MTSET modulation was evaluated by grouped student t test using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Homology Modeling—Three-dimensional modeling of the ρ1 GABA receptor amino-terminal domain was made based on the crystal structure of AChBP deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 1I9B (11Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar)). Low sequence homology between GABA receptor and AChBP did not allow straightforward or confident modeling by commonly used automatic methods such as Swiss-Model (21Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4480) Google Scholar). Thus, a manual method was used. An electron density map of AChBP was calculated to 1.8 Å resolution, based on the coordinates of one of the monomers in the 1I9B Protein Data Bank entry. The AChBP model was imbedded in the electron density. With the sequence alignment as a guide, residues of the AChBP model were graphically mutated using the molecular graphics program QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Residues were mutated to residue types as indicated by sequence alignment along randomly chosen stretches of the AChBP sequence. The new side chain atoms were automatically best fit into the electron density by the QUANTA program. The best rotamers were chosen to fit density and avoid steric clashes with other parts of the molecule. Where deletions and insertions were made, structural regularization and the best rotamers were used to model surrounding and inserted residues. Manual movements of residues and side chains were made when the QUANTA automatic features were not able to resolve steric clashes. The parts of the sequence that were homologous provided many points between which regularization could be anchored. After the entire sequence was mutated and manually modeled, the structure was energy-minimized using the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) program suite (22Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). The structural alignment program TOP (23Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was used to align the modeled monomer with each of the five AChBP monomers in the 1I9B structure. Finally, the entire pentameric structure, with sequences mutated to that of the GABA receptor, was energy-minimized using CNS. Visualization of the Binding Pocket—For three-dimensional presentation of the binding pocket, the newly identified binding residues along with the previously identified ones were mapped onto the homology model using the molecular graphics program Deep View. The resulting image was saved as a POV-Ray 3.5 scene file. The final image of the model was rendered by POV-Ray 3.6 software. Location of the Scanning Regions—To determine the scanning regions, we used the AChBP-based structural model of the amino-terminal domain of ligand-gated ion channels as a reference. Fig. 1 shows the alignment of the ρ1 GABA receptor subunit and AChBP partial sequences. We defined six potential binding loops in the GABA receptor ρ1 subunit (Fig. 1, underlined residues). Since the critical residues for agonist binding in loops B, C, and D of the ρ1 GABA receptor subunit have been previously identified (highlighted in bold) (2Amin J. Weiss D. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar, 13Torres V. Weiss D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43741-43748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in this study, we selected loops A, E, and F of the ρ1 GABA receptor subunit for cysteine scanning. The bold letters in the AChBP highlight the amino acid residues previously identified to participate in the formation of the agonist binding pocket in nicotinic receptors. The residues of the ρ1 GABA receptor subunit marked with a c above the residue are designated for cysteine scanning in this study. Functional Properties of the Cysteine Mutants—Wild type and single cysteine mutants were individually expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The functional expression and dose-response relationship were examined for all the constructs. Fig. 2A shows dose-response relationships of representative mutants with significant changes in GABA sensitivities. Using least squares fitting to individual GABA dose-response relationships with Equation 1, we have derived EC50 values for the wild type and mutant receptors (Table I). -Fold changes in the EC50 for all mutants (normalized to the wild type receptor) are plotted in Fig. 2B. The alternating pattern in EC50 changes between L166C and V171C in loop E and between S223C and F227C in loop F may suggest a β-strand structure in these two regions. Note that in loop A, mutants W133C, P135C, and F139C are not functional. Interestingly, the F146C mutant exhibited a high leak current in the absence of GABA, which was blocked by picrotoxin (data not shown). This suggests that the mutation created a spontaneously opening channel. This residue is aligned to an interface residue, Lys-94, in AChBP. In loop E, G163C was nonfunctional. This residue is conserved across the subunits in the ligand-gated ion channel family and is located in the subunit interface in AChBP. In the same loop, the expression of the mutant R158C was extremely low, and the mutants L166C and S168C showed a significant increase in EC50, suggesting that they may be involved in ligand binding. In fact, these three residues are aligned to the ligand binding residues Arg-104, Leu-112, and Met-114 in the AChBP (11Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The mutant Q160C also showed spontaneous opening in the absence of agonist. This residue is presumably aligned to another ligand binding residue, Val-106, in AChBP. In loop F, only minor changes in channel function were observed (Table I), with the most significant change being an ∼20-fold increase in the EC50 (Q226C).Table IEC50 values determined from the GABA dose-response relationship in the individual cysteine mutants of the p1 homomeric GABA receptor NF, nonfunctional; LE, low expression; SO, spontaneously opening.Loop ALoop ELoop FMutantEC50MutantEC50MutantEC50μmμmμmW133CNFV155C0.88 ± 0.06L216C0.60 ± 0.03V134C0.66 ± 0.02M156C7.21 ± 0.94K217C0.75 ± 0.06P135CNFL157C1.53 ± 0.20T218C1.03 ± 0.04D136C387.6 ± 62.3R158CLED219C3.02 ± 0.25M137C0.72 ± 0.07V159C0.97 ± 0.05E220C1.46 ± 0.11F138C5.94 ± 0.43Q160CSOR221C0.51 ± 0.02F139CNFP161C0.85 ± 0.05I222C0.50 ± 0.03V140C0.39 ± 0.07D162C0.71 ± 0.02S223C0.66 ± 0.01H141C3.65 ± 0.41G163CNFL224C3.38 ± 0.36S142C2.41 ± 0.17K164C0.69 ± 0.10S225C0.53 ± 0.02K143CLEV165C2.17 ± 0.12Q226C17.6 ± 3.58R144C1.66 ± 0.06L166C13.04 ± 1.56F227C0.38 ± 0.32S145C8.50 ± 0.51Y167C0.52 ± 0.05F146CSOS168C399.9 ± 70.7I147C3.92 ± 0.38L169C0.17 ± .00R170C10.84 ± 2.23V171C0.65 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab Accessibility of the Engineered Cysteine by MTSET—To further delineate the binding pocket of the ρ1 GABAC receptor, we examined the accessibility of the individual engineered cysteines in putative loops A, E, and F to a water-soluble thio-reactive compound, MTSET. The oocytes were treated with 1 mm MTSET for 1 min. The currents induced by a GABA concentration (∼EC20) before and after the MTSET treatment were recorded for each cell. The normalized current change upon treatment was calculated and plotted in Fig. 3. MTSET treatment of the wild type receptor did not significantly alter the GABA-induced current. Therefore, any significant change after MTSET treatment is due to the modification of the engineered cysteine by this compound. For loop A, MTSET had a significant effect on the GABA-induced currents in the oocytes expressing D136C, F138C, V140C, H141C, and I147C, suggesting that residues at these positions are accessible to MTSET modification. Accessible mutants in loop E were V155C, M156C, V159C, L166C, S168C, and R170C. In loop F, most of the residues (L216C, T218C, D219C, R221C, I222C, L224C, S225C, Q226C, and F227C) were accessible. After reacting with MTSET, S225C in loop F opened in the absence of GABA. Protection of Accessible Residues by GABA—If a cysteine residue lines the agonist binding pocket, then the binding of agonist to the receptor would block or restrict the accessibility of that residue to a modification reagent. To examine whether the accessible cysteines can be blocked by GABA, a saturating concentration of GABA was co-applied with 1 mm MTSET. The co-application of GABA with MTSET significantly reduced the alteration of the GABA response by MTSET for the following mutants: D136C, F138C, and V140C in loop A and V155C, M156C, V159C, S168C, and R170C in loop E (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, none of the residues in loop F were protected by GABA from MTSET modification. These results suggest that loop F of GABAC ρ1 receptor may not line the GABA binding pocket, whereas the GABA-protected residues in loops A and E are potential residues participating in the formation of the GABA binding pocket. However, due to global conformational changes induced by GABA, accessibility of residues in other regions of the receptor distant from the agonist binding pocket would potentially be altered in the presence of GABA. Therefore, a competitive antagonist protection experiment would further test whether these residues line the binding pocket. Protection of Accessible Residues by 3-APA—3-APA is a GABAC receptor-competitive antagonist, presumably competing with the agonist for the same binding site but without inducing a similar conformational change (24Chang Y. Weiss D. Nature Neuroscience. 2002; 5: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A saturating concentration of 3-APA was co-applied with 1 mm MTSET to the oocytes expressing individual cysteine mutants of the ρ1 GABA receptor. Fig. 5 shows that 3-APA has a protection pattern similar to that for GABA. That is, the mutants D136C, F138C, and V140C in loop A and the mutants V155C, M156C, V159C, S168C, and R170C in loop E were efficiently protected by this competitive antagonist, whereas no residue in loop F was protected. These data suggest that D136C, F138C, and S142C in loop A and V155C, M156C, V159C, S168C, and R170C in loop E are most likely lining the agonist/antagonist binding pocket of the GABA ρ1 receptor. Identification of Novel Binding Residues in the Binding Pocket—If a residue directly interacts with the agonist, then mutation of the residue would be expected to decrease the binding affinity. With the cysteine mutations, we have identified several residues that, when mutated, reduced agonist sensitivity of the GABA receptor. The sensitivity decrease by mutation could be due to the reduction of binding affinity or a decrease in the maximum open probability (25Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 923-948Crossref Scopus (782) Google Scholar). A pure gating effect on EC50, however, is limited in the ρ1 homomeric GABA receptor. For example, the previously established three-bind-to-open model (26Amin J. Weiss D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 263: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) predicts that a decrease in gating efficiency of 100-fold in the ρ1 homomeric GABA receptor would only result in an increase in the EC50 of ∼4-fold (27Chang Y. Covey D. Weiss D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the mutations with an increase in EC50 for more than 4-fold, such as D136C (loop A), L166C, S168C, R170C (loop E), and Q226C (loop F), likely have a decreased binding affinity in addition to any changes in gating efficacy. The binding affinity decrease could be a direct effect of the mutation in the binding site, or the mutation could also allosterically influence binding by changing the conformation of the binding site from a distant location. These two possibilities can be further differentiated by a combination of cysteine accessibility and protection tests. The mutants W133C, P135C, F139C (loop A), and G163C (loop E) were not functional. These mutations probably influence receptor trafficking or assembly, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the mutations directly disrupt the agonist binding site. For those mutants with minor changes in the GABA sensitivity, the role of these residues in agonist binding is probably less significant, although they might still line the binding pocket. To further determine whether a residue lines the binding pocket, we tested the accessibility and agonist/antagonist protection of the engineered cysteines. A residue that lines the binding pocket would become less accessible when the agonist is bound. However, due to the ability of agonist to induce a global conformational change related to channel opening, it is possible that the agonist could change the conformation outside the binding pocket and make that site less accessible to the cysteine modification reagent. As a further test, we examined protection by a competitive antagonist. Although recent studies suggest that a competitive antagonist can also induce a conformational change beyond the binding site to stabilize the GABA receptor in the closed state (17Holden J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18785-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Ueno S. Bracamontes J. Zorumski C. Weiss D. Steinbach J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 625-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chang Y. Weiss D. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2542-2551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), this antagonist-induced conformational change is distinct from that induced by the agonist (24Chang Y. Weiss D. Nature Neuroscience. 2002; 5: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, only when the agonist and antagonist both protect a residue from modification do we consider that residue in the binding pocket. In this way, we have identified three novel binding residues in loop A (Asp-136, Phe-138, and Val-140) and five novel binding residues in loop E (Val-155, Met-156, Val-159, Ser-168, and Arg-170). By these criteria, no binding residues were identified in loop F, suggesting that this loop in the ρ1 GABA receptor is not directly involved in agonist binding. Note that V140C, V155C, and V159C showed no significant change in GABA EC50, suggesting that they may not directly contact the agonist but may still line the binding pocket. In contrast, the L166C and Q226C mutants were 15–20-fold less sensitive to GABA, suggesting a reduced binding affinity. The two engineered cysteine residues, however, were not protected by agonist or antagonist, indicating that they are likely outside the binding pocket. The reduction of binding affinity by these mutations could be due to an indirect/distant effect on the binding pocket. Since our goal was to detect dramatic changes in accessibility caused by direct physical occlusion of binding residue by agonist/antagonist, we examined MTSET modification at a single time. At least in terms of detecting minor changes in accessibility, this approach is less sensitive than an examination of the reaction rate. Since L166C aligns with a binding site residue in the nicotinic receptor (11Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), we wanted to exclude the possibility that we were missing this potential binding site residue. We therefore examined the reaction rate of L166C to MTSET in the absence and presence of 3-APA. Fig. 6 shows that at a saturation concentration, 3-APA did not significantly change the reaction rate at L166C, further confirming our conclusion. Thus, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some minor binding residues might be under our detection threshold, the result gives us confidence that we did not miss crucial binding site residues. Spontaneously Opening Channels—In this study, we found that mutations of F146C in loop A and Q160C in loop E created spontaneously opening channels. Although the S225C mutation in loop F did not create a spontaneously opening channel, modification of this engineered cysteine by MTSET made the channel open spontaneously. The mutation of Y102S in loop D (13Torres V. Weiss D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43741-43748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and several mutations in the channel lining domain (29Chang Y. Weiss D. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2542-2551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Chang Y. Weiss D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Pan Z.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5415-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also created spontaneously opening channels. The fact that spontaneously opening channels can be created by mutations in different loops of the amino-terminal domain or in the pore-lining domain suggests that channel gating is not exclusively controlled by a single residue. Instead, the energy landscape maintaining a proper conformation of the agonist binding site and gating machinery is governed by an interconnected allosteric network. Perturbation of this allosteric network, either by agonist binding or by mutation at one of the key positions, could alter the energy landscape to stabilize the receptor in the open state. In the amino-terminal domain of the ρ1 GABA receptor, these key positions, including residues Tyr-102 (loop D), Phe-146 (in loop A), Gln-160 (in loop E), and Ser-255 (in loop F), are distributed in multiple binding (or coupling) loops. The coordinated movement of these loops induced by agonist could be an important mechanism for channel activation. It is interesting that a mutation at a different position (L99C) in loop A of the β2 subunit also created a spontaneously opening channel (7Boileau A. Glen Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2931-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mutant V140C in the homologous position of the ρ1 subunit was not spontaneously active. This difference in key sites of the gating determinants may contribute to the distinct gating kinetics of GABAA and GABAC receptors. Secondary Structure Prediction—As indicated in Fig. 2, the alternating change in EC50 upon cysteine mutation in the segments L166C–V171C of loop E and S223C–F227C of loop F suggests a β-strand structure. The β-strand structure of segment L166C–V171C of loop E is further supported by the alternating accessibility pattern in this region (Fig. 3). In loop F, however, the pattern of accessibility to MTSET suggests a random coil. In addition, an alternating pattern of accessibility to MTSET in the segment Asp-136–Val-140 in loop A also suggests a β-strand structure. The secondary structure predictions in these loops of the ρ1 GABA receptor are in agreement with the crystal structure of the homologous protein, AChBP, and similar to the predictions in the homologous regions of the α1 (8Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13166-13172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Holden J. Czajkowski C. Society for Neuroscience 33rd Annual Meeting, New Orleans, Nov. 8–12, 2003, Program Number 50.10. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar) and β2 (7Boileau A. Glen Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2931-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) subunits of the GABAA receptor. Comparison with the Residues Lining the GABAA Receptor Agonist Binding Pocket—GABAA and GABAC receptors share many agonists, such as GABA and muscimol, but have distinct competitive antagonists, such as bicuculline for GABAA and 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid for GABAC. Agonist sharing suggests that they have similar overall architecture in the agonist/antagonist binding pocket, whereas the distinct antagonist profile suggests that their agonist/antagonist binding pockets are not identical. Thus, when we use agonist and competitive antagonist protection of the modification of the engineered residues as criteria for binding site residues, it would result in identification of some common and distinct residues lining the binding pocket. Fig. 7 shows all the binding residues identified to date in the ρ1 (GABAC) and α1/β2 (GABAA) subunits. In loops B, C (2Amin J. Weiss D. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar), and D (5Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Torres V. Weiss D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43741-43748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the binding residues identified by site-directed mutagenesis are almost identical. In loop D, two additional binding residues, Arg-66 and Ser-68, in the α1 subunit are recognized by the substituted cysteine accessibility method (6Boileau A. Evers A. Davis A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Holden J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18785-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue Arg-104 in the ρ1 subunit seems to line the binding pocket. 2V. Torres and D. S. Weiss, personal communication. Our newly identified binding residues in loop A of the ρ1 subunit, Phe-138 and Val-140, can find their homologous counterparts (Tyr-97 and Leu-99) in the β2 subunit (7Boileau A. Glen Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2931-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the binding residue Aps-136 in the same loop of the ρ1 subunit is distinct from that in the β2 subunit. This suggests that the ρ1 subunit in this region adopts a slightly different conformation than the corresponding region of the β2 subunit. In loop E, our results indicate that Ser-168 and Arg-170 line the binding pocket of the ρ1 GABA receptor, similar to the homologous residues (Thr-129 and Arg-131) in the α1 subunit (9Holden J. Czajkowski C. Society for Neuroscience 33rd Annual Meeting, New Orleans, Nov. 8–12, 2003, Program Number 50.10. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified three more binding residues (V155C, M156C, and V159C) in the extended region of loop E, but it belongs to a different β-strand, of the ρ1 subunit. This region in the α1 subunit has not yet been explored. In loop F, we could not find any residue meeting our criteria for a binding site lining residues in the ρ1 GABA receptor. In contrast, three residues (Val-178, Val-180, and Asp-183) in loop F of the α1 subunit have been identified as binding site residues (8Newell J. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13166-13172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This major difference between GABAC and GABAA could, in part, underlie the functional and pharmacological diversities between these two types of GABA receptors. Model for the ρ1 GABAC Receptor Binding Pocket—Using cysteine scanning accessibility, we have successfully identified novel residues in the ρ1 GABA receptor involved in GABA binding. With these data and previously identified binding residues in other loops, we were able to construct a model for the ρ1 GABA receptor binding pocket. For a three-dimensional presentation of the agonist/antagonist binding pocket, we first built a structural model for the amino-terminal domain of the ρ1 GABA receptor by homology modeling using AChBP as a template. The binding residues experimentally identified to date, as highlighted in Fig. 7, were then mapped onto this structural model and highlighted with the side chain (Fig. 8). The residues from loops A (red), B (cyan), and C (green) form one face of the binding pocket. The complementary face of the binding pocket is formed by residues from loops D (yellow) and E (purple). Loop F is in the vicinity of the binding pocket but does not directly contribute to agonist binding. Note that all these presumed binding residues are pointing toward the putative GABA binding pocket with the exception of Val-155 and Val-159. Mutation of these residues to cysteine did not significantly alter the GABA EC50 of the receptor. Thus, it is possible that these residues are not in the binding pocket in the absence of agonist/antagonist, but a local conformational change induced by binding of the agonist or antagonist can alter their orientation and thus change their accessibility. Although the precise location of each residue still awaits the high resolution structure of the GABAC receptor, the excellent agreement of most experimentally identified binding residues and the homology model further strengthens our conclusion that the identified residues are actually lining the agonist binding pocket of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1989091919,"Mutations in genes that encode polycystins 1 or 2 cause polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Here, we report the genomic organization and functional expression of murine orthologue of human polycystin-2L1 (PKD2L1). The murine PKD2L1 gene comprises 15 exons in chromosome 19C3. Coexpression of PKD2L1 together with polycystin-1 (PKD1) resulted in the expression of PKD2L1 channels on the cell surface, whereas PKD2L1 expressed alone was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This suggested that interaction between PKD1 and PKD2L1 is essential for PKD2L1 trafficking and channel formation. Deletion analysis at the cytoplasmic tail of PKD2L1 revealed that the coiled-coil domain was important for trafficking by PKD1. Mutagenesis within two newly identified ER retention signal-like amino acid sequences caused PKD2L1 to be expressed at the cell surface. This indicated that the coiled-coil domain was responsible for retaining PKD2L1 within the ER. Functional analysis of murine PKD2L1 expressed in HEK 293 cells was undertaken using calcium imaging. Coexpression of PKD1 and PKD2L1 resulted in the formation of functional cation channels that were opened by hypo-osmotic stimulation, whereas neither molecule formed functional channels when expressed alone. We conclude that PKD2L1 forms functional cation channels on the plasma membrane by interacting with PKD1. These findings raise the possibility that PKD2L1 represents the third genetic locus that is responsible for PKD."

Anthracyclines are a group of aromatic polyketides and their derivatives, some of which are in clinical use in cancer therapy. They act principally by inhibiting topoisomerase II (1Larsen A.K.

The success of combinatorial biosynthesis rests on the ability of individual enzymes to accept non-natural substrates. A final product can only be produced if each and every step in the pathway yields a product that can be used by the next enzyme in the chain. Therefore, mechanistic insights, in particular knowledge regarding the structural basis of substrate recognition and specificity, could possibly facilitate the use of this approach by the re-design of the specificity profile of the enzymes in these pathways. As part of our efforts to investigate the structural and mechanistic enzymology of the biosynthetic pathway(s) of anthracyclines, we have studied the enzyme aclacinomycin 10-hydroxylase (RdmB) 1The abbreviations used are: RdmB, aclacinomycin-10-hydroxylase; AknA, aclacinomycin A (aklavinone-rhodosamine-deoxyfucose-cinerulose A); RdmC, aclacinomycin-15-methylesterase; DnrK, carminomycin-O-methyltransferase; DbrA, 11-deoxy-β-rhodomycin A; DcmaA, 10-decarboxymethylaclacinomycin A; DmaA, 15-demethylaclacinomycin A; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; M-ϵ-T, 4-O-methyl-ϵ-rhodomycin T (4-O-methyl-ϵ-rhodomycinone-rhodosamine); AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

This enzyme participates in rhodomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces purpurascens and is responsible for the insertion of the 10-hydroxyl substituent observed in β-rhodomycinone glycosides (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence and the three-dimensional structure of this protein clearly suggested that it is a AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase. The closest known relative (52% amino acid sequence identity) is carminomycin-O-methyltransferase (DnrK) (12Jansson A. Koskiniemi H. Mäntsälä P. Niemi J. Schneider G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41149-41156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), one of the first anthracycline biosynthetic enzymes to be studied in vitro (13Madduri K. Torti F. Colombo A.L. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3900-3904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this close relationship to a methyltransferase, the occurrence of the 10-hydroxyl group in products of combinatorial biosynthesis was dependent on the presence of the rdmB gene (14Wang Y. Niemi J. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mäntsälä P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown (15Wang Y. Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 208: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that aclacinomycin-15-methylesterase (RdmC) and RdmB acting in sequence in vitro produced the 10-hydroxyl group from the 10-carboxymethyl substituent observed in aclacinomycins. The reaction catalyzed by RdmB is particularly intriguing, because the enzyme does not use any of the cofactors usually associated with hydroxylases such as flavins and/or metal ions to activate molecular oxygen. It is also noteworthy that the enzyme lacks methyltransferase activity (7Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2942-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang Y. Niemi J. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mäntsälä P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 208: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous crystallographic study (11Jansson A. Niemi J. Lindqvist Y. Mäntsälä P. Schneider G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) had shown that RdmB has the typical fold of small molecule methyltransferases and that AdoMet is bound close to the putative active site. However, the absence of any bound anthracycline ligand in the active site prevented detailed mechanistic conclusions as to this enigmatic hydroxylation reaction. Here, we present evidence that RdmB is a hydroxylase with a novel mechanism. In particular, these studies suggest a new function for AdoMet in enzyme reactions. RdmB and its closest homologue, DnrK, are particularly striking and illustrative examples of how a novel function in a given metabolic pathway can develop by divergent evolution. Expression and Purification—Recombinant RdmB was produced and purified as described previously for DnrK (12Jansson A. Koskiniemi H. Mäntsälä P. Niemi J. Schneider G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41149-41156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine-substituted RdmB was prepared as described (11Jansson A. Niemi J. Lindqvist Y. Mäntsälä P. Schneider G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The purification of recombinant methylesterase RdmC followed procedures described elsewhere (14Wang Y. Niemi J. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mäntsälä P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In Vitro Mutagenesis—RdmB was mutated using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene). After sequencing, the mutant proteins were produced as described for the wild-type enzyme; however, due to solubility problems, the fermentation temperature was lowered to 25 °C for C165S. HPLC and LC-MS—HPLC of anthracyclines was performed on Li-Chrospher 100 RP18 columns with a mixture of 70:30 acetonitrile and 60 mmol/liter ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.6, as eluent. For analytical HPLC, a 250 × 4-mm, 5-μm particle size column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was coupled to a Shimadzu VP series chromatography system with a diode array detector, which was also used to record the UV-visible spectra of the products. In preparative HPLC, a 250 × 10-mm, 10-μm particle size column at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min was used. HPLC of AdoMet and AdoHcy was carried out as described previously (16Wang W. Kramer P. Yang S. Pereira M. Tao L. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2001; 762: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). LC-MS was performed with a PerkinElmer API 365 LC-MS/MS system (electrospray ionization, positive ions). Enzyme Assays—We have observed that the substrate for RdmB, 15-demethoxyaclacinomycin A (DmaA), is unstable and decomposes slowly in water to 10-decarboxymethylaclacinomycin (DcmaA) and presumably CO2 (Fig. 1). Therefore, two kinds of enzyme assays were used. In a coupled assay, the substrate was generated in situ by incubating AknA (40 μmol/liter) with purified RdmC (2.5 μg/ml) in 0.1 mol/liter sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 1 mmol/liter glutathione, 10 μmol/liter AdoMet, and the RdmB sample to be tested for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated, and the anthracycline products were recovered by solid-phase extraction using Supelco DSC-18 columns according to the manufacturers' instructions. The products were assayed by analytical HPLC. In the direct assay, semi-purified samples of DmaA were prepared as follows. AknA was incubated in the presence of the methyltransferase RdmC buffer and glutathione as described above. Anthracycline glycosides uncharged at pH 7.5 (AknA and DcmaA) were removed by extraction with 1:10 volume of toluene, and partially purified DmaA was recovered by solid-phase extraction as noted above. This material was added to a reaction mixture containing 0.1 mol/liter sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mmol/liter glutathione, and 10 μmol/liter AdoMet together with the RdmB sample to be tested with incubation and product recovery as in the coupled assay. Glutathione oxidation was determined by adding NADPH to a concentration of 0.1 mmol/liter to a coupled assay reaction that had gone to completion and measuring the absorbance at 340 nm before and after addition of 1 unit/ml glutathione reductase (Sigma G3664, end-reading taken after absorbance change had stopped). A reaction mixture without RdmB was used as reference. Anaerobic Reaction and Oxygen Incorporation—The components of a direct assay mixture were divided into two portions in compartments of a Thunberg tube (enzyme and substrate separated) and evacuated for 10 min. The components were mixed and incubated, either under vacuum or with air readmitted as a control or with the addition of 18O2 (97 atom%, Sigma), to test for oxygen incorporation in the products. An additional reaction was run in the absence of glutathione using an enzyme sample prepared without DTT. The products of these reactions were isolated as above, and the molecular masses of these compounds were determined by mass spectrometry. Crystallization and Data Collection—A solution of selenomethionine substituted RdmB in 50 mmol/liter Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (7.2 mg/ml enzyme), was incubated with 5 mmol/liter 11-deoxy-β-rhodomycin (DbrA), 8 mmol/liter AdoMet, and 10 mmol/liter DTT. Crystallization was carried out using vapor diffusion. Drops of the protein-substrate solution (2–4 μl) were mixed with equal amounts of well solution and allowed to equilibrate at 4 and 20 °C, respectively. Yellow needle-shaped crystals were obtained after 1 week using a well solution consisting of 0.1 mol/liter cobalt chloride, 1.6 mol/liter ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 mol/liter MES buffer, pH 6.5. Diffraction data to a 2.3-Å resolution was collected at beamline 7–11, MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden) at 100 K using 25% glycerol to flash-freeze the crystals. The crystals belong to space group P3221 and contained two subunits per asymmetric unit, giving a solvent content of 57%. The RdmB-sinefungin complex was crystallized in the same manner as the native enzyme (17Jansson A. Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. Schneider G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1637-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) but with the addition of 7.6 mmol/liter sinefungin instead of AdoMet to the crystallization mixture. The crystals of space group C2221 were grown in hanging drops. A data set was collected at beamline ID29 at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) to a resolution of 2.7 Å. The crystals were flash-frozen in a gaseous nitrogen stream at 100 K using paraffin oil as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction images for all of the data sets were indexed and processed with the program MOSFLM (18No 4. Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). SCALA of the CCP4 program package (18No 4. Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) was used for scaling. Determination of the space groups was done by auto-indexing the diffraction pattern and examination of the scaling statistics in SCALA and of the pseudo-precession photographs generated with the program PATTERN (19Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar).

McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). A search model derived from the coordinates of the binary complex of RdmB with AdoMet (Protein Data Bank code 1QZZ) consisting of the N-terminal and middle domains gave a solution for this part of one subunit in the asymmetric unit. This solution was fixed, and a rotation and translation search was carried out to find the position of the C-terminal domain. The program Molrep (21Vagin A.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) was then used to find the second molecule in the asymmetric unit, which gave a R-factor of 54.2% and correlation coefficient of 28.4. The structure of the ternary complex of RdmB·AdoMet product showed large and distinct differences in the orientation of the domain relative to each other when compared with the structure of the search model, the binary complex of RdmB·AdoMet. The initial model obtained by molecular replacement was then improved by manual inspection and rebuilding using the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The structure of the RdmB-sinefungin complex was also solved by molecular replacement, because the crystals were non-isomorphous to those of the RdmB·AdoMet complex as indicated already by differences in cell dimensions, 62.7, 87.7, and 118.6 Å (RdmB-sinefungin) compared with 63.1, 92.2, and 115.3 Å (RdmB·AdoMet). The program REFMAC 5.0 (23Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) was employed throughout for refinement of the two structures using the maximum likelihood residual. Before refinement, a set of reflections around 8% for every data set was set aside for Rfree calculations. After an initial rigid body refinement, restrained refinement consisted of conjugate gradient minimization. Isotropic B-factor refinement and bulk-solvent correction were used. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied whenever possible to improve the data to parameter ratio. The rigid Rossmann-like fold was tightly restrained, whereas the other parts of the structure were kept rather loose. Waters were added by ARP/WARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) and examined by manually inspecting the electron density maps. The geometry of the models was analyzed with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) summarized in Table I. Structural Comparisons—Pairwise and multiple sequence alignments were made using BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar), respectively, and structure alignments were carried out with TOP (19Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and the LSQ option in program O using default parameters. The figures were drawn using Pymol (29DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar), VMD (30Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 27-38Crossref Scopus (39018) Google Scholar), and POVRAY. A new HPLC method was developed to detect the products and intermediates of the RdmB reaction. In particular, the use of volatile buffer ensures compatibility with LC-MS. In mass spectrometry analysis of anthracycline triglycosides by this method, we typically observe a peak corresponding to the entire triglycoside +1. The main peak corresponds to the monoglycoside fragment +2. Fig. 2 shows the mass spectra of DbrA and M+16 in the absence and presence of isotopic oxygen. In addition, DmaA (556.3 and 798.4) and DcmaA (512.5 and 754.6) were identified by LC-MS (spectra not shown). DmaA, produced from AknA by RdmC, is unstable and decarboxylates spontaneously in water (Fig. 3, A and B). Therefore, it was unclear whether DmaA or the decarboxylated compound DcmaA (or both) was the substrate(s) of RdmB. Fast partial purification allowed testing of DmaA directly as substrate of the RdmB reaction. As can be seen from Fig. 3B, this compound reacts efficiently with the enzyme. DcmaA, the product of the decarboxylation, was purified by preparative HPLC and remarkably was not hydroxylated by RdmB (Fig. 3C). In previous work (14Wang Y. Niemi J. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mäntsälä P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 208: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no thiol reagents were added to the reaction mixture, but as the enzyme was routinely prepared with 1 mmol/liter DTT, there was always a small but apparently sufficient amount of thiol reagent present. However, we observed that a more efficient and consistent reaction was achieved when 1 mmol/liter DTT or glutathione was added. To establish the stoichiometry of the reaction, the amount of oxidized glutathione was determined via NADPH oxidation with glutathione reductase. In a combined reaction with 40 μmol/liter of the substrate AknA, 38.2 μmol/liter NADPH were consumed, corresponding to a 1:1 stoichiometry between hydroxylated product and oxidized glutathione. When enzyme was prepared entirely without the additions of thiol reagents and none was added to the reaction mixture, a new product was observed in addition to DbrA (Fig. 3D). This product, denoted “M+16,” eluted at 6 min in HPLC and had a mass spectrum consistent with a molecule containing an additional oxygen atom compared with the final product, DbrA (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the UV-visible spectrum of M+16 was indistinguishable from that of DbrA. The size of the peak varied from experiment to experiment. If glutathione was added later to the reaction, the M+16 peak disappeared upon further incubation. The dependence of the reaction upon thiol reagents prompted us to investigate whether or not a cysteine residue of the enzyme would be involved in the hydroxylation reaction. Examination of the three-dimensional structure of RdmB suggested only one cysteine residue, Cys-165, close enough to the active site. Freshly prepared mutant C165S was approximately equally active as the native enzyme, thus demonstrating that this residue is not essential for catalysis. Another amino acid, which is situated in the active site and which differs between RdmB and the active methyltransferase DnrK, is Trp-146. The replacement of this amino acid by site-directed mutagenesis with a tyrosine residue did not reduce the hydroxylase activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, no apparent methylated products were seen in the chromatograms. The hydroxylation reaction was dependent on oxygen. When prepared in a carefully evacuated Thunberg tube (i.e. in the absence of oxygen), only the hydrolyzed product DmaA (the product of the RdmC reaction) and the decarboxymethylated product DcmaA were observed. The addition of oxygen to the reaction mixture lead to the formation of the product DbrA. In the experiment, where air was replaced by 18O2, the molecular mass of DbrA increased by 2 Da. In the absence of glutathione and in the presence of 18O2, the reaction resulted in the formation of the M+16 product with the molecular mass increased by 4 Da, consistent with the incorporation of two oxygen atoms in this compound (Fig. 2). The hydroxylation reaction proceeded normally in the dark, thus excluding photoactivation as a requirement for the reaction. The reaction was dependent on AdoMet and the addition of this cofactor increased the amount of product formed by up to 10-fold (Fig. 4). The initial activity seen before the addition of AdoMet most probably is due to minor amounts of AdoMet bound to the enzyme after purification. The addition of AdoHcy inhibits catalytic activity. Noteworthy, the reaction went to completion with AdoMet quantities well below stoichiometry. Separation of AdoMet and AdoHcy by HPLC from reaction mixtures (data not shown) also indicated that AdoMet is not significantly consumed in the reaction. The methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin was surprisingly found to stimulate the hydroxylation reaction and thus was able to substitute for AdoMet (Fig. 4). Overall Structure—The subunit of RdmB consists of three domains. The N-terminal domain is involved in an extensive dimerization interface and is mainly built up by helices and contains only two β-strands. The middle domain is small and all α-helical. The C-terminal domain has an α/β-Rossmann-like fold built up by a parallel five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by helices on both sides. This domain contains the conserved fingerprint, DLGGGXG, and binds the cofactor, AdoMet. The RdmB subunit in the ternary complex contains in total 19 helices and 9 β-strands, and there are no major differences in secondary structure compared with the binary complex RdmB·AdoMet. In the ternary complex (Fig. 5), helix γ13 and parts of α14 are missing because this stretch of sequence (residues 165–171) has become disordered in the product complex. On the other hand, residues 288–296 that are disordered in the binary complex RdmB·AdoMet form a well defined loop in the ternary complex. The predominantly hydrophobic dimer interface is also preserved in the ternary complex. In both complexes, this interface buries a surface area of comparable size, 3656 Å2 (23%) for RdmB·AdoMet and 3624 Å2 (22%) for RdmB·AdoMet·DbrA. There is a large domain-domain rearrangement in RdmB upon binding of DbrA (Fig. 6). Superposition of the binary and ternary complexes using only the interface domains reveals a difference in the relative orientation of the C-terminal domains in the two complexes. The conformational change can be described as a rotation of the C-terminal domain by ∼10° around an arbitrary axis, resulting in a maximal displacement of this domain by 15 Å. As a consequence of the domain movement, helices γ6 and α7 close down over the entrance of the substrate pocket and the loop between β7 and β8 also moves closer to the bound product in the ternary complex. Helices γ13 and α14 are close to the entrance of the substrate pocket in the RdmB·AdoMet complex, whereas in the ternary complex, γ13 and parts of α14 are unfolded. AdoMet Binding Site—The AdoMet cofactor is bound in the same fashion in the RdmB·AdoMet·DbrA structure as in the RdmB·AdoMet structure. It exhibits the same conformation and interacts with the same hydrogen-bonding partners (Fig. 7). The only significant difference in the pattern of hydrogen bonds is the absence of the interaction between the carboxyl group of AdoMet and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-171 in the ternary complex. This residue is located on a flexible loop and appears to be disordered in the structure of the RdmB·AdoMet·DbrA complex. Substrate/Product Binding Site—The substrate/product binding site in RdmB is located between the C-terminal and middle domains, and residues from all three domains are involved in binding of the product. The binding pocket is made up mainly by hydrophobic residues that pack against the aromatic aglycone ring (Fig. 7). Only one residue from the N-terminal domain, Trp-109, participates in these interactions. The other residues involved in these hydrophobic interactions are Arg-307 through its hydrophobic carbon chain, Phe-145, Phe-159, Met-163, Leu-304, Met-308, Phe-311, Met-312, and Phe-346. The bound ligand forms only one hydrogen bond to the enzyme from the O-4 oxygen in DbrA to the side chain of Asn-260. The carbohydrate chain extends from the binding pocket into the bulk solution.

https://openalex.org/W2062888347,"Human fibroblasts, rat neurons, and murine neuroblastoma cells, cultured in the presence of fetal calf serum, were fed with [1-3H]sphingosine to radiolabel sphingolipids. The fate of cell sphingolipids, the release of sphingolipids in the culture medium, the interaction of sphingolipids with the proteins and lipoproteins of fetal calf serum, and the fate of sphingolipids taken up by the cells were investigated. For this latter purpose, the culture medium containing radioactive sphingolipids was delivered to nonlabeled cells. The presence of tritium at position 1 of sphingosine allowed us to follow the extent of sphingolipid catabolism by measuring the production of radioactive phosphatidylethanolamine and proteins by recycling the radioactive ethanolamine formed during sphingosine catabolism and the production of tritiated water. We confirmed that in cells the recycling of sphingosine occurred to a high extent and that only a minor portion of cell sphingolipids was catabolized to the small fragments of ethanolamine and water. Cell sphingolipids were released in the culture medium, where they formed large lipoproteic aggregates at a rate of about 12% per day. Released sphingolipids were taken up by the cells and catabolized to the sphingosine and then to ethanolamine, and recycling of sphingosine was not observed. This suggests that in the presence of fetal calf serum in the culture medium, exogenous sphingolipids directly reach the lysosomes, were they are entirely catabolized. Thus, the trafficking of sphingolipids from cells to the extracellular environment and from this to other cells does not allow the modification of the plasma membrane composition.

Thus, the trafficking of sphingolipids from cells to the extracellular environment and from this to other cells does not allow the modification of the plasma membrane composition. Membrane sphingolipids are complex lipids displaying a strong amphiphilic character (1Formisano S. Johnson M.L. Salvatore G.L. Aloj M. Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This implies an equilibrium between plasma membrane molecules and free monomers present in the extracellular environment. The critical aggregative concentration of sphingolipids is in the nano- or picomolar range (1Formisano S. Johnson M.L. Salvatore G.L. Aloj M. Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 2Sonnino S. Cantù L. Corti M. Acquotti D. Venerando B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 71: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), thus the amount of free monomers in solution is low. Nevertheless, the quantity of free monomers should increase when a favorable equilibrium leads to the formation of stable lipoprotein complexes (3Tomasi M. Roda L.G. Ausiello C. D'Agnolo G.

This process should also occur in living organisms, where significant amounts of sphingolipids are detectable in serum and cerebrospinal fluid from normal and pathological subjects (6Rueda R.

Exogenous sphingolipids administered to cells are taken up by the cells, thus entering the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Several studies have been carried out by administering sphingolipids to cells (9Saqr H.E. Pearl D.K. Yates A.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

J. 1985; 2: 279-291Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The information on the administration of sphingolipids to cells in the presence of FCS is very scant. Some data suggest that under this condition the amount of gangliosides taken up by the cells is much lower, but the rate of the catabolic process higher (11Chigorno V. Pitto M. Cardace G. Acquotti D.

This is probably because of the formation of stable complexes between gangliosides and the proteins and lipoproteins of FCS (3Tomasi M. Roda L.G. Ausiello C. D'Agnolo G. Venerando B. Ghidoni R.

Chigorno V. Pitto M. Valsecchi M. Palestini P. Ghidoni R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 55: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin is also taken up by neuronal cells and largely catabolized (13Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In this paper we performed the following: 1) the release of all classes of sphingolipids from both normal and tumor cells in culture, 2) the association of sphingolipids released by cells with proteins and lipoproteins of FCS present in the culture medium, and 3) the fate of sphingolipids released by the cells and taken up by the same or different cells. Our results suggest that the endogenous and specific sphingolipid content of plasma membrane cannot be changed in vivo by the incorporation into cells of circulating sphingolipids, and suggest that the sphingolipids that are taken up by the cells are largely and rapidly catabolized.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The commercial chemicals were the purest available, common solvents were distilled before use, and deionized water, obtained by a MilliQ system (Millipore), was distilled in a glass apparatus. High performance silica gel precoated thin layer plates (TLC Kieselgel 60) were purchased from Merck. Basal modified Eagle's medium (BME), Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from Hyclone. Other reagents for cell cultures, Vibrio cholerae sialidase, Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma.Sphingosine was prepared from cerebroside (14Carter H.E. Rothfus J.A. Gigg R. J. Lipid Res. 1961; 2: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). [1-3H]Sphingosine (radiochemical purity over 98%; specific radioactivity, 2.08 Ci/mmol) was prepared by specific chemical oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group of sphingosine followed by reduction with sodium boro[3H]hydride (15Toyokuni T. Nisar M. Dean B. Hakomori S. J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm. 1991; 29: 567-574Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). [1-3H]Sphinganine was prepared by quantitative hydrogenation in the presence of 10% activated palladium-charcoal, of [1-3H]sphingosine (10Chigorno V. Riva C. Valsecchi M. Nicolini M. Brocca P.

Radioactive sphingolipids were extracted from cells fed with [1-3H]sphingosine, purified, characterized as described previously (17Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol.

Granule cells were obtained from cerebellum of 8-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as described (20Gallo V. Ciotti M. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 9 × 106 cells/dish in 100-mm dishes (0.45 ± 0.05 mg of protein/dish), cultured with BME supplemented with 10% FCS, and used for the experiments between the 6th and 8th day of culture. The murine neuroblastoma cell line clone NB2a (Neuro2a, CCL-131, American Cell Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS in 100-mm dishes (4.52 ± 0.51 mg of protein/dish).Cell Feeding with [1-3H]Sphingosine—[1-3H]Sphingosine dissolved in methanol was transferred into a sterile glass tube and dried under a nitrogen stream; the residue was then dissolved in an appropriate volume of pre-warmed (37 °C) 2% FCS-EMEM (fibroblasts) or cell-conditioned medium (granule cells) or 10% FCS-DMEM (neuroblastoma cells) to obtain a final 3 × 10–8m concentration. After a 2-h incubation (pulse), the medium was removed, and cells were washed with culture medium and incubated for 48 h with culture medium not containing radioactive precursors in the presence of 10% FCS. In some experiments, the chase was prolonged up to 5 days with EMEM or BME. In some others experiments FCS was omitted or substituted with a 0.4% albumin. A few control experiments were carried out feeding [1-3H]sphinganine to human fibroblasts.Fractionation of Cell Medium—The cell medium from cells pulsed with 3 × 10–8m [1-3H]sphingosine and subjected to a 48-h chase were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and carefully collected in 1-ml fractions starting from the top of the tube (21Kong Y. Li R. Ladisch S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pellet and each fraction were analyzed for radioactivity content. Lipoproteins were isolated from the cell-conditioned medium from cells pulsed with 3 × 10–8m [1-3H]sphingosine and subjected to a 48-h chase, by sequential preparative ultracentrifugation (22Havel R.

Details on the apparatus and on the procedures are available from several references reported previously (2Sonnino S. Cantù L. Corti M. Acquotti D. Venerando B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 71: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).Determination of Catabolic Water—Tritiated water (10Chigorno V. Riva C. Valsecchi M. Nicolini M. Brocca P. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) formed during the metabolic processing of the tritiated sphingolipids and diffused into the cell culture medium was determined as follows. One ml of the cell culture medium was dialyzed overnight against 2 ml of water. The dialysate was distilled, and the radioactivity associated with the 100 °C fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Cell Cultures in Radioactive Conditioned Medium—The medium from cultured cells pulsed with 3 × 10–8m [1-3H]sphingosine was collected after a 48-h chase. Cells that were never treated before with radioactive precursors were incubated in the presence of these medium for different times (2–24 h). At the end of chase, the cell medium was carefully collected, and cells were repeatedly washed with EMEM, BME, or DMEM, and then with 10% FCS-containing medium (30 min) to remove ganglioside aggregates loosely bound to the cell surface. In some experiments a final 5-min treatment with 0.1% trypsin was performed to remove sphingolipids bound to surface proteins (11Chigorno V. Pitto M. Cardace G. Acquotti D. Kirschner G. Sonnino S.

Lipids present in both cells and medium were extracted, characterized, and analyzed for radioactivity content. Delipidized pellets were analyzed for radioactivity content. The cell suspensions were frozen and lyophilized, and the residues were subjected to lipid extraction. Cell lipids were extracted according to the chloroform/methanol/water procedure as described previously (25Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G.

The cell medium from cells fed with [1-3H]sphingosine were dialyzed for 2 days, frozen, and lyophilized, and the residues were subjected to lipid extraction with chloroform/methanol/water, 20:10:1 by volume. The resulting total lipid extracts were dried under nitrogen stream and dissolved in chloroform/methanol, 2:1 by volume.The main radioactive sphingolipids extracted from cells and cell medium were purified by the HPTLC-blotting technique (26Taki T. Handa S. Ishiwaka D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and characterized as described previously (17Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J.

Lipids were analyzed by HPTLC using the solvent systems chloroform, methanol, 0.2% aqueous CaCl2, 55:45:10 by volume, to separate fibroblast lipids, chloroform, methanol, and 0.2% aqueous CaCl2, 50:42:11 by volume, to analyze separate granule and neuroblastoma cell lipids, and ethyl acetate, chloroform, methanol, 50 mm KCl, 50:40:10:1.4 by volume, to analyze ceramide and radiolytic byproducts. The absence of [3H]sphingosine in the total lipid extracts from cells fed 3 × 10–8m [1-3H]sphingosine was determined after analysis of the total radioactive lipid extract by two-dimensional TLC performed with chloroform, methanol, 0.2% aqueous CaCl2, 55:45:10 by volume, and chloroform, methanol, 32% NH4OH, 40:10:1 by volume, respectively for the 1st and 2nd run. The radioactive sphingolipid pattern in neuroblastoma cells fed 3 × 10–8m [1-3H]sphingosine and that in the corresponding cell medium were confirmed by two-dimensional TLC using chloroform/methanol/water, 110:40:6 by volume, and chloroform, methanol, 0.2% aqueous CaCl2, 50:42:11 by volume, respectively, for the 1st and 2nd run.After separation, radioactive lipids were visualized with a Beta-Imager 2000 (Biospace). The radioactivity associated with individual lipids was determined with the specific β-Vision software (Biospace).Other Analytical Methods—Radioactivity associated with cells, with medium, with medium fractions, and with lipid extracts was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The protein content was determined according to Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as reference standard.RESULTSMetabolic Labeling of Cell Sphingolipids—[1-3H]sphingosine fed to cells in culture at a final concentration of 3 × 10–8 m was taken up by cells and entered into the complex sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, in agreement with previous data (17Prinetti A.

After a 2-h pulse, 45 ± 5% of the tracer was incorporated into fibroblasts, 55 ± 5% into neurons, and 52 ± 5% into neuroblastoma cells and used for the synthesis of cell sphingolipids. Fig. 1, panel A, shows the radioactive sphingolipid patterns obtained from human fibroblasts, differentiated rat cerebellar granule cells, and murine Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells. Some radioactivity was associated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), due to recycling of radioactive ethanolamine produced in the catabolism of [1-3H]sphingosine. The solvent systems based on a mixture of chloroform, methanol, and water are very powerful for the separation and chromatographic identification of complex mixtures of radioactive sphingolipids, both acidic and neutral sphingolipids, with the exemption of ceramide. In fact, in the presence of chloroform, some radical reactions on radioactive lipids occur, yielding a minor quantity of radiolytic apolar compounds of unknown structure that chromatographically overlap with ceramide. Thus, to specifically recognize and quantify ceramide, TLC were performed with a solvent system containing ethyl acetate (Fig. 1, panel B). Fig. 1, panel B, shows that in fibroblasts ceramide is under the detectable limit. Instead ceramide was recognized and quantified in neurons and neuroblastoma cells.A precise qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the sphingolipid pattern of neuroblastoma cells was carried out after two-dimensional TLC separations (Fig. 2, panel A). This was necessary to better separate GM2 from SM. The quantitative radioactive lipid composition of human fibroblasts, differentiated rat cerebellar granule cells and murine Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells, as derived by five experiments, is reported in Tables I, II and III, respectively.Fig. 2Two-dimensional TLC patterns of radioactive lipids present in murine Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells and their cell-conditioned medium after feeding 3 × 10–8m [1-3H]sphingosine, (2-h pulse followed by 48 h-chase). Lipids from cells (panel A) and from cell-conditioned medium (panel B) were extracted and separated by two-dimensional TLC by using the following solvent systems: 1st run, chloroform/methanol/water, 110:40:6 by volume; 2nd run, chloroform, methanol, 0.2% aqueous CaCl2, 50:42:11 by volume. The chase was performed in the presence of 10% FCS in the medium. Radioactive lipids were detected by digital autoradiography; 100–200 dpm/lane; time of acquisition, 48 h. The positions of standard lipids are indicated by the following numbers: 1, SM; 2, GM3; and 3, GM2.

https://openalex.org/W2048499425,"During tumorigenesis, selective proliferative advantage in certain cell subsets is associated with accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. For instance, multiple myeloma is characterized by frequent karyotypic instability at the earliest stage, progressing to extreme genetic abnormalities as the disease progresses. These successive genetic alterations can be attributed, in part, to defects in DNA repair pathways, perhaps based on epigenetic gene silencing of proteins involved in DNA damage repair. Here we report epigenetic hypermethylation of the hHR23B gene, a key component of the nucleotide excision repair in response to DNA damage, in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-responsive myeloma KAS-6/1 cells. This hypermethylation was significantly abated by Zebularine, a potent demethylating agent, with a consequent increase in the hHR23B mRNA level. Subsequent removal of this drug and supplementation with IL-6 in the culture medium re-established DNA hypermethylation of the hHR23B gene and silencing of mRNA expression levels. The inclination of DNA to be remethylated, at least within the hHR23B gene promoter region, reflects an epigenetic driving force by the cytogenetic/tumorigenic status of KAS-6/1 myeloma. The IL-6 response of KAS-6/1 myeloma also raises a question of whether the proneoplastic growth factor, such as IL-6, supports the epigenetic silencing of important DNA repair genes via promoter hypermethylation during the development of multiple myeloma.

The process of DNA repair is designed to maintain genomic integrity, which is continuously challenged by damaging factors such as reactive oxygen species generated by normal cellular metabolism, errors in DNA replication, ultraviolet radiation, and chemical reagents (1Thoma B.S. Vasquez K.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2003; 38: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Failure in the repair of DNA damage introduces genomic mutations, and long term accumulation of these mutations leads to genomic abnormalities as seen in many human cancers. In mammalian cells, nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; IL, interleukin; MM, multiple myeloma; ZEB, Zebularine-treated; NEG, untreated; REM, Zebularine-removed. is one of the mechanisms for repairing DNA damage. The pivotal role of NER is to remove helix-distorting damage, including the UV-induced lesions (e.g. [6–4] photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers), interstrand and intrastrand cross-links, and chemically induced bulky DNA adducts. The NER process involves multistep mechanisms that require complexes of proteins to participate (1Thoma B.S. Vasquez K.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2003; 38: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Lehmann A.R. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Xeroderma pigmentosum is one of the inheritable diseases associated with an NER defect which confers UV hypersensitivity and skin carcinogenesis, suggesting that a reduced gene expression of NER proteins would result in failure to maintain genomic integrity (1Thoma B.S. Vasquez K.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2003; 38: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Lehmann A.R. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Based on aberrant DNA hypermethylation, epigenetic silencing of genes involved in growth control is known to be associated with tumorigenesis. In most cases, DNA hypermethylation occurs in gene promoter regions, for instance, of the p53 gene in human breast ductal carcinoma (3Kang J.H. Kim S.J. Noh D.Y. Park I.A. Choe K.J. Yoo O.J. Kang H.S. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and human primary hepatocellular carcinoma (4Pogribny I.P. James S.J. Cancer Lett. 2002; 176: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene in lymphomas (5Rossi D. Gaidano G. Gloghini A. Deambrogi C. Franceschetti S. Berra E. Cerri M. Vendramin C. Conconi A. Viglio A. Muti G. Oreste P. Morra E. Paulli M. Capello D. Carbone A. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 123: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). DNA methylation involves the transfer of a methyl group onto position 5 of the cytidine of CpG dinucleotides, whereas CpA and CpT dinucleotides are also observed (6Lorincz M.C. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10034-10036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Tissues undergoing infection, chronic irritation, and inflammation are rich in inflammatory cells, growth factors, activated stroma, and DNA damage-promoting reagents (7Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (11417) Google Scholar). Consequently, these microenvironments foster sustained cell proliferation and survival. This also suggests that certain pro-inflammatory cytokines required by the innate immune system are involved in the neoplastic process. IL-6 is one of the pleiotropic cytokines and regulates hematopoiesis, inflammation, and oncogenesis. We have demonstrated that IL-6-induced STAT3 activation initiates transcription of the transcription factor Fli-1 (Friend leukemia integration-site 1), and Fli-1 in turn activates the promoter and increases the expression of DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase) (8Hodge D.R.

In lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as in acute myeloid leukemia, higher expression of DNMT1, -2, -3a, and -3b has been reported (10Melki J.R. Clark S.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, epigenetic silencing via promoter hypermethylation has been seen only in a relatively small number of diverse genes that are important in DNA damage repair (5Rossi D. Gaidano G. Gloghini A. Deambrogi C. Franceschetti S. Berra E. Cerri M. Vendramin C. Conconi A. Viglio A. Muti G. Oreste P. Morra E. Paulli M. Capello D. Carbone A. Br. J.

This might provide an explanation for the leukemogenesis arising from the clonal expansion of cells that have undergone successive alternations of genotypes (12Hallek M. Bergsagel P.L. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pratt G. Mol. Pathol. 2002; 55: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Considering that multiple myeloma (MM) is commonly associated with genomic alterations and that its development is IL-6-related (14Kuehl W.M. Bergsagel P.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 3: 175-187Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the epigenetic silencing of DNA repair proteins, leading to chromosomal aberrations, may be one of the causes for the development of MM. Furthermore, this may be, in part, attributed to pro-inflammatory IL-6 signaling. We used the IL-6-responsive KAS-6/1 multiple myeloma to establish a link between IL-6-induced cell survival and DNA hypermethylation of DNA repair proteins, such as the hHR23B nucleotide excision repair protein, described in this study. Cell Culture and Drug Treatment—The human KAS-6/1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with IL-6 (10 ng/ml). Cells were treated with Zebularine (250 μm) for 48 h. After Zebularine treatment, the treated cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by culturing for 1 week in fresh medium with IL-6 supplementation (10 ng/ml). KAS-6/1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Diane Jelinek (Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic/Foundation, Rochester, MN). Zebularine was generously provided by Dr. Marquez (Laboratory of Medical Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Analysis of Gene Expression by Ribonuclease Protection Assays and Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNAs from untreated cells, Zebularine-treated cells, and cells allowed to re-establish their methylation patterns following removal of Zebularine were extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Ribonuclease protection assays was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, α-33P-labeled multiple antisense RNA probes were synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase using the multiprobe DNA template. 20 μg of total RNA were hybridized to 2 × 106 cpm of labeled probes corresponding to the multiprobe template human NER-1 (human nucleotide excision repair set-1) (RiboQuant ribonuclease protection assay kit, BD Biosciences) overnight at 56 °C. Unhybridized RNA was digested first with RNase T1 and RNase A for 45 min at 30 °C and then with proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C. After phenol/chloroform extraction and sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation, hybridized RNA probes were denatured at 90 °C for 3 min and electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was exposed to an x-ray film. The cDNAs were prepared by reverse transcribing 1 μg of total RNA using the single-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using Taq Man probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions in 10-μl final volumes and in 384-well microtiter plates. Thermocycling conditions using an Applied Biosystems ABI-7900 SDS were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Specific primers for quantitative PCR of 18 S and hHR23B were designed using the Applied Biosystems assay-by-design primer design software, and their sequences are proprietary in nature. The target mRNA expression was normalized to the 18 S expression, and the relative expression was calculated back to the untreated control. Chemical Modification of Genomic DNA—EcoRI-digested genomic DNA (4 μg/40 μl) was denatured with 0.3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C and subsequently modified by 3.1 m sodium bisulfite and 0.5 mm hydroquinone in 480 μl under mineral oil for 16 h at 55 °C. Modified DNA was purified using the QIAquick DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and then treated with 0.3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C to complete the modification. After sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation, the modified DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of H2O for PCR amplification. PCR Amplification of Bisulfite-treated DNA—Two sequential PCRs were used to amplify the modified DNA fragments of interest. 2 μl of modified DNA template was used in the first PCR (a). Nested primers were used in the subsequent PCR (b). The primers for the hHR23B gene (GenBank™ accession number AY165178) are: (a) first PCR, 5′-GAATTAGT(C/T)GATATTTTTAGGGTTGAGTTT-3′ (sense, nucleotides 721–750) and 5′-ATAAAAATAAAAACTTATCACATTC(A/G)CCCAA-3′ (antisense, nucleotides 1400–1430); (b) nested PCR, 5′-GGGTTT(C/T)GTATTTATTTTGT(C/T)GGGTTTTTA-3′ (sense, nucleotides 841–870), and 5′-CAAACAAAAAATCC(A/G)CTAACTCACCACAAAATA-3′ (antisense, nucleotides 1220–1252). PCR conditions for both PCR reactions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and finally 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA fragment was subjected to cloning using the pCR4-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid Construction—The hHR23B cDNA was PCR-amplified from the ETS clone purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) and subsequently cloned into the pIRES2 vector (BD Biosciences). The recombinant plasmid expresses both green fluorescent protein and hHR23B while being transfected into mammalian cells. Plasmid UV Irradiation and DNA Repair Activity Assay—The UV-irradiated pRSVluc plasmid with the luciferase reporter gene was used to measure DNA repair activity (15Emmert S. Slor H. Busch D.B.

The pRSVluc plasmid (50 ng/μl) was pipetted with 950 μl volume per well into a 6-well plate, which was then subjected to UV irradiation using a UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Three different irradiation doses were used (200, 300, and 400 joules/m2). The UV-irradiated pRSVluc plasmids were co-transfected with the pIRES2-hHR23B expression construct into KAS-6/1 cells to evaluate the DNA repair activity of hHR23B (15Emmert S. Slor H. Busch D.B.

Res. 2002; 509: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—One million of the KAS-6/1 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with plasmid constructs using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, the harvested cell pellets were dissolved in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). The cell lysate was added with luciferin solution (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm CoA, 530 μm ATP, 470 μm luciferin, 1 μm (MgCO3)4·Mg(OH)2·5H2O) and then measured for luciferase activity in a Monolight™ 3010C luminometer (BD Biosciences). hHR23B Gene Expression Is Elevated by Zebularine—Considering karyotypic abnormality in MM, we postulated that nucleotide excision repair proteins are epigenetically silenced during the development of MM. To approach this, we used Zebularine, a demethylating agent that is reported to reverse the DNA methylation in the genome and, in doing so, to result in higher gene expression of hypermethylated genes. Survival of KAS-6/1 cells does not require IL-6; however, their growth is potentiated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (17Westendorf J.J. Ahmann G.J. Greipp P.R. Witzig T.E. Lust J.A. Jelinek D.F. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1996; 5: 866-876Google Scholar). KAS-6/1 cells were evaluated under three experimental conditions: 1) untreated (NEG), 2) Zebularine-treated (ZEB), and 3) ZEB-treated cells rescued by IL-6 supplementation (REM) after removal of the drug. After removing Zebularine, the absence of IL-6 in the culture medium failed to sustain survival of the KAS-6/1 cells, leading to significant cell death. Isolated total RNAs from NEG, ZEB, and REM KAS-6/1 cells were subjected to ribonuclease protection assay (Fig. 1). The expression profile indicated that among the nucleotide excision repair proteins, DDB1, hHR23B, and likely RPAp32 were up-regulated by Zebularine treatment (ZEB) compared with the untreated one (NEG). Intriguingly, these three up-regulated NER genes in ZEB were subsequently resilenced when Zebularine was removed and the cells were recultured in IL-6 (REM). Of the three candidate genes, the hHR23B gene, exhibited the most significant increase (approximately 5-fold). Approximate equal loading was verified by both positive controls, L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The increase in ZEB presumably resulted from the blocking of de novo methylation by Zebularine, but it might have been due to indirect mechanisms. DNA Hypermethylation of the hHR23B Gene Is Associated with Transcriptional Silencing—To confirm the demethylating effect of Zebularine, genomic DNAs isolated from NEG, ZEB, and REM KAS-6/1 cells were subjected to sodium bisulfite DNA sequencing. The investigated upstream region of the hHR23B gene corresponds to positions –360 to +55, relative to the transcription start site, and contains a high density of CpG dinucleotides (so-called “CpG islands”) (Fig. 2A). The bisulfite DNA sequencing result of NEG shows the methylation status of 47 potential methylation loci (underlined) scattered from positions –338 to –64 upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 2A). The methylation loci are mainly CpG dinucleotides, and to a lesser extent, CpA dinucleotides. There is a lack of methylation loci from position –63 to +55 despite the presence of clusters of CpG and CpA dinucleotides in this region. However, the methylation status in the region downstream of the transcription start site has been proposed to be independent of its transcriptional regulation (18Jones P.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 34-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). For untreated KAS-6/1 cells, the extent of methylation accounts for an average of 65% methylated cytosines among the 47 potential methylation loci (Fig. 2B, NEG). A 48-h exposure to Zebularine at a concentration of 250 μm was able to cause the demethylation of most of the methylation loci. The methylation density was decreased to 22% (ZEB). This suggests that the transcriptional silencing of the hHR23B gene is associated with DNA hypermethylation in its upstream promoter region (Figs. 1 and 2), which contains several potential transcriptional enhancer sites, such as Sp1 sites (Fig. 2A, boxed). Demethylation by Zebularine within this region would allow the binding of Sp1 and facilitate its transcriptional activity. Hypermethylation of the hHR23B Gene Is Reversible—The survival of KAS-6/1 cells requires the presence of IL-6 in the culture medium after Zebularine treatment is discontinued. The intriguing observation is that the hHR23B promoter region in REM is overwhelmingly remethylated at the cytosines of the CpG and CpA dinucleotides. The overall methylation density accounts for 54%, in contrast to 22% of ZEB (Fig. 2B). The diversity of the methylated loci among randomly chosen clones in REM suggests that the rescued KAS-6/1 cells are equally derived from the diverse cell population treated with Zebularine. This rules out the possibility that subsets of cells unaffected by Zebularine have a better survival rate, dominating the rescued cell population. However, the re-established methylation loci are more distributed from positioned cytosines 10–22 and 40–47, and those of NEG are more homogeneous. The cause of this difference remains unclear. The Reversible Methylation Process Is Kinetically Associated with Transcriptional Down-regulation of the hHR23B Gene—To further understand this different remethylated pattern, we monitored the remethylating (resilencing) kinetics of the hHR23B gene using quantitative PCR analysis (Fig. 3). As expected, the expression of the hHR23B gene was elevated in ZEB compared with NEG. However, withdrawal of Zebularine did not immediately repress the hHR23B gene expression. Increased expression of hHR23B was observed within 48 h (day 1 and day 2). This might be attributed to a recovery period from the potential cytotoxic effects of ZEB following drug removal. The sustaining expression level indicates that the hHR23B gene promoter is not yet remethylated, at least within 48 h. Nevertheless, this increased expression level was soon followed by a decreasing hHR23B gene expression. The required time frame of delayed gene repression was normally observed at day 3 after drug removal using the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR technique. The reduction of hHR23B gene expression results from remethylation of the hypomethylated hHR23B gene promoter (Figs. 1 and 2). The delayed repression of the hHR23B gene requires a longer time frame for active DNA methyltransferases to accumulate after Zebularine is removed. This could involve the attenuation of alleles containing the incorporated analog, Zebularine, while the whole cell population undergoes further cell divisions. The newly synthesized DNA methyltransferases are no longer covalently trapped by Zebularine and would remethylate those hemi-methylated alleles, of which the newly synthesized DNA strands are deprived of methylation imprint. Similar kinetics for the gene expression of remethylation was previously demonstrated for the p16 gene by reverse transcription-PCR techniques in the human T24 bladder carcinoma treated either with Zebularine (19Cheng J.C. Weisenberger D.J. Gonzales F.A. Liang G. Xu G.L. Hu Y.G. Marquez V.E. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (20Bender C.M. Gonzalgo M.L. Gonzales F.A. Nguyen C.T. Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6690-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This also suggests that the remethylation is time-dependent, rather than cell cycle-dependent. Comparison of the methylation density of the hHR23B gene promoter between NEG and REM (Fig. 2B) shows differences among those identified methylation loci. The regions of cytosines at positions 5–13 and 31–39 exhibit a lesser extent of hypermethylation in REM. Interestingly, the prediction of cis-acting regulatory DNA elements for transcription factor binding (bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/signal/) within the hHR23B promoter region indicates that the less hypermethylated regions in REM are highly G + C-rich, among which four high scores of transcription factor Sp1 binding sites (5′-GGGCGGAG-3′, 5′-GAGGCGGAGC-3′,5′-CCCGCCCC-3′ (reverse strand), and 5′-GGGCGGAG-3′, boxed in Fig. 2A) are predicted. The consensus sequence suggested for Sp1 recognition is either 5′-GGGCGGAG-3′ or 5′-(G/T)(A/G)GGCG(A/G)(A/G)(C/T)-3′. The fact that the highly G + C-rich regions are less liable to de novo methylation machinery, especially after being devoid of epigenetic marking by Zebularine, is interesting. The similar observation that the Sp1-like element protects a CpG island from de novo methylation in the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene in a mouse model has been reported (21Brandeis M.

The Nuclear hHR23B Proteins and Their DNA Damage Repair Activity in KAS-6/1 Myeloma Cells—The first step of NER requires a complex containing both the hHR23B and xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) proteins to recognize DNA lesions of the genome. The nuclear localization of the hHR23B proteins has been shown in HeLa cells by van der Spek et al. (23van der Spek P.J. Eker A. Rademakers S. Visser C. Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2551-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our immunohistochemical investigation of the hHR23B protein in KAS-6/1 cells also demonstrates this protein to be predominantly in the nucleus, with lower intensity observable in the cytosol (result not shown). The defects of NER activity in xeroderma pigmentosum patients contribute to the development of skin cancer as a result of failure to repair UV-induced DNA damage (15Emmert S. Slor H. Busch D.B. Batko S. Albert R.B. Coleman D. Khan S.G. Abu-Libdeh B. DiGiovanna J.J. Cunningham B.B. Lee M.M. Crollick J. Inui H. Ueda T. Hedayati M. Grossman L. Shahlavi T. Cleaver J.E. Kraemer K.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 972-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To assign the NER function of hHR23B proteins in KAS-6/1 cells, we adopted the plasmid host cell reactivation assay frequently used for assessing DNA repair activity in xeroderma pigmentosum group studies (15Emmert S. Slor H. Busch D.B. Batko S. Albert R.B. Coleman D. Khan S.G. Abu-Libdeh B. DiGiovanna J.J. Cunningham B.B. Lee M.M. Crollick J. Inui H. Ueda T. Hedayati M. Grossman L. Shahlavi T. Cleaver J.E.

Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We used the luciferase reporter gene plasmid (pRSVluc) that has undergone progressive irradiation at doses of 200, 400, and 600 J/m2. By co-transfecting the irradiated plasmid pRSVluc with or without the pIRES2-hHR23B expression construct into KAS-6/1 cells, the reactivation of luciferase reporter gene activity indicates the NER function of hHR23B proteins. As shown in Fig. 4A, the damage of UV irradiation resulted in a decrease in luciferase activity proportional to increasing doses of UV irradiation in KAS-6/1 cells, either with or without introduction of exogenous hHR23B. However, introduction of exogenous hHR23B elevated luciferase activity by approximately 2-fold. The increase was also observed when the pRSVluc in absence of UV irradiation (0 J/m2) was co-transfected with the hHR23B expression plasmid. This is likely because of pre-existing DNA nicks or breakages of the pRSVluc plasmid that are repaired by the exogenous hHR23B proteins. At the median dose of 400 J/m2 UV irradiation (Fig. 4B), the exogenous hHR23B proteins exhibited an increasing DNA repair activity (from 0.3 to 0.5 μgof the pIRES2-hHR23B construct). The DNA repair activity was elevated to 4.4, 27.3, and 92.0% by co-transfecting with 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 μg of the pIRES2-hHR23B construct, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in KAS-6/1 myeloma cells the hHR23B proteins are functional in repairing the genome damage caused by irradiation and presumably by other damaging factors. The region (position –338 to –64) of the identified methylation loci of the hHR23B gene overlaps the 200-bp region that usually embraces the basic promoter, where complexes of universal transcription factors and RNA polymerases bind. The overall demethylation by Zebularine treatment renders these loci unmethylated, inclusive of several potential Sp1 binding sites (5′-GGGCGGAG-3′, 5′-GAGGCGGAGC-3′, 5′-CCCGCCCC-3′ (reverse strand), and 5′-GGGCGGAG-3′, boxed in Fig. 2A), and is accompanied by higher hHR23B gene expression. Therefore, the methylation pattern found in the NEG and REM samples is likely to account for the transcriptional repression of the hHR23B gene. The reversible methylation after removal of Zebularine also reflects the hypermethylation tendency of the hHR23B gene due to the tumorigenic status of the KAS-6/1 myeloma cells. The slight difference of distribution of methylation density, such as Sp1-like elements, in the hHR23B gene promoter in REM suggests a delayed hypermethylation in this region (21Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 22Siegfried Z. Eden S. Mendelsohn M. Feng X. Tsuberi B.Z. Cedar H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the re-established methylation pattern via Zebularine-generated “de novo” behavior could be due to the epigenetically established methylation marking. This might involve different structural organization in the chromatin, abnormal chromosomal translocations, and dysregulated gene profiles of transcriptional factors/co-factors, as KAS-6/1 myeloma cells are further tumorigenetically developed from early B cell maturation. There is also a lack of reports addressing specific DNA de novo methylation patterns, probably because of the high redundancy of CpG islands at the genomic DNA level. Chromosome translocation and gene dysregulation are two major cytogenetic abnormalities resulting from the multistep development of myeloma. Most chromosome translocation occurs in the IgH locus (14q32), with an incidence of 60–65% in intramedullary myeloma, 70–80% in extramedullary myeloma, and >90% in myeloma cell lines (24Bergsagel P.L. Kuehl W.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5611-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The primary translocation appears because of errors accompanied by VDJ recombination, IgH switch recombination, or somatic hypermutation during normal plasma cell development. The unrepaired errors during chromosomal rearrangement contribute to genetic instability, and the chance for genetic instability is increased if the DNA repair genes are silenced during MM development. To date only aberrant promoter hypermethylation of one DNA repair protein, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, has been reported in lymphoma (5Rossi D. Gaidano G. Gloghini A. Deambrogi C. Franceschetti S. Berra E. Cerri M. Vendramin C. Conconi A. Viglio A. Muti G. Oreste P. Morra E. Paulli M. Capello D. Carbone A. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 123: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The hypermethylation of the hHR23B gene is the first example of epigenetic change of NER in malignant MM. In contrast, our preliminary result also shows that the hypermethylation of the hHR23B gene promoter region of normal resting human B cells does not exist (unpublished results). Considering that multiple myeloma arises from a normal germinal center, it is possible that the epigenetic hypermethylation of the hHR23B gene contributes the genetic instability of MM development during early B cell maturation. Dysregulations of growth control-related genes (c-myc, cyclin D1, p53, pRb, FAS, FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3), and bcl-2) are also known to occur in the development of myeloma malignancy (12Hallek M. Bergsagel P.L. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pratt G. Mol. Pathol. 2002; 55: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The hHR23B gene is dysregulated as reported in this study. Moreover, the hHR23B protein has been identified as one of the apoptosis-associated proteins in human Burkitt lymphoma (25Brockstedt E. Rickers A. Kostka S. Laubersheimer A. Dorken B. Wittmann-Liebold B. Bommert K. Otto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28057-28064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is also proposed that NER is involved in p53-dependent apoptosis, which requires the involvement of four proteins, xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups D and B (XPD and XPB), p53, and p33ING1b (isoform of the tumor suppressor gene ING1) (26Bernstein C. Bernstein H. Payne C.M. Garewal H. Mutat. Res. 2002; 511: 145-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 27Kaina B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1547-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Therefore, epigenetic silencing of the hHR23B gene would favor the clonal expansion of myeloma cells. Among a complex of lymphohematopoietic growth factors involved in myeloma development, IL-6 supports the survival and/or expansion of MM cells not only by stimulating cell division but also by preventing apoptosis (28Kallen K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 323-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In multiple myeloma, IL-6 survival and proliferation mechanisms are due to the activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (29Amlak M.

Little is known about whether the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 contributes to epigenetic cellular gene silencing. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that IL-6 up-regulates DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase), possibly through the transcription factor, Fli-1 (Friend leukemia integration-site 1), in human erythroleukemia K562 cells (8Hodge D.R.

Using the IL-6-dependent myeloma KAS-6/1, we here demonstrated that the NER hHR23B gene is hypermethylated in the promoter region, as well as other tumor suppressor genes. 2D. R. Hodge, B. Peng, C. Pompeia, W. Xiao, and W. L. Farrar, manuscript in preparation. The reversible DNA hypermethylation process in the presence of IL-6 raises the question of whether the prolonged proneoplastic effect of IL-6 is one of many factors contributing to the development from plasma cells to myeloma. Nevertheless, how this signaling directs hypermethylation, possibly through different transcription factors such as pRB and E2F1 (32Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), remains to be addressed.

We have shown previously that α-boranophosphate nucleoside analogs suppress RT-mediated resistance when the catalytic rate is responsible for drug resistance such as in the case of K65R and dideoxy (dd)NTPs, and Q151M toward AZTTP and ddNTPs. Here, we extend this property to BH3-d4TTP and BH3-3TCTP toward their clinically relevant mutants Q151M and M184V, respectively. Pre-steady-state kinetics on mutants of the Q151M RT family reveal a 3–5-fold resistance to d4TTP. This resistance is suppressed using BH3-d4TTP. Likewise, resistance to 3TCTP by M184V RT (30-fold) and K65R/M184V RT (180-fold) is suppressed using BH3-3TCTP because of a 160-fold acceleration of the catalytic constant kpol. Mechanistic insights into the rate enhancement were obtained using various α-boranophosphate nucleotides. The presence of the BH3 group renders kpol independent of amino acid substitutions present in RT. Indeed, the ∼100-fold decrease in polymerase activity caused by the R72A substitution is restored to wild-type levels using BH3-dTTP. Metal ion titration studies show that α-boranophosphate nucleoside analogs enhance 3–8-fold the binding of Mg2+ ions to the active site of the RT·DNA·dNTP complex and alleviate the requirement of critical amino acids involved in phosphodiester bond formation.

Each of these prodrugs needs to be phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate form to compete with its natural dNTP counterpart for incorporation into DNA. Unfortunately, the highly adaptive capacity of HIV-1 selects variants that are no longer drug-sensitive (2Menendez-Arias L. Trends Pharmacol.

One of the strategies for salvage therapy is to develop nucleoside analogs that do not select resistance-associated mutations, or analogs that are still potent against resistant HIVs. α-Boranophosphate nucleotides and oligonucleotides exhibit interesting properties. Such oligonucleotides are resistant to exonucleases and may find applications in direct PCR product sequencing (8Porter K.W. Briley J.D. Shaw B.R.

The (Rp)-diastereoisomer form of α-boranophosphate analogs is the preferred isomer active on RT as a chain terminator when it is devoid of a 3′-OH group. In addition, an increased phosphorylation activity of the human NDP kinase toward borano nucleotides is observed with the same diastereoisomer (15Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D.

Borano nucleotide analogs have recently shown unexpected but interesting properties toward RT variants exhibiting nucleotide analog resistance in vitro, such as the K65R substitution as well as multiple drug resistance caused by Q151M-associated substitutions (6Selmi B.

Both K65R and Q151M RT are responsible for a decrease in the rate of incorporation of the nucleotide analogs specifically, resulting in RT-mediated drug resistance. We have discovered that this type of resistance can be suppressed in vitro by the presence of the BH3 group on the α-phosphate of ddNTPs or AZTTP. Indeed, the presence of the BH3 group does not influence the binding of the analog to the RT active site, but provides (or restores in the case of resistance) a high catalytic rate constant kpol of incorporation of the analog specifically, no matter which amino acid substitution is present at the RT active site. On a mechanistic point of view, this suppression of drug resistance provides a sound confirmation that the catalytic step is responsible for drug discrimination. It also provides an elegant way to overcome RT-mediated resistance in vitro. The chemical basis of this unexpected rate enhancement effect has not been investigated yet. Introduction of a BH3 group on the α-phosphate of a nucleotide changes the physical and chemical properties of the nucleotide, but not its status as a substrate for HIV-1 RT. First, replacement of the nonbridging oxygen by a BH3 group on the α-phosphate has some steric and reactivity consequences. The BH3 group is slightly bulkier than the oxygen, and its space occupancy resembles that of a methyl group. Bond distances change between a P-O (1.54 Å) and a P-B (1.91 Å), as well as angles between O-P-O (≈100°) and O-P-B (≈115°) (18Thatcher G.R.J. Campbell A.T. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 2272-2281Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1, A and B. Boranophosphates retain the same net charge as phosphodiesters, BH3 and O being isoelectronic. However, electronegativity and distribution of charge density within the BH3 group vary relative to an oxygen (19Summers J.S. Roe D. Boyle P.D. Colvin M. Shaw B.R. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 4158-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The BH3 group does not form classical hydrogen bonds (20Crabtree R.H. Siegbahn P.E.M. Eisenstein O. Rheingold A.L. Koetzle T.F.

The predominant reason why the catalytic rate of RT is enhanced by the α-borano substitution is still unclear. In the present study, we extend this property of drug resistance suppression to two other α-boranophosphate nucleotide analogs, BH3-d4TTP and BH3-3TCTP toward corresponding clinically relevant drug resistance mutations Q151M and M184V, respectively. Then, we conduct a mechanistic study using RT mutants to contribute to a molecular explanation for the rate enhancement of the HIV-1 RT toward boranophosphate nucleotides. HIV-RT Plasmid Constructions, Enzyme Preparations, and Re-agents—The wild-type RT gene construct p66RTB was used to obtain mutant RT genes as described previously (22Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Q151Mcomplex RT is referred to as RT containing A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M substitutions. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant RTs were coexpressed with HIV-1 protease in Escherichia coli to get p66/p51 heterodimers, which were later purified using affinity chromatography. All enzymes were quantified by active site titration before biochemical studies. DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The α-boranophosphate nucleotides described here were synthesized and purified as described by Meyer et al. (15Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All diastereoisomers were stereochemically pure as judged by high performance liquid chromatography analysis, except in the case of BH3-3TCTP where the isomers could not be separated and were used as a racemic mixture. Pre-Steady-state Kinetics of Single Nucleotide Incorporation into DNA by RT—Pre-steady-state kinetics were performed using natural dNTPs or nucleotide analogs in conjunction with wild-type RT or mutants. Rapid quench experiments were performed with a Kintek Instruments model RQF-3 using reaction times ranging from 10 ms to 30 s. All indicated concentrations are final. The primer DNA/DNA oligonucleotides used for the rapid reaction were a 5′-labeled 21-mer primer (5′-ATA CTT TAA CCA TAT GTA TCC-3′) annealed to a 31-mer template 31T-RT (5′-TTT TTT TTT AGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dTTP, BH3-dTTP, d4TTP and BH3-d4TTP. A 31C-RT primer (5′-TTT TTT TTT GGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) was used for the incorporation of dCTP, 3TCTP, and BH3-3TCTP. For the sake of comparison, all of these primer-template sequences differ from a single nucleotide only, allowing faithful comparison with our previous published data. For natural nucleotides, the reaction was performed by mixing a solution containing 50 nm (active sites) HIV-1 RT bound to 100 nm primer-template in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) and a variable concentration of dNTP in 6 mm MgCl2. Reactions involving nucleotide analogs were conducted with excess concentrations of enzyme (200 nm) over primer-template duplex (100 nm). These conditions were chosen to eliminate the influence of the enzyme turnover rate (kss), which interferes in the measurements of low incorporation rates. The products of reactions were analyzed using sequencing gel electrophoresis (14% acrylamide, 8 m urea in TBE buffer) and quantified using photostimulated plates and FujiImager. The formation of product (P) over time was fitted with a burst equation P=A⋅(1−exp(−(kapp⋅t))+kss⋅t) where A is the amplitude of the burst, kapp is the apparent kinetic constant of formation of the phosphodiester bond, and kss is the enzyme turnover rate, i.e. the kinetic constant of the steady-state linear phase. The dependence of kapp on dNTP concentration is described by the hyperbolic equation kapp=kpol⋅[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP]) where Kd and kpol are the equilibrium constant and the catalytic rate constant of the dNTP for RT, respectively. Kd and kpol were determined from curve fitting using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). Assays of RT DNA Polymerization Rate—The rate of polymerization was measured using a 5′-labeled oligo(dT)21 primer annealed to a poly(rA) RNA template, in conjunction with K65A and R72A RT. Extension products were analyzed in a gel assay. The primer-template (25 nm) was incubated with 50 nm RT in the RT buffer at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 500 μm dTTP in 6 mm MgCl2 and quenched at various time by 0.3 m EDTA. Average polymerization rates were calculated from the product profile analysis using a FujiImager: the number of nucleotide mers (size in nucleotides, nt) of the most abundant band product was divided by time to yield a polymerization rate in nt·s-1. Assays of Magnesium Binding Affinity for the RT·DNA·dNTP Complex—The dissociation constant Kd(MgCl2)C of magnesium from the RT·DNA·nucleotide complex can be defined as Kd(MgCl2) C=[RT⋅DNA⋅dNTP]⋅[Mg2+] free/[RT⋅DNA⋅dNTP⋅Mg2+] where Kd(MgCl2)C is the Mg2+ dissociation constant for the RT·DNA·dNTP complex, and [Mg2+]free is the free Mg2+ concentration. To determine Kd(MgCl2)C, one should vary the total magnesium concentration and measure [Mg2+]free in the reaction mix simultaneously with the titration of active enzyme [RT·DNA·dNTP·Mg2+]. Alternatively, one could calculate [Mg2+]free for each total (added) magnesium concentration [Mg2+]total. Indeed, nucleotides, DNA, and RT bind magnesium at one or several sites individually, decreasing the concentration of free magnesium relative to total magnesium concentration. Thus, together with the use of a magnesium chelator buffer, one could solve all equations involving magnesium and individual dissociation constants relative to RT, nucleotides, and DNA, such as described in Refs. 23Beckman R.A. Mildvan A.S. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 24Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar for metal ions and prokaryotic DNA polymerases. No attempts were made to determine [Mg2+]free as a function of [Mg2+]total. Instead, for the sake of simplicity of comparison between boronated and nonboronated derivatives, all magnesium-binding species (i.e. RT, DNA, and nucleotide) were kept constant in the reactions, and only [Mg2+]total was varied in nucleotide incorporation assays. Thus, apparent binding constants Kd,app(Mg2+) were determined, and their informational content is valid in the case of nucleotide differing only by the presence of the BH3 group. Apparent dissociation constants Kd,app(Mg2+) were measured in the presence of dTTP, BH3-dTTP, AZTTP, BH3-AZTTP, d4TTP, or BH3-d4TTP. Reactions were performed under the same conditions as for pre-steady-state kinetics of single nucleotide incorporations. Briefly, 200 nm WT RT was incubated with the 21·31T-RT primer-template (50 nm) and mixed rapidly in a quench flow apparatus with an equal volume of a mix containing varying concentrations of MgCl2 (from 0.1 to 32 mm) and nucleotides at a fixed, saturating concentration. The reaction was allowed to proceed (from time zero to 0.02–15 s), quenched with EDTA, and analyzed as described above. Kd,app(Mg2+) and kapp,max were determined from hyperbolic curve fitting. The Role of the BH3 Group in the Suppression of Drug Resistance—We have shown previously that some resistance mutations such as K65R toward ddNTPs and Q151M toward AZTTP and ddNTPs decrease their catalytic rate of incorporation relative to that of their natural nucleotide counter-parts (6Selmi B.

However, the corresponding α-boranophosphate nucleoside analogs are not subjected to such a selective rate decrease, and thus, they suppress RT-mediated resistance. Is that a general rule? In other words, will α-boranophosphate nucleosides suppress all nucleotide drug resistance because of a specific decrease of their catalytic rate? Although it is not possible to answer this question in a simple manner, it is possible to implement the answer to existing nucleotides and their α-boranophosphate derivatives when available. Consequently, we first addressed the issue of d4TTP and 3TCTP together with their corresponding RT-mediated mechanisms of nucleotide resistance. Then, we conducted a series of experiments using mutant RTs as well as metal titration studies to gain insight into the mechanism of rate enhancement observed with these analogs. Resistance of Q151M RT and Q151Mcomplex RT to d4TTP and BH3-d4TTP—Comparative incorporations of d4TTP and BH3-d4TTP by Q151M RT and Q151Mcomplex (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) purified RTs were measured using pre-steady-state kinetics. The nucleotide affinity Kd is calculated as the nucleotide concentration giving half of the maximum incorporation rate kpol. The incorporation efficiency of the nucleotide into DNA (kpol/Kd) is used to calculate the selectivity factor, (kpol/Kd)dNTP/(kpol/Kd)analog. A selectivity factor greater than 1 means that the enzyme discriminates the analog over the natural nucleotide. Finally, the resistance of RT to the inhibitor is the ratio between the selectivity of the mutant over the selectivity of the wild-type enzyme. In accordance with others (25Vaccaro J.A. Parnell K.M. Terezakis S.A. Anderson K.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the incorporation of dTTP by WT RT is not significantly preferred over that of d4TTP, considering the 1.5 selectivity factor (Table I). For the Q151M RT, discrimination of d4TTP is more pronounced (Fig. 2A), essentially at the catalytic step as judged by the lower burst rate for d4TTP (kpol = 6.7 s-1). The discrimination of the nucleotide analog is higher with Q151Mcomplex RT (kpol (d4TTP) = 2.2 s-1), resulting in a 7-fold lower incorporation efficiency (0.12 s-1·μm-1), compared with dTTP (0.79 s-1·μm-1). Q151M RT and Q151Mcomplex RT display a 2.8- and 4.7-fold resistance, respectively (Fig. 2B). In the case of the BH3-d4TTP, however, the nucleotide analog is well incorporated regardless of the enzyme used. High kpol values for BH3-d4TTP keep the incorporation efficiencies between 1.4 s-1·μm-1 for Q151M RT and 0.77 s-1·μm-1 for Q151Mcomplex RT (Table I and Fig. 2A). Hence, there is no discrimination of BH3-d4TTP relative to dTTP. As a consequence, there is no resistance arising from the Q151M-associated multiple drug resistance enzymes toward the boranophosphate analog (Fig. 2B).Table IPre-steady-state kinetic constants of dTTP/d4TTP/BH3-d4TTP incorporation by WT RT, Q151M RT, and Q151Mcomplex RT mutantsConstantWT RTQ151M RTQ151Mcomplex RTdTTPd4TTPBH3-d4TTPdTTPd4TTPBH3-d4TTPdTTPd4TTPBH3-d4TTPKd (μm)aKd and kpol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%17bValue from Selmi et al.

As described before, 3TCTP is very poorly incorporated by WT RT, compared with dCTP (5Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Krebs R.

As shown in Table II, kpol varies from 7.3 s-1 for dCTP to 0.047 s-1 for 3TCTP, inducing a 50-fold selectivity (27Deval J. White K.L. Miller M.D. Parkin N.T. Courcambeck J. Halfon P. Selmi B. Boretto J. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although this discrimination increases with M184V RT through a “Kd-dependent” mechanism, the grossly impaired catalytic step mainly brings the selectivity up to 1,500-fold. When the K65R substitution is added to the M184V background, the burst rate is severely altered (kpol = 0.003 s-1) without significant change in the affinity (Kd = 89 μm) compared with M184V RT. The combination of a “Kd effect” brought by M184V and a “kpol effect” brought by K65R gives K65R/M184V RT a 180-fold level of resistance to 3TCTP. For BH3-3TCTP, the M184V substitution still induces a loss of affinity compared with dCTP, but the catalytic step is improved, as kpol(BH3-3TCTP) is brought up to 0.36–0.5 s-1 for all three enzymes (Fig. 3A, B, and C). This represents a 160-fold improvement of kpol in the case of the K65R/M184V RT mutant. Hence, there is a very limited resistance to BH3-3TCTP given by K65R and M184V substitutions (Fig. 3D), albeit the M184V mutation still increases dissociation constants of 3TCTP and BH3-3TCTP compared with dCTP. It is quite remarkable that the incorporation rate of BH3-3TCTP is >11-fold higher than that of 3TCTP even in the case of the wild-type enzyme. In conclusion, we show that the presence of the BH3 group on 3TCTP compensates for the discrimination initially brought by K65R and M184V mutations, mostly through an increase of the catalytic rate kpol. Overall, resistance because of M184V or K65R/M184V mutations is reduced 2.5–25-fold when BH3-3TCTP is used instead of 3TCTP.Table IIPre-steady-state kinetic constants of dCTP/3TCTP/BH3-3TCTP incorporation by WT RT, M184V RT, and K65R/M184V RT mutantsConstantWT RTM184V RTK65R/M184V RTdCTP3TCTPBH3-3TCTPdCTP3TCTPBH3-3TCTPdCTP3TCTPBH3-3TCTPKd (μm)aKd and kpol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%7.9bValue from Deval et al.

Earlier studies with cDNA cloning and sequence analysis have established that 31-kDa DPMS of S. cerevisiae contains a consensus sequence (YRRVIS141) that can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We have been studying the up-regulation of DPMS activity by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation in higher eukaryotes, and used the recombinant DPMS from S. cerevisiae in this study to advance our knowledge further. DPMS catalytic activity was indeed enhanced severalfold when the recombinant protein was phosphorylated in vitro. The rate as well as the magnitude of catalysis was higher with the phosphorylated enzyme. A similar increase in the catalytic activity was also observed when the in vitro phosphorylated recombinant DPMS was assayed as a function of increasing concentrations of exogenous dolichylmonophosphate (Dol-P). Kinetic studies indicated that there was no change in the Km for GDP-mannose between the in vitro phosphorylated and control recombinant DPMS, but the Vmax was increased by 6-fold with the phosphorylated enzyme. In vitro phosphorylated recombinant DPMS also exhibited higher enzyme turnover (kcat) and enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km). SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography of the 32P-labeled DPMS detected a 31-kDa phosphoprotein, and immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody established the presence of a phosphoserine residue in in vitro phosphorylated recombinant DPMS. To confirm the phosphorylation activation of recombinant DPMS, serine 141 in the consensus sequence was replaced with alanine by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The S141A DPMS mutant exhibited more than half-a-fold reduction in catalytic activity compared with the wild type when both were analyzed after in vitro phosphorylation. Thus, confirming that S. cerevisiae DPMS activity is indeed regulated by the cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation signal, and the phosphorylation target is serine 141.

Dol-P-Man synthase deficiency has been observed in a Class E Thy-1 lymphoma patient and is unable to elongate Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol to Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, a pre-requisite for Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol synthesis (11Chapman A. Trowbridge I.S. Hyman R. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1979; 17: 509-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have also made a similar observation using in vitro studies with amphomycin, a lipopeptide antibiotic from Streptomyces canas, which forms a complex with Dol-P in a calcium-dependent manner, and inhibiting the Dol-P-Man synthase activity (12Banerjee D.K.

Recent reports indicate that partial deficiency of Dol-P-Man synthase causes congenital disorder of glycosylation (14Marquardt T. Denecke J. Eur. J. Pediatr. 2003; 162: 359-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Kim S. Westphal V. Srikrishna G. Mehta D.P. Peterson S. Filiano J. Karnes P.S. Patterson M.C. Freeze H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). DPMS deficiency in these patients is associated with developmental delay, seizures, hyptonia, and dysmorphic function (16Nozaki M. Ohishi K. Yamada N. Kinoshita T. Nagy A. Takeda J. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar). The DPM1 gene is essential for viability in yeast because disruption of the gene is lethal (17Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17499-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Dol-P-Man synthase has been partially purified from mammalian tissue (18Heifitz A. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3057-3063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jensen J.W. Schutzbach J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and highly purified from the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Hasselback E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Dol-P-Man synthase gene DPM1p from S. cerevisiae has shown DPMS to be a structural gene in yeast (17Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17499-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) expressing active protein both in Escherichia coli and in mammalian cells (21Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4612-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Information on the primary structure of Dol-P-Man synthase obtained from cDNA analysis has indicated that (i) it codes for a protein of 267 amino acids with an apparent mass of 30.36 kDa; (ii) there is a potential membrane spanning domain of 25 amino acids at its carboxyl terminus; (iii) a highly conserved amino acid sequence in the membrane spanning domain originally suggested as a potential dolichol and/or polyisoprene substrate recognition site; and (iv) the predicted sequence contains one positive site for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (i.e. serine 141 in a sequence RRVIS141, a consensus sequence for phosphorylation (17Orlean P.

Expression of yeast Dol-P-Man synthase in E. coli and characterization of the purified recombinant enzyme revealed it as a 31-kDa protein. The amino acid composition and sequence of the conserved domain are not critically important for the recognition and binding of Dol-P when the synthase is present in a lipid matrix (24Schutzbach J.S. Zimmerman J.W. Forsee W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24190-24196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Dol-P-Man synthase from S. cerevisiae is different from the mammalian Dol-P-Man synthase in its in vitro properties such as sensitivity to nonionic detergents and its ability to interact with phospholipid vesicles (24Schutzbach J.S. Zimmerman J.W. Forsee W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24190-24196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jensen J.W. Schutzbach J.S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7886-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Dol-P-Man synthase has now been cloned from a number of species such as Trypanosoma brucei, Ustilago maydis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis briggsiae as well as from humans by complementation of a temperature-sensitive S. cerevisiae DPM1 mutant, or by cDNA cloning (27Mazhari-Tabrizi R.

Sequence analysis has suggested that the Dol-P-Man synthase can now be divided into two classes: one includes the enzymes from S. cerevisiae, U. maydis, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania mexicana (29Colussi P.A. Taron C.H. Mack J.C. Orlean P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Ilgoutz S.C. Zawadzki J.L. Ralton J.E. McConville M.J.

They share 50–60% amino acid identity and have a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues near the COOH terminus constituting a transmembrane domain. The other includes enzymes from the human, S. pombe, and Caenorhabditis briggsiae, lack the hydrophobic COOH terminus domain, and thus, the transmembrane domain. In addition, they have also exhibited only –30% amino acid identity with the other group (21Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4612-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Jensen J.W. Schutzbach J.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 27: 6315-6320Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Ilgoutz S.C. Zawadzki J.L. Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2746-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yeast DPM1 DNA complemented both mouse Thy-1 negative lymphoma mutant cells of complementation class E and the Lec15 mutant of Chinese hamster cells (31DeGasperi R. Thomas L.J. Sugiyama E. Chang H.M.

Lehrman M.A. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, human and mouse homologs of DPM1, hDPM1, and mDPM1 did not complement the DPMS mutant in Lec15 cells. This led to establish that mammalian DPMS is a multicomponent enzyme represented by the catalytic subunit DPM1 and two accessory proteins DPM2 and DPM3 (33Tomita S. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Ohishi K.

Most striking, however, is that Dol-P-Man synthase from every known source has a serine residue in the position corresponding to serine 141 in S. cerevisiae DPMS. Serine 141, and the preceding conserved residues meet the criteria for a consensus site for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the DPMS (22Krebs E.G. Beavo J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 48: 923-959Crossref Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 23Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In addition, a cDNA encoding the Schistosoma mansoni DPMS displaying a high homology with Cricetulus griseus and S. pombe (36Tempone A.J. Furtado D.R. Gimba E.R. Oliveira F.M. Rumjanek F.D. Comp.

Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4770) Google Scholar), have also been identified.We have been studying the regulation of Dol-P-Man synthase activity in mammalian cells by a cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation signal (38Banerjee D.K. Kousvelari E.E. Baum B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results supported enhanced Dol-P-Man synthase activity in endoplasmic reticulum membranes from cells treated with a β-agonist isoproterenol, as well as after in vitro phosphorylation of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (39Banerjee D.K. Kousvelari E.E. Baum B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6389-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Banerjee D.K. DaSilva J.J. Bigio B. Biosci. Reports. 1999; 19: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The increased enzyme activity was because of an increase in the Vmax and was independent of enhanced transcription (41Banerjee D.K. Aponte E. DaSilva J.J. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This was strongly supported by down-regulation of the synthase activity in a series of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants (42Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular detail of the phosphorylation regulation of Dol-P-Man synthase, we have used here a purified recombinant Dol-P-Man synthase from S. cerevisiae (wild type) as well as a DPMS mutant in which serine 141 has been replaced with alanine (S141A mutant). We report here that both biochemical and kinetic data have supported up-regulation of the wild type recombinant Dol-P-Man synthase activity after in vitro phosphorylation by PKA. SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography of the 32P-labeled Dol-P-Man synthase has detected a 31-kDa phosphoprotein species as well. Identification of the 31-kDa phosphoprotein on the immunoblot probed with anti-phosphoserine antibody further supported that Dol-P-Man synthase is phosphorylated at the Ser-141. To evaluate serine 141 as the phosphorylation target, we have developed a phosphorylation site-deficient DPMS mutant in which serine 141 has been replaced with alanine by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The S141A DPMS mutant has been successfully expressed as a functionally active enzyme in E. coli and analyzed after in vitro phosphorylation by PKA.MATERIALS AND METHODSE. coli DH5α harboring plasmid pDPM6 containing the structural gene DPM1 for Dol-P-Man synthase was originally developed in the laboratory of Dr. P. W. Robbins at MIT and obtained from Dr. J. S. Schutzbach. Dolichyl monophosphate, ATP (Na salt), the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA, bovine heart), bovine serum albumin (crystalline), chloramphenicol, ampicillin, IPTG, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, TPCK, soybean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, aprotenin, Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and biotin-conjugated anti-phosphoserine monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma. Protein molecular weight markers (high molecular weight, low molecular weight, and kaleidoscope), reagents for protein electrophoresis and immunoblotting, and hydroxyapatite were from Bio-Rad. GDP-[U-14C]mannose (307 mCi/mmol; a Ci = 37 Gbq), [γ-32P]ATP (3.0 Ci/mmol), 14C-methylated protein mixture, ECL chemiluminescence kit, and Amplify were obtained from GE Healthcare. Mouse monoclonal antibody to yeast Dol-P-Man synthase was obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Oligonucleotides for PCR primers were obtained from Oligos Slc, Ridgefield, CT, as well as from the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. Restriction enzymes were acquired from New England BioLabs, Boston, MA.Analytical Methods—Protein was assayed following precipitation of the protein with trichloroacetic acid using a modification (42Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar) of the procedure of Lowry et al. (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions in 12% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) using the buffer system described by Laemmli (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The gels were either processed for autoradiography in Amplify™, according to the procedure described by Bonner and Lasky (45Bonner W.M. Lasky R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5614) Google Scholar), or they were processed for Western blot analysis.Buffers—Buffer A consisted of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol. Buffer B was 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer C was 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (w/v). NET buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Washing buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm LiCl and TTBS was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 137 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20.Dol-P-Man Synthase Assay—Enzymatic transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose was assayed using the procedure described earlier (13Banerjee D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2024-2028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. In vitro phosphorylated or control recombinant Dol-P-Man synthase was incubated at 37 °C for 2 min in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, buffer containing 150 μm EDTA, 30 μm dithiothreitol, 3% glycerol, 90 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μg of Dol-P, 1% Me2SO, and 0.125 μm GDP-[14C]mannose (specific activity 318 cpm/pmol) in a total volume of 100 μl, unless otherwise mentioned. The reaction was stopped with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Chloroform/methanol extracts containing the Dol-P-Man were washed once with 5 volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride and twice with chloroform/methanol/water (3:47:48, v/v/v) to remove free GDP-[14C]mannose. A lower organic phase containing the Dol-P-Man was then quantified in a liquid scintillation spectrometer.Recombinant Dol-P-Man synthase was phosphorylated in vitro by incubating with the catalytic subunit from the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (12 units per 30 μg of protein) at 30 °C for 20 min in the presence of 10 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm ATP as described earlier (42Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the reactions were started by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3.0 Ci/mmol).Construction of the Expression Vector BL21(DE3)pDPM1–9 and Preparation of the Enzyme—The expression vector was constructed earlier by Schutzbach et al. (24Schutzbach J.S. Zimmerman J.W. Forsee W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24190-24196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to purify the Dol-P-Man synthase (46Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In brief, M9ZB broth (47Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 185: 60-93Crossref Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) (4 × 250 ml in 1 liter flasks) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 10 ml of an overnight culture of BL21(DE3)/pDPM1–9. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C on a shaker at 200 rpm. After 3 h (A600 nm of 0.66) the enzyme was induced by adding 2.5 ml of 100 mm IPTG. The cells were harvested 2 h post-induction by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 15 min (Sorvall GSA rotor). All additional procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C or on ice. The cell pellets were washed with 300 ml of water followed by 100 ml of Buffer A, and frozen overnight. The pellets were then thawed, suspended in 10 ml of Buffer A, and the cells were sonically ruptured three times for 30 s with 1-min intervals to allow cooling using a Branson sonifier (Kontes, model W185) at a power setting of 4.5. The suspension was fractionated by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 20 min (Sorvall SS-34 rotor) at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with 25 ml of Buffer A and then suspended in 5 ml of the same buffer. The suspension was diluted with 17.5 ml of Buffer B and 2.5 ml of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The mixture was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 20 min. Both supernatant (which often contained significant amounts of activity), and the pellet were saved. To solubilize additional enzyme, the pellet was suspended in 20 ml of Buffer C. To the dispersed pellets 2.5 ml of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and homogenized for 10 min in a Tekmer homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged as above, and the supernatants were saved. The procedure was repeated once more to yield a third solubilized fraction. Solubilized fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (2.5 × 11 cm) equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer B and eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 0.0 to 1.0 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using YM-10 membranes (Amicon).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Recombinant Dol-P-Man synthase after purification was phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described above. 32P-Labeled Dol-P-Man synthase was immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal antibody (1: 1,000 dilution) to yeast DPMS for 3 h at 4 °C followed by 3 h with 50 μg/ml Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (30 mg/ml) in the presence of aprotinin (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), TPCK (200 μm), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μm). The Protein A-Sepharose antigen-antibody complexes were washed twice with NET buffer, twice with washing buffer, and once with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The immune complexes were released by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by autoradiography (48Banerjee D.K. Tavarez J.J. Oliveira C.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).For immunoblotting, the recombinant Dol-P-Man synthase before and after in vitro phosphorylation was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes according to the procedure described by Towbin et al. (49Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). The blots were treated with a blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS) overnight at 15 °C and subsequently with (a) anti-Dol-P-Man synthase antibody (diluted 1:2,000 in blocking solution), and (b) biotinylated anti-phosphoserine antibody (diluted 1:2,000 in blocking solution) for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were rinsed twice with TTBS, washed with one change of TTBS for 15 min and twice more 5 min apart at room temperature. Blot a was treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000 dilution) to detect the Dol-P-Man synthase; and blot b was treated with streptavidin-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000 dilution) to detect phosphoserine as well as the molecular weight markers. The blots were developed according to the instructions provided with the ECL chemiluminescence kit and exposed to Hyperfilm™ until the desired intensity was achieved.Isolation of Dol-P-Man Synthase S141A Mutant by PCR Site-directed Mutagenesis—The strategy for PCR site-directed mutagenesis consisted on the design of oligonucleotides that contained the desired substitution, and also resulted in a silent mutation with either a new restriction site or elimination of an existing one to aid the analysis. The oligonucleotides were designed with the aid of the DNAsis Program (Hitachi Corp.) and using the DPM1 (S. cerevisiae Dol-P-Man synthase gene sequence GenBank™ J04184) as template. We have used the Silmut computer program (50Shankarappa B. Vijayananda K. Ehrlich G.D. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 882-884PubMed Google Scholar) to identify suitable restriction site(s) for silent mutagenesis. These oligonucleotides were compatible as PCR primer pairs with the DPM1F and DPM1R. The primer pairs, their corresponding products, and diagnostic restriction enzyme were: DPM1F, 5′-CGGGATCCTATGGCTAGCATCGAATACTCTGTT-3′/DPM1R, 5′-ATTCTAGCAGTCGACGCAATGACGCGTCTGTACA-3′ (449 bp); and DPM1F, 5′-TGTACAGACGCGTCATTGCGTCGACTGCTAGAAT-3′/DPM1R, 5′-CTGGATCCTTAAAAGACCAAATGGTATAGCTGGTAGCA-3′ (409 bp).

Gfa has a new fold with two zinc-sulfur centers, one that is structural (zinc tetracoordinated) and one catalytic (zinc apparently tricoordinated). In Gfa-GTT, the catalytic zinc is displaced due to disulfide bond formation of glutathione with one of the zinc-coordinating cysteines. Soaking crystals of Gfa-GTT with formaldehyde restores the holoenzyme. Accordingly, the displaced zinc forms a complex by scavenging formaldehyde and glutathione. The activation of formaldehyde and of glutathione in this zinc complex favors the final nucleophilic addition, followed by relocation of zinc in the catalytic site. Therefore, the structures of Gfa and Gfa-GTT draw the critical association between a dynamic zinc redox switch and a nucleophilic addition as a new facet of the redox activity of zinc-sulfur sites.

Therefore, the structures of Gfa and Gfa-GTT draw the critical association between a dynamic zinc redox switch and a nucleophilic addition as a new facet of the redox activity of zinc-sulfur sites. The redox activity of sulfur ligands in zinc sites, known as zinc redox switch, is a basic principle to control protein function in redox biology (1Maret W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It involves the reversible oxidation and reduction of the cysteine ligands bound to the redox-inert zinc ion. The concept has been developed and probed to explain mechanisms to control zinc homeostasis in the cell, to induce conformational changes in proteins resulting in their active, functional form, and in activation or inactivation of enzymes (2Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The zinc redox switch mechanism is linked to the binding and release of zinc and involves oxidants such as nitric oxide and GSSG (3Maret W. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 5Maret W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).A generally accepted model for the zinc redox switch involving glutathione is the release of zinc upon disulfide bond formation between a glutathione and a zinc-coordinating thiol, known as the “cysteine switch” mechanism (6Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To gain new insights into this partnership we advocate in the following the example of a formaldehyde-converting zinc enzyme that uses glutathione as co-substrate. This zinc enzyme employs a dynamic Zn-S redox switch, crucial to an essentially nucleophilic addition. This means that a cysteine switch step takes place during each turnover of the enzyme. On the contrary, zinc redox switches investigated thus far precede as singular events subsequent reactions, hence having a trigger function for these reactions without being mechanistically involved in them any more.Because of its toxic nature, formaldehyde needs to be efficiently metabolized. In most organisms this is achieved through the GSH-linked oxidation pathway. Its first step is the formation of the S-hydroxymethylglutathione adduct by reaction of formaldehyde with the SH group of glutathione (7Mason R.P. Sanders J.K. Crawford A. Hunter B.K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4504-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequently, S-hydroxymethylglutathione is oxidized by glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, a class III alcohol dehydrogenase (8Sanghani P.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15189-15194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Finally S-formylglutathione hydrolase regenerates glutathione and releases formate (9Harms N. Ras J. Reijnders W.N. van Spanning R.J. Stouthamer A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6296-6299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can be oxidized in some organisms to carbon dioxide.The adduct formation as the first step of the glutathione-linked formaldehyde oxidation is usually an uncatalyzed reaction in vivo (10Gutheil W.G. Kasimoglu E. Nicholson P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, in the methylotrophic α-proteobacterium Paracoccus denitrificans, an enzyme was identified that allows for an increased turnover compared with the uncatalyzed reaction (11Goenrich M. Bartoschek S. Hagemeier C.H. Griesinger C. Vorholt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3069-3072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This enzyme, a 21-kDa protein, was named glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme (Gfa). 1The abbreviations used are: Gfa, glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme; Gfa-GTT, Gfa-glutathione complex; Gfa-GTT-FOR, Gfa-GTT complex soaked with formaldehyde; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous dispersion.1The abbreviations used are: Gfa, glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme; Gfa-GTT, Gfa-glutathione complex; Gfa-GTT-FOR, Gfa-GTT complex soaked with formaldehyde; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. Gfa shows high sequence homology to putative proteins from a number of proteobacteria (see supplemental Fig. 1) (11Goenrich M. Bartoschek S. Hagemeier C.H. Griesinger C. Vorholt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3069-3072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It contains clustered cysteine residues, opening the possibility that the protein might contain zinc binding sites. This raised the questions of whether and, if so, how a catalytic zinc center might be functionally involved in the formation of S-hydroxymethylglutathione.To address these questions, we determined the crystal structures of both unliganded and glutathione-bound enzyme (Gfa-GTT), as well as the structure from crystals of Gfa-GTT soaked with formaldehyde. The structure of Gfa encloses two zinc sites and turns out to have a new fold. Soaking crystals of this intermediate with formaldehyde results in the reconstitution of the holoenzyme structure. Based on these observations, we suggest a mechanism for the nucleophilic addition that places a dynamic zinc redox switch at the core of the enzymatic reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The gene gfa from P. denitrificans was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into a modified pET16b vector containing a TEV cleavage site. This expression construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Protein expression was carried out at 23 °C after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells from 750 ml of expression culture were harvested 8 h after induction and resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The His10-tagged Gfa fusion protein was purified by standard methods using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and TEV protease for cleaving of the His10 tag. The final purification was performed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75HR 3/10 column, which was also used to transfer the protein to the final buffer for crystallization and storage (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The final yield of purified Gfa was typically 30 mg from 750 ml of culture. For crystallization, the purified Gfa was concentrated to 9 mg/ml. Se-Met-labeled Gfa was overexpressed in minimal media supplemented with seleno-methionine according to the EMBL protein expression group (embl-heidelberg.de) and purified according to the established protocol.Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of P. denitrificans Gfa were obtained using vapor diffusion by mixing 2 μl of concentrated protein solution with 2 μl of reservoir solution (2–2.1 m (NH4)2SO4, 4% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.4). They grew within 3–4 days as overlapping plates with dimensions of 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.05 mm. For crystallization of the Gfa-glutathione complex, the reduced form of l-glutathione (10 mm, Sigma) and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol were added to the reservoir solution. The crystals were cryoprotected by transferring them into a solution consisting of crystallization buffer and 10% glycerol prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. To investigate the reaction with formaldehyde, crystals of Gfa-GTT were soaked in a fresh solution containing crystallization buffer, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm formaldehyde for 3–5 min, flash-frozen, and stored under liquid nitrogen. Data were collected for Gfa at Advanced Light Source (X6S, Q210 CCD detector) and for Gfa-GTT as well as Gfa-GTT crystals that have been soaked with formaldehyde (Gfa-GTT-FOR), 2Because of the very high similarity with the Gfa structure, the coordinates and the structure factors for the Gfa-GTT-FOR crystals were not deposited in the Protein Data Bank but are available upon request. at DESY Hamburg (BW6, Mar CCD detector), respectively. Data were processed using the program XDS (12Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). Statistics for data collection and processing are summarized in supplemental Table I.Structure Determination and Refinement—The Gfa structure has been solved by SAD phasing from monoclinic crystals grown using protein incorporating labeled Se-Met. Selenium positions have been found using SOLVE-2.6 based on selenium atoms refinement against anomalous differences at 75–3.8 Å (13Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). RESOLVE was used to extend the resolution to native data, to calculate initial experimental electron density maps, and to obtain the initial model. Further model building was carried out with XtalView and ARP/wARP (14Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Refinement was done at all stages with REFMAC5 (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added with ARP/wARP and checked. The secondary structure has been assigned using the program DSSP (16Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12108) Google Scholar)The structures of the complexes were solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (17Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar) using the structure of Gfa as the search model. After manual model building in the catalytic zinc site, including placement of GTT from the respective REFMAC5 libraries, refinement was done by REFMAC5 similar to the procedure for the holoenzyme. The model geometry was inspected with PROCHECK (18Laskowsky R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-286Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular figures were generated with Pymol and DINO.RESULTSOverall Structure and Zinc Binding Sites—The structure of Gfa was solved to a resolution of 2.35 Å by SAD (19Dauter Z. Dauter M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table I). The 4 monomers in the asymmetric unit clearly form 2 homodimers. The size of the dimer interface is ∼890 Å2 and is equally made by polar and hydrophobic interactions, whereas the interface between the two dimers covers only 60 Å2. Dimer formation in solution was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering measurements (data not shown). Because no major difference was observed between the 2 dimers (r.m.s.d. 0.59 Å for the Cα atoms), we have focused our description on a single dimer (Fig. 1). Gfa forms a globular structure with a new fold (no matches with the DALI server (20Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar)). Thus Gfa and its so far identified sequence orthologs (supplemental Fig. 1) form a new structural family.The main topological feature of this structure is an extremely twisted mixed eight-stranded β-sheet (see supplemental Fig. 2). Within this β-sheet, the strands β8, β9, and β4 form a sandwich with another triple stranded mixed β-sheet (β5, β2, β1). The interconnection between the sheets is mediated by four 310 helices (α2, α3, α4, α6) and two α-helices (α5, α7). Helices α5 and α7 form a small antiparallel bundle and are packing against helix α8 of the opposite monomer, thus constituting a major portion of the interface between the monomers. The structure of each monomer is completed by another short α-helix, α1 (at the N termini), which faces α5, α6, and α8 (at the C termini). The novelty of this 310/β structure resides in the exclusive combination of antiparallel β-sheets with a relatively high number of 310 helices (4Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), a rare occurrence in known protein structures because of unfavorable energetics. The sandwich arrangement of the β-strands is further buttressed by a tetrahedral zinc coordinated by the side chains of Cys-33, Cys-35, Cys-101, and Cys-104 (see supplemental Fig. 3). It appears that this zinc atom has only a structural role. A second zinc ion stabilizes a large hairpin loop that connects β3 and β4 via residues Cys-54, Cys-56, and Cys-59 (Fig. 2a). The presence of zinc as the coordinated metal in Gfa has been proven by its absorption edge in the x-ray fluorescence spectrum (data not shown). Although the structural zinc is fully occupied in all monomers, the occupancy of the second zinc site was refined to 0.6. Because of its apparently labile coordination environment, this zinc site was a candidate for the catalytic function of Gfa. Similar examples, as far as the coordination sphere is concerned, have been reported (21Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The three cysteine residues create a nearly planar arrangement with the zinc, resulting in S-Zn-S angles of ∼ 120°. Electron density of water as a fourth ligand could not be identified. The nearest water molecule is 4.2 Å away from the catalytic site, and the orientation does not comply with tetrahedral geometry. The distance between the zinc ions in the monomers is 19.6–19.9 Å. Structurally there are no indications for functional interactions between them.Fig. 2a and b, view of the catalytic site of Gfa (a) and Gfa-GTT (b) including the H-bonding network (dotted lines) in which the zinc-coordinating thiol groups are involved. The residues involved in Zn2 (a) and GTT (b) binding are labeled accordingly. The representation also contains the electron density at 1σ level in the 2Fo - Fc map for the catalytic zinc and the Cys residues in Gfa (a) and for Cys residues and GTT in Gfa-GTT (B). To evaluate the changes upon GTT coordination, we chose similar perspectives of the active site. Numbering of the residues is according to the expression construct that contains three additional amino acids at the N terminus. c, electron density contoured at 3σ level in the Fo - Fc map (in green) at the catalytic site of Gfa-GTT soaked with formaldehyde.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the resolution of the structure does not allow definite statements about the type of coordinated cysteines (as thiols or thiolates) at the catalytic zinc site, the involvement of the sulfur atoms in a network of H bonds is important in defining its mechanistic aspects. Hence, the three Cys side chains are at donor-acceptor distances of 3.1–3.7 Å (see supplemental Table II) with the main chain amides of Lys-58, Cys-56, and Gly -55 and the Nη2 of Arg-98, as well as with the hydroxyl group of Ser-68 (Fig. 2a). The existence of a so-called “outer coordination sphere” that contains Arg and Ser biases us toward the stabilization of thiolate moieties with lowered pKa (22I Janda D.Y. Derewanda U. Dauter Z. Bielicki J. Cooper D.R. Graf P.C.F. Joachimiak A. Jakob U. Derewanda Z.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 1901-1907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Glutathione Binding—To investigate the glutathione interaction with the presumed catalytic zinc center, Gfa was crystallized with an excess of reduced glutathione (1:20 (mol/mol) Gfa:GTT). In this structure glutathione formed a disulfide bond to Cys-56, completely displacing the catalytic zinc (Fig. 2b). In all four monomers the electron density for glutathione is well defined (Fig. 2b), whereas density for the displaced zinc could not be identified anywhere near the catalytic site. There are no major conformational differences among the amino acids forming the binding pocket of glutathione except for Cys-56, in which the side chain reorients to bridge to the cysteinyl residue of glutathione, and for Lys-58, in which the side chain anchors the glutathione by forming a salt bridge with the glycinyl moiety of glutathione (Fig. 2b). The other key residues for glutathione binding are functionally conserved within the group of Gfa orthologs and other glutathione-binding proteins (Fig. 2b) (23Cameron A.D. Ridderström M. Olin B. Karavana M.J. Creighton D.J. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13480-13490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The glutathione pocket seems to be preexistent in the monomer, the dimer formation having probably only a stabilizing role. The H-bonding network around thiolate moieties described for Gfa is maintained also for Gfa-GTT (Fig. 2, a and b).The overall location of glutathione, very exposed to the solvent region, is reminiscent of the structures of glutathione transferases (24Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), but except for the cysteine-glutathione disulfide bridge, no functional connotations can be drawn between them.The Gfa-Glutathione Complex Reacts with Formaldehyde— When crystals of Gfa-GTT were soaked with formaldehyde, the Fo - Fc difference map allowed the identification of clear positive electron density at the catalytic site, attributable to a zinc atom (Fig. 2c). Further refinement resulted in a structure that was very similar to the structure of the holoenzyme (r.m.s.d. 0.32 Å). The recoordination of zinc strongly indicates a functional connection between Gfa-GTT and subsequent adduct formation. Thus Gfa-GTT must be an active intermediate of the catalytic cycle, and the catalytic zinc, despite its dislocation in the Gfa-GTT structure, still has to be retained in the protein near the catalytic site. An interesting feature of the Gfa structure, which fits this requirement, is a number of His residues (His-32, -50, -52, -107, -117, and –126). These residues, conserved for the whole Gfa family (see supplemental Fig. 4), are positioned relatively close to the active site (8–12 Å) and form a lining of the two wide-open channels connecting the two faces of the active site to the surface of the protein. Therefore the conserved His residues might function as a net keeping the released zinc in the neighborhood of the catalytic center, thus preventing its complete dissociation from the protein. Studies have shown that the ternary Zn-GSH-histidine complexes are readily formed and might be involved in zinc transport (25Krezel A. Wojcik J. Maciejczyk M. Bal W. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2003; : 704-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe structural identification of the Gfa-GTT intermediate combined with the inspection of the structure of Gfa allow formulating a hypothetical coupled reaction mechanism (Fig. 3). According to this mechanism it is actually the oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) that reacts with Cys-56 to form the disulfide-bonded Gfa-GTT intermediate, in which zinc cannot be located either within or outside of the catalytic site.Fig. 3a, time-resolved, three-stage catalytic cycle of Gfa. The outer circle presents the two structurally characterized intermediates that are associated to the postulated small molecule intermediates (inner circle). Stage I represents the initial situation, with Gfa in the presence of oxidized and reduced glutathione. Stage II represents the products of the reaction between Gfa and glutathione: the intermediate with dislocated zinc (Gfa-GTT) and the Zn-glutathione complex of unknown composition (m = 1 or 2), which subsequently scavenges formaldehyde. In this zinc complex the carbonyl bond of formaldehyde, as well as the sulfinyl bond of reduced glutathione, is polarized and thus activated for the final nucleophilic addition. For simplicity, only one variable has been chosen to describe the coordination number of zinc, taking into account the multiplicity of ligands (L) possibly bound to it (e.g. His, H2O). The whole ensemble (Stage III) undergoes the transformation back to Stage I with concomitant release of S-hydroxymethylglutathione. b, schematic representation of the proposed reactions occurring at all stages of the catalytic pathway for m = 1. The complexes involved and all of the reactions are formulated taking into account the oxidation state of +2 for zinc and the electroneutrality principle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, the longest H-bond within the network of H-bonds involving the cysteines at the catalytic site is the one of Cys-56 to the main chain amide of Lys-58 (3.6–3.8 Å). Hence, Cys-56 is the least stabilized, relative to the other two cysteines by coordination to zinc, and thus energetically is most suitable to react with glutathione.It can be hypothesized that the displaced zinc is coordinated to the reduced form of glutathione, because zinc is always associated in vivo with another cellular ligand and is never transferred as the free zinc ion (26Jacob C. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3489-3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The presence of other ligands like water and possibly histidine in the zinc coordination sphere cannot be excluded. We postulate that this zinc complex, for which the exact stoichiometry is unknown at this stage, acts as a scavenger for the formaldehyde present in solution (Fig. 3, Stage II → Stage III). This would provide an explanation for another previously proposed role of Gfa as a formaldehyde scavenger (11Goenrich M. Bartoschek S. Hagemeier C.H. Griesinger C. Vorholt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3069-3072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this mixed complex the carbonyl bond of formaldehyde as well as the sulfinyl bond of reduced glutathione are polarized and thus activated for the final nucleophilic addition, resulting in the formation of S-hydoxymethylglutathione, the relocation of zinc in the catalytic site, and the regeneration of oxidized glutathione. The oxidized glutathione can be fed back into the catalytic cycle (Fig. 3, Stage III → Stage I).Redox activity of sulfur ligands has been recognized as an important feature of zinc proteins, creating an oxidoreductive environment in which the ligands, but not the metal, are oxidized and reduced with concomitant release and binding of zinc (1Maret W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 4Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). It was also found in other proteins, that the presence of a redox agent such as glutathione influences the zinc transfer, with the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione playing a critical role in the complete displacement of zinc (27Jiang L-J. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3483-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).The displacement of zinc by binding of glutathione to a cysteine residue of the catalytic site turns the catalytic zinc center into a highly dynamic zinc redox switch, where zinc moves in a ping-pong fashion between its coordination site and a dislocated state forward and backward. In the dislocated state zinc exerts its actual catalytic function by activating coordinated formaldehyde and glutathione for the nucleophilic addition. Thus a dynamic zinc redox switch actually serves as the piston for the catalyzed nucleophilic addition. The perpetual large motions of zinc, which are implied in this mechanism, might be the rate-limiting step of the reaction and the reason for the low turnover number of Gfa. It has also been shown in the past that this reaction is strongly pH-dependent (11Goenrich M. Bartoschek S. Hagemeier C.H. Griesinger C. Vorholt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3069-3072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The involvement of the glutathione redox system, the ratio of oxidized and reduced glutathione being pH-dependent, delivers an explanation for this observation. The dimensions of the catalytic cleft easily allow the accommodation of a number of glutathione molecules, an essential requirement for the postulated mechanism (see supplemental Fig. 5).An alternative explanation for the activity of Gfa would be a mechanism similar to the one of alkyltransferases, such as MtaA or betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (28Kruer M. Haumann M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Thauer R.K. Dau H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Evans J.C. Huddler D.P. Hilgers M.T. Romanchuk G. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3729-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The postulated role of zinc in these enzymes is that of a Lewis acid that binds the thiol substrates as thiolates and thus activates the thiol group to be alkylated. In the light of this mechanism the Gfa-GTT substrate would have to be considered an oxidative artifact of our crystallization conditions; but the fact that zinc is recoordinated upon the reaction of Gfa-GTT with formaldehyde clearly demonstrates that Gfa-GTT is a central intermediate of the nucleophilic addition catalyzed by Gfa. Therefore a mechanism similar to that of the alkyltransferases seems improbable.Zinc redox switches described so far are single turnover events. For example, in the chaperone Hsp33 of E. coli, activation by displacement of zinc results in the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds and refolding of the monomeric protein, which can then dimerize and thus create the hydrophobic surface essential for functioning as a chaperone in protein folding (30Graumann J.L.H.

Low L.Y De Guzman R. Martinez-Yamout M. Jakob U. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In cellulose synthase, dimerization of the subunits occurs through the intermolecular disulfide bond formation after zinc release (32Kurek I. Kawagoe Y. Jacob-Wilk D. Doblin M. Delmer D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11109-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Also in enzymes, single turnover displacement or binding of zinc has been found to inactivate or trigger enzyme activity. In betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, the zinc displacement is followed by formation of a disulfide bond between two of three cysteines (29Evans J.C. Huddler D.P. Hilgers M.T. Romanchuk G. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3729-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), resulting in inactivation. Zinc-replete enzyme is reactivated. In NO synthase, the release of the zinc bridging the two monomers through oxidation of its thiolate ligands causes uncoupling of NO synthesis (33Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin.
