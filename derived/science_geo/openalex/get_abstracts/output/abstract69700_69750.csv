Both the behavior and the gland integrity are under androgen control, as indicated by castration and replacement with testosterone propionate. The integrity of the gland seems less important for marking than an influence on the central nervous system, although the gland can be used as an external measure of androgen levels. It is possible that the secretion acts as a pheromone to signal territorial possession."

https://openalex.org/W1981272901,Microscopic histochemical examinations of cultured tobacco callus disclosed a strong correlation between starch accumulation and shoot initiation. The accumulation started before any observable organized development and was heaviest in cells of loci which ultimately gave rise to organ primordia. Treatment of tissue cultures with gibberellin prevented starch accunmulation and organ formation.

https://openalex.org/W2004360463,"The DNA content of individual cell nuclei of cat hippocampus has been measured by means of a scanning cytophotometric technique. The pyramidal cells are tetraploid, whereas the remaining cell types, which include glial cells, interneurons, and the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, are diploid. Nuclei of tetraploid pyramidal cells are significantly larger than those of diploid granule cells."

The propertis of this substance are described, and its structure is confirmed by mass spectrometry and by partial synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008919591,A visual target was mloved left and right in exact synchrony with vertical movements of the head. A few minutes' exposure to this novel head-movement feedback led to a change in the visual discrimlination of head movement from object movement. The critical factor in the adaptation is the novel correlation of eye and head movement elicited during the period of exposure.
https://openalex.org/W1994475922,"Either blinding or the injection of 1 milligram of testosterone propionate into male Sprague-Dawley rats, 3 days old, results in testes and accessory organs (seminal vesicles and coagulating glands) that are smaller than normal when the rats are 72 days old. The response to blinding is prevented by removal of the pineal gland, whereas the response to treatment with testosterone is unaffected by pinealectomy. Combination of the two treatments in 3-day-old rats causes testes to be less than one-third their normal size at 72 days of age; pinealectomy in these rats permits the reproductive organs to grow to the same size as those in the androgen-treated animals."

https://openalex.org/W2078882537,"Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) enhanced the hypertaurinuria produced by benzene, chlorobenzene, and toluene in rats. Undiluted DMSO was more effective than DMSO diluted with water in potentiating the toxicity of benzene in both rats and mice. Supernatants (9000g) prepared from livers of rats treated with DMSO 24 hours earlier metabolized more benzene than those from control rats."
https://openalex.org/W2074285480,"A gene affecting the final two enzymes of uridylic acid biosynthesis does not affect a third, metabolically adjacent enzyme. Similarly, compounds that increase cellular activity for the affected enzymes do not increase activity for the third enzyme. The pyrimidine pathway can be subdivided into groups of concurrently responding enzymes. These groups may be smaller in human cells than they are in microbial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2011169504,"Red cells from individuals deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase undergo increased autohemolysis when incubated in the presence of influenza-A virus. Normal red cells, but not those from individuals deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, show increased activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt in the presence of the virus. This increase in shunt activity appears to be related to oxidation of cellular sulfhydryl groups."

https://openalex.org/W2087150694,Chicks wearing hoods containing 8.5-degree wedge prisms from the day of hatching showed both significant reduction in the average lateral displacement of pecking (adaptation) and significant pecking overcompensation in the direction opposite to the original displacement (negative aftereffect) when matched 0-degree plates were substituted for the prisms on the 8th day.

https://openalex.org/W2051206166,"THE absorption spectrum of catalase compound II is well established and provides the principal basis for the characterization of this species. The nature of the reactions involved in the conversion of catalase to compound II is not well understood, but it is clear that compound II plays a very important part in the reversible deactivation of catalase by its substrates. Although there has been no suggestion in the literature that the formation of compound II involves a major disruption of the catalase molecule, recent kinetic studies in this laboratory1 suggested that compound II may be a sub-unit species. This compound is sufficiently stable to permit a direct test of this idea by sedimentation velocity studies in the analytical ultracentrifuge."

https://openalex.org/W2030898637,"THERE is so far no satisfactory explanation for the synapsis of homologous chromosomes at meiosis1. In the past, the process has been attributed to various factors such as electrostatic forces2, resonance bonding3, hydro-dynamic forces4 and antigen-antibody formation5. The criticisms of these hypotheses have been reviewed by Riley and Law1. In this communication I have attempted to explain this phenomenon in molecular terms."

https://openalex.org/W2084651440,"ZETTLEMOYER et al.1 have recently reported considerable differences in the rates of adsorption of some isomeric surfactants, for example, sodium octyl α-sulphopelargonate (I), a wetting agent, and sodium methyl α-sulphopalmitate (II), a detergent, to ‘Graphon’. Both 1 and II have the formula RCH(SO3−Na+)COOR′, but differ in the lengths of the chains R and R′. Type I compounds seem to adsorb three–six times faster than type II compounds. The explanations cited are a higher diffusion coefficient (D) or a faster sticking to the ‘Graphon’ surface for I (ref. 1)."
