(or twice that), b ≈ 7 A., and c = 3·44 A. I should like now to correct this in the light of more recent considerations."

https://openalex.org/W1541333661,"Although it has been shown that glycine is the nitrogenous precursor of the protoporphyrin moiety of hemoglobin (1,2), it has not been previously established that glycine is utilized for the formation of all four pyrrole structures of the porphyrin. In protoporphyrin (Fig. 1) two of the pyrrole rings (I and II) contain methyl and vinyl side chains and two (III and IV) contain methyl and propionic acid side chains; it is conceivable that these two different pyrrole structures are synthesized in the animal organism from different precursors. Degradation experiments were therefore undertaken to study the distribution of isotopic nitrogen in N15-labeled heme, produced in vivo after the administration of N15-labeled glycine, in order to determine whether glycine is used in the synthesis of both pyrrole types. The degradation studies were carried out in a manner to give unequivocal data with respect to separation of the two different pyrrole structures found in protoporphyrin. Labeled hemin, obtained from the blood of a human and from the blood of ducks, after the administration of N16-labeled glycine, was converted into hematoporphyrin dimethyl ether which was subsequently oxidized to yield methylmethoxyethylmaleimide (from pyrrole rings I and II) and methyl propionic acid maleimide or hematinic acid (from pyrrole rings III and IV) (Fig. 1). It can be seen from Table I that in each experiment the N15 values of the methylmethoxyethylmaleimide from pyrrole rings I and II and of the hematinic acid from pyrrole rings III and IV were equal, and were identical with the Nls concentrations in the porphyrin. Therefore, these experiments demonstrate that glycine is utilized equally for the formation of the two types of pyrroles in the protoporphyrin. These findings are in harmony with the hypothesis that in the biosynthesis of protoporphyrin a pyrrole ring is formed which is a common precursor of both types of pyrrole structures found in the protoporphyrin. These studies do not as yet reveal the mechanism by which glycine is utilized in the biosynthesis of the porphyrin. However, this report, together with our previous work, demonstrated directly that the nitrogen of"

Tóth and others3 proyarcl by micro-Kjeldahl determinations that species of Rhynchota (Aphides, etc.) can also rapidly and Considerably increase their nitrogen content by utilizing atmospheric nitrogen, though Smith4 has not been able to confirm these results. This year, we made more progress in studying nitrogen fixation by the bark beetle, Ips, which has done much damage lately in Czech spruce forests."
https://openalex.org/W2056367836,"THE work of Rehbinder and his co-workers on the effect of surface-active substances on the strength of crystalline solids has been followed with considerable interest in this laboratory. In a paper published with Lichtman and Maslennikov, Rehbinder1 reports a 50 per cent decrease in the yield value of single crystals of tin and zinc when immersed in a 0·2 per cent solution of oleic acid in a non-polar paraffin oil. He also reports a five-fold increase in the electrical resistance of a single crystal of tin when elongated almost to fracture in the same solution, in comparison with the resistance of a specimen of the same orientation similarly extended in air. These effects are ascribed to the opening and extension of the micro-cracks in the crystal by the 'wedging action' of a film of liquid drawn into the micro-cracks by an adsorbed layer of oleic acid molecules. This principle of 'adsorption reduction of hardness' has been widely applied in various processes for the mechanical destruction of brittle bodies2."
https://openalex.org/W1973401255,"IT is generally required in radioactive tracer procedure when applied to biochemical problems that the stable and radioactive molecules or ions possess identical configurations. Only when the two isotopic atoms are supplied in the same chemical form can it be assumed that living tissues will absorb them in the proportions applied. In experiments carried out here with phosphorus-32, it was found that this requirement was not satisfied, and since no information is available on the selectivity of the plants to isotopic elements in different chemical forms, our data cannot be interpreted."

https://openalex.org/W20355472,"SUMMARY 1. Urinary excretion of inorganic, ethereal, and neutral sulfur has been determined before and after administration of synthetic estrogens to rats, rabbits, cats, and dogs. 2. A rise in the ethereal sulfate fraction was sometimes found after diethylstilbestrol in rats, cats, and dogs, but not in rabbits. No increase was obtained with dienestrol in rats or with monomestrol in one rabbit. 3. The neutral sulfur fraction was usually decreased following estrogen administration. Inorganic sulfur usually fell markedly. 4. These results were interpreted to indicate that conjugation of diethyl- stilbestrol with sulfuric acid may take place in rats, cats, and dogs, The conjugation is variable in degree and at best involves only a small per- centage of the dose. It fails to occur in rabbits. It also probably fails to occur with dienestrol in rats and with monomestrol in rabbits. Prob- ably no mercapturic acid derivatives of any of the three estrogens are formed in the species studied. Changes in inorganic sulfate excretion are due to variation in food intake. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the advice and encouragement of Dr. Ralph G. Smith of Tulane University."

In some cases, it has been shown to be adrenaline, whereas in others results indicate that it may be noradrenaline. Recently, Bülbring and Burn1 showed that even splanchnic nerve stimulation (after evisceration and ligation of the renal vessels in spinal cats) can result in the liberation of varying proportions of lævo-nor-adrenaline with the adrenaline."

He excluded the possibility of certain inorganic ions, protein and alkaloid components from being responsible for this phenomenon. The importance of this finding in problems associated with the 'pasture-grazing animal' interrelationships is apparent."

https://openalex.org/W2034393299,"ON March 24, a Royal Society Discussion was held on the subject of the physics and chemistry of hydrocarbon gels. Interest in these systems arose in the first instance from the desire to extend the range of frame throwers in which hitherto ordinary liquid hydrocarbons had been used. It was evident at a very early stage in the investigation that a possible improvement in range could be effected if the fuel could be made thixotropic in character, or at any rate if its intrinsic viscosity could be varied over wide ranges on changing the rate of shear. Further investigation revealed the fact that another physical property or combination of properties embraced under the term 'stringiness' or 'extensibility' had also to be taken into consideration."

https://openalex.org/W2050683435,"A RARE abnormality in the arterial system of the common frog was found in a male specimen from Cornwall. The fifth aortic arch persisted on both sides of the animal and was patent. Carotid, systemic and pulmo-cutaneous arches were normal ; but the fifth arch branched off from the pulmo-cutaneous. It joined the systemic arch laterally and was large and open. Right and left sides were symmetrical. A ligamentum aortico-carotideum was present. The relation of the posterior petro-hyoideus muscles was as follows. The internal carotid artery slipped beneath, that is, dorsal to, the first petro-hyoid muscle, the systemic arch dorsal to the second, and the abnormally persistent arch dorsal to the third, thus preserving the regularity of arrangement which is lost when the fifth arch disappears during development."

https://openalex.org/W4242220406,"WRITERS appear either to introduce or to illustrate the uncertainty principle by supposing that a fundamental particle such as an electron is viewed through a microscope to determine its position at the same time as measurement is being made of its momentum1. The error in the position of the particle is accepted to be δx in the formula for the resolution power of a microscope, namely, δx λ/sin θ. This formula is derived in optics from a study of the diffraction of light from two equal disks placed close together and from one disk alone."

It seemed likely that a measurement of a linear dimension together with a factor describing the shape of the particles would be the most useful parameters to correlate with filter performance, since whether a particle will pass through the filter apertures will depend upon both size and shape. It was accordingly decided to use Feret's statistical diameter1."
