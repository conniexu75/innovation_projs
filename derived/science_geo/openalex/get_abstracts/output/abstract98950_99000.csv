https://openalex.org/W2001266427,"Species of RNA that bind with high affinity and specificity to the bronchodilator theophylline were identified by selection from an oligonucleotide library. One RNA molecule binds to theophylline with a dissociation constant Kd of 0.1 microM. This binding affinity is 10,000-fold greater than the RNA molecule's affinity for caffeine, which differs from theophylline only by a methyl group at nitrogen atom N-7. Analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance indicates that this RNA molecule undergoes a significant change in its conformation or dynamics upon theophylline binding. Binding studies of compounds chemically related to theophylline have revealed structural features required for the observed binding specificity. These results demonstrate the ability of RNA molecules to exhibit an extremely high degree of ligand recognition and discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W1967448808,"A common RXL motif was found in proline-rich ligands that were selected from a biased combinatorial peptide library on the basis of their ability to bind specifically to the SH3 domains from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or c-Src. The solution structure of the PI3K SH3 domain complexed to one of these ligands, RKLPPRPSK (RLP1), was determined. Structure-based mutations were introduced into the PI3K SH3 domain and the RLP1 ligand, and the influence of these mutations on binding was evaluated. We conclude that SH3 domains recognize proline-rich motifs possessing the left-handed type II polyproline (PPII) helix conformation. Two proline residues directly contact the receptor. Other prolines in the ligands appear to function as a molecular scaffold, promoting the formation of the PPII helix. Three nonproline residues consisting of combinations of arginine and leucine interact extensively with the SH3 domain and appear to confer ligand specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1985929162,"Production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages is important for the killing of intracellular infectious agents. Interferon (IFN)-gamma and lipopolysaccharide stimulate NO production by transcriptionally up-regulating the inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Macrophages from mice with a targeted disruption of the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene (IRF-1-/- mice) produced little or no NO and synthesized barely detectable iNOS messenger RNA in response to stimulation. Two adjacent IRF-1 response elements were identified in the iNOS promoter. Infection with Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) was more severe in IRF-1-/- mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, IRF-1 is essential for iNOS activation in murine macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1607563537,"Two mercurial-inhibitable water-transporting proteins have been identified: CHIP28, an erythrocyte water channel also expressed in kidney tubules and selected extrarenal epithelia, and WCH-CD, a kidney collecting duct water channel. In searching for a protein responsible for the high transcellular water permeability in lung alveolus, we cloned a 32-kDa water channel (mercurial-insensitive water channel (MIWC)) from a rat lung cDNA library with several novel features. Water permeability was strongly increased in Xenopus oocytes expressing MIWC in a mercurial-insensitive manner, in contrast to known water channels. By in situ hybridization, MIWC showed an unique distribution in cells that do not express CHIP28, including kidney papillary vasa recta, cells lining the subarachnoid space and ventricles in brain, the inner nuclear layer in retina, and the conjunctival epithelium. An alternatively spliced form of MIWC with a 165-base pair deletion in the coding sequence was also identified; relative expression of the spliced mRNA was tissue-specific. The MIWC water channel may participate in the urinary concentrating mechanism, the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, and other physiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2168149109,"Ribonuclease E (RNAase E) was isolated in a complex that also contained polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). Besides copurification, evidence for an association of these enzymes comes from sedimentation and immunoprecipitation experiments. Highly purified RNAase E correctly processed E. coli 5S ribosomal RNA, bacteriophage T4 gene 32 mRNA and E. coli ompA mRNA at sites known to depend on the rne gene for cleavage in vivo. The difference between previous smaller estimates of the size of RNAase E and that reported here apparently is due to the sensitivity of the enzyme to proteolysis during purification. The discovery of a specific association between RNAase E and PNPase raises the intriguing possibility that these enzymes act cooperatively in the processing and degradation of RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2019155756,"Using the highly AT-specific fluorochrome daunomycin, a longitudinal optical signal called AT queue, thought to arise from a line-up of the highly AT-rich scaffold-associated regions (SARs) by the scaffolding, was identified in native chromosomes. Fluorescence banding is proposed to result from a differential folding path of the AT queue during its progression from telomere to telomere. The AT queue is tightly coiled or folded in a Q band, the resulting transverse striations across the chromatid, which also represent Giemsa subbands, generating a bright AT-rich signal over the Q region. The R bands, in contrast, contain a more central (unfolded) AT queue, yielding an AT-dull signal over the R regions. The AT queue is identified by immunofluorescence against topoisomerase II (topo II) and HMG-I/Y as the scaffold of native chromosomes; the fluorescence signal from both proteins is akin to a detailed Q-type banding pattern. Native chromosomes appear assembled according to the loop-scaffold model."
https://openalex.org/W1499540451,"The catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is inactivated by in vitro phosphorylation of Tyr307 by receptor and nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (Chen, J., Martin, B. L., and Brautigan, D. L. (1992) Science 257, 1261-1264). Here we show the phosphorylation of PP2A in cells under different growth conditions. In lysates of nontransformed murine 10T1/2 fibroblasts, there were two forms of PP2A at 36 kDa detected after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-PP2A peptide antibody. These two forms exactly comigrated with unphosphorylated purified PP2A and the PP2A 32P-labeled by in vitro phosphorylation with p60v-src kinase. The phosphorylated form of PP2A recovered from red blood cells or produced by in vitro phosphorylation was eliminated by incubation with tyrosine-specific phosphatase (PTP1B). Transformation of 10T1/2 cells by expression of p60v-src resulted in most of the PP2A in the cells being converted to a phosphorylated form that was reactive with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Serum starvation of cells reduced the amount of phosphorylated PP2A, whereas serum stimulation of quiescent cells caused an increase to the same relative amount of phosphorylated PP2A as in src-transformed cells. Addition of epidermal growth factor to quiescent NeoR cells (10T1/2 fibroblasts overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptors) temporarily increased the level of phosphorylation of PP2A, with a peak at 5-15 min and a return to basal level within 60 min. The results show that PP2A is phosphorylated in intact cells, and the extent of this modification is increased by growth factors or cell transformation, providing evidence for a physiological mechanism of PP2A regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1547127475,"We have recently reported that mammalian pancreatic group I phospholipase A2 (PLA2-I) has its specific receptor (PLA2 receptor) on a variety of mammalian cells and that various biological responses are elicited by PLA2-I via this receptor. In this study, we cloned cDNAs encoding a protein corresponding to the bovine PLA2 receptor purified from the corpora lutea on the basis of its partial amino acid sequences. The identity of a protein encoded by the cloned cDNA with the bovine PLA2 receptor was verified by a transient expression experiment using COS-7 cells. Interestingly, the deduced primary structure of the PLA2 receptor (1,463 amino acid residues) exhibits a close relatedness throughout the molecule to that of the macrophage mannose receptor, a unique member of Ca(2+)-dependent (C-type) animal lectin family, in spite of their functional diversity. Based on this sequence similarity between these two receptors, the domain organization of the PLA2 receptor could be tentatively assigned as follows; 10 extracellular domains including 8 tandem repeats homologous to C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) and a single transmembrane region followed by a short cytoplasmic tail. The results of transient expression experiments for mutant PLA2 receptors supported this assignment and furthermore suggested the region responsible for PLA2-I binding corresponds to CRDs in the mannose receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1587566573,"Production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages is enhanced upon activation by bacterial endotoxins and cytokines mainly via an increase of the intracellular content of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS). We have studied in detail the effect of several modulators of macrophage activity on steady state levels of i-NOS mRNA in the mouse macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were found to be effective inducers of i-NOS mRNA, in accordance with their known ability to stimulate both i-NOS activity and NO production in macrophages from different sources, while TNF-alpha, IL-1, or IL-6 was ineffective in this regard. Accumulation of i-NOS mRNA in response to either LPS or IFN-gamma stimulation was accompanied by increased i-NOS gene transcription, as detected both by using a nuclear run-on transcription assay and by transient transfection of the cloned gene promoter in RAW 264.7 cells. Co-stimulation of the cells with both inducers resulted in higher steady state levels of i-NOS mRNA in the absence, however, of a corresponding potentiation of the rate of gene transcription. This was due primarily to a considerable effect of LPS on i-NOS mRNA stability, with prolongation of its half-life from 1-1.5 h, in the presence of IFN-gamma alone, to 4-6 h in the presence of both LPS and IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1664836047,"The receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit is thought to mediate its diverse effects on different cell lineages by association and activation of distinct second messenger systems. One of the immediate events after binding of the kit ligand to the receptor is its association with the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and the activation of the enzyme. In the present study, we examined the association and activation of PI 3-kinase with mutant forms of the c-kit receptor transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. To define the binding site of p85 we substituted the putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the kinase insert region of the c-kit receptor by phenylalanine (YF702, YF719, YF728, and YF745, respectively). The results indicate that, upon stimulation of cells with kit ligand, 1) the wild-type c-kit protein was readily autophosphorylated and autophosphorylation was not diminished significantly with any of the mutant proteins; 2) p85 and PI 3-kinase activity associated with wild-type c-Kit protein as well as with the mutant proteins YF702, YF728, and YF745. Ligand-induced association of p85 and PI 3-kinase activity were abolished with the YF719 c-Kit protein, and this was not due to different levels of expression of p85 or c-kit; and 3) c-kit receptor-bound p85 was not phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. These results indicate that tyrosine 719 within the 719YMDM motif in the kinase insert plays an important role in binding of p85 and that its phosphorylation is a prerequisite for binding of p85 and the subsequent activation of PI 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1574834137,"LIMP II, a type II lysosomal integral membrane protein, and the CD36/LIMP II construct are targeted to lysosomes by means of a signal expressed in the tyrosine-lacking carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II (Vega, M. A., Rodriguez, F., Segui, B., Cales, C., Alcalde, J., and Sandoval, I. V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16269-16272; Vega, M. A., Segui-Real, B., Garcia, J. A., Cales, C., Rodriguez, F., Vandekerckhove, J., and Sandoval, I. V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16818-16824). Substitution of Leu475 with Ile resulted in a decreased efficiency of targeting. Mutant forms produced by substituting Leu475 by hydrophobic residues with either large (Val) or small (Ala, Gly) side chains, or by a charged residue (Asp), showed inhibited targeting. In contrast, the contiguous Ile476 residue could be replaced by either Leu, without loss in the efficiency of targeting, or by Val or Ala, with some impediment. Substitution of Ile476 by either Gly or Asp inhibited completely the targeting. The addition of the sequence Ser-Trp-Asp to the carboxyl end of the construct did not interfere with targeting. Data from 1H NMR analysis of the icosapeptide corresponding to the carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II indicated the predominance of structures with extended random coil conformations, suggesting that the targeting signal is contained in a domain with an extended configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1547481148,"Cystic fibrosis results from mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR Cl- channel. Although CFTR occurs as an integral component of the plasma membrane, recent studies implicate CFTR in endocytic recycling and suggest that the protein may also exist in intracellular vesicular compartments. To test this, we analyzed CFTR in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) purified from cells constitutively expressing CFTR at high levels. CFTR immunoreactivity was detected in CCV by immunoblot and was identified as CFTR based on labeling of immunoprecipitates with protein kinase A and by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Fusion of uncoated CCV with planar lipid bilayers resulted in the incorporation of kinase- and ATP-activated Cl- channel activity (7.8 pS at 20 degrees C; 11.9 pS at 37 degrees C), with a linear current-voltage relation under symmetrical conditions. Thus, functional CFTR occurs in CCV. Moreover, CFTR interacts with the plasma membrane specific adaptor complex during endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits. Therefore, the abundance of CFTR in the plasma membrane may be regulated by exocytic insertion and endocytic recycling, and these processes may provide an augmentation to protein kinase A activation as a mechanism for regulating CFTR Cl channels in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1562695264,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) is a normal plasma protein and an acute phase reactant important for host responses to Gram-negative bacteria and LPS. LBP forms high affinity complexes with LPS which bind to CD14, a monocyte surface protein, to initiate the release of inflammatory mediators. We found that human primary hepatocytes synthesize LBP and that the synthesis is up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-6. To examine this phenomenon in more detail, we evaluated the capacity of IL-6, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor to induce LBP synthesis in HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. IL-6 induced LBP synthesis. Dexamethasone, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor had a synergistic effect when combined with IL-6, but demonstrated minimal effect independently. LBP biosynthesis was evaluated by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled LBP from HepG2 supernatants, measurement of steady-state LBP mRNA levels, and analysis of LBP-dependent LPS binding to CD14 positive cells. An 35S-labeled, 60-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-LBP antibody from IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cell supernatants. Northern blot analysis of cellular RNA revealed an increase in LBP mRNA in IL-6-stimulated cells. CD14 expressing cells bound fluoresceinated LPS in the presence of supernatants from HepG2 cells treated with IL-6. These data provide the first information about specific cytokine and dexamethasone regulation of LBP expression in HepG2 cells. LBP behaves like a Type 1 acute phase protein."
https://openalex.org/W1484184157,"Biotinidase (EC 3.5.1.12) catalyzes the hydrolysis of biocytin, the product of biotin-dependent carboxylase degradation, to biotin and lysine. Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder of biotin recycling that is characterized by neurological and cutaneous abnormalities, and can be successfully treated with biotin supplementation. Sequences of tryptic peptides of the purified human serum enzyme were used to design oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification from human hepatic total RNA to generate putative biotinidase cDNA fragments. Sequence analysis of a cDNA isolated from a human liver library by plaque hybridization with the largest cDNA probe revealed an open reading frame of 1629 bases encoding a protein of 543 amino acid residues, including 41 amino acids of a potential signal peptide. Comparison of the open reading frame with the known biotinidase tryptic peptides and recognition of the expressed protein encoded by this cDNA by monoclonal antibodies prepared against purified biotinidase demonstrated the identity of this cDNA. Southern analyses suggested that biotinidase is a single copy gene and revealed that human cDNA probes hybridized to genomic DNA from mammals, but not from chicken or yeast. Northern analysis indicated the presence of biotinidase mRNA in human heart, brain, placenta, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W1494688418,"Picolinic acid, a catabolite of L-tryptophan, is a potent co-stimulatory agent for the induction of tumoricidal activity and the production of L-arginine-dependent reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) in murine macrophages. We studied whether picolinic acid could affect nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) expression at the gene level in the macrophage cell line ANA-1. NOS mRNA was neither constitutively expressed nor induced by treatment with picolinic acid alone. However, low levels of NOS mRNA were induced by interferon (IFN)-gamma alone. In contrast, a major increase of NOS mRNA expression was observed after treatment with IFN-gamma plus picolinic acid. The synergism was already detectable after 5-6 h and increased up to 20 h of treatment. The ability of picolinic acid to augment IFN-gamma-dependent NOS mRNA expression was associated with a parallel increase in transcription, as demonstrated by nuclear run-on experiments. Protein synthesis was required for the induction of NOS mRNA because addition of cycloheximide dramatically reduced IFN-gamma plus picolonic acid-induced NOS mRNA expression. Finally, interleukin-4 significantly decreased IFN-gamma plus picolinic acid-induced NOS mRNA expression and NOS transcription. These data provide evidence of a molecular event connecting arginine and tryptophan metabolic pathways in the generation of RNI, and they indicate that picolinic acid can induce transcriptional activation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2085327423,"The invariant chain (Ii) binds nascent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, blocking peptide binding until the complex dissociates in the endosomes. This may serve to differentiate the MHC class I and II antigen presentation pathways and enable class II molecules to efficiently bind peptides in the endosomes. This hypothesis was addressed by probing spleen cells from a combination of knock-out and transgenic mice with a large panel of T cell hybridomas. The Ii molecule blocked the presentation of a range of endogenously synthesized epitopes, but some epitopes actually required Ii. Thus, the influence of Ii on presentation does not follow simple rules. In addition, mice expressing Ii were not tolerant to epitopes unmasked in its absence, a finding with possible implications for autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1564283461,"Growth hormone (GH) plays a central role in regulating growth and intermediary metabolism in vertebrates, although the mechanisms by which GH initiates these actions are largely unknown. The GH receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, does not demonstrate homology with any known tyrosine kinases. However, addition of GH to cells in vitro has been shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of various intracellular proteins including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) and the newly described Janus kinase, JAK2. Subsequent steps in GH-mediated signal transduction have not been delineated. In the present study, we have examined early events in GH action in vivo. Hypophysectomized juvenile male rats were treated with GH for 15, 30, or 60 min. Rat liver whole cell and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting techniques. GH rapidly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of at least 8 nuclear proteins of 205, 91, 83, 80, 65, 53, 44, and 42 kDa, and caused the dephosphorylation of a single approximately 149-kDa protein. Using specific antibodies, we have identified three of these nuclear phosphoproteins as 42- and 44-kDa MAP kinases, and as STAT91, a 91-kDa component of the interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 protein complex. One consequence of the activation of STAT91 in the nucleus is the appearance of GH-stimulated DNA binding activity, as assessed by gel-mobility shift assay using an oligonucleotide containing a c-sis-inducible element from the c-fos promoter. These results show that nuclear protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a prominent early event in GH action in vivo and demonstrate a link between GH-stimulated signal transduction and target gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1482206857,"Abstract Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IG-FBP-3) is an important member of a family of proteins which binds IGF peptides and modulates their biological actions. In this study, we describe an acid-activated IGFBP-3 protease in media derived from a variety of human cell lines. Radiolabeled IGFBP-3 remained intact during incubation (pH 5.5-8) in media conditioned by normal and transformed human fibroblasts, MG-63 osteoblastic cells, and breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and Hs578T. However, acidification of the conditioned medium samples (pH < 5.5) resulted in 125I-IGFBP-3 hydrolysis and the appearance of specific radiolabeled fragments. No proteolysis of 125I-IGFBP-3 occurred during incubation in unconditioned medium at neutral or acid pH. Estrogen treatment of estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells enhanced acid-activatable IGFBP-3 proteolysis in the cell-conditioned medium but had no effect on proteolytic activity in estrogen receptor-negative Hs578T cells. The cell-derived IGFBP-3 protease was identified as the aspartic proteinase cathepsin D, based on acidic pH optimum, inhibition by pepstatin, distinctive proteolytic fragment pattern, and immunoreactivity with cathepsin D antisera. Furthermore, immuno-depletion of cathepsin D effectively attenuated acid-activated IGFBP-3 proteolysis. These data suggest a role for cathepsin D in the regulation of cellular IGF action by virtue of its potential to alter the structure/function of IGFBP-3."
https://openalex.org/W1570249216,"Phospholipase C-beta 1 (PLC-beta 1) exists as two immunologically indistinguishable polypeptides of 150 and 140 kDa and is encoded in rat brain by two distinct transcripts of 5.4 and 7.2 kilobases (kb). cDNA corresponding to the entire 5.4-kb transcript as reported previously reveals an open reading frame that is capable of coding a 1216-amino acid polypeptide (Suh, P. G., Ryu, S. H., Moon, K. H., Suh, H. W., and Rhee, S. G. (1988) Cell 54, 161-169). We have now isolated cDNAs corresponding to the entire 7.2-kb transcript from a rat brain cDNA library. The 7.2-kb transcript differs from the previously reported 5.4-kb transcript by possessing both an additional 118 nucleotides located near the end of the coding sequence and a 1738-nucleotide extension of the 3'-flanking region. The presence of the 118-nucleotide insert in the cumulative 7.2-kb sequence gives rise to an open reading frame that is capable of coding a 1173-amino acid polypeptide (PLC-beta 1b), the carboxyl-terminal sequence of which differs from that of the 1216-amino acid polypeptide (PLC-beta 1a) derived from the 5.4-kb transcript. Antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal portions of PLC-beta 1a and PLC-beta 1b. Immunoblot analysis with these isozyme-specific antibodies revealed that both PLC-beta 1a and PLC-beta 1b are expressed in rat brain and C6Bu-1 glioma cells and that PLC-beta 1a and PLC-beta 1b correspond to the previously identified 150- and 140-kDa PLC-beta 1 enzymes, respectively. Analysis of PLC-beta 1 genomic DNA indicates that PLC-beta 1a and PLC-beta 1b are derived from a single gene by alternative RNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W76344694,"We have recently shown that a series of N-acyl-L-tryptophan benzyl esters are potent substance P antagonists (Macleod, A. M., Merchant, K. J., Cascieri, M. A., Sadowski, S., Ber, E., Swain, C. J., and Baker, R. (1993) J. Med Chem. 14, 2044-2045). We now report the detailed characterization of the interaction of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan-3,5-bistrifluoromethyl benzyl ester (L-732,138) with the human neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor. L-732,138 inhibits the binding of 125I-substance P to the cloned human NK1 receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with an IC50 of 2.3 +/- 0.7 nM. In contrast, it has 200-fold lower affinity for the cloned rat NK-1 receptor and has > 1000-fold lower affinity for the human NK-2 and NK-3 receptors. L-732,138 acts as a competitive antagonist of substance P, as shown by functional Schild analysis of the inhibition of substance P-induced inositol phosphate synthesis, by kinetic analysis of the dissociation rate, and by thermodynamic analysis of the equilibrium binding of 125I-substance P to the NK-1 receptor. L-732,138 also competitively inhibits the binding of the quinuclidine amine antagonist, [125I]L-703,606, to the receptor. The compound has 230- and 10-fold reduced affinity for mutant NK-1 receptors in which histidine 265 or histidine 197, respectively, are replaced with alanine. We have previously shown that these residues play key roles in the binding of quinuclidine antagonists to the NK-1 receptor. These results suggest that the tryptophan and quinuclidine series of NK-1 antagonists bind to similar binding sites on the human NK-1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1543335178,"We have used an in vitro Escherichia coli tRNA processing system to investigate the specific role of individual exoribonucleases in the 3' maturation of tRNA precursors. The processing of pre-tRNA(Tyr)su3+ and pre-tRNA(2Arg) was studied using extracts from cells lacking one or multiple exoribonucleases or using purified RNases. Earlier genetic studies had suggested that multiple exoribonucleases contributed to the maturation of tRNA precursors, and this was proven directly in the studies described here. Complete 3' processing required the combined action of multiple exoribonucleases, and each RNase showed distinct specificities for maturation of the different parts of the 3' precursor segment. RNase II and polynucleotide phosphorylase were most effective in shortening long 3' trailer sequences to intermediates with 2-4 extra 3' residues. Final trimming of the last few 3' nucleotides of these precursors was carried out most efficiently by RNases T and PH, but the two enzymes differed in their specificity for individual nucleotide positions. Depending on the tRNA precursor, the relative importance of the various RNases to the overall maturation process differed. We also showed that purified exoribonucleases can completely complement mutant extracts and that tRNA maturation can be totally reconstructed in vitro using purified enzymes. These studies provide the first detailed information about the specific role of individual exoribonucleases in tRNA processing, and bring us closer to defining a complete E. coli tRNA maturation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1593187788,"Human keratin 1 (HK1) expression is associated with the loss of mitotic activity in epidermal keratinocytes and restricted to an intermediate stage of terminal differentiation. Recently, the control elements that mediate this differentiation-specific expression were identified (Huff, C. A., Yuspa, S. H., and Rosenthal, D. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 377-384). We now report the characterization of one of these elements. Footprint analysis on a 249-base pair fragment containing the calcium responsive element (CaRE) revealed two adjacent protected regions. The 5' most footprint contains an AP-1 consensus sequence while the 3' footprint encodes two inverted repeats of the canonical hormone response recognition sequence. Deletion of the AP-1-protected region abolished the calcium response in a reporter construct. Calcium activation of the reporter construct containing the intact CaRE was unaffected by the addition of thyroid hormone or estrogen. However, vitamin D3 was able to suppress calcium induction by the CaRE, and this suppression could be abrogated by the coaddition of retinoic acid. These studies show that AP-1 factors bind to the 5' element to mediate the calcium response while members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily interact with the 3' element to modulate the calcium response."
https://openalex.org/W1487501165,"The blood group Rh antigens are associated with non-glycosylated 30-kDa erythrocyte membrane proteins (the Rh30 polypeptides) and the Rh glycoprotein. We used antipeptide antibodies to study the Rh glycoprotein in human erythrocyte membranes. The Rh glycoprotein was present in Rhnull U+ve cells. However, the N-glycan chain of the Rh glycoprotein in Rhnull U+ve cells was smaller than in normal cells. In contrast, the N-glycan chain of the Rh glycoprotein was larger than normal in glycophorin B-deficient red cells. We suggest that this observation reflects a lower rate of movement of newly synthesized Rh glycoprotein through intracellular membranes to the cell surface in the absence of glycophorin B, and that in normal red cells glycophorin B facilitates the movement of the Rh protein complex to the cell surface. Our results provide evidence for the intracellular interaction of at least three proteins, the Rh glycoprotein, Rh30 polypeptides, and glycophorin B during the biosynthesis and cell surface expression of the Rh complex. These observations are likely to be important for the successful design of expression systems for the blood group Rh antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1892019602,"We identified four different guide RNAs (gRNAs) that specify identical editing of Trypanosoma brucei apocytochrome b (CYb) mRNA, which indicates gRNA redundancy in T. brucei. All four gRNAs appear functional since they occur in chimeras, some of which contain an interesting gRNA 3' extension. The gRNAs are encoded in different minicircles, rather than maxicircles as in other species. However, these gRNA genes are not between 18-base pair repeats as are the other minicircle gRNA genes in T. brucei. The three minicircles cloned contain the same gRNA genes, one of which is substantially diverged, all in the same order, indicating that they are related. CYb gRNA is less abundant in procyclic than bloodstream forms. Procyclic forms contain abundant edited CYb mRNA unlike bloodstream forms thus suggesting that CYb mRNA editing may be regulated at the level of gRNA utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1608267442,"The engagement of the B cell antigen receptor is the first step of antigenic stimulation of B lymphocytes. This step is followed by a series of biochemical events, including the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositide turnover, and multiple patterns of calcium mobilization, which lead to the regulation of gene transcription and cellular responses. The B cell antigen receptor complex is composed of membrane immunoglobulins (as antigen recognition subunits) and associated chains (Ig-alpha and Ig-beta) that couple the receptor to cytoplasmic protein kinases. To investigate independently the relative signaling capacity of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta, chimeric proteins containing their cytoplasmic domains were expressed in a B cell line. We found that Ig-alpha and Ig-beta activate two distinct intracellular signaling pathways. The engagement of Ig-alpha chimeras induces a complete release of calcium from intracellular stores, followed by transmembrane calcium influx and late cell activation signals, detected by lymphokine secretion. In contrast, Ig-beta chimeras do not induce lymphokine secretion or calcium influx, but induce short oscillatory release of calcium, dependent on the activity of the Ca-ATPase pump of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results provide a structural basis for the diversity of B cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W1528893072,"The P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a plasma membrane protein overexpressed in multidrug-resistant tumor cells, is thought to be both an ATPase that actively exports cytotoxic drugs and a Cl- channel activated by cell swelling. The partial reversal of multidrug resistance by Cl- transport blockers suggests a possible role for Cl- in Pgp-mediated drug transport. We used multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster fibroblasts and human breast cancer cells expressing Pgp to study the roles of Cl- (and also Na+ and HCO3-/CO2) on Pgp-mediated efflux of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 (R123). In Pgp-expressing Chinese hamster fibroblasts, exposed to isosmotic solutions, the unidirectional efflux of R123 was not measurably changed by a approximately 60-min removal of Cl- (or by exposure to Na(+)-free, or nominally HCO3-/CO2-free medium); short term (2-3 min) ion substitutions were also ineffective. In human breast cancer cells transfected with human mdr1 cDNA, hyposmotic solutions activated a Cl- current but had no effect on the Pgp-mediated unidirectional efflux of R123. Additionally, in human breast cancer cells, the intracellular presence of R123 did not prevent activation of the Cl- current by hyposmotic solution. The lack of detectable effect of removal of Cl-, Na+, or HCO3- on Pgp-mediated R123 transport rules out direct coupling between substrate transport and transport of either of these ions by Pgp. The persistence of Pgp-mediated R123 efflux in osmotically swollen cells indicates that activation of the Pgp-associated Cl- current does not hinder the Pgp pump function. The lack of effect of R123 on swelling-activated Cl- current denotes that Pgp-mediated transport of organic substrates and Pgp-associated Cl- currents can occur at the same time in a single cell. These results underscore the dissociation between Pgp-mediated active drug transport and electrodiffusive Cl- transport."
https://openalex.org/W2139546902,"The Bacillus subtilis cysE and cysS genes encoding, respectively, the serine acetyltransferase and the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase were found downstream from the gltX gene encoding the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. This gene organization is also conserved in Bacillus stearothermophilus where the cysE and cysS genes show high amino acid identity with those of B. subtilis. In both organisms the coding sequences of cysE and cysS overlap, suggesting a translational coupling. B. subtilis cysE and cysS were expressed in Escherichia coli using the inducible trc promoter; they functionally complement mutants of E. coli affected in those genes. Overproduction of B. subtilis CysRS in E. coli has a toxic effect on cell growth. Disruption of gltX and cysS by Campbell-type insertion is lethal for the cell, indicating that these genes code for an essential and unique function in B. subtilis. S1 mapping analysis shows that the transcription of gltX is under the control of a sigma A promoter located 43 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon. A T-box sequence and a rho-independent terminator known to regulate expression of other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes and of some amino acid biosynthetic operons in Bacillus sp., were found between gltX and cysE. No sigma A promoter was detected upstream of cysE, which is consistent with the lethality of a Campbell-type insertion using a plasmid that interrupts transcription coming from the gltX promoter, and suggests that gltX, cysE, and cysS constitute an operon. This is the first case where genes implicated in the biosynthesis of an amino acid and its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase are shown to be co-transcribed."
https://openalex.org/W1522379684,"A novel globo-series disialoganglioside, disialosyl galactosyl globoside (Structure 1 below), defined by new monoclonal antibody (mAb) RM2, was isolated and characterized as having terminal structure identical to that of ganglio-series ganglioside GD1 alpha (Structure 2) and a common mucin-type epitope (Structure 3) widely distributed in glycoproteins such as glycophorin A. While these three structures share a common nonreducing tetrasaccharide terminus, mAb RM2 showed strong specific reactivity only with Structure 1, not with Structures 2 or 3. Another mAb, QSH2, reacted strongly with Structure 3 but did not cross-react with Structures 1 or 2. Conformational molecular models based on minimum energy hard sphere exoanomeric calculations suggest that Structure 1 presents a unique surface topology distinct from that of Structures 2 or 3. Our findings suggest the novel concept that reactivity of a common carbohydrate epitope with different antibodies or ligands is highly dependent on the type of carrier glycosylceramide or carrier O-linked peptide.

https://openalex.org/W1557652812,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), a 58-60 kDa glycoprotein, binds to the lipid A region of LPS. The resulting LPS-LBP complex is recognized by both the membrane-bound (mCD14) and soluble forms of CD14 (sCD14), thereby enhancing the ability of LPS to activate myeloid, endothelial, and epithelial cells. To begin to characterize the structure-function relationships within LBP, we have created and expressed a truncated form of human LBP (herein called NH-LBP) comprising amino acid residues 1-197 of the parent molecule. Experiments were done to characterize the ability of NH-LBP to bind LPS and to promote LPS binding to CD14. We found that NH-LBP efficiently binds LPS but does not transfer the LPS to either mCD14 or sCD14. Additionally, NH-LBP inhibited LPS binding to LBP, inhibited the LBP-promoted binding of LPS to CD14, and inhibited the LBP-dependent activation of rabbit peritoneal exudate macrophages. The apparent dissociation constant for LPS-NH-LBP complexes is less than 1 x 10(-8) M which compares well with the dissociation constant for LPS-LBP complexes of approximately 1 x 10(-9) M. We conclude from these studies that the LPS binding site of LBP resides in the amino-terminal half of LBP and that the CD14 interaction site resides in the carboxyl-terminal half of LBP. These data suggest that appropriately modified fragments of LBP might provide novel reagents with high LPS binding affinity that could be useful in inhibiting LPS-dependent cellular activation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1598760385,"The intracellular Ca2+ indicator Indo-1 was used to monitor changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) in single HeLa cells upon readmission of external Ca2+ after a short incubation in Ca(2+)-free solution. HeLa cells were responsive to histamine but not to caffeine, and their histamine-sensitive store was totally depleted by a 60-min exposure to 2 microM thapsigargin. The resting [Ca2+]i in thapsigargin-treated cells was higher than in control cells and low amplitude [Ca2+]i oscillations were observed in about 20% of the cells. Readmission of external Ca2+ after a brief withdrawal of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a transient [Ca2+]i rise, which then decayed to the same elevated [Ca2+]i measured before the Ca2+ withdrawal period. The [Ca2+]i rise was associated with an increased rate of Mn2+ entry, measured as the rate of quenching of intracellular Fura-2. The same procedure did not affect the [Ca2+]i in control cells not pretreated with thapsigargin. The amplitude of this [Ca2+]i transient in thapsigargin pretreated cells depended on the duration of prior incubation in Ca(2+)-free medium. The [Ca2+]i rise induced by elevating the extracellular [Ca2+] from 1.5 to 10 mM was more pronounced if the [Ca2+]i during the initial incubation in 1.5 mM Ca2+ was first lowered by depolarizing the cells. We conclude that an empty store stimulates a Ca2+ entry pathway consisting of two components: a continuously elevated basal leak and a second component that is transient due to the high [Ca2+]i-induced inhibition of the Ca2+ entry pathway. This inhibition and the subsequent recovery from it as the [Ca2+]i is brought to resting levels could cause the oscillatory Ca2+ entry that we recorded in a fraction of the thapsigargin-treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588194817,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 75-kDa IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) beta chain and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-K). Herein, we demonstrate that the 85-kDa (p85) regulatory subunit of PI3-K physically associates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated IL-2R beta chain. A fusion protein containing both the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal src homology 2 domains of p85 precipitates an 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (pp80) from the lysates of IL-2-stimulated, but not unstimulated, human T lymphoblasts. Preclearing studies and immunoblotting with an antiserum to the IL-2R beta chain demonstrates that pp80 represents a portion of the IL-2R beta chain pool. A tyrosine-phosphorylated oligopeptide corresponding to tyrosine 392 of the IL-2R beta chain partially inhibits binding of the IL-2R beta chain by p85 fusion protein, raising the possibility that this residue plays a role in the interaction of PI3-K with the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1561219262,"We show here that treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) stimulates the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and S6 protein kinase (S6K) activities both in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A single peak of MAPKK activity, four peaks of activity against the S6 synthetic peptide, RRLSSLRA (S6 peptide), and three distinct peaks toward myelin basic protein (MBP) were observed after Mono-Q chromatography of LIF-stimulated cell extracts. Two of the MBP kinase activities correlated with the stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Interestingly, down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by chronic treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with phorbol ester was found to attenuate, but not block, the LIF-mediated stimulation of MAPKK, MAPK, and S6K activities in 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with epidermal growth factor increased MAPKK, MAPK, and S6K activities to a similar extent as LIF, but this activation was not attenuated by down-regulation of PKC. Our results suggest that the full activation of the MAPK cascade by LIF may require inputs from multiple signaling pathways, one of which is dependent upon the presence of functional PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1520253334,"We present the concept of chemo-enzymic backbone engineering of proteins. Recombinant DNA techniques are used to produce appropriate proteins that are enzymically fragmented to give the starting materials. These fragments are modified specifically at their chain termini either enzymically (coupling of a hydrazide to the C terminus) or chemically (periodate oxidation of N-terminal serine to a glyoxylyl function). The modified fragments, which need no side protection whatever, are mixed together and religate themselves spontaneously under mild conditions. The hydrazone bond thus formed can be reduced if desired, which stabilizes the linkage and enhances the flexibility of the local conformation. In this way biologically or chemically derived structures can be incorporated into the protein, and the choice of the chemical ones is free of all of the constraints of the genetic code. We believe that this combined approach gives access to constructions that could not be derived by either recombinant or chemical methods alone. We illustrate the particularity of this concept by the engineered modifications of the 64-74 disulfide loop region of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Analogs constructed include one which, in spite of having a nonpeptide link in its backbone, has full biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1497613660,"The biosynthesis of the membrane-bound metalloendopeptidase meprin was studied after the introduction of cDNAs encoding the rat meprin alpha and beta subunits into human 293 cells. When expressed individually the meprin alpha subunit was found to be primarily secreted into the culture medium, while the beta subunit was determined to be an integral membrane protein. Coexpression of the alpha and beta subunits results in the localization of both subunits to the plasma membrane. In this case the alpha subunit is specifically released from the cell surface by dithiothreitol, indicating the alpha subunit is associated with the membrane via disulfide bond(s) to the beta subunit. Meprin expressed in 293 cells is similar to the rat kidney enzyme in that it forms disulfide-linked dimers and has a similar pattern of glycosylation. However, the expressed protein displayed no detectable peptidase activity against four meprin substrates. Processing of the alpha subunit was followed after the introduction of sequences coding for the human c-myc peptide epitope EQKLISEEDL into its cDNA in the region of its prosequence and at the COOH terminus. Detection of the resulting proteins using a monoclonal antibody specific for the c-myc epitope indicates the alpha subunit is processed at its COOH terminus but retains the prosequence which is absent from the enzyme purified from rat kidney. Limited trypsin digestion of meprin precursors expressed in 293 cells results in both the activation of the enzyme and the removal of the prosequence. This result supports the hypothesis of Bode et al. (Bode W., Gomis-Ruth, F. X., Huber, R., Zwilling, R., and Stocker, W. (1992) Nature 358, 164-167) that meprin and other astacin family proteases require removal of NH2-terminal prosequences at the junction of the astacin protease domain for zymogen activation. Trypsin-activated meprin was assayed with the protein substrate azocasein and three synthetic peptide substrates. The membrane-bound beta subunit was found to be more active than the secreted alpha subunit against azocasein but much less active toward the synthetic peptide substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1597926044,"We have expressed dual subunit combinations of isoforms of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NR1A-NR2A and NR1C-NR2A, in Xenopus oocytes. We show that both forms of the receptor are stereospecifically activated by low concentrations (10 nM) of the phorbol ester 4-beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, known to activate protein kinase C (PKC). The activation is transient, and, after reaching a maximum in about 10 min, it decreases rapidly in spite of the continuous presence of phorbol ester. The addition of 2 microM oleoylacetylglycerol had similar consequences. NR1C differs from NR1A by a deletion of 37 amino acids that include four consensus phosphorylation sites for PKC in the C-terminal region. The corresponding peptide has been shown to become phosphorylated upon activation of PKC in neurons (Tingley, W. G., Roche, K. W., Thompson, A. K., and Huganir, R. L. (1993) Nature 364, 70-73). However, the activity of NR1C-NR2A receptors was stimulated 7-fold, twice the potentiation observed for NR1A-NR2A. By site-specific mutagenesis of NR1C and NR2A, we removed additional consensus PKC phosphorylation sites located between TM3 and TM4. Coexpression of these mutant subunits showed a similar response to phorbol esters as wild type receptors. Our results indicate that neither the predicted consensus phosphorylation sites between transmembrane sequences TM3 and TM4 nor the phosphorylatable C-terminal splice domain is essential for the modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1501269964,"To study the effect of mononuclear cell differentiation on metalloproteinase production, the human monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1 were exposed to two well known differentiating agents, the phorbol esters (phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). With U937 cells, PMA-induced differentiation increased the production of both interstitial collagenase and 92-kDa gelatinase, whereas exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3 induced full interstitial collagenase expression in the absence of any detectable 92-kDa gelatinase production. In fact, when U937 cells were differentiated with PMA and then exposed to vitamin D3, the hormone actually suppressed phorbol-induced 92-kDa gelatinase biosynthesis. With THP-1 cells, PMA also induced the production of 92-kDa gelatinase fully, but unlike U937 cells, the combination of PMA and 1,25-(OH)2D3 was required for substantial interstitial collagenase biosynthesis. As with U937 cells, the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells caused a dose-dependent inhibition of 92-kDa gelatinase production. Northern hybridizations demonstrated that both phorbol esters and vitamin D3 act on monocytic cell lines at a pretranslational level. To determine whether metalloproteinase biosynthesis in normal differentiated mononuclear phagocytes was also modified by 1,25-(OH)2D3, human blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages were exposed to this hormone. In both cell types, basal and Staphylococcal-stimulated 92-kDa gelatinase production was markedly inhibited by 1,25-(OH)2D3. In contrast, interstitial collagenase production was completely unaffected by the hormone. In summary, the two major metalloproteinases produced by monocytic cells are regulated via distinct molecular pathways by the action of PMA and 1,25-(OH)2D3. Furthermore, vitamin D3 completely dissociates the production of 92-kDa gelatinase and interstitial collagenase in human mononuclear phagocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1486291800,"During an examination of different cell types for CD36 mRNA splice variants, a partial cDNA from HEL cells was isolated and characterized. This CD36 cDNA had a 309-base pair deletion following the region encoding the first putative transmembrane domain of CD36. The open reading frame of the deleted CD36 cDNA was retained and was predicted to yield a protein lacking 103 amino acid residues. The presence of this variant was confirmed in RNA pools from placental tissue by a reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction assay. Comparison of the HEL CD36 cDNA with the genomic sequence revealed that the mRNA represented by this variant CD36 cDNA was produced by a pre-mRNA splicing reaction that excluded exons 4 and 5. Transient expression of the variant CD36 cDNA in COS-1 cells showed that CD36 immunoreactive protein was expressed on the cell surface but lacked an antigenic epitope defined by amino acid residues 41-143. This cell surface glycoprotein (M(r) approximately 57,000) was of identical molecular weight as a CD36 isoform observed on the surface of HEL cells. The exclusion of exons during CD36 pre-mRNA processing appears to be conserved within one other CD36 gene family member, CLA-1."
https://openalex.org/W1537222185,"We have found a monoclonal antibody, called BV7, that rapidly stimulated by 6-10-folds HT-29 colon carcinoma cell adhesion to resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This effect was directed to tumor cells and not to endothelial cells and was cell-specific. BV7 was also active on the HCCP-2998 but did not change adhesion to endothelial cells of other tumor cells (MG63 osteosarcoma, A375 melanoma, MHCC-1410 and Lovo colon carcinoma) even if, by flow cytometry, this monoclonal antibody could bind to them. Additionally, BV7 effect was substratum-specific, since it did not increase but rather blocked HT-29 adhesion to matrix proteins. Immunoprecipitation analysis and binding to specific transfectants revealed that BV7 recognizes beta 1-subunit of integrin receptors and antibody blocking experiments showed that alpha 2 beta 1 antibodies were able to counteract BV7 effect on HT-29 adhesion to endothelial cells. In contrast, antibodies directed to other integrins or endothelial adhesive receptors (E- and P-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, ICAM-2) were ineffective. Induction of HT-29 adhesion to endothelial cells by BV7 was Fc- and protein synthesis-independent but required metabolically active cells. The presence of physiological concentrations of divalent cations and of cytoskeletal integrity was not needed. Comparative studies with eight different prototypic beta 1 antibodies showed that five of them induced HT-29 adhesion to endothelial cells in a way unrelated to their ability to interfere with HT-29 adhesion to matrix proteins. Cross-blocking binding assays demonstrated that all the five antibodies recognized a topographically related epitope. Taken together these results provide evidence that beta 1 antibodies may trigger a novel pathway of HT-29 colon carcinoma adhesion to endothelial cells with different features in respect to other described mechanisms of tumor cell interaction with the endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W2129387993,"Retinoylation (retinoic acid acylation) is a posttranslational modification of proteins occurring in many eukaryotic cell lines. The widespread occurrence of retinoylation suggests that it may play a role in many effects of retinoic acid (RA) on cells. The regulatory subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase are retinoylated in the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL60 (Takahashi, N., Liapi, C., Anderson, W. B., and Breitman, T. R. (1991) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 290, 293-302), and cytokeratins are retinoylated in normal human keratinocytes (Takahashi, N., Jetten, A. M., and Breitman, T. R. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 180, 393-400). We show, in this study, that the intermediate filament protein vimentin is retinoylated in HL60 cells during a 24-h exposure to 100 nM [3H]RA. We found that a retinoylated protein of M(r) 55,000 coeluted on anion exchange chromatography and comigrated on either one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a protein that also was stained on immunoblots by an anti-vimentin antibody. About 50% of the [3H]RA was released from this M(r) 55,000 retinoylated protein after hydrolysis with either NH2OH (1 M, pH 10) or CH3OH, 0.1 M KOH. These results indicated that a large fraction of the RA was bound to vimentin by an ester bond. Both the M(r) 55,000 retinoylated protein and immunoreactive vimentin were associated with cell nuclei isolated by two procedures. They were detached during exposure to a nonionic detergent buffer, suggesting that they are bound to the nuclear envelope. These results indicate that retinoylation is a new modification of vimentin that may be an early event in RA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1509049425,"Genomic and cDNA clones for rabbit interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were isolate based on homology with the human, mouse, and rat IL-1ra gene. A partial genomic clone, obtained by screening a rabbit genomic library, contained coding sequences for the carboxyl-terminal 108 amino acids of rabbit IL-1ra. Two classes of cDNA for rabbit IL-1ra were obtained using RNA from inflamed rabbit colon tissue. One class of cDNA coded for a secreted form of IL-1ra, whereas the other coded for a putative intracellular form of rabbit IL-1ra. The latter form is similar to that isolated from human epithelial cells. A partially synthetic rabbit IL-1ra gene was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant rabbit IL-1ra was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography. Its affinity was similar to that of human IL-1ra for the human and mouse type I IL-1 receptor. From the cDNA clone and the purified recombinant protein, specific probes were developed for measuring levels of rabbit IL-1ra mRNA and protein in normal and inflamed rabbit tissues. Unlike IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, IL-1RA mRNA and protein were present at detectable levels in normal rabbit colon. During the development of an experimental formalin-immune complex colitis, rabbit IL-1 alpha showed a dramatic increase in tissue levels, consistent with previous results; IL-1ra also increased 3-4-fold. Treatment of colitis rabbits with corticosteroids significantly suppressed neutrophil infiltration, corticosteroid treatment suppressed IL-1ra but not IL-1 alpha mRNA steady-state levels. Our observations demonstrate that IL-1 and IL-1ra synthesis is differentially regulated in healthy and inflamed intestinal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1513410491,"Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a reportedly specific lipoxygenase inhibitor, was found to selectively inhibit platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells. Maximal inhibition of PDGF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation (96%) was observed using 4 microM NDGA (IC50 = 1.5 microM). No effect of NDGA was observed upon DNA synthesis stimulated with either fetal bovine serum, bombesin, or epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the presence of insulin, or with the potent mitogen Pasteurella multocida toxin. The selective inhibition of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis by NDGA was also observed in diploid murine cells, rat, and human fibroblasts. Furthermore, 4 microM NDGA also inhibited PDGF-stimulated anchorage-independent colony growth of rat-1 cells by 76%. Using Swiss 3T3 cells, we found that PDGF-stimulated arachidonic acid mobilization and prostaglandin E2 production was abolished by NDGA in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of PDGF-stimulated arachidonic acid mobilization by NDGA could not, however, explain its potent inhibitory effect upon PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. Our results showed that NDGA also selectively inhibited PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in intact cells. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by EGF or bombesin was not altered by NDGA treatment. Crucially, NDGA inhibited in vitro the tyrosine kinase activity of anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PDGF receptor immunoprecipitates prepared from cultures stimulated with PDGF. This inhibition of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in a cell-free system confirmed that NDGA acts directly at the level of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase domain. These results suggest that the potent and selective inhibitory effect of NDGA on PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis results from its inhibitory action on tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1492495888,"The murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) L6 recognizes an integral membrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed on lung, breast, colon, and ovarian carcinomas and is referred to as the L6 antigen. This antigen is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention due to its high level expression on malignant cells. We have previously reported the isolation of a cDNA encoding the human L6 antigen (H-L6). Here, we report the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding the murine L6 antigen (M-L6). This cDNA contains one long open reading frame, which encodes a 220-amino acid polypeptide that is 78% homologous to H-L6. This protein contains short NH2- and COOH-terminal hydrophilic domains and four hydrophobic regions, each long enough to span the plasma membrane. Each of these hydrophobic domains is separated by a hydrophilic domain, the longest of which contains one possible N-linked glycosylation site and is located between the third and fourth hydrophobic domains. We have previously demonstrated that the murine L6 mAb recognizes a protein epitope expressed on human tumor-derived cell lines. Now, using chimeric cDNA constructs encoding human-murine L6 antigen hybrids in conjunction with monoclonal antibody binding experiments, we show that the 42-residue hydrophilic domain of the L6 antigen, located between the third and fourth hydrophobic domains, is outside the cell and that residues in the NH2-terminal region of this domain are critical for the binding of the murine L6 mAb to H-L6."
https://openalex.org/W1523829475,"The alpha 4 integrin subunit can associate with either the beta 1- or beta 7-integrin subunit to form two unique adhesion receptors alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 7. We developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 19H8) that immunoprecipitated alpha 4 beta 1, induced homotypic leukocyte aggregation, and blocked the binding of cells to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the CS-1 peptide region of fibronectin. Aggregation cross-blocking analysis suggested that mAb 19H8 belonged to the group of mAbs that react with the B2 epitope of the alpha 4 subunit (alpha 4.B2 epitope); however, unlike the alpha 4.B2-specific mAb L25, mAb 19H8 did not immunoprecipitate alpha 4 beta 7. In addition, mAb 19H8 did not bind to beta 1-positive cells unless transfected with alpha 4 cDNA. These results indicated that mAb 19H8 was not specific for an individual alpha 4, beta 1, or beta 7 subunit but reacted with an epitope formed from the association of alpha 4 with beta 1. Separating the alpha 4 from the beta 1 subunit, by removing divalent cations or by treatment with high pH, disrupted mAb 19H8 binding. In contrast, the alpha 4-specific mAb L25 and the beta 1-specific mAb 18D3 could react with their respective subunits without subunit association. Therefore, mAb 19H8 defined a novel regulatory epitope expressed by the integrin alpha 4 beta 1."
https://openalex.org/W1541085066,"Abstract The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is linked to plasma membranes through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. It has been posited that the GPI anchor facilitates clearance of uPAR-bound complexes between two chain urokinase (tcuPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) by the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (alpha 2MR) which permits re-expression of unoccupied uPA receptors on the cell surface. To test this hypothesis we compared internalization and degradation of 125I-labeled tcuPA-PAI-1 by COS cells expressing either transfected wild-type, GPI-linked uPAR (uPAR/GPI), or a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domains of uPAR linked to the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the alpha chain (p55 subunit) of the interleukin-2 receptor (uPAR/IL-2R alpha). The kinetics of binding, internalization and degradation of tcuPA-PAI-1 by COS cells expressing each form of uPAR were virtually identical. However, internalization of complexes by uPAR/IL-2R alpha was more susceptible to inhibition by recombinant soluble 39-kDa alpha 2MR-associated protein (RAP) which competes for binding of tcuPA-PAI-1 complexes to alpha 2MR (p < 0.001), and the internalization was accompanied by a greater reduction in the number of surface uPAR/IL-2R alpha, than uPAR/GPI (p < 0.05). These studies indicate that the rate of internalization of tcuPA-PAI-1 is governed primarily by the extracellular domains of uPAR, whereas the GPI anchor may facilitate internalization of complexes and re-expression of uPAR when binding sites on alpha 2MR are limiting."
https://openalex.org/W1487355568,"The preimplantation ovine conceptus transiently secretes several proteins, including a type I interferon (IFN-tau), that are likely involved in establishment of pregnancy. A method has been developed to identify proteins produced simultaneously with IFN-tau. An antiserum against total ovine conceptus secretory proteins, from which IFN-tau and proteins common to maternal uterine tract secretions had first been removed, was used to immunoscreen cDNA libraries created from mRNA of days 13 and 15 ovine conceptuses. This approach has allowed several unique cDNA to be identified, including one particularly abundant transcript for a novel member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. This cDNA encodes a 265-amino acid protein with a 20-amino acid signal sequence. A 64-amino acid Kunitz domain occupies the carboxyl terminus. It is preceded by two similar repeats of 84 residues that bear no obvious similarity to any sequences present in the protein data banks. The protein present in conceptus secretions (M(r) of approximately 14,000) represents only the carboxyl terminus of the molecule. The mRNA for this putative proteinase inhibitor was confined to trophectoderm and was highly expressed for only a few days (approximately 13-18) of development. A similar transcript was detected during the days 17-21 period in cattle embryos. Despite their high expression, no proteinase-inhibitory activity can so far be ascribed to either the ovine or bovine proteins. The P1 residue, an asparagine, is not represented in any other known Kunitz inhibitors."

Incorporation of 35S-labeled amino acids into CD23 polypeptide chain is not affected either. In cycloheximide-treated cells, B1 increases the decline of CD23 from the cell surface. The disappearance of CD23 molecule correlates with an increase of soluble CD23 fragments detected in the culture medium.

Thrombin and angiotensin II stimulated the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate and the formation of several cytosolic species of inositol phosphates without the activation of PI 3-hydroxykinase. The response to thrombin was distinctive because a very large production of inositol 1,4-bisphosphate was accompanied by hydrolysis of PI 4-phosphate. The response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was distinguished by the production of the PI 3-hydroxykinase product, PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and the appearance of PI 3-hydroxykinase activity in immunoprecipitates. PDGF treatment of PAC1 cultures did not produce accumulation of detectable amounts of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, although a small sustained elevation in the level of inositol monophosphate and a gradual accumulation of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate were observed. Characterization of these distinctive responses permitted us to correlate agonist-regulated PPI metabolism with induction of immediate-early genes and stimulation of hypertrophy or proliferation of PAC1 cultures (Rothman, A., Wolner, B., Button, D., and Taylor, P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 6399-6404). Thrombin-stimulated PPI turnover and the production of a high level of inositol bisphosphate may be early signals linked to the induction of fosB and PAC1 cell hypertrophy, whereas the activation of PI 3-hydroxykinase and the accumulation of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in response to PDGF appear to be associated with mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1561860966,"Antibodies raised against a trpE-L16 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli were used to examine immunological relatedness between Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal protein L16 and ribosomal proteins from eubacteria, halobacteria, methanogens, eocytes, and other eukaryotes. Homologues of L16 also were identified by searches of sequence data bases. Among the bacterial proteins that are immunologically related and similar in sequence to L16 are ribosomal proteins that bind 5 S rRNA. L16 protein fused near its carboxyl terminus to E. coli beta-galactosidase could assemble into functional yeast 60 S ribosomal subunits. The RPL16A-lacZ gene fusion partially complemented the slow growth or lethality of mutants containing null alleles of one or both RPL16 genes, respectively. L16-beta-galactosidase fusion protein cosedimented with ribosomes and polyribosomes, and remained associated with high salt-washed ribosomes. Monoclonal antibodies against beta-galactosidase were used to map the location of L16-beta-galactosidase on the surface of the 60 S subunit by immunoelectron microscopy. L16 was localized near the top surface of the central protuberance, where the 60 S subunit potentially contacts the 40 S subunit. This is similar to the location of the bacterial homologues of L16 in 50 S ribosomal subunits."

They were enriched 13- and 18-fold in two apical membrane markers, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase, respectively, and presented a low level of contamination by basolateral and intracellular membranes. These apical membrane vesicles of homogeneous inside-out orientation were used to measure 36Cl- influx. The 36Cl- influx was found to be (i) voltage-insensitive (ii) diphenylcarboxylic acid-insensitive, and (iii) from 55 to 100% activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase according to initial rates and accumulation capacities. This rapid and ATP-dependent activation was associated with phosphorylation of a 170-180-kDa protein but was not observed with a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide like adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Immunodetection experiments showed that the mature form of bovine cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was only present in the apical membranes. As compared with the previously described characteristics of CFTR, the 36Cl- uptakes detected here are the in vitro manifestation of the functional form of bovine CFTR located at the apical level in these tracheal epithelial cells. Inside-out apical membrane vesicles, with freely accessible cytoplasmic sides and functional CFTR, offer a new model system to study CFTR."
