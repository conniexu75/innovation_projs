https://openalex.org/W1989052865,"Our aim in the current study was to determine the necessity of satellite cells for long-term muscle growth and maintenance. We utilized a transgenic Pax7-DTA mouse model, allowing for the conditional depletion of > 90% of satellite cells with tamoxifen treatment. Synergist ablation surgery, where removal of synergist muscles places functional overload on the plantaris, was used to stimulate robust hypertrophy. Following 8 wk of overload, satellite cell-depleted muscle demonstrated an accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and fibroblast expansion that resulted in reduced specific force of the plantaris. Although the early growth response was normal, an attenuation of hypertrophy measured by both muscle wet weight and fiber cross-sectional area occurred in satellite cell-depleted muscle. Isolated primary myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) negatively regulated fibroblast ECM mRNA expression in vitro, suggesting a novel role for activated satellite cells/MPCs in muscle adaptation. These results provide evidence that satellite cells regulate the muscle environment during growth.—Fry, C. S., Lee, J. D., Jackson, J. R., Kirby, T. J., Stasko, S. A, Liu, H., Dupont-Versteegden, E.

https://openalex.org/W1985806334,"Transcriptional events involved in the development of human cerebral neocortex are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the temporal dynamics and laterality of gene expression in human and macaque monkey neocortex. We found that interareal differences exhibit a temporal hourglass pattern, dividing the human neocortical development into three major phases. The first phase, corresponding to prenatal development, is characterized by the highest number of differential expressed genes among areas and gradient-like expression patterns, including those that are different between human and macaque. The second, preadolescent phase, is characterized by lesser interareal expression differences and by an increased synchronization of areal transcriptomes. During the third phase, from adolescence onward, differential expression among areas increases again driven predominantly by a subset of areas, without obvious gradient-like patterns. Analyses of left-right gene expression revealed population-level global symmetry throughout the fetal and postnatal time span. Thus, human neocortical topographic gene expression is temporally specified and globally symmetric."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia can be caused by expansion of a (GGGGCC)n repeat in the C9orf72 gene. Mutant r(GGGGCC)n- and r(GGCCCC)n-containing transcripts aggregate in nuclear foci, possibly sequestering repeat-binding proteins such as ASF/SF2 and hnRNPA1, suggesting a toxic RNA pathogenesis, as occurs in myotonic dystrophy. Furthermore, the C9orf72 repeat RNA was recently demonstrated to undergo the noncanonical repeat-associated non-AUG translation (RAN translation) into pathologic dipeptide repeats in patient brains, a process that is thought to depend upon RNA structure. We previously demonstrated that the r(GGGGCC)n RNA forms repeat tract length-dependent G-quadruplex structures that bind the ASF/SF2 protein. Here we show that the cationic porphyrin (5,10,15,20-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (TMPyP4)), which can bind some G-quadruplex-forming sequences, can bind and distort the G-quadruplex formed by r(GGGGCC)8, and this ablates the interaction of either hnRNPA1 or ASF/SF2 with the repeat. These findings provide proof of concept that nucleic acid binding small molecules, such as TMPyP4, can distort the secondary structure of the C9orf72 repeat, which may beneficially disrupt protein interactions, which may ablate either protein sequestration and/or RAN translation into potentially toxic dipeptides. Disruption of secondary structure formation of the C9orf72 RNA repeats may be a viable therapeutic avenue, as well as a means to test the role of RNA structure upon RAN translation."
https://openalex.org/W2149420045,"Postendocytic sorting of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is driven by their interactions between highly diverse receptor sequence motifs with their interacting proteins, such as postsynaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1) (PDZ) domain proteins. However, whether these diverse interactions provide an underlying functional specificity, in addition to driving sorting, is unknown. Here we identify GPCRs that recycle via distinct PDZ ligand/PDZ protein pairs that exploit their recycling machinery primarily for targeted endosomal localization and signaling specificity. The luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and β2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR), two GPCRs sorted to the regulated recycling pathway, underwent divergent trafficking to distinct endosomal compartments. Unlike B2AR, which traffics to early endosomes (EE), LHR internalizes to distinct pre-early endosomes (pre-EEs) for its recycling. Pre-EE localization required interactions of the LHR C-terminal tail with the PDZ protein GAIP-interacting protein C terminus, inhibiting its traffic to EEs. Rerouting the LHR to EEs, or EE-localized GPCRs to pre-EEs, spatially reprograms MAPK signaling. Furthermore, LHR-mediated activation of MAPK signaling requires internalization and is maintained upon loss of the EE compartment. We propose that combinatorial specificity between GPCR sorting sequences and interacting proteins dictates an unprecedented spatiotemporal control in GPCR signal activity.

https://openalex.org/W2044128314,"γ-Secretase generates amyloid β-protein (Aβ), a pathogenic molecule in Alzheimer disease, through the intramembrane cleavage of the β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (βCTF) of β-amyloid precursor protein. We previously showed the framework of the γ-secretase cleavage, i.e. the stepwise successive processing of βCTF at every three (or four) amino acids. However, the membrane integrity of γ-secretase was not taken into consideration because of the use of the 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid-solubilized reconstituted γ-secretase system. Here, we sought to address how the membrane-integrated γ-secretase cleaves βCTF by using γ-secretase associated with lipid rafts. Quantitative analyses using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of the βCTF transmembrane domain-derived peptides released along with Aβ generation revealed that the raft-associated γ-secretase cleaves βCTF in a stepwise sequential manner, but novel penta- and hexapeptides as well as tri- and tetrapeptides are released. The cropping of these peptides links the two major tripeptide-cleaving pathways generating Aβ40 and Aβ42 at several points, implying that there are multiple interactive pathways for the stepwise cleavages of βCTF. It should be noted that Aβ38 and Aβ43 are generated through three routes, and γ-secretase modulator 1 enhances all the three routes generating Aβ38, which results in decreases in Aβ42 and Aβ43 and an increase in Aβ38. These observations indicate that multiple interactive pathways for stepwise successive processing by γ-secretase define the species and quantity of Aβ produced. γ-Secretase generates amyloid β-protein (Aβ), a pathogenic molecule in Alzheimer disease, through the intramembrane cleavage of the β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (βCTF) of β-amyloid precursor protein.

It cleaves β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (βCTF) of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the middle of the membrane and releases Aβ and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Many familial AD (FAD)-associated mutations are found in presenilin (PS) 1/2, the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase (2.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewskim B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Two transmembrane aspartates in presenilin-1 required for presenilin endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity.Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Those mutations appear to modulate the activities of γ-secretase, leading to qualitatively and/or quantitatively altered generation of Aβ species (3.Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Bammens L. Benilova I.

The mechanism of γ-secretase dysfunction in familial Alzheimer disease.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2261-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thus, how γ-secretase cleaves βCTF is a critical issue in the pathogenesis of AD. In fact, a number of clinical and preclinical AD therapeutic trials targeting Aβ and/or γ-secretase are ongoing based on the amyloid theory (4.Mangialasche F. Solomon A. Winblad B. Mecocci P.

Because of the unavailability of water molecules within the membrane, the cleavage that occurs within the membrane has remained an enigma ever since the identification of APP (5.Dyrks T. Weidemann A.

However, advanced structural analyses of γ-secretase with cryo-electron microscopy and the substituted cysteine method have provided a plausible explanation; γ-secretase itself provides the hydrophilic environment required for substrate cleavage by generating a water-accessible cavity surrounded by multiple transmembrane segments of its own components (1.De Strooper B.

This view is supported by a recent study of the crystal structure of a PS/signal peptide peptidase homologue (8.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanism of the cleavage within the membrane is another important issue in the context of developing a disease-specific therapeutic reagent. We have been concerned about the molecular mechanisms regarding how βCTF is cleaved by γ-secretase within the membrane (9.Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R. Maruyama H.

Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. Longer forms of amyloid β protein: implications for the mechanism of intramembrane cleavage by γ-secretase.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identification of βCTF-derived tri- (and tetra-) peptides generated along with Aβ has lent strong support to the model (13.Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S. Ihara Y. γ-Secretase: successive tripeptide and tetrapeptide release from the transmembrane domain of β-carboxyl-terminal fragment.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13042-13052Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In this model, the initial ϵ-cleavages are followed sequentially by cleavages after every three (or four) residues, releasing Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Aβ38) as the final products. There are two product lines as follows: Aβ49 > Aβ46 > Aβ43 > Aβ40 and Aβ48 > Aβ45 > Aβ42 > Aβ38. Similarly spaced residues with intramembrane cleavage have been identified in tumor necrosis factor-α, a substrate of a signal peptide peptidase-like protein (14.Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Böhland C. Imhof A. Martoglio B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. A γ-secretase-like intramembrane cleavage of TNFα by the GxGD aspartyl protease SPPL2b.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 894-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Endoproteolysis with a spacing of three residues has also been shown to occur in PS (15.Fukumori A. Fluhrer R. Steiner H. Haass C. Three-amino acid spacing of presenilin endoproteolysis suggests a general stepwise cleavage of γ-secretase-mediated intramembrane proteolysis.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 7853-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the stepwise cleavage mechanism may be a characteristic of intramembrane proteolysis. As the previous study to identify the released oligopeptides was carried out using CHAPSO-solubilized γ-secretase (13.Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S. Ihara Y. γ-Secretase: successive tripeptide and tetrapeptide release from the transmembrane domain of β-carboxyl-terminal fragment.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13042-13052Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the mechanism underlying intramembrane cleavage by γ-secretase remains to be clarified. Now it is known that some previous observations do not agree with the proposed model. For example, the different molecular species of Aβ and their corresponding AICDs are not produced in a one-to-one ratio (9.Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R. Maruyama H. Koo E.H. Haass C. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. Potential link between amyloid β-protein 42 and C-terminal fragment γ49–99 of β-amyloid precursor protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24294-24301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cell-based expression of Aβ48 generates both Aβ42 and Aβ40 even if there is a preference for Aβ42 generation (10.Funamoto S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Hirotani N. Saido T.C. Ihara Y. Truncated carboxyl-terminal fragments of β-amyloid precursor protein are processed to amyloid β-proteins 40 and 42.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13532-13540Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that there may be additional unidentified processing pathways for Aβ generation. Here, to address these issues, we sought to verify the stepwise cleavage model for Aβ generation using lipid raft membranes (16.Brown D.A. London E. Functions of lipid rafts in biological membranes.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar), where active γ-secretase is known to reside (17.Wada S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Qi Y. Misono H. Shimada Y. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Ihara Y. γ-Secretase activity is present in rafts but is not cholesterol-dependent.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13977-13986Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The antibodies against Aβ used here were 82E1 (IBL), 6E10 (Covance), polyclonal antibodies specific for Aβ40, Aβ42, or Aβ43 (IBL), and a monoclonal antibody specific for Aβ38 (IBL). Antibodies against nicastrin and Pen-2 were from Sigma and Oncogene Science, respectively. The monoclonal antibodies against caveolin, flotillin, and calnexin were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. A microsomal fraction was prepared as described previously (11.Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y.

Briefly, harvested CHO cells or cortices from 4-week-old Wistar rats were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 140 mm KCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EGTA) containing various protease inhibitors. Following brief centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, the resulting postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellets containing the total membrane fraction were suspended in buffer C (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA). Lipid rafts were obtained as the detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) as described (17.Wada S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Qi Y. Misono H. Shimada Y. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Ihara Y. γ-Secretase activity is present in rafts but is not cholesterol-dependent.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13977-13986Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The pellets containing the total membrane fraction were homogenized in 10% sucrose in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% CHAPSO and various protease inhibitors. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose, placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid with 35% and then 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline. The discontinuous gradient was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C on an SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman). Lipid rafts accumulating at the 5–35% sucrose interface were carefully collected and resuspended in buffer C. βCTF (C99) tagged with FLAG at the carboxyl terminus (C99-FLAG) was prepared from Sf9 cells basically as described (18.Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. Equimolar production of amyloid β-protein and amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain from β-carboxyl-terminal fragment by γ-secretase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus and cultured in the presence of 20 mm GM6001 to suppress α-secretase-like cleavage of C99-FLAG. C99-FLAG overexpressed in Sf9 cells was solubilized with the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and then immunoaffinity-purified with anti-FLAG® M2-agarose beads (Sigma). The quantity and purity of the obtained C99-FLAG were assessed by gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The reaction mixture contained DRMs at a protein concentration of 80 μg/ml from CHO cells or 100 μg/ml from rat brains, defined amounts of C99-FLAG, and 0.25% CHAPSO in buffer C supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 μg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysyl chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm thiorphan, 100 μm bestatin, 10 μm amastatin, 0.1 μm arphamenine, and 5 mm EDTA). This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, and the reaction was stopped by placing the reaction mixture on ice. To assess γ-secretase activities in the total membrane fraction, the pellets containing the total membrane fraction were resuspended in buffer C to give a final protein concentration of 4.0 mg/ml. An equal volume of buffer C containing 2% CHAPSO and protease inhibitors (1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 2 μg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysyl chloromethyl ketone, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm thiorphan) was added, and the fraction was kept on ice for 1 h. The fraction was diluted in 3 volumes of buffer C containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 μg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysyl chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm thiorphan, 133 μm bestatin, 13.3 μm amastatin, 0.13 μm arphamenine, and 6.7 mm EDTA) and defined amounts of C99-FLAG, and then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. The experiments to compare γ-secretase activities between total membranes and lipid rafts were performed within a linear range of Aβ generation according to the concentration of the substrate and the protein concentration in the membrane fraction. Aliquots from the reaction mixture were transferred into the SDS sample buffer and subjected to quantitative Western blotting. The remaining part of the reaction mixture was mixed with trichloroacetic acid and kept on ice for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered through a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane (0.22-μm pore size, Merck). The filtrate was injected into an HP1100 (Hewlett-Packard) system equipped with an STR ODS-II column (4.6 × 150 mm, Shinwa Chemical Industries) to be concentrated. The column was washed with 0% B for 7 min, and the peptides were eluted as a mixture by using a steep 0–90% B gradient for 0.1 min (A, 0.05% formic acid; B, 0.05% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile). The eluate was subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses. The proteins were separated on either a 16.5% conventional Tris/Tricine gel or an 11% Tris/Tricine long gel (20 cm length) containing 8 m urea, followed by Western blotting with the antibodies to Aβ as described previously (11.Qi-Takahara Y.

Longer forms of amyloid β protein: implications for the mechanism of intramembrane cleavage by γ-secretase.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The blots were developed by an ECL system (GE Healthcare). The signals were detected using a LAS 4000 mini-luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Film) and quantified using MultiGauge software (Fuji Film) with defined amounts of each synthetic Aβ species as standards. For the detection of other proteins, the proteins separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The quantification of the expected peptides by LC-MS/MS was performed as described previously (13.Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S.

A Quattro PremierTM XE tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer accompanied by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (Waters) equipped with a column (ACQUITY UPLC® HSS T3, 1.8 μm, 2.0 × 150 mm) was used to identify and quantify the tripeptides and other oligopeptides. To quantify each analyte, the precursor ion-product ion pairs were monitored using the device's multiple-reaction monitoring mode as follows: m/z = 304.1 and 185.0 for IAT; 330.1 and 185.0 for VIV; 346.1 and 215.1 for ITL; 332.1 and 173.0 for TVI; and 332.1 and 185.0 for VIT. The precursor and product m/z values used for other peptides were as follows: MVG, 305.9 and 202.9; VGG, 231.9 and 156.9; GGV, 232.1 and 117.8; GVV, 274.1 and 128.9; VVI, 330.1 and 199.1; VIA, 302.1 and 185.0; ATV, 290.1 and 173.0; IVI, 344.1 and 213.1; TLV, 332.1 and 187.1; LVM, 362.1 and 213.1; GGVV, 331.1 and 213.9; GVVI, 387.1 and 231.1; VVIA, 401.3 and 203.0; VIAT, 403.5 and 184.9; IATV, 403.0 and 219.0; ATVI, 403.3 and 254.1; TVIV, 431.1 and 231.0; VIVI, 443.1 and 231.0; IVIT, 444.9 and 233.0; VITL, 444.9 and 232.9; GVVIA, 458.0 and 256.0; VVIAT, 502.7 and 199.1; VIATV, 502.0 and 185.0; IATVI, 516.0 and 173.0; ATVIV, 502.0 and 254.0; TVIVI, 544.0 and 200.9; VIVIT, 544.0 and 185.0; IVITL, 558.2 and 213.1; IATVIV, 615.2 and 268.0; VIVITL, 657.3 and 184.9. FLF (m/z = 426.3 and 261.2) was used as an internal standard. Standard curves for peptides were obtained within a linear range from 1.5 to 100 fmol. After 3 h of incubation of the reconstituted Aβ generation system, the produced Aβ was immunoprecipitated with 6E10 and protein G-coupled to Sepharose beads. The produced AICD was immunoprecipitated subsequently with anti-FLAG® M2-agarose beads. Aβ and AICD bound to the recovered beads were eluted with 30% acetonitrile in 1% trifluoroacetate. Molecular masses of the peptides were determined with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-TOF-mass spectrometer, 4800 Plus MALDI TOF/TOFTM analyzer (AB SCIEX) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix (18.Kakuda N.

Their quantities were determined by amino acid analysis (Peptide Institute). Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Statistical analyses were performed using StatView 5.0 and Microsoft Excel 2008. Our previous study showed that lipid rafts contain all four components (PS1/2, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2) required for the active γ-secretase complex and exhibit higher γ-secretase activity in the membrane-based cell-free Aβ generation system using an endogenous substrate (17.Wada S.

This indicates that lipid rafts are one of the sites involved in Aβ generation within the cell. The following studies provided several lines of evidence for this assumption (22.Vetrivel K.S. Thinakaran G. Membrane rafts in Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid production.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1801: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23.Bhattacharyya R. Barren C. Kovacs D.M. Palmitoylation of amyloid precursor protein regulates amyloidogenic processing in lipid rafts.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 11169-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, the lipid composition of the rafts is favorable for γ-secretase activities (24.Osenkowski P. Ye W. Wang R. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Direct and potent regulation of γ-secretase by its lipid microenvironment.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22529-22540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to use lipid rafts as a model system for the intramembrane cleavage of βCTF by γ-secretase. Lipid rafts were prepared from CHO cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of 1% CHAPSO. The raft fraction was determined by its flotation, the presence of flotillin (a lipid raft marker), and the absence of calnexin (a non-DRM marker). The majority of mature nicastrin, Pen-2, and the carboxyl-terminal fragment of PS were fractionated into the lipid raft fraction (Fig. 1A) (17.Wada S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Qi Y. Misono H. Shimada Y. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Ihara Y. γ-Secretase activity is present in rafts but is not cholesterol-dependent.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13977-13986Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An in vitro reconstituted γ-secretase assay was performed using lipid rafts together with 0.25 μm C99-FLAG that was purified from Sf9 cells. γ-Secretase activity was assessed by the amounts of Aβ generated. Although only small amounts of proteins were recovered, the raft fraction yielded specific γ-secretase activity 10-fold higher than that of the total membrane-associated γ-secretase (Fig. 1B). Aβ was produced in a time-dependent manner by incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). The production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 proceeded in a similar profile (Fig. 2, A and C). L-685,458 completely suppressed the Aβ production, indicating that it was mediated by γ-secretase. The molecular species of Aβ produced were examined by a long SDS-urea gel (Fig. 2D). The most robustly produced was Aβ40, followed by Aβ42. In addition to Aβ40 and Aβ42, significant amounts of Aβ43 and small amounts of Aβ45 were detected. A weak signal migrating at the Aβ46 position represented the combined signals of Aβ46 plus larger species. Moreover, significant amounts of Aβ38 were produced. The Aβ38 band was just beneath the bands of C99-FLAG on a long SDS-urea gel, and its identity was confirmed with an Aβ38-specific antibody (data not shown, see Fig. 6A). Aβ41 and Aβ44 were undetectable.FIGURE 6GSM-1 enhanced the release of VVIA as well as VVIAT and VVI by raft-associated γ-secretase. A, effect of GSM-1 on Aβ generation by raft-associated γ-secretase. Lipid rafts from CHO cells were subjected to the Aβ generation assay in the presence of GSM-1 at the indicated concentrations. Following incubation for 60 min, the reaction mixtures were subjected to Western blotting with 82E1 for total Aβ and species-specific antibodies to Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ38, and Aβ43. Relative Aβ generation activities compared with no treatment with GSM-1 are shown. Whereas the levels of total Aβ did not alter, the levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 decreased, and those of Aβ38 increased significantly with GSM-1 in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.0032, 0.0179, and 0.0017, respectively, Spearman's rank correlation). The Aβ40 levels were relatively stable under treatment with GSM-1 at most concentrations, but very high concentrations of GSM-1 caused a decrease in Aβ40 (p = 0.0006, Student's t test compared with no treatment with GSM-1).

MazEF is a type II toxin-antitoxin system present on the chromosome of Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Whether MazEF is involved in programmed cell death or reversible growth inhibition and bacterial persistence is a matter of debate. In the present work the role of MazF in bacterial physiology was studied by using an inactive, active-site mutant of MazF, E24A, to activate WT MazF expression from its own promoter. The ectopic expression of E24A MazF in a strain containing WT mazEF resulted in reversible growth arrest. Normal growth resumed on inhibiting the expression of E24A MazF. MazF-mediated growth arrest resulted in an increase in survival of bacterial cells during antibiotic stress. This was studied by activation of mazEF either by overexpression of an inactive, active-site mutant or pre-exposure to a sublethal dose of antibiotic. The MazF-mediated persistence phenotype was found to be independent of RecA and dependent on the presence of the ClpP and Lon proteases. This study confirms the role of MazEF in reversible growth inhibition and persistence. Toxin-antitoxin systems are ubiquitous in nature and present on the chromosomes of both bacteria and archaea.

Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 5577-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). TA loci were originally discovered on plasmids where they help in plasmid maintenance by killing or inhibiting the growth of plasmid-free cells (5.Hayes F. Toxins-antitoxins. Plasmid maintenance, programmed cell death, and cell cycle arrest.Science. 2003; 301: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 6.Jensen R.B. Gerdes K. Programmed cell death in bacteria. Proteic plasmid stabilization systems.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Each TA locus consists of a pair of genes. Typically, the downstream gene encodes for a stable toxin and the upstream gene encodes for a labile antitoxin. Comprehensive genome analyses have shown that TA loci are ubiquitous in free-living prokaryotes but are less abundant in obligatory intracellular bacteria (7.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has more than 80 TA loci, whereas Mycobacterium leprae has two TA pseudo loci (7.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The biological function of TA loci when present on a plasmid is clear, but the roles of many chromosomal TA loci are unclear. There are different models that have been proposed to explain their presence on the chromosome. These include the programmed cell death model (PCD), the growth modulation model, the persistence model, and the development model (8.Van Melderen L. Saavedra De Bast M. Bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems. More than selfish entities?.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000437Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Despite a plethora of studies on TA systems, in most cases their functions remain to be elucidated. A common difficulty encountered during study of a specific TA system is functional redundancy with other TA systems present in the same organism. Many genomes contain multiple TA loci. Hence study of the in vivo role of a particular TA locus requires the selective activation of that specific locus in the background of other TA loci. Ectopic overexpression of the active, toxin component often leads to cell death, further complicating elucidation of TA system function. In the present study we use a method described previously (9.Tripathi A. Dewan P.C. Barua B. Varadarajan R. Additional role for the ccd operon of F-plasmid as a transmissible persistence factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12497-12502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to study one of the best characterized Escherichia coli chromosomal TA systems, mazEF (5.Hayes F. Toxins-antitoxins. Plasmid maintenance, programmed cell death, and cell cycle arrest.Science. 2003; 301: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 7.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The MazEF TA system consists of a labile antitoxin MazE and a stable toxin MazF. They are encoded by the genes mazE and mazF, which are located downstream of the relA gene (10.Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. An Escherichia coli chromosomal “addiction module” regulated by guanosine [corrected] 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate. A model for programmed bacterial cell death.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The expression of the mazEF is negatively autoregulated by binding of either MazE or MazE-MazF complex to two upstream promoters (11.Marianovsky I. Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. The regulation of the Escherichia coli mazEF promoter involves an unusual alternating palindrome.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5975-5984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In vivo, during exponential growth, MazE is normally degraded by the ATP-dependent ClpAP serine protease (10.Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. An Escherichia coli chromosomal “addiction module” regulated by guanosine [corrected] 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate. A model for programmed bacterial cell death.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). MazF is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves mRNAs at the 3′ end of the first A base in an ACA sequence in a ribosome-independent manner (12.Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H.

Gerdes K. Rapid induction and reversal of a bacteriostatic condition by controlled expression of toxins and antitoxins.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Rather, the toxins induce a bacteriostatic condition that can be fully reversed by expression of the cognate antitoxin. Concomitant with the loss of the ability to form colonies, RelE and MazF overexpression inhibited translation. However in both cases, subsequent overexpression of the cognate antitoxins was reported to simultaneously reverse the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis and the bacteriostatic condition. In another study (17.Tsilibaris V. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Van Melderen L. What is the benefit to Escherichia coli of having multiple toxin-antitoxin systems in its genome?.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6101-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), an E. coli mutant strain deleted for five known TA systems was examined under five different stress conditions, namely amino acid starvation, rifampin treatment, chloramphenicol treatment, acidic stress, and nutritional downshift and also during the post-stress recovery phase. In contrast to earlier reports, it was found that under all the tested conditions, the wild type and mutant strains showed similar reversible growth inhibition indicating that neither the growth inhibition nor the post stress recovery phase was dependent on any of the five TA systems. Because many bacteria contain multiple homologous TA systems with overlapping functions, knock-out of a single TA system often does not produce an observable phenotype (18.Shah D. Zhang Z. Khodursky A. Kaldalu N. Kurg K. Lewis K. Persisters. A distinct physiological state of E. coli.BMC Microbiol. 2006; 6: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 19.Maisonneuve E.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In the present work we study the effect of a specific TA module, mazEF, in the background of several TA systems. We use a previously described methodology for regulating the expression of toxin in a tunable fashion (9.Tripathi A. Dewan P.C. Barua B. Varadarajan R. Additional role for the ccd operon of F-plasmid as a transmissible persistence factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12497-12502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The method involves activation of the wild type (WT) toxin by overexpression of a mutated version of the toxin that has an unaltered affinity for the antitoxin but a very low affinity/activity for the cellular target of WT toxin (9.Tripathi A. Dewan P.C. Barua B. Varadarajan R. Additional role for the ccd operon of F-plasmid as a transmissible persistence factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12497-12502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Relative to ectopic expression from a heterologous promoter, our method has the following advantages. First, WT MazF is expressed from its cognate promoter. Second, although there are multiple systems for low and tunable expression in E. coli, this is not true for other bacteria. Third, at low levels of induction from a tightly regulated promoter, there can be issues with cell to cell variability in expression. This is not an issue in our approach, where high inducer concentrations are used to overexpress the inactive, active-site mutant. Using this methodology we show that MazF is involved in inhibiting bacterial cell growth and enhancing drug tolerance/bacterial persistence rather than cell killing. Persisters are enriched in a dormant, slow growing fraction of cells present and are genetically identical to the remainder of an actively growing bacterial population. Persisters are tolerant to various drugs in the absence of any specific, active resistance mechanism (21.Balaban N.Q. Merrin J. Chait R. Kowalik L. Leibler S.

Microbial persistence and the road to drug resistance.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13: 632-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas previous studies have demonstrated overexpression of the mazEF genes in persister cells (18.Shah D. Zhang Z. Khodursky A. Kaldalu N. Kurg K. Lewis K. Persisters. A distinct physiological state of E. coli.BMC Microbiol. 2006; 6: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 24.Vázquez-Laslop N. Lee H. Neyfakh A.A. Increased persistence in Escherichia coli caused by controlled expression of toxins or other unrelated proteins.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3494-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the specific contribution of the MazEF system in generation of persisters had not been determined. In the present work, we conclusively show that MazF plays a definite role in generation of persisters that is dependent on activation by ClpP and Lon proteases and independent of the RecA mediated SOS response. E. coli host strains and plasmids used for this study are mentioned in Table 1. BW25113 (WT) is a wild type E. coli K12 strain that has the mazEF operon present on the chromosome. JW2753-1 (WT) is a derivative of BW25113 in which the mazF gene has been deleted from the chromosome, and this is referred to BWΔmazF. JW4184–2 is a derivative of BW25113 in which the chpB gene (mazF homolog) has been deleted from the chromosome, and this is referred to BWΔchpB. The strains BWΔclpP, BWΔlon, and BWΔrecA are BW25113 strains that have deletions of clpP, lon, and recA genes, respectively, from the chromosome. Strains BW25113, BWΔmazF, BWΔchpB, BWΔclpP, BWΔlon, and BWΔrecA were obtained from the E. coli genetic Stock Center at Yale (CGSC). Strains BWΔmazF, BWΔclpP, BWΔlon, and BWΔrecA were made markerless by using the plasmid pCP20 expressing Flippase recombinase (25.Cherepanov P.P. Wackernagel W. Gene disruption in Escherichia coli. TcR and KmR cassettes with the option of Flp-catalyzed excision of the antibiotic-resistance determinant.Gene. 1995; 158: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). MCΔmazF and MGΔmazF strains are derivatives of E. coli strains MC4100 and MG1655, respectively. Both strains have a deletion of the mazF gene from the chromosome. MazF mutant genes were cloned between NdeI and HindIII sites in plasmid pBAD24. The mazF gene was amplified from the genome of BW25113 strain (WT) of E. coli, and the mutants were generated by a mega-primer-based method of site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (26.Bajaj K.

Positive colonies containing the cat cassette at the mazEF locus were confirmed by both PCR and DNA Sanger sequencing. The strain MCΔmazEF::cat was made markerless by excising the cat gene after transforming the strain with the pCP20 plasmid expressing Flippase recombinase.

An E. coli K12 strain, MG1655 transformed with pKD46 plasmid, was electroporated with amplified kan cassette containing ∼50 bp at each end that was homologous to the flanking sequences of the mazF gene. Transformants were screened on kanamycin (50 μg/ml) containing LB agar plates. The presence of the kan cassette at the mazF locus was confirmed by PCR. The resulting strain, MGΔmazF::kan, was made markerless by transforming the strain with pCP20 expressing Flippase recombinase, and the resulting strain was named MGΔmazF (25.Cherepanov P.P.

E. coli strains WT and BWΔmazF (WT with deletion of ΔmazF gene on chromosome) were transformed in parallel with pBAD24 plasmids expressing WT MazF, MazF (E24A), MazF (H28A), and wild type Trx under control of the arabinose inducible PBAD promoter. 5 μl of the transformation mix were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB/amp (100 μg/ml). Wherever not indicated, the growth of culture has been carried out at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm. 50 μl of a 10−4 dilution was plated on six-well LB-amp plates containing either 0 or 0.2% arabinose. To construct plasmid, pET15bmazE, pET15b-6×his-gyrA-3×FLAG plasmid was digested with NotI and NdeI restriction enzymes and linearized by removing the gyrA gene. The linearized vector has a T7 promoter at one end and a 3× FLAG tag sequence (5′-gattataaagatcatgat-3′) at the other end. The mazE gene was PCR amplified from the E. coli strain BW25113 containing WT mazEF operon using forward primer and reverse primers that have ∼30 bp homologous sequences at the each end to the linearized vector. The PCR product and the vector were recombined by the Gibson assembly method (31.Gibson D.G. Young L. Chuang R.Y. Venter J.C. Hutchison 3rd, C.A. Smith H.O. Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar). After recombination, E. coli strain DH5α was transformed with the recombined product, and positive transformants were screened by colony PCR using vector-specific forward and gene-specific reverse primers. Further confirmation of the clones was done by DNA sequencing, and the resulting clone was named as pET15bmazE. This has 6× histidine and 3× FLAG tags at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mazE gene, respectively. For the cloning of 6× histidine-mazE-3× FLAG into pBAD24 vector, plasmid pET15bmazF was used as a template for PCR. Gibson assembly was done to recombine NdeI- and HindIII-digested pBAD24 vector and PCR-amplified product, respectively. Positive transformants were confirmed by colony PCR and by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using peroxidase-conjugated anti-His antibody. Clones were further confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the resulting plasmid was named as pBAD24mazE. To study the effect of Lon and ClpP on the stability of MazE, WT (BW25113 strain), BWΔclpP (BW25113 lacking clpP gene), and BWΔlon (BW25113 lacking lon gene) strains were transformed with pBAD24mazE plasmid and grown in LB medium at 37 °C, 180 rpm overnight. 1% of the overnight culture was used for secondary inoculation and grown further under similar conditions to an A600 of 0.5. Cells were induced with 0.001% (w/v) arabinose for 2 h. After 2 h, inducer (arabinose) was removed, and the repressor (glucose) was added at a final concentration of 2% (w/v) to repress the further expression of MazE from the PBAD promoter. Where required, heat shock was given at 48 °C for 20 min followed by incubation at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken at intervals of 30 min, and the cellular level of MazE was monitored by SDS-PAGE and quantitated using Bio-Rad ChemiDocTM MP image software, Image Lab 4.1. E. coli strains MG1655 (WT strain, contains WT mazE and mazF genes on the chromosome) and MGΔmazEF (MG1655 with deletion of mazE and mazF genes from the chromosome) were transformed with pBAD24E24AmazF or pBAD24trx. Primary cultures for both the strains were grown at 37 °C for 16 h in LB media containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) with shaking at 180 rpm. Secondary inoculation was done at a 1:100 dilution, and cells were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.3 was reached followed by induction at an inducer concentration of 0.2% (w/v) for 1 h. Total RNA was purified using GE Healthcare illustra RNAspin Mini RNA Isolation kit, and cDNA from the total RNA was prepared using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). A real-time PCR analysis to quantitate expression from the mazEF operon was done using mazE-specific primers and with iQ SYBR Green Supermix at 55 °C. As an internal control, 16 S rRNA was used for normalization of expression across all the samples. To check the specificity of expression from the mazEF operon in the presence of an overexpressed E24A MazF mutant, mRNA levels of an unrelated gene trx cloned under the PBAD promoter were also measured. The change in expression of mazEF operon from its native promoter was quantified and compared in induced and uninduced E24A MazF samples, respectively. E. coli strain BWΔmazF containing pBAD24mazE plasmid was grown at 37 °C, 180 rpm for 16 h in LB media containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Secondary inoculation was done with 1% of primary culture, grown further under similar conditions, and induction was done at an A600 of 0.5 with 0.2% (w/v) arabinose for 2 h. Cells were pelleted down at 5000 rpm at 4 °C, resuspended in Tris buffer (0.2 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 m sucrose), and lysed by sonication at 45% amplitude for 10 min with 2 s pulse on and 8 s off. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C to pellet down cell debris. The supernatant was incubated with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads for 5 h at 4 °C followed by washing (50 mm imidazole, 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl) and elution by elution buffer (500 mm imidazole, 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl). Purified protein was dialyzed in coupling buffer (0.05 m sodium bicarbonate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) and coupled to Bio-Rad Affi-Gel 10 by using amine coupling chemistry. The amount of protein bound to Affi-Gel was estimated using fluorescence spectroscopy. Approximately 80% of the initial amount of MazE was coupled to the beads. E. coli strain BWΔmazF transformed with pBADE24AmazF was grown at 37 °C for 16 h in LB media containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Secondary inoculation was done at a dilution of 1:100, a"
https://openalex.org/W2123319919,"Admixture is a well known confounder in genetic association studies. If genome-wide data is not available, as would be the case for candidate gene studies, ancestry informative markers (AIMs) are required in order to adjust for admixture. The predominant population group in the Western Cape, South Africa, is the admixed group known as the South African Coloured (SAC). A small set of AIMs that is optimized to distinguish between the five source populations of this population (African San, African non-San, European, South Asian, and East Asian) will enable researchers to cost-effectively reduce false-positive findings resulting from ignoring admixture in genetic association studies of the population. Using genome-wide data to find SNPs with large allele frequency differences between the source populations of the SAC, as quantified by Rosenberg et. al's In-statistic, we developed a panel of AIMs by experimenting with various selection strategies. Subsets of different sizes were evaluated by measuring the correlation between ancestry proportions estimated by each AIM subset with ancestry proportions estimated using genome-wide data. We show that a panel of 96 AIMs can be used to assess ancestry proportions and to adjust for the confounding effect of the complex five-way admixture that occurred in the South African Coloured population."
https://openalex.org/W2045353541,"Rod photoreceptors contribute to vision over an ∼ 6-log-unit range of light intensities. The wide dynamic range of rod vision is thought to depend upon light intensity-dependent switching between two parallel pathways linking rods to ganglion cells: a rod → rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway that operates at dim backgrounds and a rod → cone → cone bipolar cell pathway that operates at brighter backgrounds. We evaluated this conventional model of rod vision by recording rod-mediated light responses from ganglion and AII amacrine cells and by recording RB-mediated synaptic currents from AII amacrine cells in mouse retina. Contrary to the conventional model, we found that the RB pathway functioned at backgrounds sufficient to activate the rod → cone pathway. As background light intensity increased, the RB's role changed from encoding the absorption of single photons to encoding contrast modulations around mean luminance. This transition is explained by the intrinsic dynamics of transmission from RB synapses."

Mutations in human TRPML1 cause the lysosome storage disease, mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV). Unlike vertebrates, which express three TRPML genes, TRPML1–3, the Drosophila genome encodes a single trpml gene. Although the trpml-deficient flies exhibit cellular defects similar to those in mammalian TRPML1 mutants, the biophysical properties of Drosophila TRPML channel remained uncharacterized. Here, we show that transgenic expression of human TRPML1 in the neurons of Drosophila trpml mutants partially suppressed the pupal lethality phenotype. When expressed in HEK293 cells, Drosophila TRPML was localized in both endolysosomes and plasma membrane and was activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) applied to the cytoplasmic side in whole lysosomes and inside-out patches excised from plasma membrane. The PI(3,5)P2-evoked currents were blocked by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), but not other phosphoinositides. Using TRPML A487P, which mimics the varitint-waddler (Va) mutant of mouse TRPML3 with constitutive whole-cell currents, we show that TRPML is biphasically regulated by extracytosolic pH, with an optimal pH about 0.6 pH unit higher than that of human TRPML1. In addition to monovalent cations, TRPML exhibits high permeability to Ca2+, Mn2+, and Fe2+, but not Fe3+. The TRPML currents were inhibited by trivalent cations Fe3+, La3+, and Gd3+. These features resemble more closely to mammalian TRPML1 than TRPML2 and TRPML3, but with some obvious differences.

The Va mice show defects in hearing and pigmentation, implicating a key function of TRPML3 in hair cells and melanocytes (19.Di Palma F. Belyantseva I.A. Kim H.J. Vogt T.F. Kachar B. Noben-Trauth K.

Substitutions of the equivalent position, as well as a number of nearby amino acids, by proline in TRPML1 or TRPML2 also resulted in constitutive channel activity on the plasma membrane (16.Xu H.

These have allowed convenient characterizations of biophysical properties of these channels (21.Dong X.P. Cheng X. Mills E. Delling M. Wang F. Kurz T. Xu H. The type IV mucolipidosis-associated protein TRPML1 is an endolysosomal iron release channel.Nature. 2008; 455: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Common to all mammalian TRPML channels is their activation on the cytoplasmic side by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), a phosphoinositide enriched in intracellular membranes (22.Dong X.P. Shen D. Wang X. Dawson T. Li X. Zhang Q. Cheng X. Zhang Y. Weisman L.S. Delling M. Xu H. PI(3,5)P2 controls membrane trafficking by direct activation of mucolipin Ca2+ release channels in the endolysosome.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). At least for TRPML1, this effect appears to be antagonized by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (23.Zhang X. Li X. Xu H. Phosphoinositide isoforms determine compartment-specific ion channel activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 11384-11389Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the PIP2 species enriched in the plasma membrane. Thus, it may be assumed that selective bindings between PI(3,5)P2 and PI(4,5)P2 determine the function of TRPML channels. While the high PI(4,5)P2 content inhibits the TRPML channels located on the plasma membrane, the high PI(3,5)P2 levels in intracellular membranes support the activation of TRPML channels in endolysosomes. Different from vertebrates, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans express only one trpml gene. In C. elegans, the deletion of the MCOLN ortholog gene, cup-5, leads to the accumulation of enlarged vacuoles, excess apoptotic cells, and embryonic lethality (24.Treusch S. Knuth S. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Goldin E. Grant B.D. Fares H. Caenorhabditis elegans functional orthologue of human protein h-mucolipin-1 is required for lysosome biogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In Drosophila, disruption of the only trpml gene resulted in similar, but more severe, defects as compared with human MLIV, including defective autophagy due to diminished fusion of late-endosomes and amphisomes with lysosomes, impaired synaptic transmission, accumulation of apoptotic cells, oxidative stress, lipofuscin accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, motor defects, and massive neurodegeneration (1.Cheng X.

The more severe abnormality of the Drosophila TRPML knock-out than the mammalian TRPML1 knock-out/mutations suggests that the insect channel may also carry out functions that are uniquely performed by mammalian TRPML2 and/or TRPML3, raising the possibility that the insect TRPML channel may collectively possess properties of all three mammalian TRPML channels. To date, however, little is known about the channel function of Drosophila TRPML channel and how it is regulated. Here, we show that transgenic expression of human TRPML1 in neurons of the TRPML-null flies (referred to as trpml1 (26.Venkatachalam K. Long A.A. Elsaesser R. Nikolaeva D. Broadie K. Montell C. Motor deficit in a Drosophila model of mucolipidosis type IV due to defective clearance of apoptotic cells.Cell. 2008; 135: 838-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar)) partially rescued the pupal lethality phenotype, indicating some but not complete functional resemblance between the insect TRPML and mammalian TRPML1. To provide functional correlates between these channels, we examined the channel function of Drosophila TRPML heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. We show that TRPML is expressed and functional on both endolysosomes and plasma membrane of HEK293 cells. Similar to its mammalian counterparts, it is activated by PI(3,5)P2, and inhibited by PI(4,5)P2. However, its sensitivity to other phosphoinositides is not identical to that of mouse TRPML1. The “Va” mutant of Drosophila TRPML is constitutively active on the plasma membrane and is permeable to K+, Na+, Cs+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Fe2+, but blocked by trivalent cations, Fe3+ and La3+ and Gd3+. In addition, the channel displays a bell-shaped dependence on extracytosolic pH, which is significantly left shifted as compared with that of human TRPML1. The construct for C-terminal YFP-tagged Drosophila TRPML (26.Venkatachalam K. Long A.A. Elsaesser R. Nikolaeva D. Broadie K. Montell C. Motor deficit in a Drosophila model of mucolipidosis type IV due to defective clearance of apoptotic cells.Cell. 2008; 135: 838-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was used to create the TRPML-EGFP plasmid transferring the coding sequence of TRPML to the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The Lamp1-mCherry plasmid was generated from Lamp1-EGFP (gift from Dr. Paul Luzio, Cambridge University) by replacing the coding sequence of EGFP with that of mCherry. Human TRPML1Va-EGFP was a gift from Dr. Haoxing Xu (University of Michigan). TRPMLVa-EGFP was created by substituting the codon for Ala-487 of TRPML-EGFP by that for a proline using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The final sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. All phosphoinositides (Di-C8 forms, unless indicated otherwise) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. Other chemicals were obtained from Fisher Scientific Co or Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated otherwise. Stock solutions of diC16 phospholipids were made in water (0.5 mm) by sonication for 30 min on ice and then aliquots stored at −80 °C. On the day of the experiments, a new aliquot was thawed and diluted in the bath solution for inside-out recordings (see later under “Electrophysiology”) and sonicated for 10–30 min. This procedure followed that described previously for PI(4,5)P2 (29.Rohács T. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Logothetis D.E. Distinct specificities of inwardly rectifying K+ channels for phosphoinositides.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36065-36072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), allowing the formation of mostly small micelles for channel activation in the patched membrane. The cDNA for C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human TRPML1 (hTRPML1::HA) was subcloned into the pUAST vector and transgenic flies were generated by Rainbow Transgenic Flies Inc. To verify transgene expression in Drosophila cells, the flies were crossed with fly line cg-GAL4 (Bloomington line 7011) for expression in fat-bodies/hemocytes and the presence of hTRPML1::HA in larval fat-bodies was detected by immunohistochemistry as described (27.Wong C.O. Li R. Montell C. Venkatachalam K. Drosophila TRPML is required for TORC1 activation.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1616-1621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, fat-bodies were dissected from 3rd instar wandering larvae and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing LysoTracker Red DND-99 (1:500) (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then washed two times with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Samples were then washed three times with PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 before incubating with rabbit anti-HA primary antibodies (Cell Signaling) at 4 °C overnight. The tissues were then washed and probed with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit) (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Samples were mounted on glass slide with Vectashield Mounting Media containing DAPI (Vector Labs). Images were taken using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope system. For pupal lethality analysis, hTRPML1::HA was expressed in the trpml1 neurons using a pan-neuronal GAL4 driver (elav-GAL4) as described (26.Venkatachalam K. Long A.A. Elsaesser R. Nikolaeva D.

The numbers of eclosed pupal cases and uneclosed, or partially eclosed, pupae after metamorphosis were counted to determine pupal lethality. HEK293 cells were cultured as previously described (30.Xiao R. Tang J. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tian J. Zhu M.X.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14640-14645Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown overnight in wells of a 12-well plate to 40–50% confluence. The desired plasmid (0.5 μg) was diluted in 50 μl normal saline (150 mm NaCl, sterile) and then mixed with 4 μl of deacylated PEI (25 mm) by vortexing. After incubation at the room temperature for 10 min, the DNA/PEI mixture was added dropwise to the cultured cells while the plate was gently rocked throughout the process to allow even distribution of the DNA/PEI complex. The plate was then returned to the culture incubator. The cells were reseeded 16–20 h later on poly-ornithine coated glass coverslips and used within 4–24 h for fluorescence imaging or electrophysiological studies. Cells co-transfected with TRPML-EGFP and Lamp1-mCherry grown on glass coverslips were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and rinsed in PBS. The coverslip was mounted on a glass slide using fluorogel (with Tris buffer) mounting media (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Fluorescence images were taken using a Nikon eclipse Ti laser scanning confocal microscope system. To document the enlarged endolysosomal vacuoles, cells transiently transfected with TRPML-EGFP grown on glass coverslips were treated overnight with vacuolin-1 (1 μm). DIC and epifluorescence images were taken using a 63× water-immersed lens from an upright Olympus BX51WI fluorescence microscope. For whole-cell recordings, the pipette solution contained (in mm): 135 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 4 HEPES (pH 7.2 by CsOH). Recording pipettes were pulled from standard wall borosilicate tubing with filament (Sutter Instrument) to 2–3 MΩ when filled with the pipette solution and placed in the bath. The normal Tyrode's bath solution contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 by NaOH). The low pH bath solution contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, and 10 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES), (pH 4.6 or other desired pH values by HCl or NaOH). The N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) solution contained (in mm): 140 NMDG, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 by HCl). The low sodium bath solution (LSS) contained (in mm): 150 KCl, 2 NaCl, 0.25 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 by KOH). For ion selectivity experiments, the isotonic extracellular solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 150 KCl, 150 CsCl, 100 CaCl2, or 100 MnCl2, supplemented with 10 HEPES and 10 MES (pH 4.6 by HCl). For experiments testing permeability of Fe2+ and Fe3+, the extracellular Fe2+ or Fe3+ solution contained (in mm) 50 FeCl2 or 35 FeCl3, supplemented with 10 HEPES and 10 MES and the required amount of NMDG to reach an osmolarity of 300 mOsm (pH 4.6 by HCl). Ascorbic acid (50 μm) was included in the Fe2+ solution to prevent oxidation. For whole lysosome patch clamp recordings, cells transfected with TRPML-EGFP were treated with vacuolin-1 (1 μm) overnight and then placed in the recording chamber mounted on an Olympus IX71-inverted fluorescence microscope. A sharp glass pipette mounted to a micromanipulator was used to slice through a selected EGFP-positive cell that contained enlarged green fluorescence vacuoles (see Fig. 2B). One of the vacuoles released from the cell was then picked for whole lysosome recording using a patch electrode filled with the low pH bath solution (pH 4.6) described above. For both whole lysosome and inside-out recordings, the bath solution contained (in mm): 140 K-gluconate, 4 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.39 CaCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 by KOH). The pipette for inside-out recordings contained the normal Tyrode's solution. The pipette resistance was 2–3 MΩ for inside-out patches and 4–5 MΩ for whole-lysosome recordings. The capacitance of the whole lysosomes used for recording was around 1 pF. Drugs (phosphoinositides and trivalent cations) were diluted to the final desired concentrations in the appropriate solutions and were applied via a gravity-driven perfusion system with the open end placed at about 50 μm from the sample being recorded. The solution exchange was complete within a few seconds. Data were collected by an EPC9 or EPC10 amplifier using PatchMaster (HEKA electronics Inc., Germany). Cells, patches, or enlarged endolysosomes, were held at 0 mV. Currents were elicited by voltage ramps from −100 to +100 mV in 200 ms and repeated every second. For voltage steps in Fig. 3C, 1 s steps from −100 to 90 mV in 10-mV increments and with 2-s intervals were used; for voltage steps in Fig. 5D, 400 ms steps from −80 mV to +80 mV in 10-mV increments and with 1-s intervals were used. Signals were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. All experiments were conducted at the room temperature (22–23 °C).FIGURE 5Whole-cell currents of Drosophila TRPMLVa expressed in HEK293 cells and its dependence on extracytosolic pH.

These perceptions can predict adjustment and quality of life in patients with single conditions. However, multimorbidity (i.e. patients with multiple long-term conditions) is increasingly prevalent and a key challenge for future health care delivery. The objective of this research was to develop a valid and reliable measure of illness perceptions for multimorbid patients.Candidate items were derived from previous qualitative research with multimorbid patients. Questionnaires were posted to 1500 patients with two or more exemplar long-term conditions (depression, diabetes, osteoarthritis, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Data were analysed using factor analysis and Rasch analysis. Rasch analysis is a modern psychometric technique for deriving unidimensional and intervally-scaled questionnaires.Questionnaires from 490 eligible patients (32.6% response) were returned. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five potential subscales 'Emotional representations', 'Treatment burden', 'Prioritising conditions', 'Causal links' and 'Activity limitations'. Rasch analysis led to further item reduction and the generation of a summary scale comprising of items from all scales. All scales were unidimensional and free from differential item functioning or local independence of items. All scales were reliable, but for each subscale there were a number of patients who scored at the floor of the scale.The MULTIPleS measure consists of five individual subscales and a 22-item summary scale that measures the perceived impact of multimorbidity. All scales showed good fit to the Rasch model and preliminary evidence of reliability and validity. A number of patients scored at floor of each subscale, which may reflect variation in the perception of multimorbidity. The MULTIPleS measure will facilitate research into the impact of illness perceptions on adjustment, clinical outcomes, quality of life, and costs in patients with multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W1970066961,"Pyrethroid insecticides induce an excito-repellent effect that reduces contact between humans and mosquitoes. Insecticide use is expected to lower the risk of pathogen transmission, particularly when impregnated on long-lasting treated bednets. When applied at low doses, pyrethroids have a toxic effect, however the development of pyrethroid resistance in several mosquito species may jeopardize these beneficial effects. The need to find additional compounds, either to kill disease-carrying mosquitoes or to prevent mosquito contact with humans, therefore arises. In laboratory conditions, the effects (i.e., repellent, irritant and toxic) of 20 plant extracts, mainly essential oils, were assessed on adults of Anopheles gambiae, a primary vector of malaria. Their effects were compared to those of DEET and permethrin, used as positive controls. Most plant extracts had irritant, repellent and/or toxic effects on An. gambiae adults. The most promising extracts, i.e. those combining the three types of effects, were from Cymbopogon winterianus, Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Thymus vulgaris. The irritant, repellent and toxic effects occurred apparently independently of each other, and the behavioural response of adult An. gambiae was significantly influenced by the concentration of the plant extracts. Mechanisms underlying repellency might, therefore, differ from those underlying irritancy and toxicity. The utility of the efficient plant extracts for vector control as an alternative to pyrethroids may thus be envisaged."
https://openalex.org/W1972918997,"The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of acute chronic gastritis and the development of stomach and duodenal ulcers. Chronic infection furthermore predisposes to the development of gastric cancer. Crucial to H. pylori survival within the hostile environment of the digestive system are the adhesins SabA and BabA; these molecules belong to the same protein family and permit the bacteria to bind tightly to sugar moieties Lewis(B) and sialyl-Lewis(X), respectively, on the surface of epithelial cells lining the stomach and duodenum. To date, no representative SabA/BabA structure has been determined, hampering the development of strategies to eliminate persistent H. pylori infections that fail to respond to conventional therapy. Here, using x-ray crystallography, we show that the soluble extracellular adhesin domain of SabA shares distant similarity to the tetratricopeptide repeat fold family. The molecule broadly resembles a golf putter in shape, with the head region featuring a large cavity surrounded by loops that vary in sequence between different H. pylori strains. The N-terminal and C-terminal helices protrude at right angles from the head domain and together form a shaft that connects to a predicted outer membrane protein-like β-barrel trans-membrane domain. Using surface plasmon resonance, we were able to detect binding of the SabA adhesin domain to sialyl-Lewis(X) and Lewis(X) but not to Lewis(A), Lewis(B), or Lewis(Y). Substitution of the highly conserved glutamine residue 159 in the predicted ligand-binding pocket abrogates the binding of the SabA adhesin domain to sialyl-Lewis(X) and Lewis(X). Taken together, these data suggest that the adhesin domain of SabA is sufficient in isolation for specific ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1977675309,"Malaria infection accounts for over one million deaths worldwide annually. India has the highest number of malaria deaths outside Africa, with half among Indian tribal communities. Our study sought to identify barriers to malaria control within tribal populations in malaria-endemic Gadchiroli district, Maharashtra.This qualitative study was conducted via focus groups and interviews with 84 participants, and included tribal villagers, traditional healers, community health workers (CHWs), medical officers, and district officials. Questions assessed knowledge about malaria, behavior during early stages of infection, and experiences with prevention among tribal villagers and traditional healers. CHWs, medical officers, and district officials were asked about barriers to treating and preventing malaria among tribal populations. Data were inductively analyzed and assembled into broader explanation linking barriers to geographical, cultural and social factors. Findings indicate lack of knowledge regarding malaria symptoms and transmission. Fever cases initially present to traditional healers or informal providers who have little knowledge of malaria or high-risk groups such as children and pregnant women. Tribal adherence with antimalarial medications is poor. Malaria prevention is inadequate, with low-density and inconsistent use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Malaria educational materials are culturally inappropriate, relying on dominant language literacy. Remote villages and lack of transport complicate surveillance by CHWs. Costs of treating malaria outside the village are high.Geographic, cultural, and social factors create barriers to malaria control among tribal communities in India. Efforts to decrease malaria burden among these populations must consider such realities. Our results suggest improving community-level knowledge about malaria using culturally-appropriate health education materials; making traditional healers partners in malaria control; promoting within-village rapid diagnosis and treatment; increasing ITN distribution and promoting their use as potential strategies to decrease infection rates in these communities. These insights may be used to shape malaria control programs among marginalized populations."
https://openalex.org/W2042279414,"Interaction of collagen with fibronectin is important for extracellular matrix assembly and regulation of cellular processes. A fibronectin-binding region in collagen was identified using unfolded fragments, but it is not clear if the native protein binds fibronectin with the same primary sequence. A recombinant bacterial collagen is utilized to characterize the sequence requirement for fibronectin binding. Chimeric collagens were generated by inserting the putative fibronectin-binding region from human collagen into the bacterial collagen sequence. Insertion of a sufficient length of human sequence conferred fibronectin affinity. The minimum sequence requirement was identified as a 6-triplet sequence near the unique collagenase cleavage site and was the same in both triple-helix and denatured states. Denaturation of the chimeric collagen increased its affinity for fibronectin, as seen for mammalian collagens. The fibronectin binding recombinant collagen did not contain hydroxyproline, indicating hydroxyproline is not essential for binding. However, its absence may account, in part, for the higher affinity of the native chimeric protein and the lower affinity of the denatured protein compared with type II collagen. Megakaryocytes cultured on chimeric collagen with fibronectin affinity showed improved adhesion and differentiation, suggesting a strategy for generating bioactive materials in biomedical applications."

Inhibitor binding into the second AAA domain of Drg1 requires ATP loading and results in inhibition of ATP hydrolysis in this site. As a consequence the physiological activity of Drg1, i.e. the release of Rlp24 from pre-60S particles, is blocked, and further progression of cytoplasmic preribosome maturation is prevented.

https://openalex.org/W2063878016,"The Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) controls the expression of many genes involved in the plant's response to dehydration and heat stress. Despite the significance of post-translational regulation in DREB2A activation, the mechanism underlying this activation remains unclear. Here, with the aid of a newly produced antibody against DREB2A, we characterized the regulation of DREB2A stability in plants exposed to stress stimuli. Endogenous DREB2A accumulated in wild-type Arabidopsis plants subjected to dehydration and heat stress. A degradation assay using Arabidopsis T87 suspension-cultured cells revealed that DREB2A protein degradation was inhibited at high temperatures. The proteasome-dependent degradation of DREB2A required the import of this protein into the nucleus. The E3 ligases DRIP1 and DRIP2 were involved in this process under both normal and stressful conditions; however, other E3 ligases may have also been involved, at least during the late stages of the heat stress response. Although the constitutive expression of DREB2A resulted in an overproduction of DREB2A and enhanced target gene induction during stress in transgenic plants, the accumulation of DREB2A caused by proteasome inhibitors did not induce target gene expression. Thus, the stabilization of DREB2A is important but not sufficient to induce target gene expression; further activation processes are required."

However, the colonic mucosa is permanently in contact with the microbiota and its metabolic products including toxins that also have the potential to trigger oncogenic transformation.To analyze fecal DNA for microbiota composition and functional potential in African Americans with pre-neoplastic lesions.We analyzed the bacterial composition of stool samples from 6 healthy individuals and 6 patients with colon polyps using 16S ribosomal RNA-based phylogenetic microarray; the Human intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) and 16S rRNA gene barcoded 454 pyrosequencing. The functional potential was determined by sequence-based metagenomics using 454 pyrosequencing.Fecal microbiota profiling of samples from the healthy and polyp patients using both a phylogenetic microarraying (HITChip) and barcoded 454 pyrosequencing generated similar results. A distinction between both sets of samples was only obtained when the analysis was performed at the sub-genus level. Most of the species leading to the dissociation were from the Bacteroides group. The metagenomic analysis did not reveal major differences in bacterial gene prevalence/abundances between the two groups even when the analysis and comparisons were restricted to available Bacteroides genomes.This study reveals that at the pre-neoplastic stages, there is a trend showing microbiota changes between healthy and colon polyp patients at the sub-genus level. These differences were not reflected at the genome/functions levels. Bacteria and associated functions within the Bacteroides group need to be further analyzed and dissected to pinpoint potential actors in the early colon oncogenic transformation in a large sample size."
https://openalex.org/W1965511124,"Background Fusarium head blight (FHB), mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum, substantially reduces wheat grain yield and quality worldwide. Proteins play important roles in defense against the fungal infection. This study characterized differentially expressed proteins between near-isogenic lines (NILs) contrasting in alleles of Fhb1, a major FHB resistance gene in wheat, to identify proteins underlining FHB resistance of Fhb1. Methods The two-dimensional protein profiles were compared between the Fusarium-inoculated spikes of the two NILs collected 72 h after inoculation. The protein profiles of mock- and Fusarium-inoculated Fhb1+NIL were also compared to identify pathogen-responsive proteins. Results Eight proteins were either induced or upregulated in inoculated Fhb1+NIL when compared with mock-inoculated Fhb1+NIL; nine proteins were either induced or upregulated in the Fusarium-inoculated Fhb1+NIL when compared with Fusarium-inoculated Fhb1−NIL. Proteins that were differentially expressed in the Fhb1+NIL, not in the Fhb1−NIL, after Fusarium inoculation included wheat proteins for defending fungal penetration, photosynthesis, energy metabolism, and detoxification. Conclusions Coordinated expression of the identified proteins resulted in FHB resistance in Fhb1+NIL. The results provide insight into the pathway of Fhb1-mediated FHB resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2029386456,"Simulators are commonly used to train complex tasks. In particular, simulators are applied to train dangerous tasks, to save costs, and to investigate the impact of different factors on task performance. However, in most cases, the transfer of simulator training to the real task has not been investigated. Without a proof for successful skill transfer, simulators might not be helpful at all or even counter-productive for learning the real task. In this paper, the skill transfer of complex technical aspects trained on a scull rowing simulator to sculling on water was investigated. We assume if a simulator provides high fidelity rendering of the interactions with the environment even without augmented feedback, training on such a realistic simulator would allow similar skill gains as training in the real environment. These learned skills were expected to transfer to the real environment. Two groups of four recreational rowers participated. One group trained on water, the other group trained on a simulator. Within two weeks, both groups performed four training sessions with the same licensed rowing trainer. The development in performance was assessed by quantitative biomechanical performance measures and by a qualitative video evaluation of an independent, blinded trainer. In general, both groups could improve their performance on water. The used biomechanical measures seem to allow only a limited insight into the rowers' development, while the independent trainer could also rate the rowers' overall impression. The simulator quality and naturalism was confirmed by the participants in a questionnaire. In conclusion, realistic simulator training fostered skill gains to a similar extent as training in the real environment and enabled skill transfer to the real environment. In combination with augmented feedback, simulator training can be further exploited to foster motor learning even to a higher extent, which is subject to future work."
https://openalex.org/W2119815941,"Ras mutations are frequent in cancer cells where they drive proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. However in primary cells, mutant Ras instead can cause oncogene-induced senescence, a tumor suppressor function linked to repression of the polycomb factor Bmi1, which normally regulates cell cycle inhibitory cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (cdki). It is unclear how Ras causes repression of Bmi1 in primary cells to suppress tumor formation while inducing the gene in cancer cells to drive tumor progression. Ras also induces the EMT transcription factor ZEB1 to trigger tumor invasion and metastasis. Beyond its well-documented role in EMT, ZEB1 is important for maintaining repression of cdki. Indeed, heterozygous mutation of ZEB1 is sufficient for elevated cdki expression, leading to premature senescence of primary cells. A similar phenotype is evident with Bmi1 mutation. We show that activation of Rb1 in response to mutant Ras causes dominant repression of ZEB1 in primary cells, but loss of the Rb1 pathway is a hallmark of cancer cells and in the absence of such Rb1 repression Ras induces ZEB1 in cancer cells. ZEB1 represses miR-200 in the context of a mutual repression loop. Because miR-200 represses Bmi1, induction of ZEB1 leads to induction of Bmi1. Rb1 pathway status then dictates the opposing effects of mutant Ras on the ZEB1-miR-200 loop in primary versus cancer cells. This loop not only triggers EMT, surprisingly we show it acts downstream of Ras to regulate Bmi1 expression and thus the critical decision between oncogene-induced senescence and tumor initiation."

We previously demonstrated that nucleolar stress induces translocation of the nucleolar protein MYBBP1A from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and enhances p53 activity. However, whether and how MYBBP1A regulates p53 tetramerization in response to nucleolar stress remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that MYBBP1A enhances p53 tetramerization, followed by acetylation under nucleolar stress. We found that MYBBP1A has two regions that directly bind to lysine residues of the p53 C-terminal regulatory domain. MYBBP1A formed a self-assembled complex that provided a molecular platform for p53 tetramerization and enhanced p300-mediated acetylation of the p53 tetramer. Moreover, our results show that MYBBP1A functions to enhance p53 tetramerization that is necessary for p53 activation, followed by cell death with actinomycin D treatment. Thus, we suggest that MYBBP1A plays a pivotal role in the cellular stress response.

https://openalex.org/W1990874223,"Programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) has been proposed to act as a pro-apoptotic factor and tumor suppressor. However, the mechanisms underlying its apoptotic function are largely unknown. A proteomics search for binding partners of phosducin-like protein, a co-chaperone for the cytosolic chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide 1 (CCT), revealed a robust interaction between PDCD5 and CCT. PDCD5 formed a complex with CCT and β-tubulin, a key CCT-folding substrate, and specifically inhibited β-tubulin folding. Cryo-electron microscopy studies of the PDCD5·CCT complex suggested a possible mechanism of inhibition of β-tubulin folding. PDCD5 bound the apical domain of the CCTβ subunit, projecting above the folding cavity without entering it. Like PDCD5, β-tubulin also interacts with the CCTβ apical domain, but a second site is found at the sensor loop deep within the folding cavity. These orientations of PDCD5 and β-tubulin suggest that PDCD5 sterically interferes with β-tubulin binding to the CCTβ apical domain and inhibits β-tubulin folding. Given the importance of tubulins in cell division and proliferation, PDCD5 might exert its apoptotic function at least in part through inhibition of β-tubulin folding."
https://openalex.org/W2017789562,"Structural characterization of the human Y4 receptor (hY4R) interaction with human pancreatic polypeptide (hPP) is crucial, not only for understanding its biological function but also for testing treatment strategies for obesity that target this interaction. Here, the interaction of receptor mutants with pancreatic polypeptide analogs was studied through double-cycle mutagenesis. To guide mutagenesis and interpret results, a three-dimensional comparative model of the hY4R-hPP complex was constructed based on all available class A G protein-coupled receptor crystal structures and refined using experimental data. Our study reveals that residues of the hPP and the hY4R form a complex network consisting of ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen binding. Residues Tyr(2.64), Asp(2.68), Asn(6.55), Asn(7.32), and Phe(7.35) of Y4R are found to be important in receptor activation by hPP. Specifically, Tyr(2.64) interacts with Tyr(27) of hPP through hydrophobic contacts. Asn(7.32) is affected by modifications on position Arg(33) of hPP, suggesting a hydrogen bond between these two residues. Likewise, we find that Phe(7.35) is affected by modifications of hPP at positions 33 and 36, indicating interactions between these three amino acids. Taken together, we demonstrate that the top of transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) and the top of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 (TM6-TM7) form the core of the peptide binding pocket. These findings will contribute to the rational design of ligands that bind the receptor more effectively to produce an enhanced agonistic or antagonistic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2056715169,"Autologous c-kit(+) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) are currently used in the clinic to treat heart disease. CPC-based regeneration may be further augmented by better understanding molecular mechanisms of endogenous cardiac repair and enhancement of pro-survival signaling pathways that antagonize senescence while also increasing differentiation. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates multiple signaling cascades by modulating protein folding and thereby activity and stability of phosphoproteins. In this study, we examine the heretofore unexplored role of Pin1 in CPCs. Pin1 is expressed in CPCs in vitro and in vivo and is associated with increased proliferation. Pin1 is required for cell cycle progression and loss of Pin1 causes cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase in CPCs, concomitantly associated with decreased expression of Cyclins D and B and increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb). Pin1 deletion increases cellular senescence but not differentiation or cell death of CPCs. Pin1 is required for endogenous CPC response as Pin1 knock-out mice have a reduced number of proliferating CPCs after ischemic challenge. Pin1 overexpression also impairs proliferation and causes G2/M phase cell cycle arrest with concurrent down-regulation of Cyclin B, p53, and Rb. Additionally, Pin1 overexpression inhibits replicative senescence, increases differentiation, and inhibits cell death of CPCs, indicating that cell cycle arrest caused by Pin1 overexpression is a consequence of differentiation and not senescence or cell death. In conclusion, Pin1 has pleiotropic roles in CPCs and may be a molecular target to promote survival, enhance repair, improve differentiation, and antagonize senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1978634585,"Subretinal fibrosis is directly related to severe visual loss, especially if occurs in the macula, and is frequently observed in advanced age-related macular degeneration and other refractory eye disorders such as diabetic retinopathy and uveitis. In this study, we analyzed the immunosuppressive mechanism of subretinal fibrosis using the novel animal model recently demonstrated. Both TLR2 and TLR4 deficient mice showed significant enlargement of subretinal fibrotic area as compared with wild-type mice. A single intraocular administration of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which is an endogenous ligand for TLR2 and TLR4, inhibited subretinal fibrosis in wild-type mice but not in TLR2 and TLR4-deficient mice. Additionally, HSP70 induced IL-10 production in eyes from wild-type mice but was impaired in both TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice, indicating that HSP70-TLR2/TLR4 axis plays an immunomodulatory role in subretinal fibrosis. Thus, these results suggest that HSP70-TLR2/TLR4 axis is a new therapeutic target for subretinal fibrosis due to prognostic CNV."
https://openalex.org/W2039675300,"Several tumour types are sensitive to deactivation of just one or very few genes that are constantly active in the cancer cells, a phenomenon that is termed 'oncogene addiction'. Drugs that target the products of those oncogenes can yield a temporary relief, and even complete remission. Unfortunately, many patients receiving oncogene-targeted therapies relapse on treatment. This often happens due to somatic mutations in the oncogene ('resistance mutations'). 'Compound mutations', which in the context of cancer drug resistance are defined as two or more mutations of the drug target in the same clone may lead to enhanced resistance against the most selective inhibitors. Here, it is shown that the vast majority of the resistance mutations occurring in cancer patients treated with tyrosin kinase inhibitors aimed at three different proteins follow an evolutionary pathway. Using bioinformatic analysis tools, it is found that the drug-resistance mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains of Abl1, ALK and exons 20 and 21 of EGFR favour transformations to residues that can be identified in similar positions in evolutionary related proteins. The results demonstrate that evolutionary pressure shapes the mutational landscape in the case of drug-resistance somatic mutations. The constraints on the mutational landscape suggest that it may be possible to counter single drug-resistance point mutations. The observation of relatively many resistance mutations in Abl1, but not in the other genes, is explained by the fact that mutations in Abl1 tend to be biochemically conservative, whereas mutations in EGFR and ALK tend to be radical. Analysis of Abl1 compound mutations suggests that such mutations are more prevalent than hitherto reported and may be more difficult to counter. This supports the notion that such mutations may provide an escape route for targeted cancer drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2043497635,"Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5, PPP5C) is known to interact with the chaperonin heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and is involved in the regulation of multiple cellular signaling cascades that control diverse cellular processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, motility, and apoptosis. Here, we identify PP5 in stable complexes with extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Studies using mutant proteins reveal that the formation of PP5·ERK1 and PP5·ERK2 complexes partially depends on HSP90 binding to PP5 but does not require PP5 or ERK1/2 activity. However, PP5 and ERK activity regulates the phosphorylation state of Raf1 kinase, an upstream activator of ERK signaling. Whereas expression of constitutively active Rac1 promotes the assembly of PP5·ERK1/2 complexes, acute activation of ERK1/2 fails to influence the phosphatase-kinase interaction. Introduction of oncogenic HRas (HRas(V12)) has no effect on PP5-ERK1 binding but selectively decreases the interaction of PP5 with ERK2, in a manner that is independent of PP5 and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) activity, yet paradoxically requires ERK2 activity. Additional studies conducted with oncogenic variants of KRas4B reveal that KRas(L61), but not KRas(V12), also decreases the PP5-ERK2 interaction. The expression of wild type HRas or KRas proteins fails to reduce PP5-ERK2 binding, indicating that the effect is specific to HRas(V12) and KRas(L61) gain-of-function mutations. These findings reveal a novel, differential responsiveness of PP5-ERK1 and PP5-ERK2 interactions to select oncogenic Ras variants and also support a role for PP5·ERK complexes in regulating the feedback phosphorylation of PP5-associated Raf1."
https://openalex.org/W2158005747,"Two basic strategies have been proposed for using transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to decrease dengue virus transmission: population reduction and population replacement. Here we model releases of a strain of Ae. aegypti carrying both a gene causing conditional adult female mortality and a gene blocking virus transmission into a wild population to assess whether such releases could reduce the number of competent vectors. We find this ""reduce and replace"" strategy can decrease the frequency of competent vectors below 50% two years after releases end. Therefore, this combined approach appears preferable to releasing a strain carrying only a female-killing gene, which is likely to merely result in temporary population suppression. However, the fixation of anti-pathogen genes in the population is unlikely. Genetic drift at small population sizes and the spatially heterogeneous nature of the population recovery after releases end prevent complete replacement of the competent vector population. Furthermore, releasing more individuals can be counter-productive in the face of immigration by wild-type mosquitoes, as greater population reduction amplifies the impact wild-type migrants have on the long-term frequency of the anti-pathogen gene. We expect the results presented here to give pause to expectations for driving an anti-pathogen construct to fixation by relying on releasing individuals carrying this two-gene construct. Nevertheless, in some dengue-endemic environments, a spatially heterogeneous decrease in competent vectors may still facilitate decreasing disease incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2160687904,"GM-CSF is an endogenous pulmonary cytokine produced by normal alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) that is a key defender of the alveolar space. AEC GM-CSF expression is suppressed by oxidative stress through alternations in mRNA turnover, an effect that is reversed by treatment with recombinant GM-CSF. We hypothesized that specific microRNA (miRNA) would play a key role in AEC GM-CSF regulation. A genome-wide miRNA microarray identified 19 candidate miRNA altered in primary AEC during oxidative stress with reversal by treatment with GM-CSF. Three of these miRNA (miR 133a, miR 133a*, and miR 133b) are also predicted to bind the GM-CSF 3'-untranslated region (UTR). PCR for the mature miRNA confirmed induction during oxidative stress that was reversed by treatment with GM-CSF. Experiments using a GM-CSF 3'-UTR reporter construct demonstrated that miR133a and miR133b effects on GM-CSF expression are through interactions with the GM-CSF 3'-UTR. Using lentiviral transduction of specific mimics and inhibitors in primary murine AEC, we determined that miR133a and miR133b suppress GM-CSF expression and that their inhibition both reverses oxidant-induced suppression of GM-CSF expression and increases basal expression of GM-CSF in cells in normoxia. In contrast, these miRNAs are not active in regulation of GM-CSF expression in murine EL4 T cells. Thus, members of the miR133 family play key roles in regulation of GM-CSF expression through effects on mRNA turnover in AEC during oxidative stress. Increased understanding of GM-CSF gene regulation may provide novel miRNA-based interventions to augment pulmonary innate immune defense in lung injury."

Here, we cloned four novel caspases (Lvcaspase2-5) from the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, and investigated their potential roles in WSSV replication using dsRNA-mediated gene silencing. Lvcaspase2-5 have the typical domain structure of caspase family proteins, with the conserved consensus motifs p20 and p10. Lvcaspase2 and Lvcaspase5 were highly expressed in muscle, while Lvcaspase3 was highly expressed in hemocytes and Lvcaspase4 was mainly expressed in intestine. Lvcaspase2-5 could also be upregulated by WSSV infection, and they showed different patterns in various tissues. When overexpressed in Drosophila S2 cells, Lvcaspase2-5 showed different cellular localizations. Using dsRNA-medicated gene silencing, the expression of Lvcaspase2, Lvcaspase3, and Lvcaspase5 were effectively knocked down. In Lvcaspase2-, Lvcaspase3- or Lvcaspase5-silenced L. vannamei, expression of WSSV VP28 gene was significantly enhanced, suggesting protective roles for Lvcaspase2, Lvcaspase3 and Lvcaspase5 in the host defense against WSSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2148914218,"TMPRSS6 is a regulated gene, with a crucial role in the regulation of iron homeostasis by inhibiting hepcidin expression. The main regulator of iron homeostasis, the antimicrobial peptide hepcidin, which also has a role in immunity, is directly upregulated by inflammation. In this study, we analyzed whether inflammation is also a modulator of TMPRSS6 expression in vitro and in vivo and we determined the mechanism of this regulation A Human Hepatoma cell line was treated with interleukin-6 and mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide and TMPRSS6 expression and the regulatory mechanism were addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that inflammation downregulates TMPRSS6 expression in vitro and in vivo. The downregulation of Tmprss6 by inflammation in mice is not dependent on the Bmp-Smad pathway but occurs through a decrease in Stat5 phosphorylation. Moreover, Stat5 positively regulates Tmprss6 expression directly by binding to a Stat5 element located on the Tmprss6 promoter. Importantly, our results highlight the functional role of inflammatory modulation of TMPRSS6 expression in the regulation of hepcidin. TMPRSS6 inhibition via decreased STAT5 phosphorylation may be an additional mechanism by which inflammation stimulates hepcidin expression to regulate iron homeostasis and immunity."

https://openalex.org/W1963864629,"Direct sequencing remains the most widely used method for the detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung cancer; however, its relatively low sensitivity limits its clinical use. The objective of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of detecting an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation from peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PNA-LNA PCR) clamp and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) techniques compared to that by direct sequencing. Furthermore, the predictive efficacy of EGFR mutations detected by PNA-LNA PCR clamp was evaluated. EGFR mutational status was assessed by direct sequencing, PNA-LNA PCR clamp, and Ion Torrent PGM in 57 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated the predictive efficacy of PNA-LNA PCR clamp on the EGFR-TKI treatment in 36 patients with advanced NSCLC retrospectively. Compared to direct sequencing (16/57, 28.1%), PNA-LNA PCR clamp (27/57, 47.4%) and Ion Torrent PGM (26/57, 45.6%) detected more EGFR mutations. EGFR mutant patients had significantly longer progressive free survival (14.31 vs. 21.61 months, P = 0.003) than that of EGFR wild patients when tested with PNA-LNA PCR clamp. However, no difference in response rate to EGFR TKIs (75.0% vs. 82.4%, P = 0.195) or overall survival (34.39 vs. 44.10 months, P = 0.422) was observed between the EGFR mutations by direct sequencing or PNA-LNA PCR clamp. Our results demonstrate firstly that patients with EGFR mutations were detected more frequently by PNA-LNA PCR clamp and Ion Torrent PGM than those by direct sequencing. EGFR mutations detected by PNA-LNA PCR clamp may be as a predicative factor for EGFR TKI response in patients with NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2076629023,"Patients with akinesia benefit from chronic high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Among the mechanisms contributing to the therapeutic success of HFS-STN might be a suppression of activity in the output region of the basal ganglia. Indeed, recordings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) of fully adult mice revealed that HFS-STN consistently produced a reduction of compound glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents at a time when the tetrodotoxin-sensitive components of the local field potentials had already recovered after the high frequency activation. These observations suggest that HFS-STN not only alters action potential conduction on the way towards the SNr but also modifies synaptic transmission within the SNr. A classical conditioning-test paradigm was then designed to better separate the causes from the indicators of synaptic depression. A bipolar platinum-iridium macroelectrode delivered conditioning HFS trains to a larger group of fibers in the STN, while a separate high-ohmic glass micropipette in the rostral SNr provided test stimuli at minimal intensity to single fibers. The conditioning-test interval was set to 100 ms, i.e. the time required to recover the excitability of subthalamo-nigral axons after HFS-STN. The continuity of STN axons passing from the conditioning to the test sites was examined by an action potential occlusion test. About two thirds of the subthalamo-nigral afferents were occlusion-negative, i.e. they were not among the fibers directly activated by the conditioning STN stimulation. Nonetheless, occlusion-negative afferents exhibited signs of presynaptic depression that could be eliminated by blocking GABA(B) receptors with CGP55845 (1 µM). Further analysis of single fiber-activated responses supported the proposal that the heterosynaptic depression of synaptic glutamate release during and after HFS-STN is mainly caused by the tonic release of GABA from co-activated striato-nigral afferents to the SNr. This mechanism would be consistent with a gain-of-function hypothesis of DBS."

A number of 13 metabolites have been identified and quantified from cerebrospinal fluid collected from a group of 10 mix breed healthy dogs. The biological variability as resulting from the relative standard deviation of the physiological concentrations of the identified metabolites had a mean of 18.20% (range between 9.3% and 44.8%). The reported concentrations for metabolites may be used as normal reference values. The homogeneity of the obtained results and the low biologic variability show that the 1H NMR analysis of the dog’s cerebrospinal fluid is reliable in designing and interpreting clinical and therapeutic trials in dogs with central nervous system pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2038535332,"Background In centenarian populations, application of the positive biology approach (examination of positive phenotypes in aging) has revealed that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation accumulation may be linked to human longevity; however, the role of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) abnormalities modulated by G-protein beta-3 (GNB3) and nitrate (NO2) production associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), commonly appearing in age-related diseases, remains undetermined. Objective The association between the mtDNA 5178A/C, mtDNA 10398A/G, GNB3 C825T, and eNOS polymorphisms and longevity in a Uygur population (Xinjiang region, China) were investigated. Methods A total of 275 experimental subjects aged ≥100 or with 4 generations currently living were screened for inclusion in the centenarian (>100 years) and nonagenarian groups (90–100 years), and 112 65–70 year old control subjects were selected. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to examine mtDNA 5178A/C, mtDNA 10398A/G, GNB3 C825T, and eNOS. Associations between polymorphic loci, genotypes, and longevity were analyzed. Results 165 included subjects (M∶F = 107∶58; mean age = 97±3 years; mean age 100–113 years) were assigned to the centenarian (M∶F = 46/19; n = 65) and nonagenarian groups (M∶F = 61/39; n = 100). Associations between mtDNA C5178A and A10398G polymorphisms with longevity in the centenarian group with mtDNA genotype frequencies 5178A and 10398G were 66.79% and 36.8%. Conclusions Applying the overwhelming longevity observed in Uygur populations, these findings demonstrate that mtDNA 5178A/C and 10398A/G, GNB3 C825T, and eNOS polymorphisms are useful as a genetic basis for longevity."

The present study observed gene-gene combination effect and interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCA1, APOA1, SR-B1, and CETP in serum HDL-C from a cross-sectional study in the Japanese population. Methods The study population comprised 1,535 men and 1,515 women aged 35–69 years who were enrolled in the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study. We selected 13 SNPs in the ABCA1, APOA1, CETP, and SR-B1 genes in the reverse cholesterol transport system. The effects of genetic and environmental factors were assessed using general linear and logistic regression models after adjusting for age, sex, and region. Principal Findings Alcohol consumption and daily activity were positively associated with HDL-C levels, whereas smoking had a negative relationship. The T allele of CETP, rs3764261, was correlated with higher HDL-C levels and had the highest coefficient (2.93 mg/dL/allele) among the 13 SNPs, which was statistically significant after applying the Bonferroni correction (p<0.001). Gene-gene combination analysis revealed that CETP rs3764261 was associated with high HDL-C levels with any combination of SNPs from ABCA1, APOA1, and SR-B1, although no gene-gene interaction was apparent. An increasing trend for serum HDL-C was also observed with an increasing number of alleles (p<0.001). Conclusions The present study identified a multiplier effect from a polymorphism in CETP with ABCA1, APOA1, and SR-B1, as well as a dose-dependence according to the number of alleles present."
https://openalex.org/W2077756064,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a multifunctional protein as well as a classic glycolytic enzyme, and its pleiotropic functions are achieved by various post-translational modifications and the resulting translocations to intracellular compartments. In the present study, GAPDH in the plasma membrane of BeWo choriocarcinoma cells displayed a striking acidic shift in two-dimensional electrophoresis after cell-cell fusion induction by forskolin. This post-translational modification was deamidation of multiple glutaminyl residues, as determined by molecular mass measurement and tandem mass spectrometry of acidic GAPDH isoforms. Transglutaminase (TG) inhibitors prevented this acidic shift and reduced cell fusion. Knockdown of the TG2 gene by short hairpin RNA reproduced these effects of TG inhibitors. Various GAPDH mutants with replacement of different numbers (one to seven) of Gln by Glu were expressed in BeWo cells. These deamidated mutants reversed the suppressive effect of wild-type GAPDH overexpression on cell fusion. Interestingly, the mutants accumulated in the plasma membrane, and this accumulation was increased according to the number of Gln/Glu substitutions. Considering that GAPDH binds F-actin via an electrostatic interaction and that the cytoskeleton is rearranged in trophoblastic cell fusion, TG2-dependent GAPDH deamidation was suggested to participate in actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a multifunctional protein as well as a classic glycolytic enzyme, and its pleiotropic functions are achieved by various post-translational modifications and the resulting translocations to intracellular compartments. In the present study, GAPDH in the plasma membrane of BeWo choriocarcinoma cells displayed a striking acidic shift in two-dimensional electrophoresis after cell-cell fusion induction by forskolin. This post-translational modification was deamidation of multiple glutaminyl residues, as determined by molecular mass measurement and tandem mass spectrometry of acidic GAPDH isoforms. Transglutaminase (TG) inhibitors prevented this acidic shift and reduced cell fusion. Knockdown of the TG2 gene by short hairpin RNA reproduced these effects of TG inhibitors. Various GAPDH mutants with replacement of different numbers (one to seven) of Gln by Glu were expressed in BeWo cells. These deamidated mutants reversed the suppressive effect of wild-type GAPDH overexpression on cell fusion. Interestingly, the mutants accumulated in the plasma membrane, and this accumulation was increased according to the number of Gln/Glu substitutions. Considering that GAPDH binds F-actin via an electrostatic interaction and that the cytoskeleton is rearranged in trophoblastic cell fusion, TG2-dependent GAPDH deamidation was suggested to participate in actin cytoskeletal remodeling. The placenta is a vital organ for feto-maternal exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products. These functions are carried out mainly by the trophoblasts covering chorionic villi, which are exposed to maternal blood flow into the intervillous space. Trophoblasts are composed of syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts. The former is a terminally differentiated multinucleated cell without generative potency. It is formed by fusion of a cytotrophoblast, which is present between a syncytiotrophoblast and its basement membrane. Syncytiotrophoblasts are continuously supplied with cellular materials, such as enzymes, organelles, and nucleic acids derived from fusing with a cytotrophoblast. The cell-cell fusion or the syncytial formation of trophoblasts is regulated by numerous factors, such as growth factors, membrane proteins, proteases, physicochemical factors, and membrane architecture. One of the major players in the downstream signaling for cell fusion is protein kinase A (PKA), and this pathway has been largely delineated in vitro using the choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo. Treatment with cyclic AMP (cAMP) or agents such as forskolin (1.Wice B. Menton D. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. Modulators of cyclic AMP metabolism induce syncytiotrophoblast formation in vitro.Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) induces BeWo cell fusion. Forskolin increases intracellular cAMP levels by activating adenylyl cyclase and activates PKA. In turn, PKA activates transcription factors such as GCMα (glial cell missing α) (2.Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Wegner M.

In addition to the cAMP/PKA pathway, two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, ERK1/2 and p38, are suggested to mediate trophoblast cell fusion and differentiation downstream from epidermal growth factor receptor activation. Induction of these MAPKs activates the PPARγ/RXRα signal directly regulating syncytin-1 for cell fusion (10.Ruebner M. Langbein M. Strissel P.L. Henke C. Schmidt D. Goecke T.W. Faschingbauer F.

Although syncytin is a key factor mediating cell fusion of cytotrophoblasts, many other proteins and signaling pathways, including those involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and degradation of adhesion proteins, also participate in trophoblast fusion, and the whole picture of the syncytialization process is not yet completely understood. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) is a multifunctional protein with diverse activities. Besides its classic function in glycolysis, this enzyme is directly involved in gene regulation, vesicular transport, cell signaling, chromatin structure, DNA repair, autophagy, and apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 11.Sirover M.A. On the functional diversity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Biochemical mechanisms and regulatory control.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1810: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To exert these functions, GAPDH undergoes dynamic changes in subcellular localization and post-translational modification as well as in its interaction with other proteins. For example, upon exposure to oxidative stress, GAPDH is S-nitrosylated at its active site, cysteine, and this S-nitrosylation increases binding of GAPDH to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Siah1 (12.Hara M.R. Agrawal N. Kim S.F. Cascio M.B. Fujimuro M. Ozeki Y. Takahashi M. Cheah J.H. Tankou S.K. Hester L.D. Ferris C.D. Hayward S.D. Snyder S.H. Sawa A. S-Nitrosylated GAPDH initiates apoptotic cell death by nuclear translocation following Siah1 binding.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The GAPDH-Siah1 complex stabilizes Siah1, whose nuclear localization signal mediates translocation of GAPDH, facilitating the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of nuclear proteins and thereby apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, the GAPDH-Siah1 complex binds to p300/CBP to form a second nuclear protein complex and triggers a pleiotropic cascade involving p53, Bax, and p21 (13.Sen N. Hara M.R. Kornberg M.D. Cascio M.B. Bae B.I. Shahani N. Thomas B. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Snyder S.H. Sawa A. Nitric oxide-induced nuclear GAPDH activates p300/CBP and mediates apoptosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the present study, GAPDH was deamidated at multiple glutaminyl residues during BeWo cell fusion. This post-translational modification was catalyzed by transglutaminase 2 (TG2 2The abbreviations used are: TGtransglutaminaseA-PMapical plasma membraneESIelectrospray ionizationEYFPenhanced yellow fluorescent proteinIPGimmobilized pH gradientPMCplasma membrane coating2-DEtwo-dimensional electrophoresis7QEGAPDH mutant in which all Gln residues are replaced with Glu (Q48E/Q78E/Q113E/Q185E/Q204E/Q264E/Q280E). or tissue transglutaminase; EC 2.3.2.13).

The BeWo human choriocarcinoma-derived cell line was cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). To induce differentiation into a multinuclear syncytium, 25 μm forskolin (Calbiochem) was added to the medium, and the cells were incubated on type 1 collagen (BD Biosciences)-coated plates for 3 days. To inhibit TG activity, 250 μm cystamine dihydrochloride (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or 200 μm monodansylcadaverine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added 24 h after the stimulation with forskolin. The A-PM fraction was obtained using the method of Chaney and Jacobson (14.Chaney L.K. Jacobson B.S. Coating cells with colloidal silica for high yield isolation of plasma membrane sheets and identification of transmembrane proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10062-10072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, the BeWo cells were washed once with a plasma membrane coating (PMC) buffer (20 mm MES, 135 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 5.3) and incubated with 5% (w/v) cationic colloidal silica (Sigma-Aldrich) in PMC buffer on ice for 2 min for surface coating. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 35% (w/v) polyacrylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in the PMC buffer on ice for 2 min for cross-linking and neutralization of the silica surface. The cells were then lysed with 2.5 mm imidazole, and the lysate was fractionated by density gradient centrifugation using Nicodenz (Axis-Shield PoC, Oslo, Norway). The isolated A-PM proteins in 1% SDS were dialyzed against the 2-DE buffer, containing 5 m urea, 1.4 m thiourea, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and were subjected to first dimension separation by isoelectric focusing using an immobilized pH gradient (IPG) dry strip, pH 3–10 (GE Healthcare). After electrofocusing, the strip was equilibrated in an SDS-equilibrating buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, pH 8.8) and subsequently reduced and alkylated with 10 mg/ml DTT and 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide, respectively, for 15 min each at room temperature. The strip was then inserted into a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for the second dimension separation. The electrophoresed gel was stained with SYPRO Ruby (Invitrogen) to visualize the proteins. In-gel digestion was carried out according to the method of Shevchenko et al. (15.Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3521) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein spots were cut out of the 2-DE gel, and the proteins in the gel slices were then rinsed with acetonitrile. The dehydrated gels were incubated with a mixture of trypsin (modified trypsin from bovine pancrease; Promega) and lysylendopeptidase (Wako) in 50 μl of 100 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate on ice for 45 min, and the solution was then replaced by a new ammonium hydrogen carbonate solution without enzymes, followed by incubation overnight at 37 °C. The peptides were extracted from the gel employing a 5% formic acid and 50% acetonitrile solution at room temperature for 15 min and then dried with a SpeedVac concentrator (Tomy, Tokyo, Japan). The peptide samples were desalted employing a Zip-Tip (Millipore), and mixed with 20 mm 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Wako) solution on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) sample plate. Mass spectrometry (MS) was carried out with a Voyager DE-Pro time-of-flight mass spectrometer (AB Sciex), and the protein database search was performed using the MASCOT search engine (available on the Matrix Science Web site). The cell surface proteins were biotinylated and isolated employing streptavidin, as follows. The BeWo cells on culture plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and then incubated with Biotin-Sulfo-OSu (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) dissolved in PBS under gentle rotation at 4 °C for 30 min. After removal of the excess reagent by washing twice with an ice-cold buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl at pH 8.0, the cells were recovered by scraping and incubated in a lysis buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 17,400 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. After protein concentration measurement by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), the supernatant was incubated with streptavidin-coupled agarose beads (Pierce) under rotation at 4 °C overnight. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with the lysis buffer. Subsequently, the biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling the beads with the SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The total cell lysate was dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.3% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate and then centrifuged to remove cell debris. The proteins in the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then incubated with a blocking buffer (2.5% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). After washing with PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) three times, each for 10 min, the membrane was incubated with IgG antibodies in the blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. The antibodies were mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Fitzgerald), mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (BD Biosciences), goat polyclonal anti-enolase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), and mouse monoclonal anti-TG2 (Thermo Fisher). After washing with PBS-T three times, each for 10 min, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse IgG (Dako), goat IgG (Dako), or rabbit IgG (Promega) in the blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS-T three times. Immunoreactive bands were developed with Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The A-PM proteins were separated according to their isoelectric point (pI) by using an OFFGEL fractionator (Agilent), as follows. The solvent (1% SDS) of the A-PM fraction was replaced by a solution containing 5 m urea, 1.4 m thiourea, and 0.1 mm DTT using a cellulose ester dialysis membrane (molecular weight cut-off 3,500–5,000; Spectrum Labs), and the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/1.8 ml by dilution with a Protein OFFGEL stock solution containing 6.7 m urea, 1.9 m thiourea, 62.2 mm DTT, glycerol, and OFFGEL Ampholyte pH3–10 (Agilent). An equal volume (150 μl) of protein solution was loaded over the IPG gel (pH 3–10) in each of 12 wells, and the apparatus was run under a programmed method consisting of 50 μA, 4,500 V, and 200 milliwatts at maximum and up to 20 kV-h. LC-nano-ESI/MS was carried out by using reversed phase Inertsil 300C4 (GL Science, Tokyo, Japan) trap (0.3 × 2 mm) and separation (0.3 × 150 mm) columns directly coupled with an LTQ-XL ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Each OFFGEL fraction (∼20 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of 1% formic acid, injected into the trap column, and washed with 0.1% formic acid. The proteins were eluted by a gradient of 0–90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 5 μl/min and infused into the mass spectrometer through a Monospray tip (GL Science). Immunoaffinity gel was prepared by coupling mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody with Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using a dimethyl pimelimidate imidoester cross-linker (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each OFFGEL fraction after isoelectric separation was dialyzed against the lysis buffer and then applied to an immunoaffinity gel column (200-μl bed volume), as described above. The column was washed with PBS three times, equilibrated with the lysis buffer, and incubated at 4 °C for 5 h. The column was then washed with PBS, and the proteins were eluted employing 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. BeWo cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min. After the cells had been incubated with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 3 min, they were treated with 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 1 h and finally incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin IgG at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed three times, for 5 min each, with PBS at room temperature and then exposed to Alexa488-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) or Alexa633-labeled anti-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Nuclear DNA was fluorescently stained with 0.2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Dojindo). The cells were observed using an Olympus IX51 fluorescent microscope or a Leica TCS SP8 confocal fluorescent microscope. For TG2 knockdown, the shRNA-encoding TG2 genes were created employing a pBAsi-hU6 Pur DNA vector (Takara, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences for the coding strand of shRNA were as follows: GATCCGTCGACTGTGGATTGGCATCTGTGAAGCCACAGATGGGATGCCAATCCACAGTCGACTTTTTTA (5′-3′) and AGCTTAAAAAAGTCGACTGTGGATTGGCATCCCATCTGTGGCTTCACAGATGCCAATCCACAGTCGACG (5′-3′) for the controls, GATCCGCAGTGACTTTGACGTCTTTGCTGTGAAGCCACAGATGGGCAAAGACGTCAAAGTCACTGCTTTTTTA (5′-3′) and AGCTTAAAAAAGCAGTGACTTTGACGTCTTTGCCCATCTGTGGCTTCACAGCAAAGACGTCAAAGTCACTGCG for human TG2 shRNA-1; and GATCCAGTGTGGCACCAAGTACCTGCTCAACTGTGAAGCCACAGATGGGTTGAGCAGGTACTTGGTGCCACACTTTTTTTA (5′-3′) and AGCTTAAAAAA AGTGTGGCACCAAGTACCTGCTCAACCCATCTGTGGCTTCACAGTTGAGCAGGTACTTGGTGCCACACTG for human TG2 shRNA-2. For GAPDH gene knockdown, the shRNA-encoding GAPDH vectors were created employing a pBAsi-hU6 Pur DNA vector according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences for the coding strand of shRNA were GATCCGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTCTGTGAAGCCACAGATGGGAAATCCGTTGACTCCGACCTTTTTTA (5′-3′) and AGCTTAAAAAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTCCCATCTGTGGCTTCACAGAAATCCGTTGACTCCGACCG (5′-3′) for controls and GATCCGTCGACTGTGGATTGGCATCTGTGAAGCCACAGATGGGATGCCAATCCACAGTCGACTTTTTTA (5′-3′) and AGCTTAAAAAAGTCGACTGTGGATTGGCATCCCATCTGTGGCTTCACAGATGCCAATCCACAGTCGACG (5′-3′) for human GAPDH shRNA. These constructs were introduced into BeWo cells using an Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells stably expressing shRNA were selected employing puromycin, and down-regulation of the protein was assessed by Western blotting. The pEGFP-TG2 plasmid encoding the wild-type construct, which was kindly provided by Dr. Marc Antonyak (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), was subcloned into a CSII-RfA-CMV-EGFP vector, which was kindly provided by Dr. Hiroyuki Miyoshi (RIKEN BRC, Ibaraki, Japan), using an L-R clonase reaction (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Human GAPDH cDNA was amplified from BeWo cells using random primers and was inserted into the XhoI/BamHI site located at the 3′-end of a human U6 promoter of the pENTER4 (Life Technologies) vector. The cDNAs in pENTER4 were then subcloned into a CSII-RfA-CMV-HA or a CSII-RfA-CMV-EYFP vector using the L-R clonase reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate the mutants with replacement of Gln by Glu was performed using a KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forskolin induces differentiation of BeWo cells via activation of cAMP-sensitive pathways. The cells undergo fusion to form a syncytium, as demonstrated by the disappearance of E-cadherin at the lateral cell boundaries 72 h after activation (Fig. 1A) (16.Coutifaris C. Kao L.C. Sehdev H.M. Chin U. Babalola G.O. Blaschuk O.W. Strauss 3rd, J.F. E-cadherin expression during the differentiation of human trophoblasts.Development. 1991; 113: 767-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the molecules involved in the fusion process occurring at the cell membrane, the A-PM was isolated from the cells, in the presence or absence of forskolin, by using colloidal silica (14.Chaney L.K.

Cell. 2010; 21: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and subjected to 2-DE differential display followed by peptide mass fingerprinting. We identified several proteins displaying quantitative or qualitative change by forskolin treatment: cytokeratin 18 (0.1), galectin-3 (0.7), keratin 19 (0.5), desmolase/cytochrome P450 (18.8), ER-60 protease/protein-disulfide isomerase (1.6) and heat shock 70kDa protein 5 (2.0), where -fold change is shown in parentheses. In addition, GAPDH displayed a remarkable change or “hypershift” in its isoelectric point (pI), indicating post-translational modification (Fig. 1B). This change was unrelated to the use of colloidal silica for isolation, because it was also found to affect the GAPDH in the membrane fraction prepared by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation without using colloidal silica (data not shown). Next, endogenous levels of GAPDH before and after forskolin treatment were determined by Western blotting. The amount of GAPDH recovered from the A-PM fraction was increased after forskolin treatment, whereas the level of total GAPDH in the cell was unchanged (Fig. 1C). The labeling of cell surface proteins revealed that GAPDH was not exposed to the extracellular milieu, suggesting localization beneath the plasma membrane (data not shown). To characterize the post-translational modification leading to the acidic hypershift, the acidic isoforms in the A-PM were separated according to their pI values using an OFFGEL fractionator. The SDS-PAGE indicated that the isoforms had been successfully separated into several fractions (Fig. 2, A and B). These fractions were subjected to LC-nano-ESI/MS for molecular mass measurement. Although the mass spectra of multiply charged ions displayed no gross changes, the deconvolution to singly charged species suggested an increase in the molecular mass by one or a few Da according to the acidic shift (Fig. 2C). This feature of acidic GAPDH isoforms allowed us to speculate that deamidation or citrullination had occurred, both accompanying an increase by 1 Da of the molecule. Subsequently, GAPDH was immunopurified from each fraction and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by tandem MS. The isotopic distribution of the product ions from protonated peptide LVINGNPITIFQERDPSK (residues 67–84) indicated that residue 78 (Gln) but not 80 (Arg) was largely responsible for the +1 Da increase, suggesting partial deamidation of the glutaminyl residue (Fig. 2D). The same change was observed in 204 (Gln) and suggested in other glutaminyl residues (data not shown). In addition, the isotopic profile of the product ions indicated that the deamidation level was higher in peptides derived from the GAPDH isoforms with lower pI values (Fig. 2E). Non-enzymatic deamidation of at least seven asparaginyl residues has been demonstrated for GAPDH (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot; P04406, G3P_HUMAN) and was actually present in the GAPDH samples analyzed herein (data not shown). On the other hand, deamidation of glutaminyl residues can occur enzymatically (i.e. with TG, which binds the side chain amide of γ-glutaminyl residues of proteins and then forms an isopeptide bond with an amine donor or hydrolyzes it to free acid (glutamic acid) when a suitable amine donor is absent). Dansylcadaverine is a competitive inhibitor substrate, and cystamine blocks the active site of TG (18.Birckbichler P.J. Orr G.R. Patterson Jr., M.K. Conway E. Carter H.A. Increase in proliferative markers after inhibition of transglutaminase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 5005-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In a study by Robinson et al. (19.Robinson N.J. Baker P.N. Jones C.J. Aplin J.D. A role for tissue transglutaminase in stabilization of membrane-cytoskeletal particles shed from the human placenta.Biol. Reprod. 2007; 77: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), these TG inhibitors down-regulated fusion and differentiation of (cyto)trophoblasts in primary culture. To study the role of TG in BeWo cell fusion, we examined the effects of these inhibitors on the modification of GAPDH. The cells were treated with forskolin, and then either 0.2 m dansylcadaverine or 0.25 m cystamine was added to the medium. After 48 h of incubation, A-PM was obtained from the cells and subjected to 2-DE followed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), these inhibitors prevented the hypershift, and the number of GAPDH spots identified in the TG-inhibited cells was comparable with that of the cells without forskolin and the inhibitors. In this experiment, GAPDH expression was unchanged by either dansylcadaverine or cystamine (data not shown). Next, the effects of TG inhibitors on BeWo cell fusion were investigated by counting the nuclei in the cells whose nuclei and cell borders were labeled with DAPI and E-cadherin, respectively, and the percentage of multinucleated cell nuclei among total nuclei was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3C, BeWo cell fusion was significantly suppressed by these inhibitors. These findings suggested that TG is responsible for the glutaminyl deamidation of GAPDH and is involved in the cell fusion mechanism. At least eight TGs encoded by different genes are distributed in the human body (for a review, see Ref. 20.Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Transglutaminases. Nature's biological glues.Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To identify the TG specifically catalyzing GAPDH deamidation, we first analyzed the expressions of TG genes and proteins in BeWo cells. TG2 (tissue TG) but not TG1 protein was detected by Western blotting, whereas TG1 and TG2 mRNAs were expressed in BeWo cells (data not shown). These results were consistent with TG1 being expressed in skin, whereas TG2 is ubiquitous, and suggested that TG2 is responsible for deamidation of GAPDH during trophoblastic cell fusion. To specify the nature of the involvement of TG2 in GAPDH deamidation and cell fusion, TG2 gene manipulation was conducted. We generated two clones of shRNA with different constructs completely suppressing TG2 expression (Fig. 4A). In the TG2-deficient cells, the amount of TG2 protein in the A-PM fraction was low, and interestingly, the hypershift was not observed (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, overexpression of TG2 did not cause substantial change in the modification of GAPDH or cell fusion. Subsequently, the effect of TG2 knockdown on cell fusion was analyzed, employing microscopic observations and statis"

ACTN4 functions as a transcriptional regulator of myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2, which plays a critical role in expression of muscle-specific genes during skeletal muscle differentiation. We found that ACTN4 translocates to the nucleus, induces myogenic gene expression, and promotes myotube formation during myogenesis. The myogenic process is controlled by an association between myogenic factors and MEF2 transcription factors. ACTN4 increased expression of muscle-specific proteins via interaction with MEF2. However, sLZIP decreased myogenic gene expression and myotube formation during myogenesis via disruption of the association between ACTN4 and MEF2. ACTN4 increased the promoter activities of myogenic genes, whereas sLZIP abrogated the effect of ACTN4 on transcriptional activation of myogenic genes in myoblasts. The C terminus of sLZIP is required for interaction with the C terminus of ACTN4, based on deletion mutant analysis, and sLZIP plays a role in regulation of MEF2 transactivation via interaction with ACTN4. Our results indicate that sLZIP negatively regulates skeletal muscle differentiation via interaction with ACTN4 and that sLZIP can be used as a therapeutic target molecule for treatment of muscle hypertrophy and associated diseases. The small leucine zipper protein (sLZIP) plays a role in transcriptional regulation in various types of cells. However, the role of sLZIP in myogenesis is unknown.

ACTNs are actin-binding proteins that play multiple roles in different types of cells, including attachment to actin filaments in skeletal muscle cells (4.Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M.

ACTN2 and 3 are enriched in muscle cells, whereas ACTN1 and 4 are widely expressed in other cells (5.Passaquin A.C. Lhote P. Rüegg U.T.

However, the function of ACTN4 during myogenesis is unclear. It is preferentially localized in the nucleus upon induction of myogenesis, and its expression leads to disruption of HDAC7 and the myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) 2A, and enhancement of MEF2-mediated transcription (12.Goffart S.

Myogenesis is a process of muscle tissue formation from myoblasts (15.Delgado I. Huang X. Jones S. Zhang L. Hatcher R. Gao B. Zhang P.

The MEF2 family of MADS (MCM1, agamous, deficiens, and serum response factor) domain transcription factors cooperates with MRFs in promoting muscle differentiation (15.Delgado I. Huang X. Jones S.

In this study, ACTN4 was identified as a sLZIP-binding protein and characterized as a regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation. ACTN4 enhances differentiation of myoblasts via interaction with MEF2, whereas sLZIP disrupts the association between ACTN4 and MEF2, resulting in suppression of myogenic gene expression and skeletal muscle differentiation. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Horse serum was purchased from Welgene Inc. Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were purchased from Bio-Rad. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were from GE Healthcare. Silver nitrate, anti-MyHC, anti-Flag (M2), anti-MEF2D, and anti-myogenin antibodies were purchased from Sigma and BD Biosciences. Anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST), anti-ACTN4, anti-green fluorescence protein (GFP), anti-Myc, β-actin, and α-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Murine myoblast C2C12 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. When cells were 80–90% confluent, the proliferation medium was replaced by the differentiation medium containing 2% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 48 h. C2C12 cells (5 × 105/well) were transfected with the ACTN4 expression plasmid (1 μg) for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and lysed in radioimmuneprecipitation assay lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were electrophoresed on 8% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with the specific antibodies at 4 °C overnight. β-Actin was used as an internal control. The blots were then incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The immune complex was detected using an ECL Plus Detection Kit (Pierce). His-sLZIP protein was expressed in BL21 cells using the T7 isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible system. IPTG-induced cells were disrupted by sonication, and cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. His-sLZIP protein was applied onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads column, and the column was washed until the elute contained no materials. For the pulldown experiment, His-tagged fusion protein-immobilized Sepharose beads were prepared. A total of 500 μl of purified sLZIP beads and myoblasts nuclear extracts were mixed with binding buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed four times with washing buffer. Each time the beads were incubated with washing buffer on a rotator for 3 min and collected. The samples were boiled in SDS sample loading buffer for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie Blue and silver staining. Proteins in silver-stained gels were analyzed and profiled using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ DeCa Xp Max mass spectrometer (Korea Basic Science Institute, Seoul, South Korea). Transfected cells were grown in 100-mm cell culture dishes to 70–80% confluence before medium was removed, then the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in radioimmuneprecipitation lysis buffer. Cells were collected, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Approximately 500 μg of solubilized lysates was used for each pulldown assay using the GST beads, and an immunoprecipitation assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed with the antibody described in the assay. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was synthesized with the use of 2 μg of total RNA through SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea) with oligo(dT) primers. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with the LightCycler 480 using SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche Applied Science). The sequences of the primers used for qRT-PCR were as follows: myogenin forward, 5′-TTG CTC AGC TCC CTC AAC CAG GA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGC AGA TTG TGG GCG TCT GTA GG-3′; MyoD forward, 5′-GAC CTG CGC TTT TTT GAG GAC C-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAG GCC CAC AGC AAG CAG CGA C-3′; MyHC forward, 5′-CCA TTC AGA GCA AAG ATG CAG G-3′ and reverse 5′-GCA TAACGC TCT TTG AGG TTG-3′. Each experiment was performed in three experimental replicates with three technical replicates within each experiment. C2C12 and HEK-293T cells transfected with the specific plasmid were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 20 min on ice using 80 μl/well Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, and luciferase activity was analyzed using the Luminometer 20/20n (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). For normalization, pSV40-β-galactosidase was co-transfected with the luciferase reporter gene. Collected supernatants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega) and analyzed by a DU530 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments). Cells were grown on coverslips. After 24 h, growth medium was changed with differentiation medium (2% horse serum containing DMEM), and cells were incubated for 3 days. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with 1% BSA for 1 h in 4 °C and the specific antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with 1× PBS, cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslides were washed with PBS, mounted, and analyzed. All images were captured with an Axiovert 100 fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Analyses were performed with Student's t test using SPSS 12.0 software. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. p = 0.05 and p = 0.001 are designated by * and **, respectively. To investigate the function of sLZIP in cellular processes, sLZIP-binding proteins were identified. A His pulldown assay was performed in HeLa cells using His-tagged sLZIP purified from bacterial cell lysates. A number of proteins were identified as sLZIP-binding proteins. Protein bands were analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and four dominant proteins, including ACTN4, were identified (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). The actin-binding protein ACTN4 translocates to the nucleus and probably participates in transcriptional regulation during myogenesis (12.Goffart S. Franko A. Clemen C.S. Wiesner R.J. α-Actinin 4 and BAT1 interaction with the cytochrome c promoter upon skeletal muscle differentiation.Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts are a commonly used model for in vitro skeletal muscle differentiation. Therefore, a His pulldown assay was performed using nuclear extracts of C2C12 cells. Results showed that sLZIP interacts with endogenous ACTN4 (Fig. 1B). Interaction between sLZIP and ACTN4 in the same samples was confirmed using Western blotting (Fig. 1B). The peptide sequences obtained using LC-MS/MS and the highly conserved region in mammalian cells are shown in Fig. 1C. To investigate the role of ACTN4 in myogenesis, we examined the effect of ACTN4 on transcription of muscle-specific genes in C2C12 myoblasts. Results from a luciferase assay showed that ACTN4 increased the transcriptional activities of MCK and myogenin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Knockdown of ACTN4 (supplemental Fig. S1A) using shRNA for ACTN4 (sh-ACTN4) decreased the promoter activities of MCK and myogenin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). C2C12 cells transfected with ACTN4 exhibited an increase in myotube formation, compared with a control (Fig. 2C). This observation was confirmed using immunofluorescence staining. In cells transfected with ACTN4, the number of visible myotubes was increased, compared with a control (Fig. 2D). The number of nuclei per myotube was counted and is presented as the myogenic fusion index, which indicates that ACTN4 increased myotube formation by 2.2-fold (Fig. 2D). Because levels of MyHC and myogenin are increased during myogenic differentiation, we examined the effect of ACTN4 on expression of these marker proteins. ACTN4 increased the protein expression of MyHC and myogenin during myoblast differentiation, whereas knockdown of ACTN4 decreased expression of both proteins (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that ACTN4 is involved in skeletal muscle differentiation via transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific genes. Because localization of ACTN4 is important for transcriptional regulation, the location of ACTN4 during myoblast differentiation was identified. Results from cell fractionation showed that ACTN4 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as differentiation proceeds (Fig. 2F). This result was confirmed using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2F). These findings indicate that ACTN4 induces myogenic gene expression and promotes myotube formation via transcriptional regulation of target genes. Because ACTN4 is involved in myotube formation and interacts with sLZIP, the role of sLZIP in the myogenic process was investigated. We first examined the effect of sLZIP on the promoter activities of MRF family genes. sLZIP reduced the promoter activities of MCK and myogenin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Myotube formation was decreased in C2C12 cells transfected with sLZIP compared with a control (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S1B). The myogenic fusion index indicated that sLZIP suppresses myotube formation by 2.8-fold (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that sLZIP negatively regulates myogenesis. Because ACTN4-mediated myogenesis is associated with expression of the MRF family genes, we examined the effect of sLZIP on MRF gene expression during the myogenic process. Expressions of MyHC and myogenin were increased during the myogenic process, and ACTN4 up-regulated expression of these myogenic marker proteins (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1C). However, sLZIP decreased expression of MyHC and myogenin in differentiated myoblasts (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1C). These results were quantified using the myogenic fusion index. ACTN4 significantly enhanced C2C12 differentiation, whereas sLZIP suppressed myoblast differentiation, compared with a control (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that sLZIP suppresses expression of muscle-specific proteins and myoblast differentiation. sLZIP is located in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional regulator (1.Kang H. Kim Y.S. Ko J. A novel isoform of human LZIP negatively regulates the transactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor.Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1746-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because ACTN4 is localized in the nucleus of myotubes and increases the transcriptional activity of MEF2 in C2C12 cells (14.Chakraborty S. Reineke E.L. Lam M. Li X. Liu Y. Gao C. Khurana S. Kao H.Y. α-Actinin 4 potentiates myocyte enhancer factor-2 transcription activity by antagonizing histone deacetylase 7.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35070-35080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of sLZIP in transactivation of MEF2. C2C12 cells were transfected with the MCK promoter coupled to the luciferase reporter gene, ACTN4, or sLZIP, and the promoter activity was determined. ACTN4 increased the MCK promoter activity in both complete and differentiation media; however, sLZIP decreased the ACTN4-induced promoter activity of MCK (Fig. 4A). MEF2 increased the MCK promoter activity, whereas knockdown of ACTN4 decreased MEF2-induced MCK promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). However, knockdown of sLZIP (supplemental Fig. S2A) enhanced the MEF2-induced MCK transcriptional activity (Fig. 4C). The enhancer of the MCK promoter contains the (TA(A/T)4TA) sequence which is known as a MEF2 binding site, and this consensus sequence is found in the promoter region of numerous muscle-specific genes, including MyHC, myogenin, and MCK (20.Suzuki E. Guo K. Kolman M. Yu Y.T. Walsh K. Serum induction of MEF2/RSRF expression in vascular myocytes is mediated at the level of translation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 3× tandem repeats of the MEF2 binding site were generated coupled to the luciferase reporter gene (MEF2×3-Luc) (supplemental Fig. S2B). The MEF2×3-Luc was co-transfected with MEF2A, C, D, and ACTN4 into HEK-293T cells. Results from a luciferase assay showed that ACTN4 increased the luciferase activity of MEF2×3, and the luciferase activity was enhanced in the presence of MEF2A, C, and D in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 4D). However, sLZIP repressed the luciferase activity of MEF2×3 (Fig. 4E). When MEF2 and ACTN4 were co-transfected, the luciferase activity of MEF2×3 was increased by 3.7-fold; however, sLZIP reduced the luciferase activity by ∼2-fold (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that sLZIP is involved in regulation of myogenic gene expression via inhibition of the transcriptional activation of MEF2. These results were confirmed using qRT-PCR analysis. ACTN4 induced differentiation of myoblasts and increased the mRNA expressions of myogenin, MyoD, and MyHC (Fig. 4F). However, sLZIP suppressed the mRNA levels of the muscle-specific genes both in the presence and absence of ACTN4 (Fig. 4F), indicating that sLZIP suppresses expression of myogenic genes in C2C12 myoblasts. Because sLZIP is involved in regulation of ACTN4-mediated myogenic gene expression, the interaction domains of sLZIP and ACTN4 were investigated using a GST pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S2C, sLZIP interacts with ACTN4. To analyze the interaction domain of ACTN4 with sLZIP, three ACTN4 deletion mutants were generated (Fig. 5B). mGST-sLZIP and a series of FLAG-tagged deletion mutants of ACTN4 were co-expressed in HEK-293T cells, and cell lysates were pulled down using GST-agarose beads. Results showed that the C-terminal region (480–911) of ACTN4 is required for interaction with sLZIP (Fig. 5B). Deletion mutants of sLZIP were also prepared and were used to examine the luciferase activity of MEF2×3. sLZIP-F (1–354), sLZIP-C (229–354), and sLZIP-CC (296–354) repressed the luciferase activity of MEF2×3 in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 5C). Results from a GST pulldown assay showed that sLZIP(296–354) interacts with ACTN4(480–911) (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S2D). These results were confirmed using an MEF2×3 luciferase assay. ACTN4(480–911) increased the luciferase activity of MEF2×3 up to 70% of wild-type ACTN4, whereas other deletion mutants did not affect the luciferase activity (Fig. 5E). sLZIP(296–354) effectively decreased the luciferase activity of MEF2×3 (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that the C terminus of sLZIP is required for interaction with the C terminus of ACTN4 and that sLZIP plays a role in regulation of MEF2 transactivation via interaction with ACTN4. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of sLZIP in myoblast differentiation, the effect of sLZIP on the interaction between ACTN4 and MEF2D was investigated. We performed an immunoprecipitation assay using cells transfected with ACTN4, sLZIP, and MEF2D. Results showed that ACTN4 binds to MEF2D; however, sLZIP interferes with the binding between ACTN4 and MEF2D (Fig. 6A). The formation of complexes between ACTN4 and MEF2D and between ACTN4 and sLZIP was examined using an immunoprecipitation assay. ACTN4 increased the formation of ACTN4 and MEF2D complexes; however, sLZIP repressed the interaction between ACTN4 and MEF2D (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that sLZIP disrupts the association between ACTN4 and MEF2D. We examined whether sLZIP disrupts the endogenous interaction between ACTN4 and MEF2D in C2C12 cells. Results from an immunoprecipitation assay showed that ACTN4 interacts with MEF2D at the endogenous level (Fig. 6C). However, ectopically expressed sLZIP disrupted the association between ACTN4 and MEF2D in differentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 6C). ACTN4 also interacted with MEF2A and C, and sLZIP disrupted the interaction between ACTN4 and MEF2A/C (supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest that ACTN4 forms a complex with MEF2 and promotes myogenesis; however, sLZIP inhibits the myogenic process via interaction with ACTN4 (Fig. 6D). Differentiation of myoblasts is a process of change in cellular morphology and organization. During this process, expression of muscle-specific genes is increased, and formation of myotubes occurs (16.Horlick R.A. Benfield P.A.

Various transcription factors, including the MEF2 and the MRF gene families, are involved in myogenic differentiation and play critical roles in regulation of gene expression in myogenesis (15.Delgado I.

Knock-out studies have demonstrated that complex association between various muscle transcription factors occurs during myogenesis and that each transcription factor plays an important role in regulation of the gene expression pattern (28.Haberland M.

In this study, we characterized a novel mechanism by which sLZIP plays a role in inhibition of myoblast differentiation and myotube formation. Regulation of gene expression by transcription factors comprises combinatorial events in that coordinated interactions of co-factors are required. In an effort to identify sLZIP-binding partners, we performed a His pulldown assay and LC-MS/MS and identified ACTN4 as a novel sLZIP-binding protein in myotubes. The sLZIP-binding partner ACTN4 is apparently involved in MEF2 transcriptional regulation (14.Chakraborty S. Reineke E.L. Lam M. Li X. Liu Y. Gao C. Khurana S.

Ectopic expression of ACTN4 increases the transcriptional activity of MEF2 by disrupting the interaction between MEF2 and HDAC7 (14.Chakraborty S. Reineke E.L. Lam M. Li X. Liu Y. Gao C. Khurana S.

MEF2 proteins increase the expression of muscle-associated proteins, including MyHC, myogenin, MyoD, and MCK during muscle differentiation, and the binding sites of MEF2 proteins are localized in the promoter region of the myogenic genes (16.Horlick R.A.

Myogenin, a factor regulating myogenesis, has a domain homologous to MyoD.Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). MEF2 activity is regulated by many signaling pathways in which MAPKs act directly on specific residues of MEF2A, C, and D, thereby augmenting MEF2 transactivating functions (30.Han J. Molkentin J.D. Regulation of MEF2 by p38 MAPK and its implication in cardiomyocyte biology.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, hyperactivation of MEF2-dependent transcription induces muscle disease, such as hypertrophy, by acting as a part of the transcriptional program (31.Lin Q. Lu J. Yanagisawa H. Webb R.

ACTN4 also has a nuclear receptor interacting motif that functions either as a transcriptional regulator or as a co-activator. Recently, ACTN4 was shown to be a transcriptional regulator via direct interaction with an estrogen receptor (33.Khurana S. Chakraborty S. Zhao X. Liu Y. Guan D. Lam M. Huang W. Yang S. Kao H.Y.

Some nuclear receptors, including retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, and T3 receptors, are also involved in regulation of myogenesis (34.Albagli-Curiel O. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Vincent S.

In this study, ACTN4 showed two important features that are required of a transcriptional co-activator: (i) translocation to the nucleus and (ii) direct interaction with transcription factors during myogenesis. ACTN4 is translocated to the nucleus during muscle differentiation, indicating that ACTN4 probably functions as a transcriptional regulator during myoblast differentiation. ACTN4 induces expression of muscle-specific genes, including some known transcription factors that regulate myogenesis, and promotes myotube formation in C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Our results indicate that ACTN4 is also a co-regulator of myogenesis. The roles of sLZIP and ACTN4 in myogenesis were investigated. C2C12 cells overexpressing ACTN4 exhibited an increase in MCK and myogenin promoter activities and the luciferase activity of MEF2×3. However, sLZIP decreased these activities. A recent study showed that ACTN4 is required for the transcriptional activation of MEF2 through interaction with the C terminus of MEF2 (14.Chakraborty S. Reineke E.L. Lam M. Li X. Liu Y. Gao C. Khurana S. Kao H.Y. α-Actinin 4 potentiates myocyte enhancer factor-2 transcription activity by antagonizing histone deacetylase 7.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35070-35080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). sLZIP disrupts the interaction between ACTN4 and MEF2, and sLZIP interacts with ACTN4 through the C terminus, resulting in suppression of ACTN4-induced myogenesis. Down-regulation of MEF2 activity is important in regulating muscle expansion and in preventing myogenesis (19.Black B.L. Olson E.N.

Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). sLZIP inhibits myoblast differentiation via regulation of ACTN4 and MEF2. Therefore, sLZIP is a candidate for study as a therapeutic agent in muscle-associated diseases, such as hypertrophy. It has been reported that expression of class II HDACs, which repress MEF2-dependent gene expression by binding to MEF2, is significantly reduced in skeletal muscles (12.Goffart S. Franko A.

Genet. 2006; 49: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). During the muscle differentiation process, release of MEF2 from HDACs is required, which leads to disruption of the HDACs-MEF2 complex and enhancement of MEF2-mediated transcription (14.Chakraborty S. Reineke E.L. Lam M. Li X. Liu Y. Gao C. Khurana S. Kao H.Y. α-Actinin 4 potentiates myocyte enhancer factor-2 transcription activity by antagonizing histone deacetylase 7.J. Biol.

Invest. 2007; 117: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). sLZIP increases the activities of HDACs, resulting in suppression of target gene expression (1.Kang H. Kim Y.S. Ko J. A novel isoform of human LZIP negatively regulates the transactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor.Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1746-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, sLZIP probably plays a role in regulation of HDAC activities in myogenesis. Although further study regarding the relationship between sLZIP and HDACs is needed, our findings demonstrate that sLZIP functions as a negative regulator in myoblast differentiation via interaction with ACTN4.

https://openalex.org/W1983310987,"Neurokinin B (NKB) and its G-protein-coupled receptor, NK3R, have been implicated in the neuroendocrine control of GnRH release; however, little is known about the structure-function relationship of this ligand-receptor pair. Moreover, loss-of-function NK3R mutations cause GnRH deficiency in humans. Using missense mutations in NK3R we previously identified in patients with GnRH deficiency, we demonstrate that Y256H and Y315C NK3R mutations in the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains (TM5 and TM6), resulted in reduced whole-cell (79.3±7.2%) or plasma membrane (67.3±7.3%) levels, respectively, compared with wild-type (WT) NK3R, with near complete loss of inositol phosphate (IP) signaling, implicating these domains in receptor trafficking, processing, and/or stability. We further demonstrate in a FRET-based assay that R295S NK3R, in the third intracellular loop (IL3), bound NKB but impaired dissociation of Gq-protein subunits from the receptor compared with WT NK3R, which showed a 10.0 ± 1.3% reduction in FRET ratios following ligand binding, indicating activation of Gq-protein signaling. Interestingly, R295S NK3R, identified in the heterozygous state in a GnRH-deficient patient, also interfered with dissociation of G proteins and IP signaling from wild-type NK3R, indicative of dominant-negative effects. Collectively, our data illustrate roles for TM5 and TM6 in NK3R trafficking and ligand binding and for IL3 in NK3R signaling.—Noel, S. D., Abreu, A.

https://openalex.org/W2077106442,"Making the decision between self-renewal and differentiation of adult stem cells is critical for tissue repair and homeostasis. Here we show that the apoptotic adaptor Fas-associated death domain (FADD) regulates the fate decisions of muscle satellite cells (SCs). FADD phosphorylation was specifically induced in cycling SCs, which was high in metaphase and declined in later anaphase. Furthermore, phosphorylated FADD at Ser-191 accumulated in the uncommitted cycling SCs and was asymmetrically localized in the self-renewing daughter SCs. SCs containing a phosphoryl-mimicking mutation at Ser-191 of FADD (FADD-D) expressed higher levels of stem-like markers and reduced commitment-associated markers. Moreover, a phosphoryl-mimicking mutation at Ser-191 of FADD suppressed SC activation and differentiation, which promoted the cycling SCs into a reversible quiescent state. Therefore, these data indicate that FADD regulates the fate determination of cycling SCs."
https://openalex.org/W1992829780,"Introduction Cognitive tasks that do not change the required response for a stimulus over time (‘consistent mapping’) show dramatically improved performance after relative short periods of practice. This improvement is associated with reduced brain activity in a large network of brain regions, including left prefrontal and parietal cortex. The present study used fMRI-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which has been shown to reduce processing efficacy, to examine if the reduced activity in these regions also reflects reduced involvement, or possibly increased efficiency. Methods First, subjects performed runs of a Sternberg task in the scanner with novel or practiced target-sets. This data was used to identify individual sites for left prefrontal and parietal peak brain activity, as well as to examine the change in activity related to practice. Outside of the scanner, real and sham rTMS was applied at left prefrontal and parietal cortex to examine their involvement novel and practiced conditions. Results Prefrontal as well as parietal rTMS significantly reduced target accuracy for novel targets. Prefrontal, but not parietal, rTMS interference was significantly lower for practiced than novel target-sets. rTMS did not affect non-target accuracy, or reaction time in any condition. Discussion These results show that task practice in a consistent environment reduces involvement of the prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that prefrontal cortex is predominantly involved in target maintenance and comparison, as rTMS interference was only detectable for targets. Findings support process switching hypotheses that propose that practice creates the possibility to select a response without the need to compare with target items. Our results also support the notion that practice allows for redistribution of limited maintenance resources."
https://openalex.org/W2092328658,"Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHEs) play important roles in regulating internal pH (pHi), cell volume and neutral Na(+) absorption in the human intestine. Earlier studies have shown that low extracellular pH (pHe) and metabolic acidosis increases the expression and function of NHE1-3 genes. However, transcriptional mechanisms involved remained unknown. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying acid-induced NHE2 expression in C2BBe1 and SK-CO15 intestinal epithelial cells. Assessing total RNA and protein by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively, displayed significant increases in the NHE2 mRNA and protein levels in cells exposed to acidic media (pH 6.5 and 6.7) compared to normal medium. Acid treatment was also associated with a significant enhancement in NHE2 transport activity. Quantification of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA indicated that the rate of NHE2 transcription was increased in response to acid. Furthermore, acid caused a significant increase in NHE2 promoter activity confirming transcriptional upregulation. Through functional and mutational studies the acid-response element was mapped to a 15-nucleotide GC-rich sequence at bp -337 to -323 upstream from the transcription start site. We previously identified this element as an overlapping Egr-1/Sp1/Egr-1 motif that was essential for the NHE2 upregulation by mitogen-induced transcription factor Egr-1. Cells exposed to acid exhibited a temporal increase in Egr-1 mRNA and protein expression. These events were followed by Egr-1 nuclear accumulation, as detected by immunofluorescence microscopy, and potentiated its in vitro and in vivo interaction with the NHE2 promoter. Disruption of ESE motif and knockdown of Egr-1 expression by targeted small interfering RNA abrogated the acid-induced NHE2 transcriptional activity. These data indicate that the acid-dependent NHE2 stimulation is implemented by transcriptional upregulation of NHE2 via acid-induced Egr-1 in the intestinal epithelial cells."

The integral values of the reaction rates, the burning velocities and the heat release of the acoustically perturbed flame are compared with the unperturbed case. We found that the flame's sensitivity to acoustic perturbations is greatest when the wavelength is comparable to the flame thickness. Even in this case, the perturbations are stable with time. We conclude that acoustic fields acting on the chemistry do not contribute significantly to the emergence of large amplitude pressure oscillations."

While methods have been identified for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, to date, self-sampling has not provided adequate specimens for cytology. We piloted the validity and reliability of using a self-lavaging device for cervical cytology and HPV testing. We enrolled 198 women in New York City in 2008–2009 from three ambulatory clinics where they received cervical cancer screening. All were asked to use the Delphi Screener™ to self-lavage 1–3 months after clinician-collected index cytological smear (100 normal; 98 abnormal). Women with abnormal cytology results from either specimen underwent colposcopy; 10 women with normal results from both specimens also underwent colposcopy. We calculated sensitivity of self-collected cytology to detect histologically confirmed high grade lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN, 2+); specificity for histology-negative (CIN 1 or lower), paired cytology negative, or a third cytology negative; and kappa for paired results. One hundred and ninety-seven (99.5%) women self-collected a lavage. Seventy-five percent had moderate to excellent cellularity, two specimens were unsatisfactory for cytology. Seven of 167 (4%) women with definitive results had CIN2+; one had normal and six abnormal cytology results with the self-lavage (sensitivity = 86%, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 42, 100). The kappa for paired cytology was low (0.36; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.47) primarily due to clinician specimens with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) coded as normal using Screener specimens. However, three cases of HSIL were coded as ASC-US and one as normal using Screener specimens. Seventy-three women had paired high-risk HPV tests with a kappa of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.84). Based on these preliminary findings, a larger study to estimate the performance of the Screener for co-testing cytology and HPV or for HPV testing with cytology triage is warranted.

The method is first illustrated and validated on simulated images of a fluorescently-labeled protein translocating from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and then applied to experimental data obtained with fluorescently-labeled hexokinase 2 in different cell types imaged by regular or confocal microscopy. The method was found to be robust with respect to cell morphology changes and mitochondrial dynamics (fusion, fission, movement) during the time-lapse imaging.

https://openalex.org/W2026123729,"The profile hidden Markov model (PHMM) is widely used to assign the protein sequences to their respective families. A major limitation of a PHMM is the assumption that given states the observations (amino acids) are independent. To overcome this limitation, the dependency between amino acids in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) which is the representative of a PHMM can be appended to the PHMM. Due to the fact that with a MSA, the sequences of amino acids are biologically related, the one-by-one dependency between two amino acids can be considered. In other words, based on the MSA, the dependency between an amino acid and its corresponding amino acid located above can be combined with the PHMM. For this purpose, the new emission probability matrix which considers the one-by-one dependencies between amino acids is constructed. The parameters of a PHMM are of two types; transition and emission probabilities which are usually estimated using an EM algorithm called the Baum-Welch algorithm. We have generalized the Baum-Welch algorithm using similarity emission matrix constructed by integrating the new emission probability matrix with the common emission probability matrix. Then, the performance of similarity emission is discussed by applying it to the top twenty protein families in the Pfam database. We show that using the similarity emission in the Baum-Welch algorithm significantly outperforms the common Baum-Welch algorithm in the task of assigning protein sequences to protein families."
https://openalex.org/W2010119097,"Direct Sanger sequencing of viral genome populations yields multiple ambiguous sequence positions. It is not straightforward to derive linkage information from sequencing chromatograms, which in turn hampers the correct interpretation of the sequence data. We present a method for determining the variants existing in a viral quasispecies in the case of two nearby ambiguous sequence positions by exploiting the effect of sequence context-dependent incorporation of dideoxynucleotides. The computational model was trained on data from sequencing chromatograms of clonal variants and was evaluated on two test sets of in vitro mixtures. The approach achieved high accuracies in identifying the mixture components of 97.4% on a test set in which the positions to be analyzed are only one base apart from each other, and of 84.5% on a test set in which the ambiguous positions are separated by three bases. In silico experiments suggest two major limitations of our approach in terms of accuracy. First, due to a basic limitation of Sanger sequencing, it is not possible to reliably detect minor variants with a relative frequency of no more than 10%. Second, the model cannot distinguish between mixtures of two or four clonal variants, if one of two sets of linear constraints is fulfilled. Furthermore, the approach requires repetitive sequencing of all variants that might be present in the mixture to be analyzed. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of our method on the two in vitro test sets shows that short-range linkage information of two ambiguous sequence positions can be inferred from Sanger sequencing chromatograms without any further assumptions on the mixture composition. Additionally, our model provides new insights into the established and widely used Sanger sequencing technology. The source code of our method is made available at http://bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/publications/beggel/linkageinformation.zip."

It is found that the dynamical behaviors of population on square lattice depend on the mixing proportion of the two simple games.
