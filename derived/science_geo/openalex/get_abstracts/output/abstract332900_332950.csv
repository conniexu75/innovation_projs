https://openalex.org/W2074069141,"An inhibitor of seed germination was isolated from the integuments of Lovell peach seeds. Evidence from chromatographic analysis, from studies of its absorption of ultraviolet light and from assays on its effects on plant growth, indicate that the inhibitor is, if not identical with, dormin. Termination of rest in peach seeds is correlated with the disappearance of the inhibitor. The effects of the inhibitor are antagonistic to those of gibberellic acid on sections of wheat coleoptiles."
https://openalex.org/W2051447999,Spermatophore counts in wild females of Papilio glaucus show that the monomorphic nonmimetic male mates less frequently with the mimetic female morph than with the nonmimetic female morph. Female dimorphism in this species cannot be maintained by heterozygous advantage. Mating preference for the nonmimetic female may sufficiently counteract avian predation pressure favoring the mimetic female to account for the maintenance of the nonmimetic morph in the population in those areas in which the model is abundant and to account for the reduction in frequency or elimination of the mimetic morph in those areas in which the model is less numerous or absent.
https://openalex.org/W2040997226,"The bromination of chiral crystalline samples of 4,4â€²-dimethylchalcone was reinvestigated. In the presence of the optically active reaction product, (+)- or (-)-chalcone dibromide, crystallization from solutions of the achiral chalcone is specifically directed toward one-handedness. A feedback mechanism can thus be envisaged where optically active compounds are formed, generate additional material of the same chirality, and communicate this chirality to other regions, simply by cycles of solidification, reaction, and liquefaction."
https://openalex.org/W2075960474,"Data from a wide variety of sources reflect geographical, baccalaureate, and social class variations in the production of scientific and scholarly doctorates in the United States. To a significant extent, these variations are associated with the kind of religiousethnic group from which such persons come. Roman Catholics are extremely low producers of scientists and scholars, but fundamentalistic and traditional Protestant faiths (southern white Protestants, Lutherans) are also low producers. Liberal Protestant sects, such as Unitarians and Quakers, and secularized Jewish groups are highly productive, and less liberal faiths are moderately productive. Variations in productivity are reflective of differences in beliefs and values. Highly productive groups share a certain set of values, unproductive groups hold the antithesis of these, and those groups intermediate in productivity possess a mixed blend. Tentatively, the common beliefs and value systems of high producers seem to include naturalism; intrinsic valuation of learning and the individual quest for truth; emphasis on human dignity, goodness, and competence; a life pathway of serious dedication, of service to humanity, of continual striving; humanistic equalitarianism; a pragmatic search for better ways of doing things unfettered by traditional restraints; and a focus on the relatively immediate, foreseeable future which can be affected by personal effort. Historically, the scientists (or their immediate ancestors) have broken away from the traditional orthodoxy, broadened certain values, and retained others. For example, the children of Jewish immigrants to the United States departed from the traditional ritualism of the eastern European Jewish community, broadened the old value of scriptural erudition to include secular learning of all kinds, but maintained emphasis upon personal striving and social responsibility. Also, it appears that eminent scientists often emerge from devout Protestant homes emphasizing learning and responsibility but that such scientists frequently depart from the parental religious faith (31). Psychodynamically, this set of cultural values produces a person with an inquiring cognitive disposition, whose duty it is to strive diligently to improve the human condition. Given a certain level of intellectual talent, and cultural support in educational, scientific, and scholarly institutions, youth will frequently choose careers in scientific and scholarly professions. This same cultural milieu apparently also produces disproportionate numbers of inventors and entrepreneurs; historically, it produced those who activated the industrial revolution and those who generally were responsible for rapid economic growth. The data discussed herein extend only to about 1960, prior to the great social unrest of the 1960's and early 1970's. Speculatively, one might predict that productivity will diminish to the extent that current social movements stressing existential futility, goal attainment ""now,"" or power relationships are successful in penetrating groups which have been highly productive, since these emphases undermine longterm scholarly striving."

https://openalex.org/W2066335285,"Crystals of calcite and, in one case, of dolomite up to 90 microm in size are dispersed in pelagic red clay at several sites on the floor of the South Pacific Ocean. They were analyzed by microscopic, x-ray diffraction, electron x-ray microprobe, and oxygen isotopic techniques. These carbonates are authigenic and were probably precipitated from hydrothermal solutions connected with deep-sea volcanic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2002738216,"In the polymerization of alpha-olefins with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, the polymer is formed directly as long fibrillar units with folder chains. It is proposed that the fibrils are formed by the crystallization of polymer chains growing from the active sites on the catalyst surface, a process which is likened to root growth in whiskers."

https://openalex.org/W2021545560,Continuous seismic profiles of the Straits of Florida indicate that north of 26 degrees 30'N the trough was formed mainly by sediment upbuilding along the margins. South of this latitude the straits may be due in part to faulting.
https://openalex.org/W1984920291,"After the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, ozone concentrations outside the polar regions are 4% below levels typical of the past 12 years, and 3% below the very lowest level seen in those years. The debris from the eruption may have lowered ozone levels by changing the wind patterns in the stratosphere, combined with chemical effects. Levels between 30 and 60[degree]N latitude were 9% below normal."
