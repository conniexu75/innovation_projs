Sweetness rises with concentration, whereas pleasantness first rises and then decreases. The breakpoint appears to occur at a constant sweetness (that is, constant sensory) level."
https://openalex.org/W1988176227,"Although conclusive evidence is lacking for its establishment, the thesis that complexity adds stability to communities is probably accepted by the majority of ecologists. I believe this attitude found its origins in the indisputable fact that there are latitudinal and altitudinal changes in community complexity. As one progresses northward or southward from the equator, or higher in altitude in most parts of the world, one cannot help but notice that communities tend to become simpler, that is, there are fewer species per community. At the same time, these communities appear to become less stable. But perhaps this change in stability is in appearance only; they appear to be less stable because of the relatively greater number of individuals comprising each species population in temperate areas. Each population, because of its greater numbers, is therefore conspicuous, and changes in these numbers are noticed. We are particularly aware of such changes because populations in these areas of the world have been comparatively well studied. Many of the most studied populations include species of economic importance where changes in population numbers are vital to agricultural or forestry practices. Equatorial populations, on the other hand, contain smaller numbers of individuals of each species because of the greater number of species present. Number changes are simply not as noticeable because the population itself is not as obvious among the other populations. It may be that when (if ever) we have as much data on equatorial populations as we have on those of temperate climates, we will find fluctuations of equal relative magnitude (but not of equal numbers, of course). If, on the other hand, we really do find a correlation between complexity and stability, the suggestion by May (12) that stability permits complexity may be well worth investigating. Because of its organization and physical setting, the Rhopalomyia community I have studied might be expected to have considerable stability. In fact, however, it does not. Each of the populations in the community fluctuates greatly and irregularly in both percentages and numbers, and these populations apparently become locally extinct occasionally, because they sometimes cannot be found even in extensive collections. After studying several of the more important parasitoid species, it is evident to me that there is little or nothing about their interactions that might induce greater community stability. Each species seems to have evolved into the community with no higher purpose than simply to usurp what it can from some other member, and it does this by concentrating its energies on better competitive mechanisms rather than higher reproductive capacities. There are never empty niches to be filled by organisms having the ""correct specifications"" because new niches are created out of parts of older, broader niches which were occupied by other, more r-selected organisms. Thus, perhaps we have read too much into community organization. Perhaps the ""ifiling of niches"" is essentially nothing more than the haphazard result of competitive jostling among species; and that as communities develop, they are not necessarily programmed for such things as greater stability or better energy utilizationthe species merely become more closely packed."

However, their thermal stability is not favorable. These sulfoxides are intermediates in the mammalian metabolism of thiocarbamates, being formed by liver microsomal oxidases and cleaved in a system consisting of glutathione and a soluble enzyme from liver."
https://openalex.org/W2030210946,"Decreased hemoglobin-oxygen affinity is thought to be of adaptive value to humans and nonindigenous animals at high altitude. To test this, hemoglobin-oxygen affinity was modified by carbamoylation of hemoglobin in rats. Exposure of control (low oxygen affinity) and experimental (high oxygen affinity) animals to a pressure equivalent to high altitude revealed that increased, rather than decreased, hemoglobin-oxygen affinity will permit survival at greatly reduced environmental oxygen pressures."

The rapid loss of toxin from denervated muscle can be blocked by inhibitors of energy production and protein synthesis, and may reflect turnover of the toxin-receptor complex in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2043017375,"Preceding the opening of the sodium channels of axon membrane there is a small outward current, gating current, that is probably associated with the molecular rearrangements that open the channels. Gating current is reversibly blocked by three procedures that block the sodium current: (i) internal perfusion with zinc ions, (ii) inactivation of sodium conductance by brief depolarization, and (iii) prolonged depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2069643300,If effective sex control techniques were rapidly and widely adopted in the United States the current sex preferences of married women indicated that the temporary effect would be of a surplus of male births in the first couple of years followed by a wave of female births to achieve balance. The most significant implication appears to be the probability of first borns being male. Current attitudes of women however suggest that a substantial proportion would not use sex selection techniques even if available. Data on the use of this technology suggest the only major impact would be on first and second births with little effect on over-all sex ratio at birth.

Somatic-somatic, flagellar-somatic, and flagellar-flagellar type agglutination was observed with the lectins. Enzyme-treated promastigotes gave reduced lectin agglutination reactions. The results suggest that complex saccharide moieties are randomly distributed on the surface of this organism."

https://openalex.org/W1972520018,"A subdiaphragmatic vagotomy markedly inhibits eating and self-stimulation produced in rats by lateral hypothalamic stimulation. The stomach is known to be affected by hypothalamic stimulation via the vagus, and afferents from the stomach can influence the hypothalamus via the same nerve. Consequently, this result suggests that eating and self-stimulation may be partly controlled by hypothalamic influences on the stomach which, in turn, affects hypothalamic sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2030441141,Amniotic fluid cell cultures were screened for mycoplasma contamination. Mycoplasma RNA's were observed in more than half the cultures examined. Karyotypic analyses of these contaminated cell cultures revealed a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations. These studies emphasize the need for screening for mycoplasma in cultured amniotic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2146285954,"The experimental verification of a proposed biosynthetic pathway for a given natural product is often difficult to obtain with the use of the whole organism (permeability factors) or, in the case of higher plants, a cell-free system. Until the purified enzyme for each step of biosynthesis is available, biosynthetic studies can, however, be carried out, albeit with modest incorporation values, by means of either hydroponic or injection methodology. Where viable seed sources are available it is suggested that improvements of several orders of magnitude in incorporation can be achieved by a short-term incubation (small pool size of precursors; trapping of reactive intermediates) or a long-term feeding (equilibration of precursor with the compartmentalized or induced synthetases). In bacterial, fungal, mammalian, and plant systems, where incorporation efficiencies provide the opportunity to study (13)C enrichment (at least equal to natural abundance of the isotope), we can expect a rapid expansion since the method removes the tedium of carbon-by-carbon degradation. For the next few years, however, the prognosis would seem to favor parallel studies of (13)C and (2)H, and of (14)C/(3)H ratio techniques since the last-mentioned method provides more information concerning the stereoselectivity of labeling processes on the microgram scale."

An analysis of precise data on oxygen binding to the cyanmet hybrids and normal hemoglobin shows that if this is the case, then cooperative ligand binding in hemoglobin is more properly described by some model of the sequential type than by any twostate concerted model."

https://openalex.org/W1583897953,"The problems that relate to the outermost limits of institutional care, if such limits exist, will certainly be among the most salient problems during the coming years-no matter whether such care proceeds on an inpatient or an outpatient basis. Whatever course may be taken will certainly affect the lives of every citizen in urbanized and industrialized society. At present in California there is considerable shifting of individuals from one care status or category to another, in efforts to find accommodations that will better reflect the realities of modern existence. However, such shifting of caseloads as the moving of individuals from nursing and convalescent homes to hospitals and back again does not constitute a change, either from the standpoint of the subjects involved or from the standpoint of significantly affecting the overall caseload. Most commonly, the shifting of caseloads has been merely jurisdictional. Much the same can be said of the transfers from a police agency to welfare, or vice versa. Similarly, a shift from inpatient status to outpatient status does not constitute a significant change. Such transfers from one jurisdiction to another reflect a reduction in caseload for one agency, but a corresponding increase in caseload for another. Thus, there has been no significant change in the subject population as such. Jurisdictional transfers are often merely caretaking actions that reflect bureaucratic decisions. Equally often, such decisions do not address themselves to the basic priorities that guide the functions of caretaking. Explicitly stated priorities must supersede jurisditional transfers if the concept of caretaking is to include better resources for human development and if the subject population is to participate in the managing of institutions. On any given day during 1969 in the state of California, virtually 8 million people from an estimated population of 19,800,000 were under some form of institutional care or in some institutional program, or were employed to provide the care and administer the programs. Clearly this is a vast effort toward the training and retraining, as well as the rehabilitation of people, in the traditional sense of these words. The salient problems that have emerged from this context of urban and industrial development involve social control, social mobility, organizational behavior by caretakers and subjects, minority peoples, and the extensions of institutions into communities. Given these developments, is it not proper to ask whether or not the nature of urbanized and industrialized society has changed to such a point that a return to the past (and past solutions) is no longer feasible? Is it not also proper to ask what voice the subject population will have in helping to guide the urban and industrialized state into the future? And certainly there is a question that virtually everyone will ask: What percentage of tax revenues (whether shared or under direct programs) shall be destined to better meet the problems of this future society, which, it seems, is already upon us?"
https://openalex.org/W2036158628,"Total time required for larval and pupal development in Ephestia kühniella Z. was significantly modified when habitable space of the food mass was increased by dilution with a nontoxic sawdust. Doubling the living space resulted in an increased developmental rate, presumably due to a reduction in the number of larval interactions. Tripling the living space, however, produced a somewhat unexpected delay in development, accompanied by a marked increase in variance about the means for both males and females."
