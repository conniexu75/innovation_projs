https://openalex.org/W1970611288,"The clinician looking, listening, or feeling for signs of a disease may far prefer a false alarm to a miss, particularly if the disease is serious and contagious. On the other hand, he may believe that the available therapy is marginally effective, expensive, and debilitating. The pilot seeing the landing lights only when they are a few yards away may decide that his plane is adequately aligned with the runway if he is alone and familiar with that plight. He may be more inclined to circle the field before another try at landing if he has many passengers and recent memory of another plane crashing under those circumstances. The Food and Drug administrator suspecting botulism in a canned food may not want to accept even a remote threat to the public health. But he may be less clearly biased if a recent false alarm has cost a canning company millions of dollars and left some damaged reputations. The making of almost any fine discrimination is beset with such considerations of probability and utility, which are extraneous and potentially confounding when one is attempting to measure the acuity of discrimination per se."

https://openalex.org/W2081308351,The presence or absence of a change in the ambient stimulus conditions upon entry into a food source controlled the frequency with which pigeons choose one of two concurrently available grain sources. Such changes characteristically accompany the production of response-produced food and account for prior reports of responding to produce food in the presence of freely available food.

Severe global cooling at about that time, preceded and followed by warmer conditions, is implied also by other glacial, floral, and some oceanographic evidence, but not by other oceanographic evidence nor by studies of past eustatic sea levels. Severe global cooling at about that time is incompatible with the Milankovitch theory of climatic change."
https://openalex.org/W1984224027,Model calculations of Jupiter's electron and proton radiation belts indicate that the Galilean satellites can reduce particle fluxes in certain regions of the inner magnetosphere by as much as six orders of magnitude. Average fluxes should be reduced by a factor of 100 or more along the Pioneer 10 trajectory through the heart of Jupiter's radiation belts in early December. This may be enough to prevent serious radiation damage to the spacecraft.

https://openalex.org/W2094852492,Predictions of Jupiter's electron and proton radiation belts are based mainly on decimeter observations of 1966 and 1968. Extensive calculations modeling radial diffusion of particles inward from the solar wind and electron synchrotron radiation are used to relate the predictions and observations.
