https://openalex.org/W1995032745,"The nucleotide sequence of a cloned 5.3 kilobase cDNA for the human low density lipoprotein receptor revealed five domains in the 839 amino acid protein: 322 NH2-terminal amino acids, extremely rich in disulfide-bonded cysteine residues (15%) and including an 8-fold repeat of 40 residues that may contain the LDL binding site; 350 residues homologous to the precursor of mouse epidermal growth factor; a region immediately outside the plasma membrane, rich in serine and threonine and the site of O-linked glycosylation; 22 hydrophobic amino acids, spanning the plasma membrane; and 50 COOH-terminal amino acids, projecting into the cytoplasm. The mRNA for the receptor contains a 3' untranslated region of 2.5 kilobases that includes multiple copies of the Alu family of repetitive DNAs. Transfection of simian COS cells with the human LDL receptor cDNA linked to the SV40 early promoter resulted in expression of functional cell surface receptors."

We find one loop for each of the tandemly repeated histone gene clusters. The attachment site is localized in the A + T rich H1-H3 spacer on a 657 bp fragment. In the cluster of the hsp70 heat-shock genes, in both control and heat-shocked cells, we find two attachment sites in close proximity upstream of regulatory elements. The transcribed sequences are not associated with the nuclear scaffold in control or in heat-shocked cells. A family of attachment sites related by hybridization to those of the hsp70 genes was discovered."
https://openalex.org/W2019081472,"Specific binding of dnaA protein to the E. coli origin of replication (oriC) is essential for initiation of chromosomal replication. Based on binding of plasmid DNA fragments, dnaA protein recognizes in addition to oriC a number of specific sites: within or near the replication origins of pSC101, pBR322, and ColE1; within the regulatory regions of the dnaA and ""X-protein"" genes; and in IRL-Tn5. All strong binding sites share a common 9 bp sequence, 5'-TTATCACACAA, repeated at four conserved positions within oriC. As shown by DNAase I footprinting, dnaA protein binding is highly cooperative, covering 250 bp at oriC and 100 bp at single 9 bp sequence sites. Consistent with filter-binding and nuclease-protection studies, complexes of 20 to 30 dnaA monomers are visualized at oriC and other sites by electron microscopy. The functions of dnaA complexes and 9 bp sequences at these sites are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1995112067,"A sequence from the Ubx 5' exon in the bithorax complex of Drosophila melanogaster was expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria. This protein was used to raise rabbit antisera and monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies detect antigens that, on protein blots and by immunofluorescence on whole mounts of imaginal discs, show the predicted segmental distribution of Ubx products. These products are predominantly, if not totally, localized in the cell nucleus. In the embryonic nervous system nuclei are labeled from the second thoracic segment to the eighth abdominal segment. There is no labeling in homozygous Df bxd100 embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2028740451,"We examine the interaction between polyoma-virus-encoded middle tumor antigen and the cellular src gene product, pp60c-src, using a series of monoclonal antibodies that recognize mammalian pp60c-src. Our results show that infection of mouse cells with transformation-competent strains of polyoma virus results in the stimulation of pp60c-src kinase activity severalfold over that observed in uninfected mouse cells and mouse cells infected with transformation-deficient polyoma virus. A similar degree of enhancement of pp60c-src kinase activity was found in polyoma-virus-transformed rodent cells. No differences were detected in the level of pp60c-src synthesis in polyoma-virus-infected and uninfected mouse cells or polyoma-virus-transformed and normal rodent cells. These studies demonstrate that polyoma-virus-encoded middle tumor antigen is associated with pp60c-src in lysates of polyoma-virus-infected and polyoma-virus-transformed cells and suggest a novel mechanism for the functional activation of a cellular proto-oncogene product, namely, that the interaction between middle tumor antigen and pp60c-src leads to a stimulation of pp60c-src tyrosyl kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1972966267,"L cells expressing either the A/NT/60/68 nucleoprotein or the A/PR/8/34 (H1) hemagglutinin by DNA mediated gene transfer were used to investigate recognition by influenza A specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). A subpopulation of CTL that recognized the H1 hemagglutinin was detected in mice primed with either A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) or A/JAP/305/57 (H2N2) influenza viruses. However, neither CTL from mice primed with A/NT/60/68 (H3N2) nor the recombinant virus X31 (H3N2) showed any activity on L cells expressing H1. These results showed that the majority of fully crossreactive CTL do not recognize the hemagglutinin molecule. A comparison between nucleoprotein and hemagglutinin transfected L cells reveals the nucleoprotein as the major target for CTL that are crossreactive on the three pandemic strains of human influenza A virus."
https://openalex.org/W2061234561,"A functionally rearranged mu heavy chain immunoglobulin (lg) gene was introduced into the germ line of mice. The mu gene encodes a polypeptide which, combined with lambda 1 light chains, shows a specificity for binding the hapten NP. Four transgenic mice harboring 20-140 copies of the foreign mu gene expressed the gene specifically in spleen, lymph node, and thymus at a high level. Purified surface lg-positive B cells, Lyt 2-positive mature T cells, and thymocytes transcribed the foreign mu gene at a similarly high level, suggesting that control of lg gene rearrangement might be the only mechanism that determines the specificity of heavy chain gene expression within the lymphoid cell lineage. No transcription of the foreign mu gene was detected in nonlymphoid tissues with the exception of the heart which expressed the gene at a low level. The transgenic mice had up to 400-fold elevated serum levels of NP binding antibody, which contained a heavy chain with the characteristics of the foreign mu gene. The serum levels of endogenous heavy and light chains in transgenic mice appeared to be the same as in normal mice."
https://openalex.org/W1542089964,"A method for the rapid purification of caldesmon, an F-actin binding protein of smooth muscle, has been developed. Caldesmon remains native after heating at 90 degrees C, a property that provides the basis for the purification in high yield of both caldesmon and tropomyosin, another heat-stable protein of smooth muscle. Caldesmon purified by this procedure is a highly asymmetric protein with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 2.7 S and a Stokes radius of about 91 A. The protein exists as two polypeptide chains of Mr = 135,000 and 140,000, with each Mr polypeptide being resolvable into several isoelectric species. Estimates based on densitometry of stained gels suggest that caldesmon is more abundant in smooth muscle than filamin or alpha-actinin. Purified caldesmon bound to F-actin in the pH range 6-8. Binding was unaffected by Ca2+ or Mg2+ at up to millimolar levels. Binding was saturable, with a polypeptide molar ratio of about one caldesmon to six actins at saturation. F-actin binding was not inhibited by saturating levels of tropomyosin. Caldesmon dramatically increased the viscosity of F-actin. Light microscopy and electron microscopy of negatively stained material revealed that caldesmon induced the formation of massive F-actin bundles which contained up to hundreds of filaments. Electron microscopy of sectioned caldesmon-saturated F-actin mixtures revealed large bundles which appeared to include linear arrays of regularly spaced actin filaments cut transversely, exhibiting a center to center spacing of 15 nm. Possible structural implications based on the existence of these structures is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1523373796,"Homogeneous porcine calpain (Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteinase) was found to hydrolyze a variety of peptides and synthetic substrates. Leu-Trp-Met-Arg-Phe-Ala, eledoisin-related peptide, alpha-neoendorphin, angiotensin I, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, neurotensin, dynorphin, glucagon, and oxidized insulin B chain were cleaved with a general preference for a Tyr, Met, or Arg residue in the P1 position preceded by a Leu or Val residue in the P2 position. No great difference in specificity was found between low-Ca2+-requiring calpain I and high-Ca2+-requiring calpain II. 4-Methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) derivatives having a Leu(or Val)-Met(or Tyr)-MCA or a Leu-Lys-MCA sequence were also cleaved by either calpain I or calpain II with preference for Leu over Val by a factor of 9 to 16. Calpains I and II showed similar but not identical kinetic behavior for individual substrates. The Km and kcat values ranged from 0.23 to 7.08 mM and 0.062 to 0.805 s-1 for the calpains, while kcat/Km values for the calpains were only 1/433 to 1/5 of those for papain with a given substrate. With succinyl-Leu-Met(or Tyr)-MCA, calpains I and II were half-maximally activated at 12 and 260 microM Ca2+, respectively, and competitively inhibited by leupeptin (Ki = 0.32 microM for I and 0.43 microM for II) or antipain (Ki = 1.41 microM for I and 1.45 microM for II). Thus, this is the first report describing the specificity and kinetics of calpains I and II."
https://openalex.org/W2013986489,"Simian sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3 (SSV-NIH 3T3) and SSV-NRK cells secrete a potent growth-promoting activity identical with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in mitogenic assays. The secreted activity is blocked by anti-PDGF antisera and competes with 125I-PDGF for receptor binding, suggesting that the secreted protein is the transforming protein of SSV, p28v-sis, or its processed product. Secreted p28v-sis appears to stimulate autocrine cell growth of SSV-transformed cells because anti-PDGF antisera block 3H-thymidine incorporation into growing SSV-NIH 3T3 and SSV-NRK cells. SSV-transformed cells have reduced numbers of high-affinity 125I-PDGF receptors; PDGF/p28v-sis receptor was purified from SSV-NIH 3T3 cells and retained active protein tyrosine kinase activity stimulated by PDGF. The rate of tumor growth in athymic nude mice injected with SSV-transformed cells was compared with levels of secreted growth factor activity. The rate of tumor growth in nude mice correlated directly with levels of p28v-sis secreted by SSV-transformedv cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976669574,"Norepinephrine, briefly superfused during high-frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers in the rat hippocampal slice in vitro, produced a reversible increase in the magnitude, duration, and probability of induction of long-term synaptic potentiation in the CA3 subfield. Similar results were obtained with isoproterenol, whereas propranolol or timolol reversibly blocked long-term potentiation. Norepinephrine had little apparent effect on responses obtained during low-frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers. These data suggest that norepinephrine can mediate long-lasting, frequency-dependent modulation of synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Furthermore, the results suggest a plausible mechanism for some of the known associative interactions between synaptic inputs to hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1521840182,"A-431 cells were treated with inhibitors of either N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin or glucosamine) or of N-linked oligosaccharide processing (swainsonine or monensin) to examine the glycosylation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and to determine the effect of glycosylation modification on receptor function. The receptor was found to be an Mr = 130,000 polypeptide to which a relatively large amount of carbohydrate is added co-translationally in the form of N-linked oligosaccharides. Processing of these oligosaccharides accounts for the 10,000-dalton difference in electrophoretic migration between the Mr = 160,000 precursor and Mr = 170,000 mature forms of the receptor. No evidence was found for O-linked oligosaccharides on the receptor. Mr = 160,000 receptors resulting from swainsonine or monensin treatment were present on the cell surface and retained full function, as judged by 125I-EGF binding to intact cells and detergent-solubilized extracts and by in vitro phosphorylation in the absence or presence of EGF. On the other hand, when cells were treated with tunicamycin or glucosamine, ligand binding was reduced by more than 50% in either intact cells or solubilized cell extracts. The Mr = 130,000 receptors synthesized in the presence of these inhibitors were not found on the cell surface. In addition, no Mr = 130,000 phosphoprotein was detected in the in vitro phosphorylation of tunicamycin or glucosamine-treated cells. It appears, therefore, that although terminal processing of N-linked oligosaccharides is not necessary for proper translocation or function of the EGF receptor, the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides is required."
https://openalex.org/W1974005072,"Many mammary tumors induced by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) contain a provirus in the same region of the host-cell genome, leading to expression of a putative cellular oncogene called int-1. Here we present the structure and nucleotide sequence of int-1. We have established several proviral insertion sites exactly by nuclease S1 analysis or by molecular cloning and DNA sequencing. The protein-encoding domain of int-1 is distributed over four exons. At the 5' end of the gene two overlapping exons were detected, one of which is preceded by a TATA box. The deduced int-1-encoded protein has 370 amino acids, with a preponderance of hydrophobic residues at the NH2 terminus. Proviruses are found at both sides of the gene, usually oriented away from the gene. Downstream integrations occur frequently in the long 3' untranslated region of the last exon. One upstream provirus is inserted in the 5' untranslated region and, unlike the other upstream insertions, in the same orientation as the int-1 gene. Proviral integrations always leave the protein-encoding domain intact, providing further evidence that the int-1 protein contributes an essential step in mammary tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1589339185,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a brittle-bone disorder, constitutes a major group of the inherited diseases of connective tissue. We have been studying an autosomal recessive form of OI in which the severely affected patient has inherited two abnormal pro-alpha 2(I) collagen alleles from consanguinous parents. Previously, nuclease S1 mapping was employed to localize a defect in the mRNA coding for the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen carboxyl-propeptide. The mutation prevents incorporation of pro-alpha 2(I) chains into the normal type I procollagen heterotrimer resulting in secretion of only pro-alpha 1(I) homotrimers. Here we report complete characterization of the corresponding region of the altered gene. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization showed a small homozygous deletion in the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene of the patient and a heterozygous pattern in both parents. Genomic cloning of the patient's DNA revealed a four nucleotide frameshift deletion in exon 1 near the end of translation which apparently instigates use of a new termination codon four nucleotides 3' to the original site. The mutation identified in this OI patient directly demonstrates the critical role of the carboxyl-propeptides in chain selection and assembly during the biosynthesis of procollagen."
https://openalex.org/W2170710432,"We have localized the antitermination system involved in E. coli ribosomal RNA transcription and compared it with antitermination in the lamboid bacteriophages. In vivo experiments with gene-fusion plasmids were used to examine the ability of specific areas of the rrnG control region to convert an ordinary transcription complex into antitermination transcription complex. A 67 bp restriction fragment immediately following the rrnG P2 promoter decreased transcription termination about 50%. This fragment contains box A-, box B-, and box C-like sequences similar to those in lambda nut loci. It also caused transcripts from lac and hybrid trp-lac promoters to read through a transcription terminator. Translation through the 67 bp segment or reversal of its orientation resulted in complete loss of antitermination activity. We conclude that the E. coli ribosomal RNA operons possess an antitermination system similar to that used by the bacteriophage lambda."
https://openalex.org/W2085141643,"The 35 nucleotide spliced leader (SL) sequence is found on the 5' end of numerous trypanosome mRNAs, yet the tandemly organized reiteration units encoding this leader are not detectably linked to any of these structural genes. Here we report the presence of a class of discrete small SL RNA molecules that are derived from the genomic SL reiteration units of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leptomonas collosoma. These small SL RNAs are 135, 105, and 95 nucleotides, respectively, and contain a 5'-terminal SL or SL-like sequence. S1 nuclease analyses demonstrate that these small SL RNAs are transcribed from continuous sequence within the respective SL reiteration units. With the exception of the SL sequence and a concensus donor splice site immediately following it, these small RNAs are not well conserved. We suggest that the small SL RNAs may function as a donor of the SL sequence in an intermolecular process that places the SL at the 5' terminus of many trypanosomatid mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2105994871,"The human sis proto-oncogene contains the coding sequence for one of two polypeptide chains present in preparations of biologically active human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). A human clone, c-sis clone 8, which contains all of the v-sis-related sequences present in human DNA, was transcriptionally inactive when transfected into NIH/3T3 cells. When placed under the control of a retrovirus LTR, the clone was transcribed at levels comparable to that observed in cells transformed by SSV DNA. However, c-sis clone 8 DNA did not express detectable sis/PDGF-2 proteins and lacked biologic activity. A putative upstream exon was identified by its ability to detect the 4.2 kb sis-related transcript in certain human cells. When this sequence was inserted in the proper orientation between the LTR and c-sis clone 8, the chimeric molecule acquired high titered transforming activity, comparable to that of SSV DNA. Transformants containing this construct expressed human sis/PDGF-2 translational products. Thus the normal coding sequence for a human growth factor has transforming activity when expressed in an appropriate assay cell."
https://openalex.org/W1495721887,"Tumor promoters cause a variety of effects in cultured cells, at least some of which are thought to result from activation of the Ca2+-phospholipid-stimulated protein kinase C. One action of tumor promoters is the modulation of the binding and phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in A431 cells. To determine if these compounds act on the EGF receptor by substituting for the endogenous activator of C kinase, diacylglycerol, we compared the effects of the potent tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) with those of the synthetic diacylglycerol analog 1-oleyl 2-acetyl diglycerol (OADG). When A431 cells were treated with TPA, the subcellular distribution of C kinase activity shifted from a predominantly cytosolic location to a membrane-associated state; OADG also caused the disappearance of cytosolic C kinase activity. The shift in the subcellular distribution of C kinase, caused by TPA or OADG, correlated with changes in binding and phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. OADG, like TPA, caused loss of binding to an apparent high affinity class of receptors, blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, and stimulated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at both serine and threonine residues. No difference between the phosphopeptide maps of receptors from cells treated with OADG or TPA was observed. Thus, it appears that tumor promoters can exert their effects on the EGF receptors by substituting for diacylglycerol, presumably by activating protein kinase C. Further, these results suggest that endogenously produced diacylglycerol may have a role in normal growth regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2074237669,"We have characterized two types of recombination events between linear plasmids and yeast chromosomal telomere-adjacent sequences (Y' elements). In one type of event, a linear plasmid restriction-cut within a Y' element regains the missing Y' DNA, and may also acquire additional Y' elements. This process is similar to the healing of broken chromosomes by recombination. In a second type of event, terminally added C1-3A sequences on the linear plasmid interact with C1-3A sequences located just internal to the chromosomal Y' elements, resulting in the addition of one to four Y' elements to the plasmid. Similar recombination events occurring between different chromosome ends could lead to the dispersal and amplification of telomere-adjacent sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1571922057,"The immunoglobulin fraction prepared from the serum of a rabbit immunized with purified type II insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor from rat placenta was tested for its specificity in inhibiting receptor binding of 125I-IGF II and for its ability to modulate IGF II action on rat hepatoma H-35 cells. The specific binding of 125I-IGF II to plasma membrane preparations from several rat cell types and tissues was inhibited by the anti-IGF II receptor Ig. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-IGF II to the Mr = 250,000 type II IGF receptor structure in rat liver membranes was blocked by the anti-receptor Ig, while no effect on affinity labeling of insulin receptor with 125I-insulin or IGF I receptor with 125I-IGF I or 125I-IGF II was observed. The specific inhibition of ligand binding to the IGF II receptor by anti-receptor Ig was species-specific such that mouse receptor was less potently inhibited and human receptor was unaffected. Rat hepatoma H-35 cells contain insulin and IGF II receptor, but not IGF I receptor, and respond half-maximally to insulin at 10(-10) M and to IGF II at higher concentrations with increased cell proliferation (Massague, J., Blinderman, L.A., and Czech, M.P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13958-13963). Addition of anti-IGF II receptor Ig to intact H-35 cells inhibited the specific binding of 125I-IGF II to the cells by 70-90%, but had no detectable effect on 125I-insulin binding. Significantly, under identical conditions anti-IGF II receptor Ig was without effect on IGF II action on DNA synthesis at both submaximal and maximal concentrations of IGF II. This finding and the higher concentrations of IGF II required for growth promotion in comparison to insulin strongly suggest that the Mr = 250,000 receptor structure for IGF II is not involved in mediating this physiological response. Rather, at least in H-35 cells, the insulin receptor appears to mediate the effects of IGF II on cell growth. Consistent with this interpretation, anti-insulin receptor Ig but not anti-IGF II receptor Ig mimicked the ability of growth factors to stimulate DNA synthesis in H-35 cells. We conclude that the IGF II receptor may not play a role in transmembrane signaling, but rather serves some other physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W2014747616,"We have derived rat cell lines producing different and regulatable amounts of pp60v-src by introducing the src gene of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) under the control of the glucocorticoid-responsive transcriptional promoter from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We find that the cellular phenotype is strictly dependent upon the dose of pp60v-src with a distinct threshold for changes indicative of neoplastic potential. Cells with low constitutive levels of pp60v-src are not phenotypically distinguishable from cells without v-src, but as little as a 4-fold increment in pp60v-src produces morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth. These properties of the transformed state are achieved at levels of pp60v-src far below levels found in an RSV-transformed cell line, without detectable increase in phosphorylation of the major cellular target for tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2079543136,"We have delimited the region of transcription termination in the α-amylase gene Amy-2a. Mapping of in vitro elongated nascent transcripts to Amy-2a restriction fragments indicates that transcription terminates in a region between 2.5 and 4 kb downstream of the polyadenylation site. These runoff transcription experiments, combined with S1 nuclease mapping of nuclear transcripts at steady state, suggest that transcription termination occurs at multiple sites."
https://openalex.org/W2083896717,"The control of transcription initiation at the lactose operon promoter was investigated in vitro. We found that an upstream promoter (termed lac P2) interfered with RNA polymerase binding at the principal promoter (termed lac P1). The start site for lac P2 was located at base pair position -22 relative to the P1 start site. The addition of cAMP receptor protein and cAMP was shown to repress lac P2 and to activate lac P1. Abortive initiation reactions for both promoters were used to investigate the coordinate repression-activation elicited by CRP-cAMP. The effects of lac promoter mutations (L8, Ps, and UV5) were consistent with an important RNA polymerase positioning role for CRP-cAMP in the activation of lac operon expression."
https://openalex.org/W1514956241,"The temporal relationship between the occupancy of the thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)) and glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) receptors and the rate of growth hormone (GH) gene transcription and mRNA accumulation were investigated. The GC line of cultured rat pituitary tumor cells was used in these studies. The rate of GH gene transcription was measured by elongation of in vivo initiated RNA chains in isolated nuclei using radioactive precursors and hybridization of labeled transcripts to immobilized GH gene sequences. T3 receptor occupancy was directly proportional to the rate of GH gene transcription during the initial phase of hormone induction. These results suggest that a single occupied receptor is sufficient to fully activate the gene and that the unoccupied receptor resides close to the gene regulatory site. A decrease in GH gene transcription rapidly followed the initial increase in activity. This decrease occurred in the absence of new protein synthesis and was not accompanied by a proportional decrease in the level of occupied T3 receptor. An analysis of dexamethasone activation of GH gene transcription found maximum stable binding of occupied receptor to nuclei within 5 min of hormone addition, while transcription of the gene did not become fully activated until 30 to 60 min later. Transcription of the gene then declined to a rate 2 to 3 times that observed before addition of dexamethasone. These results suggest that at least one relatively slow molecular step precedes glucocorticoid hormone-receptor enhancement of gene transcription and that a second molecular event later attenuates the response. The simultaneous addition of both hormones produced two peaks of enhanced transcription, each apparently due to the separate effects of the hormones. GH mRNA levels were closely linked to the rate of transcription of the gene under all induction conditions. Comparison of the rates of decay of GH mRNA in cells cultured in the presence or the absence of hormones suggests that GH mRNA is much more stable when T3 is present. The glucocorticoid responses of the gene were consistently obtained only in the presence of T3. These results and the transcriptional synergism of the two hormones suggest a direct interaction of the occupied receptors at their regulatory sites. The transcriptional effects of glucocorticoids were observed only in about half the experiments performed in the absence of T3. When transcriptional activation did not occur, GH mRNA usually still increased 24 h after hormone treatment was begun, but not early in the induction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This finding suggests that, in mammals, rhodopsin kinase functions in the pineal gland and other tissues to phosphorylate rhodopsin-like integral membrane receptors and is thereby involved in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1981937425,"A molecular genetic analysis has been performed using as subjects an Albanian family in which the father is a silent carrier, the mother has high Hb A2-β thalassemia trait, and both children have β thalassemia. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the daughter's paternal β-globin gene and its flanking regions failed to reveal any base changes of known functional significance. When introduced into HeLa cells the gene was expressed at normal levels with proper processing of RNA. Haplotype analysis revealed that the affected son and daughter inherited different ϵγδβ-globin gene clusters from the father. The silent carrier allele is not due to a mutation within the β-globin structural gene or its flanking regions and as such represents a novel form of β+ thalassemia."
https://openalex.org/W1587148305,"The gamma chain of human fibrinogen exists in 2 nonallelic forms, gamma A and gamma B, which differ only in their carboxyl termini. We have found that only one genomic locus exists for gamma-fibrinogen and that the gamma A and gamma B chains arise by alternate mRNA splicing near the 3' end of this gene. In contrast to the rat gamma B mRNA which is produced by alternate splicing with identical polyadenylation sites, human gamma B is produced when the eighth intervening sequence remains unspliced and a polyadenylation signal within this intron is used. The new carboxyl terminus is 16 amino acids longer than the gamma A protein, and although there is only minimal homology between the rat and human carboxyl termini they share a very high proportion of acidic amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2085647205,"We have analyzed antigenic variants with a known lineage and show that there are several telomeres on which variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes can be expressed. These telomeres have similar restriction maps 5' to the barren region. In addition, the same VSG gene was expressed on different telomeres. Some antigenic switches in the lineage were accomplished by duplicative replacement of one VSG gene with another. Other switches occurred without duplication by transcriptional activation of an alternate telomeric VSG gene. We call the latter process telomeric activation and propose that these two processes can occur independently. We further propose that antigenic switching by telomeric activation is mediated by the regulatory system that controls which telomere is transcriptionally active, while the duplicative mechanism does not."
https://openalex.org/W2072227693,"We present evidence that Tn10 transposase promotes double strand breaks and single strand joints at Tn10 termini in vivo. Plasmids containing a shortened Tn10 element and a transposase overproducer fusion give rise, upon transposase induction, to new DNA species. The most prominent class is a circularized transposon molecule whose structure suggests that it arises from double strand breakage at the two transposon ends followed by covalent joining between the 3' and 5' ends of one of the two strands. We have used formation of the circularized transposon as a physical assay for the interaction between transposase and different mutant and wild-type termini. These experiments show that transposase protein interacts preferentially with the genetically most active termini in a way that suppresses productive interaction with weaker termini present on the same substrate molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2061769726,"Human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV) are closely associated with some human T-cell leukemias and lymphomas. A unique 3' region of the HTLV genome is believed to be involved in HTLV-induced cellular transformation, although the function of this region has yet to be determined. A subgenomic messenger RNA transcribed from this region of HTLV has now been characterized. These results provide direct evidence for the expression of a novel gene in HTLV."
https://openalex.org/W2144554373,"The mutation, oligosyndactyly, results in syndactyly, muscle anomalies, and diabetes insipidus in heterozygous mice. When homozygous, the mutation is lethal early in development. Although homozygous embryos are able to form blastocyst outgrowths (the in vitro equivalent to implantation), cells begin to accumulate in mitosis as early as the blastocyst stage. Even though the cytologic appearance is that of mitotic cells treated with a microtubule inhibitor such as colcemid, the homozygous embryos do, in fact, have normal appearing mitotic spindles. These results define the Os mutation as one which, in the homozygous state, prevents the movement of chromosomes from the metaphase plate. It is the first mammalian developmental mutation to be so defined and is unique among all mitotic arrest mutations thus far described in higher eucaryotes."

When antibodies to the 22 residue peptide are microinjected into monolayer baby hamster kidney cells before or shortly after infection with wildtype VSV, G protein accumulates in large intracellular patches and little G is observed in the Golgi complex or at the cell surface. In contrast, when antibodies to the 11 residue peptide are injected, no such patches are observed and G protein is seen colocalized with the injected antibody at the endoplasmic reticulum, in the Golgi complex, in transport vesicles, and at the plasma membrane. Microinjection of these antibodies does not disturb the pathway or kinetics of G-protein transport. In cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of VSV, 045, the glycoprotein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum at 39.8°C, but rapidly moves through the Golgi apparatus and then to the cell surface after a temperature shift-down to 32°C. Using rhodamine-coupled antibodies to the 11 residue peptide, a microscope stage equipped for precise temperature control, and a silicon intensifier target video camera, we can visualize by video light microscopy the synchronized exocytotic transport of the G protein directly in the living cell."
https://openalex.org/W1676883243,"Stimulation of parenchymal cell alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, with either epinephrine or the specific alpha-agonist phenylephrine or the beta-agonist isoproterenolol, promoted a net Ca2+ influx when the pH of the external medium was greater than pH 7.7. The effect was both time- and dose-dependent. At the elevated pH of 8.1, alpha-adrenergic receptors were still able to mobilize intracellular Ca2+, since when the external Ca2+ concentration was reduced to 0.05 mM, epinephrine promoted net Ca2+ efflux. The data suggest the existence of a Ca2+/H+ antiport or a Ca2+/OH- symport in the plasma membrane which can be stimulated by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors. It is proposed that the Ca2+ influx mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors helps maintain the elevated cytosolic [Ca2+]i for longer time periods after the initial mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores."
https://openalex.org/W1529388619,"Under physiological conditions, integration of lambda DNA into the Escherichia coli chromosome requires the direct participation of only two proteins, the viral int gene product and E. coli integration host factor (IHF). A variant of the int gene has been isolated that permits integrative recombination in cells mutant for one of the two subunits of IHF (Miller, H.I., Mozola, M.A., and Friedman, D.I. (1980) Cell 20, 721-729). In the present work, we have purified Int-h, the product of this variant gene. In contrast to the wild-type int gene product (Int+), which produces almost no recombinants in the absence of IHF, purified Int-h protein sponsors reduced but significant levels of integrative recombination in the absence of any E. coli supplement. This shows that the int gene encodes all the information necessary for the elementary steps in recombination and implies that IHF functions as an accessory protein. When supplemented by IHF, recombination promoted by Int-h resembles that promoted by Int+ in kinetics, stoichiometry of Int and IHF, and nature of the recombinant product. Under these conditions, Int-h uses supercoiled DNA more effectively than nonsupercoiled DNA as a substrate for recombination, as does Int+. However, in the absence of IHF, Int-h recombines supercoiled and nonsupercoiled substrates identically, indicating that IHF is an important part of the mechanism that senses the supercoiled state of the substrate DNA during recombination. A surprising difference in recombination carried out by Int-h in the presence or absence of IHF concerns the degree to which sites on the same circle recombine with one another as opposed to sites on sister molecules. In the presence of IHF, Int-h favors intramolecular recombination, as does Int+. However, in the absence of IHF, Int-h almost exclusively promotes intermolecular recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1497983649,"A DNA-dependent ATPase found in crude preparations of the phage T4 gene 32 protein, shown to be the product of the nonessential T4 dda gene, has been purified to apparent homogeneity and free of nucleases. The dda protein hydrolyzes ATP or dATP to the respective nucleoside diphosphates, in a reaction that is completely dependent on the presence of DNA. DNA in a single-stranded form is strongly preferred and there is little effect of differences in strand length or base composition. We show that the dda protein is the DNA helicase previously studied by Krell et al. (Krell, H., Durwald, H., and Hoffmann-Berling, H. (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 94, 387-395); it can unwind extensive stretches of double-stranded DNA very rapidly, appearing to move with a 5‘-3‘ polarity relative to the single DNA strand to which it initially binds. The reaction is highly distributive, indicating that the dda protein is continuously dissociating and reassociating with the DNA being unwound. The T4 gene 32 protein, a single-strand-binding, helix-destabilizing protein, competes with the dda protein for binding to single-stranded DNA. Consequently, it seems to inhibit rather than to promote the helicase reaction. The other known T4-encoded DNA helicase, the gene 41 protein, has little effect on the helicase activity of the dda protein. These results are relevant to the suspected role of the dda protein in phage T4 DNA replication, as well as to its possible role in phage genetic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1510433774,"The receptor-binding properties and in vitro biological effects of a highly active gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, [N-acetyl-D-p-chloro-Phe1,2D-Trp3,D-Lys6,D-Ala10]GnRH, were compared with those of the GnRH superagonist analog, [D-Ala6] des-Gly10-GnRH-N-ethylamide. In rat pituitary particles and isolated pituitary cells, the 125I-labeled GnRH antagonist showed saturable high-affinity binding (Ka v 8.4 +/- 1.4 X 10(9) M-1) to the same receptor sites which bound the GnRH agonist. The rate of dissociation of the receptor-bound antagonist from pituitary particles and cells was extremely slow in comparison with that of the agonist ligand. Also, dissociation of the antagonist analog was incomplete, with a residual fraction of tightly bound ligand that was proportional to the duration of preincubation. The [D-Lys6]GnRH antagonist prevented GnRH-induced luteinizing hormone release during static incubation and superfusion of cultured pituitary cells, but in contrast to the agonist did not cause desensitization of the gonadotroph. Although the antagonist caused a prolonged reduction in available GnRH receptor sites, this was attributable to persistent occupancy by the slowly dissociating ligand rather than to receptor loss. Autoradiographic analysis of [D-Lys6]GnRH-antagonist uptake by cultured pituitary cells revealed that the peptide remained bound at the cell membrane for up to 2 h, in contrast with the rapid endocytosis of GnRH agonists. The slow dissociation of receptor-bound antagonist was consistent with its ability to cause sustained blockade of GnRH actions, and its prolonged cell-surface location suggests that receptor activation is necessary to initiate the rapid internalization of hormone-receptor complexes that is a feature of the agonist-stimulated gonadotroph."
https://openalex.org/W1531398313,"Guanylate kinase was purified from human erythrocytes by affinity chromatography using GMP-agarose, and the four isozymes which are present were separated by chromatofocusing. The kinetic properties of each isozyme were analyzed with respect to the natural substrates GMP and dGMP, and the 5'-monophosphate derivatives of the antiviral nucleoside analogs 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG) and 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine (ACV, Acyclovir). The analysis of substrate kinetics yielded Km values for DHPG 5'-monophosphate which were similar with all isozymes (42-54 microM), and about 3-fold higher than the Km values obtained for GMP. Km values obtained with ACV 5'-monophosphate were 10-20-fold higher than the GMP values and varied nearly 4-fold among isozymes (209-753 microM). GMP produced the highest enzyme velocities with all isozymes, followed by dGMP, DHPG 5'-monophosphate, and ACV 5'-monophosphate, in that order. Differences in maximal velocities among isozymes were generally small. DHPG 5'-monophosphate inhibited the isozymes by a simple competitive mechanism with respect to GMP. In contrast, ACV 5'-monophosphate acted as an apparent hyperbolic mixed-type inhibitor. Similar patterns of inhibition were obtained with all isozymes. It is probable that differences is the reactivity of DHPG 5'-monophosphate and ACV 5'-monophosphate with individual guanylate kinase isozymes do not contribute significantly to differences in their antiviral effects."
https://openalex.org/W1557410956,"The recent observation that ammonium sulfate stabilizes cell-surface [3H]cyclic AMP binding in Dictyostelium discoideum (Van Haastert, P., and Kien, E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9636-9642) led us to attempt to identify the surface cAMP receptor by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P]cAMP using this stabilization technique. 8-azido-[32P]cAMP specifically labeled a polypeptide which migrates as a closely spaced doublet (Mr = 40,000 to 43,000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Greater than 60% of the labeled polypeptide was found associated with membranes. This protein was distinguished from the cytosolic regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Mr = 41,000) by differences in developmental regulation, specificity, and subcellular localization. No kinase regulatory subunit was detected in membranes by western blot analysis. Our preliminary observations show that labeling of this doublet correlates closely with cAMP-binding activity, suggesting that it is the surface receptor which mediates chemotaxis and cAMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1652230776,"Rat liver fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) is a 14,200-Da polypeptide that is abundantly represented in the cytosol of liver and small intestinal epithelial cells. It may play an important role in the intracellular transport and metabolism of fatty acids. We have recently determined its sequence from an analysis of cloned cDNAs (Gordon, J.I., Alpers, D.H., Ockner, R. K., and Strauss, A.W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3356-3363). With the availability of full-length cloned FABP cDNAs, genetic manipulation of the coding region introduced into an appropriate expression vector could provide a powerful tool for analyzing the molecular details of fatty acyl-protein interaction. We, therefore, have inserted the coding sequence of rat FABP cDNA into a prokaryotic expression vector. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were used to properly space the initiator methionine residue downstream from a Shine-Dalgarno ribosome-binding site. FABP transcription in the chimeric plasmid was under the direction of the leftward promotor of phage lambda. Promotor activity in turn was regulated by a thermolabile repressor specified by a defective lambda prophage contained in the host chromosome. When grown at permissive temperatures, rat liver FABP represented approximately 0.8% of radiolabeled soluble bacterial proteins. Edman degradation of FABP purified from Escherichia coli lysates indicated that it was intact. However, its NH2 terminus was not acetylated as it is in mammalian tissues. A frameshift mutation was introduced in vitro into the coding region of FABP cDNA. The effects of this on fatty acyl-protein interaction were examined using a solid phase (oleic acid-Sepharose) binding assay. Amino acid sequence rearrangements in the COOH-terminal region of rat liver FABP had a significant effect on its ability to bind fatty acids as well as on its stability in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2098898501,"The analysis of the voltage-sensitive Ca++ channel of the unicellular eucaryote, Paramecium has been extended to a biochemical level based on recent observations that the transfer of cytoplasm from wild-type cells into mutants lacking Ca++-channel function (""pawn"" in P. tetraurelia and ""CNR"" in P. caudatum) causes mutant cells to regain Ca++-channel function. We have microinjected various cytoplasmic fractions into mutant cells and measured the restored Ca++-channel function using a convenient behavioral assay. Following the ""curing"" activity, we characterized and purified the component from wild-type cytoplasm that can restore the function missing in cells carrying mutations in the cnrC gene. The curing factor is not an RNA, but a heat-labile, -SH-containing protein that appears to affect existing mutant channels on the ciliary membrane. We have purified this factor over 500-fold from the soluble cytoplasm using conventional techniques. The protein is of low apparent molecular weight (less than 30,000 daltons), acidic, soluble, and does not have the properties of calmodulin."

https://openalex.org/W1521138589,"Abstract Activation of glycogen synthase in the perfused rat liver is defective in severely diabetic rats. In the present study, activation of glycogen synthase by glucose and increased incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen by insulin are defective in hepatocytes isolated from alloxan diabetic rats. Acute activation of glycogen synthase in hepatocytes isolated from diabetic rats was restored by treatment of the rats with insulin in vivo. Restoration of synthase activation was not achieved by incubation of hepatocytes in the presence of insulin in vitro for up to 12 h. When isolated hepatocytes from diabetic rats were placed in primary culture in a serum-free defined medium over a 3-day period, glycogen synthesis was partially restored by cortisol and triiodothyronine and dramatically increased by insulin. Concomitant with restoration of [14C]glycogen synthesis was an insulin-mediated increase in glycogen synthase I and synthase phosphatase activity. Restoration of regulation of glycogen synthesis in primary cultures of hepatocytes from diabetic rats by insulin required the presence of cortisol and triiodothyronine. Primary cultures of hepatocytes from normal rats did not require triiodothyronine for insulin to effect glycogenesis over a 3-day period. These data demonstrate that insulin acts in a chronic manner in concert with other hormones to control synthase phosphatase activity, an effect which may be influencing acute control of hepatic glycogen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1554708511,"The T4 bacteriophage dda protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase that is the product of an apparently nonessential T4 gene. We have examined its effects on in vitro DNA synthesis catalyzed by a purified, multienzyme T4 DNA replication system. When DNA synthesis is catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase on a single-stranded DNA template, the addition of the dda protein is without effect whether or not other replication proteins are present. In contrast, on a double-stranded DNA template, where a mixture of the DNA polymerase, its accessory proteins, and the gene 32 protein is required, the dda protein greatly stimulates DNA synthesis. The dda protein exerts this effect by speeding up the rate of replication fork movement; in this respect, it acts identically with the other DNA helicase in the T4 replication system, the T4 gene 41 protein. However, whereas a 41 protein molecule remains bound to the same replication fork for a prolonged period, the dda protein seems to be continually dissociating from the replication fork and rebinding to it as the fork moves. Some gene 32 protein is required to observe DNA synthesis on a double-stranded DNA template, even in the presence of the dda protein. However, there is a direct competition between this helix-destabilizing protein and the dda protein for binding to single-stranded DNA, causing the rate of replication fork movement to decrease at a high ratio of gene 32 protein to dda protein. As shown elsewhere, the dda protein becomes absolutely required for in vitro DNA synthesis when E. coli RNA polymerase molecules are bound to the DNA template, because these molecules otherwise stop fork movement (Bedinger, P., Hochstrasser, M., Jongeneel, C.V., and Alberts, B. M. (1983) Cell 34, 115-123)."
https://openalex.org/W1505220694,"Several studies have shown that proteolytic cleavage can enhance the biological activity of the growth hormone (GH) molecule. It seemed possible, therefore, that proteolytic modification of GH might be a normal function of GH-target tissues. Plasmalemma-enriched fractions isolated from rabbit liver were found to contain a proteinase(s) which cleaves the large disulfide loop of human and rat GH. The proteolytic activity was specific to plasmalemma-enriched fractions in that much lower activities were observed in microsomal-enriched fractions prepared from the same livers. The plasmalemmal proteinase(s) may be a trypsin-like enzyme because proteolytic activity was decreased by two serine proteinase inhibitors. Inhibition by unlabeled human GH of 125I-GH binding to receptors did not prevent cleavage of the tracer; therefore, hormone-receptor interaction was not required for cleavage of the GH molecule. In binding studies, cleaved GH associated more readily than did intact hormone with rabbit liver receptors. These studies suggest that plasmalemma-enriched fractions prepared from rabbit liver contain a proteinase which cleaves the GH molecule in a highly specific manner. Moreover, it is unlikely that inactivation of GH is the function of this limited proteolysis because cleaved hormone is bound preferentially by at least a subset of receptors in rabbit liver."
https://openalex.org/W1552309949,"Abstract In anaerobic phosphate buffer, pH 6.3-7.5, deoxyhemerythrin is oxidized to semi-methemerythrin (semi-met) by excess sodium nitrite. This oxidation is quantitative as judged by EPR spectroscopy. Further oxidation to methemerythrin is not detected. The absorbance changes of hemerythrin during the oxidation are biphasic. The rate of the faster first phase is linearly dependent on [H+] and [NO2-] suggesting that the oxidant is nitrous acid rather than nitrite. During the slower second phase, the characteristic EPR spectrum of semi-methemerythrin appears. The first phase can be interpreted by a scheme in which nitrous acid transforms deoxyhemerythrin (FeIIFeII) to the semi-met nitrosyl adduct (FeIIFeIIINO) and hydroxide. Independent experiments confirm that the combination of semi-met plus NO produces an EPR-silent adduct. The rates of the absorbance changes for the second phase are nearly independent of nitrite concentration and pH in the range 6.3-7.5. This slower phase involves the transformation of the EPR-silent intermediate to the semi-met nitrite adduct (FeIIFeIIINO2-) and is consistent with rate-limiting dissociation of nitric oxide followed by rapid attachment of nitrite. Nitrite appears to be a unique oxidant of deoxyhemerythrin in that when employed in excess, the final, stable product is semi-met- rather than methemerythrin. The lack of reactivity of ethyl nitrite with deoxyhemerythrin suggests that HONO oxidizes deoxyhemerythrin via an inner-sphere process in contrast to oxidants such as Fe(CN)6(3-). A proposed generalization is that excesses of inner-sphere oxidants convert deoxy to (semi-met)R, which is stabilized with respect to (semi-met)R, which is stabilized with respect to (semi-met)0 and met because the oxidant and/or a product of the oxidant can bind to the iron site."
https://openalex.org/W1527101868,"We have simultaneously quantitated alpha 1-adrenergic receptor occupation and agonist-elicited Ca2+ mobilization monitored as unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux from intact BC3H-1 muscle cells in order to examine the relationship between the number of surface receptors occupied and the functional response. [3H]Prazosin has been used to measure receptor number as well as the binding kinetics with surface receptors, and the observed equilibrium and kinetic constants are in close accord with values obtained previously in cellular homogenates. Since alpha 1-agonist-elicited 45Ca2+ efflux can be monitored over intervals of 3 min or less and prazosin dissociation from its receptor has a t 1/2 of 44 min, prazosin can be employed to produce a pseudoirreversible inactivation of receptors. A comparison of the remaining receptors and residual response reveals an inverse linear relationship between receptors inactivated by prazosin and 45Ca2+ efflux. A similar result is obtained following fractional receptor inactivation with the irreversible alkylating agent phenoxybenzamine. Parameters of receptor occupation and response also correlate well for the agonist phenylephrine and for the competitive antagonist phentolamine. The unitary relationship between sites available for occupation and response indicates that the alpha 1 receptor does not function as an oligomer where fewer bound antagonist molecules are required to block the receptor than sites of agonist occupation necessary for activation. Moreover, substantial evidence has accrued in intact smooth muscle for a receptor reserve or nonlinear coupling between alpha 1 receptor occupation and contraction in smooth muscle. Our findings demonstrate that such behavior does not exist for alpha 1 receptor-elicited mobilization of Ca2+ in the BC3H-1 muscle cell."
https://openalex.org/W1498513762,"We present an analysis of the influence of DNA superhelicity on the topology of chimeric plasmids. A correlation is found between topological variations and in vivo/in vitro functions. Data refer to the topological transitions observed in function of variations of the superhelical density in the three closed DNA domains that represent the three extreme examples, from the point of view of the topological organization, among many chimeric systems analyzed. The plasmids studied are ADR2-BS-pBR322 (the vector pBR322 + the yeast gene ADR2), ADR3-5c-yRp7 (containing yeast TRP1, a constitutive mutant of yeast ADR2, a fragment of 5 kilobases of unanalyzed chromosomal DNA and the vector pBR322), and p31 (pBR322 + a yeast DNA fragment encompassing the right moiety of the Ty1 element and its in vivo promoter). In the model systems analyzed, the topological transitions observed in the eukaryotic sequences (relevant in one case for activation of selective in vitro transcription (Ty), in another (ADR2) for the in vivo expression) take place in the range of superhelical densities predicted on theoretical ground (Vologodskii, A. V., Lukashin, A. V. Anshelevich, V. V. & Frank-Kamenetskii, M. D. (1979) Nucleic Acids Res. 6, 967-982)."
https://openalex.org/W1502848148,"Previously, we reported that pancreatic acini have specific receptors for the insulin-like growth factors (IGF) I and II. We now report that the binding of 125I-labeled IGF II to mouse pancreatic acini is maximally increased by 100 nM insulin (51%) and is maximally reduced by 10 nM cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) (34%), but is not affected by other regulatory peptides such as somatostatin or glucagon. Since many polypeptide hormones are internalized, we determined whether this regulation of IGF II binding occurred via a change in internalization. Acid washing or trypsinization has been shown to remove surface-bound hormone while the acid- or trypsin-resistant radioactivity represents internalized radioligand. Insulin increased and CCK8 decreased the internalization of IGF II as determined by these techniques. Studies of IGF II binding to acini at low temperature (15 degrees C) and binding to particulate fractions from acini were also consistent with the effect of insulin to increase and CCK8 to decrease the internalization of IGF II. When insulin and CCK8 were added together, the inhibitory effect of CCK8 predominated, indicating that CCK8 acted distal to the effect of insulin. Several lines of evidence suggest that this effect of CCK8 was via the CCK receptor and was mediated via a change in intracellular Ca2+: the effect of CCK8 on inhibiting IGF II binding was blocked by the cholecystokinin antagonist N2,O2'-dibutyryl cGMP; the cholinergic agent carbachol (1-100 microM), which acts through the muscarinic receptor to increase intracellular Ca2+, also inhibited IGF II binding; the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1-5 microM) mimicked the effects of CCK8 and carbachol. These data indicate, therefore, that CCK8 and possibly insulin may regulate the internalization of IGF II via intracellular Ca2+. Moreover, the data raise the possibility that alterations of hormone internalization may be a general phenomenon of hormone-hormone interaction."

We found that the 176 nucleotide wild-type transcript formed the predicted hairpin structures designated 1:2 and 3:4; the latter structure is believed to signal transcription termination. We constructed a deletion plasmid, pSm delta 1,4, to determine whether the postulated RNA antiterminator structure 2:3 could also form. This plasmid lacked the DNA regions corresponding to RNA segments 1 and 4. We found that the leader transcript from pSm delta 1,4 formed structure 2:3. This provides the first direct evidence establishing the formation of a predicted antitermination secondary structure."
