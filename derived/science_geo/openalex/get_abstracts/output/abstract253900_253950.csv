https://openalex.org/W2035433348,"Immunoglobulin G (IgG) mediates pro- and anti-inflammatory activities through the engagement of its Fc fragment (Fc) with distinct Fcg receptors (FcgRs). One class of Fc-FcgR interactions generates pro-inflammatory effects of immune complexes and cytotoxic antibodies. In contrast, therapeutic intravenous gamma globulin and its Fc fragments are anti-inflammatory. We show here that these distinct properties of the IgG Fc result from differential sialylation of the Fc core polysaccharide. IgG acquires anti-inflammatory properties upon Fc sialylation, which is reduced upon the induction of an antigen-specific immune response. This differential sialylation may provide a switch from innate anti-inflammatory activity in the steady state to generating adaptive pro-inflammatory effects upon antigenic challenge."

This so-called “framing effect” represents a striking violation of standard economic accounts of human rationality, although its underlying neurobiology is not understood. We found that the framing effect was specifically associated with amygdala activity, suggesting a key role for an emotional system in mediating decision biases. Moreover, across individuals, orbital and medial prefrontal cortex activity predicted a reduced susceptibility to the framing effect. This finding highlights the importance of incorporating emotional processes within models of human choice and suggests how the brain may modulate the effect of these biasing influences to approximate rationality."

In contrast to traditional cross-couplings, which require the prior preparation of organometallic reagents, we use a copper catalyst to generate the carbon nucleophiles in situ, via decarboxylation of easily accessible arylcarboxylic acid salts. The scope and potential economic impact of the reaction are demonstrated by the synthesis of 26 biaryls, one of which is an intermediate in the large-scale production of the agricultural fungicide Boscalid."

We found that the murine Irgm1 (LRG-47) guanosine triphosphatase induced autophagy and generated large autolysosomal organelles as a mechanism for the elimination of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis . We also identified a function for a human IRG protein in the control of intracellular pathogens and report that the human Irgm1 ortholog, IRGM, plays a role in autophagy and in the reduction of intracellular bacillary load."
https://openalex.org/W1990402424,"The merozoite stage of the malaria parasite that infects erythrocytes and causes the symptoms of the disease is initially formed inside host hepatocytes. However, the mechanism by which hepatic merozoites reach blood vessels (sinusoids) in the liver and escape the host immune system before invading erythrocytes remains unknown. Here, we show that parasites induce the death and the detachment of their host hepatocytes, followed by the budding of parasite-filled vesicles (merosomes) into the sinusoid lumen. Parasites simultaneously inhibit the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of host plasma membranes, which act as “eat me” signals to phagocytes. Thus, the hepatocyte-derived merosomes appear to ensure both the migration of parasites into the bloodstream and their protection from host immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2088366327,"Translational repression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) plays an important role in sexual differentiation and gametogenesis in multicellular eukaryotes. Translational repression and mRNA turnover were shown to influence stage-specific gene expression in the protozoan Plasmodium . The DDX6-class RNA helicase, DOZI (development of zygote inhibited), is found in a complex with mRNA species in cytoplasmic bodies of female, blood-stage gametocytes. These translationally repressed complexes are normally stored for translation after fertilization. Genetic disruption of pbdozi inhibits the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complexes, and instead, at least 370 transcripts are diverted to a degradation pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1974537340,"Assembly of the soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin 2 is thought to be the driving force for the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. However, whereas exocytosis is triggered at a millisecond time scale, the SNARE-mediated fusion of liposomes requires hours for completion, which challenges the idea of a key role for SNAREs in the final steps of exocytosis. We found that liposome fusion was dramatically accelerated when a stabilized syntaxin/SNAP-25 acceptor complex was used. Thus, SNAREs do have the capacity to execute fusion at a speed required for neuronal secretion, demonstrating that the maintenance of acceptor complexes is a critical step in biological fusion reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1993635466,"Nitroalkene derivatives of linoleic acid (LNO2) and oleic acid (OA-NO2) are present; however, their biological functions remain to be fully defined. Herein, we report that LNO2 and OA-NO2 inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages independent of nitric oxide formation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ activation, or induction of heme oxygenase-1 expression. The electrophilic nature of fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives resulted in alkylation of recombinant NF-κB p65 protein in vitro and a similar reaction with p65 in intact macrophages. The nitroalkylation of p65 by fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives inhibited DNA binding activity and repressed NF-κB-dependent target gene expression. Moreover, nitroalkenes inhibited endothelial tumor necrosis factor-α-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression and monocyte rolling and adhesion. These observations indicate that nitroalkenes such as LNO2 and OA-NO2, derived from reactions of unsaturated fatty acids and oxides of nitrogen, are a class of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators.

Reactive oxygen species and NO-derived oxidizing, nitrosating and nitrating products mediate diverse cell signaling and pathologic processes in cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurodegenerative diseases (1Baldus S.

These reactive inflammatory mediators chemically modify carbohydrates, DNA bases, amino acids, and unsaturated fatty acids to form oxidized, nitrosated and nitrated derivatives. For example, accumulation of inflammatory-induced protein tyrosine nitration products represents a shift from the physiological signal-transducing actions of NO to an oxidative, nitrative, and potentially pathogenic pathway (1Baldus S.

These derivatives were initially viewed to be, like nitrotyrosine, a “footprint” of NO-dependent redox reactions (3Rubbo H Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S. Kirk M.

LNO2 positional isomers, including 9-, 10-, 12-, and 13-nitro-9,12-cis-octadecadienoic acids, have been identified as free acids in human plasma and red blood cells and as esterified components of plasma lipoproteins and red blood cell membranes (10Baker P.R.

In addition, plasma and red cell free and esterified nitrooleate (OA-NO2, isomers 9- and 10-nitro-9-cis-octadecenoic acid) was also identified in healthy human blood (11Baker P.R. Lin Y.

Current knowledge indicates that enzymatically oxidized unsaturated fatty acid-derived products, such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, lipoxins, and resolvins serve as lipid mediators or autacoids. These signaling mediators act within a local microenvironment to orchestrate both physiological and pathological events, including platelet aggregation, constriction of vascular smooth muscle, neonatal development, wound healing, and resolution of inflammation (12Serhan C.N. Oliw E. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 107: 1481-1489Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In this context, endogenous nitrated fatty acid derivatives, such as OA-NO2 and LNO2, represent an emerging class of NO and fatty acid-derived signaling molecules (14Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11527-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At present, the cell signaling mechanisms and detailed structure-function relationships of this family of fatty acid derivatives are an object of interest. Recently, nitrated unsaturated fatty acids were shown to be potent electrophiles that mediate reversible nitroalkylation reactions with both glutathione and the Cys and His residues of proteins. This occurs both in vitro and in vivo and is viewed to transduce redox- and NO-dependent cell signaling by inducing a covalent, thiol-reversible post-translational modification that regulates protein structure, function, and subcellular distribution (15Batthyany C.

Herein, we report the effects of LNO2 and OA-NO2 on inflammatory responses in vascular cells, including monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells. These data indicate that the nitroalkene derivatives of linoleic acid and oleic acid (LNO2 and OA-NO2) are a novel class of endogenous, electrophilic mediators in the vasculature that can exert adaptive anti-inflammatory signaling reactions via the post-translational modification of transcriptional regulatory proteins. LNO2 and OA-NO2 were synthesized, purified, and quantitated as previously described (10Baker P.R. Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Baker P.R. Lin Y. Schopfer F.J. Woodcock S.R. Long M.H. Batthyany C. Iles K.E. Baker L.M.S. Branchaud B.P. Chen Y.E.

OA-NO2 and LNO2 were purified by preparative TLC developed twice using silica HF plates and a solvent system consisting of hexane/ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v). The regions corresponding to OA-NO2 and LNO2 were scraped and extracted. Stock concentrations of OA-NO2 and LNO2 were quantitated by chemiluminescent nitrogen analysis, using caffeine as a standard, and confirmed spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient (E268) of 8.22 mm–1 cm–1 for OA-NO2 in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), zinc protoporphryin-IX, 3,3-bis(aminoethyl)-1-hydroxy-2-oxo-1-triazene (DETA-NONOate), 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (cPTIO), sodium nitrite (NaNO2), diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA), and Na2HPO4 were from Sigma. Rosiglitazone, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, Wy14643, and GW501516 were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Streptavidin-coated plates were from Pierce. Recombinant NF-κB p65 protein and TransAMTM NF-κB p65 Chemi kit were from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). The synthesis of biotinylated OA, LA, OA-NO2, and LNO2 was performed as described for the synthesis of biotinylated (15S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (16Kang L.T. Vanderhoek J.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-methylpiperidine (5.3 μl, 48μmol) was added to a solution of either OA, LA, OA-NO2, or LNO2 (15 mg in 1.5 ml of methylene chloride). After cooling the mixture to –78 °C, isobutylchloroformate (6.2 μl, 48 μmol) was added. The reaction mixture was maintained at –78 °C for 45 min and then warmed to –20 °C. After 35 min, a heated (80 °C) solution of biotin hydrazide (48.6 mg, 188 μmol) in dimethylformamide (2 ml) was added. The mixture was immediately cooled and maintained at –20 °C for 40 min and then warmed to room temperature. After extraction with methylene chloride, the products were chromatographed and purified by preparative TLC developed twice using silica HF plates, using a solvent system consisting of methylene chloride/methanol (80/20, v/v). The regions corresponding to the biotinylated OA, LA, OA-NO2, and LNO2 were scraped and extracted. Stock concentrations of biotinylated OA, LA, OA-NO2, and LNO2 were quantitated by chemiluminescent nitrogen analysis using caffeine as a standard. The characterization of the biotinylated OA, LA, OA-NO2, and LNO2 was done by direct infusion into a ESI MS (ion trap) at both positive and negative mode or by ESI-liquid chromatography-MS/MS in the negative ion mode, using multiple reaction monitoring and an enhanced product information scan mode on a 4000 hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Q-Trap) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The ESI HPLC analysis was performed by C-18 reverse phase chromatography using a MercuryMS chromatography system equipped with a Luna C18 column (Phenomenex, Belmont, CA) equilibrated in 70% A (aqueous formic acid (0.01%)) and 30% B (0.01% formic acid in acetonitrile). One minute after injection, a 2-min gradient was initiated to reach a composition of 60% A and then to 7% A over an additional 4 min, held for 1 min at 7% A, and then back to 70% A and re-equilibrated. The retention times (min) and specific multiple reaction monitorings used for each species were as follows: biotinylated LA 7.50, 519/476; biotinylated OA 7.94, 521/478; biotinylated LNO2 6.90, 564/517; biotinylated OA-NO2 7.30, 566/519. Bone marrow cells were isolated from 8–12-week-old heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) knockout mice or wild-type mice as previously (17Feng X. Novack D.V. Faccio R. Ory D.S. Aya K. Boyer M.I. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow macrophages were prepared by culturing isolated bone marrow cells in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence of 0.1 volume of culture supernatant from macrophage colony-stimulating factor-producing cells for 2 days. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from BioWhittaker (San Diego, CA). The cells were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (BioWhittaker), containing 5% fetal calf serum, human basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, human epithelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin-B, hydrocortisone, and ascorbic acid. Early passages (passages 3–5) of HUVEC were used for all experiments. THP-1 cells (a human monocyte cell line from ATCC, Manassas, VA; catalog number TIB-202™) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (ATCC, catalog number 30-2001) supplemented with 10% FBS. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages with PMA (0.1 μm) for 5 days. RAW264.7 cells (a murine macrophage cell line from ATCC, catalog no. TIB-71™) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science (East Rutherford, NJ; catalog number CC-2702) and cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. The nonadherent cells were removed with PBS before treatment. CV-1 cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblast cell line from ATCC; catalog number CCL-70™) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS. Macrophages in fresh 1% FBS or 1% delipidated FBS (Cocalico Biologicals; catalog number CBX4234)-containing culture medium were treated as indicated. Medium was collected from triplicate wells 18–20 h after treatment. The concentrations of human and mouse TNFα, IL-6, and MCP-1 released from cells into medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits using protocols supplied by the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The half-maximal concentration for LNO2 and OA-NO2 inhibition of LPS-induced cytokine synthesis (IC50) was calculated using software obtained from GraphPad Software, Inc. Total RNA from cell pellets was extracted using RNeasy kits (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and reverse transcription reactions (Advantage RT for PCR kit; Clontech) were performed with 0.5–1 μg of DNase I (Qiagen)-treated RNA. Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCRs were carried out using the LightCycler thermocycler and the SYBR green I kits (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cycle numbers obtained at the log-linear phase of the reaction were plotted against a standard curve prepared with serially diluted control samples. Expression levels of target genes were normalized by concurrent measurement of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels. CV-1 cells at ∼85% confluence in 24-well plates were transiently co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with a plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of three tandem PPAR-response elements (3× PPRE TK-luciferase) in pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and human PPARγ1 in pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), respectively. Green fluorescent protein expression plasmid was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were cultured for 4 h in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and then treated with various stimuli as indicated for an additional 16–20 h. RAW264.7 cells were transiently co-transfected with NF-κB-luciferase reporter (NF-κB-luc) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and green fluorescent protein expression plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were pretreated with nitrated fatty acids or control fatty acids in 1% FBS Eagle's minimal essential medium for 16–20 h and then stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 h. Each transfection was performed in triplicate on at least 3 occasions. Reporter luciferase assay kits (Promega) were used to measure the luciferase activity of cells with a luminometer, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Victor II; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase activity was normalized by green fluorescent protein units. Partially purified human recombinant p65 protein (470 units/ml) was incubated in phosphate buffer 100 mm containing 100 μm DTPA (pH 7.4) with different concentrations of LNO2, OA-NO2, LA, or OA for 1 h at room temperature. The remaining p65 activity was measured using the TransAM™ NF-κB p65 Chemi kit from Active Motif following the manufacturer's instructions. A modification was introduced into the protocol by avoiding any addition of dithiothreitol to sample and buffer preparations. The amount of p65 added to each well was 10 ng. The p65 activity was not affected by native fatty acids (LA and OA) or vehicle. Thus, the activity of p65 incubated with 1 μm of corresponding native fatty acids was considered maximal (100%). Partially purified human recombinant p65 protein (470 units/ml) was incubated in 100 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 μm DTPA (pH 7.4) with different concentrations of biotinylated LNO2, OA-NO2, LA, or OA for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture (25 ng of p65) was added to streptavidin-coated plates that were previously blocked for 1 h with Tween Tris-buffered saline (TTBS: 0.5% Tween 20, 30 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) containing 3% albumin, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times using TTBS containing 1% albumin. The plates were then incubated with anti-p65 in 1% albumin containing TTBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed four times. Color development was followed at 650 nm using tetramethyl benzidine as substrate. Cells treated under different experimental conditions were washed quickly with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4, frozen in liquid nitrogen, scraped off, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium orthoavanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm aprotinin) for 10–15 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured in the cleared supernatant via Coomassie dye binding (Bio-Rad). The cell lysates (200 μg) were precipitated overnight with 50 μl of UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin Plus (Pierce), or 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Sigma) was added to 1 ml of cell lysate with equal amounts of protein and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. The precleared lysates (200 μg) were incubated with anti-p65 with constant agitation at 4 °C overnight and then further incubated with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow for 1 h. These precipitates were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The whole cell lysates (20 μg) or precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was done using anti-p65 (sc-372), anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (anti-VCAM-1; sc-13160), anti-actin (sc-1616) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-HO-1 (SPA-895) (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Inc., San Diego, CA). HUVEC were grown until 95% confluent in 48-well fibronectin-coated plates (for static adhesion analyses) or 25-mm dishes (for laminar flow analyses) and then incubated for 2 h with or without LNO2. Subsequently, HUVEC were activated with TNFα (2 ng/ml) for 16 h. Static Adhesion of THP-1 Cells on HUVEC—Fluorescently labeled monocytes treated with Cell Tracker Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added at a leukocyte/endothelial ratio of 10:1. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, unbound monocytes were removed by washing (nonadherent fraction). Both fractions (adherent and nonadherent cells) were lysed using 1 m NaOH (20 min), and fluorescence was measured at excitation = 480 nm and emission = 515 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorescent plate reader. Adhesion and Rolling of THP-1 Monocyte Cell on HUVEC in Laminar Flow—THP-1 cell adhesion to and rolling on HUVEC during flow were determined using a Glycotech flow chamber system (Rockville, MD) at flow rates corresponding to a wall shear rate of 0.5–1.5 dynes/cm2. Fluorescently labeled THP-1 cells were viewed on a Leica inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics and a Hamamatsu Orca ER digital CCD camera (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Real time images of each field were captured at 30 frames/s for 5 min using the automated image capture feature of Simple PCI software (Compix). Resulting time lapse images were analyzed by the motion tracking and analysis feature of Simple PCI software to calculate rolling velocities and the number of firmly bound cells. Cells not moving for 5 s or more were considered firmly bound cells and were counted. The rolling velocities for THP-1 cells were calculated using Simple PCI software. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. throughout. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance with the Newman-Keuls test unless specified.

LNO2 and OA-NO2 Inhibit LPS-induced Secretion of Proinflammatory Cytokines in Macrophages—To explore the physiological actions of LNO2 and OA-NO2, we investigated the impact of synthetic LNO2 and OA-NO2 (Scheme 1), identical to that detected in the healthy human circulation (10Baker P.R.

The concentration-dependent effects of LNO2 and OA-NO2 on LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages were first defined. LNO2 and OA-NO2 dose-dependently inhibited the LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNFα, and MCP-1, in THP1 and RAW264.7 macrophages in either lipid-rich serum (L-serum) or delipidated serum (D-serum). In THP-1 macrophages, the half-maximal concentration for LNO2 inhibition of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine synthesis (LNO2 IC50) was 1.2–1.9 μm (L-serum) and 1.2–1.8 μm (D-serum) for IL-6, 0.4–0.8 μm (L-serum) and 0.5–0.8 μm (D-serum) for TNFα, and 0.5–0.6 μm (L-serum) and 0.5–0.7 μm (D-serum) for MCP-1 (Fig. 1A). The half-maximal concentration for OA-NO2 inhibition of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine synthesis (OA-NO2 IC50) was 1.1–1.7 μm (L-serum) and 1.0–1.9 μm (D-serum) for IL-6, 0.3–0.9 μm (L-serum) and 0.5–0.8 μm (D-serum) for TNFα, and 0.4–0.6 μm (L-serum) and 0.5–0.8 μm (D-serum) for MCP-1 (Fig. 1A). In RAW264.7 cells, the LNO2 IC50 was 1.1–1.7 μm (L-serum) and 1.3–1.8 μm (D-serum) for IL-6, 1.4–1.8 μm (L-serum) and 1.2–1.8 μm (D-serum) for TNFα, and 1.1–1.7 μm (L-serum) and 1.1–1.8 μm (D-serum) for MCP-1 (Fig. 1B). The OA-NO2 IC50 was 1.8–2.5 μm (L-serum) and 1.9–2.4 μm (D-serum) for IL-6, 1.7–2.2 μm (L-serum) and 1.4–1.9 μm (D-serum) for TNFα, and 1.2–1.9 μm (L-serum) and 1.3–2.2 μm (D-serum) for MCP-1 (Fig. 1B). Similar responses were observed for the IC50 values of LNO2 and OA-NO2 in the inhibition of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in primary cultures of human macrophages: LNO2 IC50, 0.5–0.7 μm (d-serum) for IL-6, 0.4–0.6 μm (D-serum) for TNFα, and 0.6–0.8 μm (D-serum) for MCP-1; OA-NO2 IC50, 0.7–0.8 μm (D-serum) for IL-6, 0.5–0.7 μm (D-serum) for TNFα, and 0.6–0.8 μm (D-serum) for MCP-1 (Fig. 1C). In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in the anti-inflammatory effects of these nitroalkenes in the presence or absence of the lipidic components of serum. The native fatty acid precursors of LNO2 and OA-NO2, LA or OA, also displayed no inhibitory effects toward LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion (Fig. 1). These results affirm that the anti-inflammatory actions of LNO2 and OA-NO2 are direct and not mediated by hydrophobic interactions or via reaction products generated by the interaction of nitroalkenes with the lipophilic components of serum or macrophage membranes. In some control experiments, it was observed that the native fatty acids LA and OA slightly inhibited LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine synthesis (10–20% inhibition) at concentrations greater than 5 μm (not shown). The subsequent nitration of LA and OA added to cultured cells remains a subject of further investigation. Higher concentrations of LNO2 (∼5 μm) and OA-NO2 (∼5 μm) did not induce cytotoxic effects in our experimental conditions, as evidenced by an absence of alterations in cellular morphology and no detectable release of cellular lactate dehydrogenase (not shown). Collectively, our results indicate that LNO2 and OA-NO2 exert strong anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages. The close correspondence between IC50 values for suppressing LPS-induced cytokine expression and nitroalkene concentration suggests a common mechanism of action.FIGURE 1Nitrated fatty acids inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine secretion in macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2000716096,We analyzed longitudinal data on academic careers and conducted interviews with faculty members to determine the scope and causes of the gender gap in patenting among life scientists. Our regressions on a random sample of 4227 life scientists over a 30-year period show that women faculty members patent at about 40% of the rate of men. We found that the gender gap has improved over time but remains large.
https://openalex.org/W2012510292,We report the detection of an earthquake by a space-based measurement. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites observed a ±15-microgalileo gravity change induced by the great December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. Coseismic deformation produces sudden changes in the gravity field by vertical displacement of Earth's layered density structure and by changing the densities of the crust and mantle. GRACE's sensitivity to the long spatial wavelength of gravity changes resulted in roughly equal contributions of vertical displacement and dilatation effects in the gravity measurements. The GRACE observations provide evidence of crustal dilatation resulting from an undersea earthquake.
https://openalex.org/W2130227698,"Blood clots perform an essential mechanical task, yet the mechanical behavior of fibrin fibers, which form the structural framework of a clot, is largely unknown. By using combined atomic force‐fluorescence microscopy, we determined the elastic limit and extensibility of individual fibers. Fibrin fibers can be strained 180% (2.8-fold extension) without sustaining permanent lengthening, and they can be strained up to 525% (average 330%) before rupturing. This is the largest extensibility observed for protein fibers. The data imply that fibrin monomers must be able to undergo sizeable, reversible structural changes and that deformations in clots can be accommodated by individual fiber stretching."

https://openalex.org/W2058574926,"The renal Na+:Cl– cotransporter rNCC is mutated in human disease, is the therapeutic target of thiazide-type diuretics, and is clearly involved in arterial blood pressure regulation. rNCC belongs to an electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporter family (SLC12A) that has two major branches with inverse physiological functions and regulation: sodium-driven cotransporters (NCC and NKCC1/2) that mediate cellular Cl– influx are activated by phosphorylation, whereas potassium-driven cotransporters (KCCs) that mediate cellular Cl– efflux are activated by dephosphorylation. A cluster of three threonine residues at the amino-terminal domain has been implicated in the regulation of NKCC1/2 by intracellular chloride, cell volume, vasopressin, and WNK/STE-20 kinases. Nothing is known, however, about rNCC regulatory mechanisms. By using rNCC heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, here we show that two independent intracellular chloride-depleting strategies increased rNCC activity by 3-fold. The effect of both strategies was synergistic and dose-dependent. Confocal microscopy of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged rNCC showed no changes in rNCC cell surface expression, whereas immunoblot analysis, using the R5-anti-NKCC1-phosphoantibody, revealed increased phosphorylation of rNCC amino-terminal domain threonine residues Thr53 and Thr58.

In addition, a defect in NCC regulation by serine/threonine kinases WNK1 and WNK4 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a salt-dependent form of human hypertension known as pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) (7Wilson F.H. Kahle K.T. Sabath E. Lalioti M.D. Rapson A.K. Hoover R.S. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 8Yang C.L.

NCC is the pharmacological target of thiazide-type diuretics that are currently recommended by the Joint National Committee VII for the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure as the first line treatment of arterial hypertension either as the unique drug or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (10Chobanian A.V.

JAMA. 2003; 289: 2560-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (16273) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of NCC for cardiovascular and renal physiology, pharmacology, and pathophysiology, little is known about the mechanisms by which NCC activity is regulated. NCC belongs to the superfamily of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporters (SLC12) from which seven members have been identified at both the functional and molecular level. NCC, together with two isoforms of the Na+: K+:2Cl– cotransporter, NKCC1 and NKCC2, compose the sodium-driven branch (NKCCs), and four isoforms of the K+:Cl– cotransporter compose the potassium-driven branch (KCCs). Because these cotransporters are involved in the regulation of cell volume and/or in clamping the intracellular chloride concentration [Cl–]i, it has been proposed that their activity is regulated by changes in cell volume and/or [Cl–]i by means of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathways (for review, see Refs. 11Gamba G.

Several lines of evidence suggest that phosphorylation activates NKCCs and inhibits KCCs cotransporters, whereas dephosphorylation inhibits NKCCs and activates KCCs cotransporters. For instance, cell shrinkage, low intracellular chloride concentration, and protein phosphatase inhibitors activate NKCC1. Studies in this last cotransporter led to the identification of three amino-terminal threonine residues that become phosphorylated under such stimulatory conditions (16Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol.

Here we show that rNCC activity and amino-terminal domain phosphorylation is increased by [Cl–]i depletion strategies. rNCC activation is completely prevented when the amino-terminal domain threonine residues Thr53 and Thr58 and serine residue Ser71 are eliminated, suggesting that these amino acid residues are absolutely required for such regulation.

Automatic DNA sequencing was used to confirm all mutations. All primers used for mutagenesis were custom made (Sigma). Assessment of the Na+:Cl– Cotransporter Function—rNCC activity was assessed by functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes following our protocols published previously (23Monroy A. Plata C.

Oocytes injected with water or rNCC cRNA (10 ng/oocyte) were exposed to two different conditions that promote a decrease in the [Cl–]i:low Cl– hypotonic stress and/or coinjection with the K+:Cl– cotransporter KCC2 cRNA (10 ng/oocyte). After injection, oocytes were maintained during 4 days in isotonic ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 5.0 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4). The night before the uptake assay, oocytes were incubated in two different osmolar conditions: isotonic (ND96, ∼210 mosm/kg H2O) or low Cl– hypotonic stress (79 mm Na+ isethionate, 2 mm K+-gluconate, 1.8 mm Ca2+ gluconate, 1.0 mm Mg2+-gluconate, 5 mm HEPES, ∼170 mosm/kg H2O, pH 7.4). Then, tracer 22Na+ uptake (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was assessed in oocytes exposed to isotonicity using our usual isotonic uptake solution (40 mm NaCl, 56 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-chloride, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 210 mosm/kg H2O) containing 1 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm amiloride, and 0.1 mm bumetanide plus 2 μCi of 22Na+ per ml. In contrast, uptake in oocytes exposed to low Cl– hypotonic stress was assessed in a similar hypotonic uptake medium (40 mm NaCl, 38 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-chloride, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 170 mosm/kg H2O) with the same drugs and tracer 22Na+. Thus, 22Na+ uptake in oocytes injected with water, rNCC cRNA alone, rNCC + KCC2 cRNA, or any rNCC mutant with or without KCC2 cRNA was assessed under both regular isotonic and Cl–-free hypotonic protocols. Tracer activity was determined for each oocyte dissolved in 10% SDS by β-scintillation counting. Western Blotting—Western blot was used to compare the amount of NCC protein in cRNA-injected oocytes exposed to the intracellular chloride depletion maneuvers described above. Immunoblots were performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-NCC antibody kindly provided by Mark Knepper, National Institutes of Health, (27Wang X.Y. Masilamani S. Nielsen J. Kwon T.H. Brooks H.L.

In brief, groups of 15 oocytes exposed to each maneuver were homogenized in 4 μl/oocyte of homogenization buffer, centrifuged twice at 100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was recollected. Oocyte protein (equivalent to one oocyte per lane) was heated in sample buffer containing 6% SDS, 15% glycerol, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 150 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol, resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5%). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and exposed overnight at 4 °C to the rabbit polyclonal anti-NCC antibody diluted 1:1500 in blocking buffer, TTBS (2.24 g/liter Tris-base, 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.6) 0.2%. Membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary (anti-rabbit) antibody (Alpha Diagnostic Intl.) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer and washed again.

For densitometry analysis, the plasma membrane fluorescence was quantified by determining the pixel intensity around the entire oocytes circumference using SigmaScan Pro image analysis software. Western blot was performed in proteins extracted from the EGFP-NCC-injected oocytes following the procedures described above. NCC Phospho-antibody Studies—We used the previously characterized R5 antibody (17Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that was raised to detect phosphorylation of residues Thr212 and Thr217 in human NKCC1 (shark Thr184 and Thr189), a generous gift from B. Forbush, Yale University. R5-antibody is also useful to detect phosphorylation of corresponding residues Thr99 and Thr104 in rabbit NKCC2 (31Gimenez I. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F1341-F1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Through sequence comparison and mutation analysis (see Fig. 3 in “Results and Discussion”), we found that for rNCC to be recognizable by the R5 antibody at least tyrosine at position 56 in rat NCC must be converted to the histidine found in NKCCs. Therefore, using custom primers we constructed an rNCC single mutant Y56H-NCC or a quadruple mutant L49Y-Y56H-I59M-V61A, this latter containing all significant differences between NCC and NKCC2. For functional analysis oocytes injected with appropriate cRNA constructs were incubated in the same experimental solutions and for the same time as those described above. At the end of the incubation period, 4 oocytes per group were homogenized in 100 μl of ice-cold anti-phosphatase solution (150 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaF, 5.0 mm EDTA, 15 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm pyrophosphate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) with 1% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture. Then, homogenate was cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were subjected to Western blotting. The equivalent to 6 μl of lysate was loaded per lane. The analysis was repeated four times, and functional expression was assessed in parallel for each experiment. To test for the specificity of R5 antibody signal with NCC samples, we carried out alkaline phosphatase treatment of oocyte homogenates. Briefly, after 16-h incubation in ND96 or Cl–-free solutions, oocytes were lysed in AlkPhos solution (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, 0.2% SDS) to which protease inhibitors and calyculin A were added to avoid protein degradation and PP1-mediated dephosphorylation. Then, homogenates were split in two, and 5 units of phosphatase alkaline were added to one of the samples. Homogenates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The dephosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding the same volume of 2x sample buffer. 12 μl of this solution were loaded per lane and was subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting with R5 antibody. In Vitro cRNA Translation—To prepare cRNA for microinjection, each of the wild-type or mutant cDNA was digested at the 3′ end using NotI or NheI from New England Biolabs (Carlsbad, CA), and cRNA was transcribed in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ (Ambion) transcription system. cRNA product integrity was confirmed on agarose gels, and concentration was determined by absorbance reading at 260 nm (DU 640, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). cRNA was stored frozen in aliquots at –80 °C until used. Data Analysis—All results presented are based in a minimum of three different experiments with at least 10 oocytes per group in each experiment. Statistical significance is defined as two-tailed, with p < 0.05, and the results are presented as mean ± S.E. The significance of the differences between groups was tested by one-way analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using Bonferroni's correction. NCC Activity Is Increased by Intracellular Chloride Depletion Maneuvers—Because the regulatory mechanisms controlling electroneutral cotransporters in their native tissues and in transfected cells seem to operate in response to intracellular chloride concentration or to correct changes in intracellular chloride concentration (11Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), the present study tested such mechanisms of regulation for NCC. We used two different experimental strategies to induce a depletion of [Cl–]i. The first protocol was to compare the activity of rNCC in X. laevis oocytes injected with rNCC cRNA alone or together with of K+:Cl– cotransporter KCC2 cRNA. We chose KCC2 because it is the K+:Cl– cotransporter isoform that is significantly active in isotonic conditions when expressed in X. laevis oocytes (11Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 25Song L. Mercado A. Vazquez N. Xie Q. Desai R. George A.L. Gamba G. Mount D.B. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 91-105Google Scholar), thus maintaining a continuous K+:Cl– efflux over the incubation days before the uptake assays were performed. A similar approach was used in HEK-293 cells by Gillen and Forbush (32Gillen C.M. Forbush B. II I Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C328-C336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that analyzed the regulation of NKCC1 activity by intracellular chloride depletion induced by cotransfecting the cells with KCC1. The second protocol was the “low Cl– hypotonic stress” in which rNCC-injected oocytes were incubated in a Cl–-free, slightly hypotonic medium (170 mosm/kg H2O) for several hours before the uptake assay. Low Cl– hypotonic stress is known to induce a decrease in [Cl–]i in several cells (16Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol.

(Lond.). 1994; 475: 45-57Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, low Cl– hypotonic stress in X. laevis oocytes induces the opening of Cl– channels that promote Cl– efflux (34Ackerman M.J. Wickman K.D. Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 depicts the effect of each protocol separately, or together, upon tracer 22Na+ uptake in H2O- or rNCC-injected oocytes. As we have shown previously (1Gamba G. Saltzberg S.N. Lombardi M. Miyanoshita A. Lytton J. Hediger M.A. Brenner B.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2749-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 23Monroy A. Plata C. Hebert S.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16553-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), 22Na+ uptake in water-injected oocytes was very small and not thiazide sensitive, indicating that X. laevis oocytes do not express endogenous activity of a Na+:Cl– cotransporter. As shown in Fig. 1, the minimum uptake observed in water-injected oocytes was not affected by KCC2 cRNA injection or by low Cl– hypotonic stress. 22Na+ uptake in rNCC-injected oocytes incubated over-night in regular ND96 was 2840 ± 154 pmol oocyte–1 h–1. In contrast, 22Na+ uptake in oocytes coinjected with rNCC and KCC2 cRNA and that were incubated in similar isotonic conditions was 11,757 ± 514 pmol oocyte–1 h–1 (p < 0.001). In oocytes that were injected with rNCC alone but were exposed to low Cl– hypotonic stress, 22Na+ uptake was 12,449 ± 974 pmol oocyte–1 h–1 (p < 0.001). Combination of both experimental protocols resulted in synergistic effect because 22Na+ uptake in rNCC + KCC2 cRNA-injected oocytes incubated overnight in the Cl–-free hypotonic medium was 16,469 ± 669 pmol oocyte–1 h–1 (p < 0.001). As shown in Fig. 2, in oocytes incubated in isotonic conditions or exposed to low Cl– hypotonic stress, the effect of KCC2 cRNA coinjection upon rNCC activity was dose-dependent. Increased amount of KCC2 cRNA injected was associated with increased activity of rNCC. Oocytes exposed to low Cl– hypotonic stress exhibited higher basal activity and reached the plateau phase at lower KCC2 cRNA concentrations. Thus, promoting intracellular chloride depletion by two different strategies resulted in increased 22Na+ uptake by the renal Na+:Cl– cotransporter. The increased uptake could be caused by the augmented driving force by the intracellular chloride depletion. Alternatively, as has been shown to occur with NKCC1, NCC can also be regulated by chloride-sensitive mechanisms. Therefore, we analyzed whether the intracellular chloride depletion maneuvers modulate the phosphorylation status of the conserved NCC amino-terminal domain threonines that in NKCC1 have been shown to be involved in its regulation by intracellular chloride (16Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Dose-dependent effect of KCC2 cRNA upon NCC activity in oocytes.

By using R5 antibody, a phospho-antibody that recognizes the phosphorylation of two amino-terminal domain threonine residues in NKCC1 (human sequence, Thr212, Thr217; shark, Thr184, Thr189) (17Flemmer A.W.

Overlapping phenotypes of pgp1/pgp19 and twd1 mutant plants suggested a positive regulatory role of TWD1 in PGP-mediated export of the plant hormone auxin, which controls plant development. Here, we provide evidence at the cellular and plant levels that TWD1 controls PGP-mediated auxin transport. twd1 and pgp1/pgp19 cells showed greatly reduced export of the native auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Constitutive overexpression of PGP1 and PGP19, but not TWD1, enhanced auxin export. Coexpression of TWD1 and PGP1 in yeast and mammalian cells verified the specificity of the regulatory effect. Employing an IAA-specific microelectrode demonstrated that IAA influx in the root elongation zone was perturbed and apically shifted in pgp1/pgp19 and twd1 roots.

Moreover, IAA has been shown to have potential value as a photoactivable cytotoxin with applications in cancer therapy (7Folkes K.L. Wardman P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 776-779PubMed Google Scholar).

Auxin transport is polar from the shoot apex to the root apex and in reverse to the root-hypocotyl junction in a cell-to-cell manner (4Blakeslee J.J. Peer W.A. Murphy A.S. Curr. Opin.

PGP1 has been shown to catalyze the primary active transport of native and synthetic auxins using plant and heterologous transport systems. PGP1 activity is inhibited by auxin efflux inhibitors such as N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and flavonols as well as anticancer drugs such as verapamil and cyclosporin A (17Geisler M.

Interestingly, twd1 plants resemble those of pgp1/pgp19 double mutants, and PGP1/PGP19-TWD1 interaction can be verified by a broad array of methods (16Geisler M. Kolukisaoglu H.Ü. Bouchard R.

Similar mutant phenotypes, together with reduced auxin transport in intact hypocotyls, suggested a regulatory role for PGP1 and PGP19 in auxin transport (13Geisler M. Murphy A.S.

TWD1, which also belongs to the multidomain FKBP family, is distinguished by its unique C-terminal membrane anchor, which localizes the protein to both the plasma (16Geisler M. Kolukisaoglu H.Ü.

In the latter, TWD1 functionally interacts with the C termini of MDR-associated protein (MRP)-like ABC transporters MRP1 and MRP2 (30Geisler M. Girin M. Brandt D. Vincenzetti V. Plaza S. Paris N.

Interestingly, both pairs of ABC transporters interact with independent domains of TWD1. PGP1 and PGP19 interact with the cis,trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase-like domain, and MRP1 and MRP2 interact with the tetratricopeptide repeat domain. This difference in binding to TWD1 domains might specify functional diversity of the interactions.In both cases, regulatory roles of TWD1 in individual ABC transporter pairs have been suggested (16Geisler M.

Furthermore, FKBP12 has been shown to regulate murine MDR3 activity, but attempts to demonstrate interaction have been thus far unsuccessful (33Hemenway C.S. Heitman J. J. Biol.

Consistent with these observations, the PGP-interacting cis,trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase-like domain of TWD1 has been shown to lack any isomerase activity and not to bind FK506 (29Kamphausen T.

Here, we provide several lines of evidence that TWD1 functions as a positive regulator of PGP1-mediated auxin transport, suggesting a novel mode of PGP regulation via FKBP-type immunophilins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown as described previously (16Geisler M. Kolukisaoglu H.Ü. Bouchard R. Billion K. Berger J. Saal B. Frangne N. Koncz-Kalman Z. Koncz C. Dudler R. Blakeslee J.J. Murphy A.S. Martinoia E. Schulz B. Mol. Biol.

For quantification of gravitropism, wild-type and pgp1 (At2g36910), pgp19 (At3g28860), pgp1/pgp19, and twd1 (At3g21640) mutant seeds (all ecotype Wassilewskija) were surface-sterilized and grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium and 0.7% Phytagar (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) under continuous light conditions as described (61Lariguet P. Fankhauser C. Plant J. 2004; 40: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Each gravistimulated root was assigned to one of twelve 30° sectors in the circular histograms; the length of each bar represents the percentage of seedlings showing the same direction of root growth. The number of seedlings for each genotype was between 72 and 96.Analysis of IAA Contents and Responses—A. thaliana wild-type, pgp1, pgp19, pgp1/pgp19, and twd1 mutant plants (all ecotype Wassilewskija) expressing the maximal auxin-inducible reporter ProDR5-green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformations using the DR5-GFPm construct (38Ottenschläger I.

Homozygous T3 was used for all experiments described. Seedlings were grown vertically for 5 days as described above, stained with 10 μm propidium iodide before microscopy, and analyzed by differential interference contrast (Leica DM R microscope equipped with a Leica DC300 F charge-coupled device). For histological signal localization, both images were electronically merged and further processed with Photoshop 7.0. (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA).For endogenous free auxin quantification, shoot and root segments of 30–50 seedlings were collected and pooled. The samples were extracted with MeOH and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Calculation of isotopic dilution factors was based on the addition of 100 pmol of [2H]IAA to each sample. In some cases, roots of 40 seedlings were manually divided into root segments (see Fig. 4C) and analyzed as described above. The data are presented the means of three independent lots of 30–50 seedlings each.Expression and Localization Analysis—Immunolocalization in roots was performed as described (60Ueda M. Matsui K. Ishiguro S. Sano R. Wada T. Papanov I. Palme K. Okada K. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Labeling was performed with rabbit anti-PIN1 and guinea pig anti-PIN2 antibodies at 1:500 and 1:400 dilutions, respectively. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies were used at 1:400 dilution. During the immunolocalization procedures, solutions were changed using a pipetting robot (InsituPro, Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG). Plasma membranes and microsomal fractions were separated by aqueous two-phase partitioning or continuous sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunoprobed as described (16Geisler M. Kolukisaoglu H.Ü.

Frangne N. Gomes E. Martinoia E. Palmgren G.M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1814-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transcripts specific for PGP1 (At2g36910), TWD1 (At3g21640), and 40 S ribosomal protein S16 (At2g09990) were detected by conventional PCR for 25 and 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 52 °C. The intron-spanning PCR primers used were as follows: S16, 5′-ggcgactcaaccagctactga (sense) and 5′-cggtaactctttggtaacga (antisense); PGP1, 5′-gtccctcaagagccgtgcttg (sense) and 5′-ccatcatcgatgacagcgatc (antisense); TWD1, 5′-ccatagcatacatgggggacg (sense) and 5′-tctgtggcgtcgaaagatacg (antisense). Equal volumes of PCR products were separated on 2.5% agarose gels. Negative controls in the absence of enzyme in the RT reaction yielded no products.Protoplast Efflux Experiments—Intact Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were prepared from the rosette leaves of plants grown on soil under white light (100 μmol m–2 s–1, 8-h light/16-h dark cycle, 22 °C), and auxin efflux experiments were performed as described (17Geisler M.

Efflux was started by incubation at 25 °C and halted by silicon oil centrifugation. Effluxed radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting of the aqueous phases and is presented as relative efflux of the initial efflux (efflux prior to incubation), which was set to zero.

For detoxification assays, transformants grown in the same medium to A600 ∼ 0.8 were washed and diluted to A600 = 1.0 in water. Cells were 10-fold diluted five times, and each 5 μl were spotted on minimal medium plates supplemented with 10 μm IAA or 750 μm 5-fluoroindole. Growth at 30 °C was assessed after 3–5 days. Assays were performed with three independent transformants.IAA transport experiments were performed as described (17Geisler M. Blakeslee J.J. Bouchard R. Lee O.R. Vincenzetti V. Bandyopadhyay A.

Aliquots of 0.5 ml were taken after incubation at 30 °C. IAA retention is expressed as relative loading of the initial loading (t = 2.5 min), which was set to zero. For efflux experiments (see Fig. 6B), cells were loaded for 10 min on ice, washed twice with cold water, and resuspended in 15 ml of synthetic minimal medium (pH 4.5). Aliquots of 0.5 ml were taken after incubation at 30 °C. IAA retention is expressed as relative loading of the initial (maximal) loading (t = 0 min), which was set to 100%.FIGURE 6Coexpression of PGP1 and TWD1 specifically inhibits IAA export.

https://openalex.org/W2155013883,"The P56S mutation in VAPB (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B) causes autosomal dominant motoneuronal diseases. Although it was reported that the P56S mutation induces localization shift of VAPB from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to non-ER compartments, it remains unclear what the physiological function of VAPB is and how the P56S mutation in VAPB causes motoneuronal diseases. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of wild type VAPB (wt-VAPB) promotes unfolded protein response (UPR), which is an ER reaction to suppress accumulation of misfolded proteins, and that small interfering RNA for VAPB attenuates UPR to chemically induced ER stresses, indicating that VAPB is physiologically involved in UPR. The P56S mutation nullifies the function of VAPB to mediate UPR by inhibiting folding of VAPB that results in insolubility and aggregate formation of VAPB in non-ER fractions. Furthermore, we have found that expression of P56S-VAPB inhibits UPR, mediated by endogenous wt-VAPB, by inducing aggregate formation and mislocalization into non-ER fractions of wt-VAPB. Consequently, the P56S mutation in a single allele of the <i>VAPB</i> gene may diminish the activity of VAPB to mediate UPR to less than half the normal level. We thus speculate that the malfunction of VAPB to mediate UPR, caused by the P56S mutation, may contribute to the development of motoneuronal degeneration linked to VAPB/ALS8."

Antagonistically, HIV-1 viral infectivity factor degrades these enzymes. A3G is enzymatically inhibited by binding RNA within an unidentified large cytosolic ribonucleoprotein, implying that RNA degradation during reverse transcription may activate intravirion A3G at the necessary moment. We purified a biologically active tandem affinity-tagged A3G from human HEK293T cells. Mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation from HEK293T and T lymphocyte extracts identified many RNA-binding proteins specifically associated with A3G and A3F, including poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), YB-1, Ro-La, RNA helicases, ribosomal proteins, and Staufen1. Most strikingly, nearly all A3G-associated proteins were known to bind exclusively or intermittently to translating and/or dormant mRNAs. Accordingly, A3G in HEK293T and T lymphocyte extracts was almost completely in A3G-mRNA-PABP complexes that shifted reversibly between polysomes and dormant pools in response to translational inhibitors. For example arsenite, which inhibits 5′-cap-dependent translational initiation, shifted mRNA-A3G-PABP from polysomes into stress granules in a manner that was blocked and reversed by the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed A3G-mRNA-PABP stress granules only partially overlapping with Staufen1. A3G coimmunoprecipitated HIV-1 RNA and many mRNAs.

This single-stranded DNA, which has a minus sense, is synthesized using viral RNA as a template and is released from the DNA-RNA hybrid when the RNA is degraded by a ribonuclease H inherent in reverse transcriptase. Vif binds specifically to A3G and A3F and recruits a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase complex containing cullin 5 and elongins B-C that causes their polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby ridding infected cells of these antiviral enzymes and precluding their incorporation into progeny virions (1Chiu Y.L.

Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that A3G is tightly regulated intracellularly. Several human T cell lines contain substantial amounts of A3G and/or A3F but incorporate only small amounts into virions and are highly permissive for replication of HIV-1(Δvif) (17Rose K.M. Marin M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2005; 21: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This suggests that cellular factors can modulate the anti-HIV-1 activities of A3G and A3F. A3G is also transcriptionally induced in T cells by mitogenic factors that activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (18Rose K.M. Marin M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41744-41749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in macrophages by interferon α (19Peng G. Lei K.J. Jin W. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that A3G in proliferating T cells and HEK293T cells occurs in an enzymatically inactive form in a large ribonucleoprotein complex (20Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 21Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Treatment of this complex with RNase A released A3G and activated its enzymatic activity (20Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 21Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This high Mr complex is absent in resting T cells, which contain relatively little RNA, and the uncomplexed active A3G in those cells can apparently invade fully assembled wild-type HIV-1 capsids and cause their inactivation (21Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that A3G associates intracellularly with RNA in a ribonucleoprotein complex(es), that this inhibits its enzymatic and anti-HIV-1 activities, and that this inhibitory association is controlled by mitogenic cytokines that activate T cells. Similarly, the cytidine deaminases APOBEC1 and activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which edit apolipoprotein B mRNA and control recombination and hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, respectively, associate with RNAs and proteins that restrict their activities and substrate specificities (22Bransteitter R.

The concentrative incorporations of A3F and A3G into assembling retroviral capsids also require functional interactions with RNAs and proteins (2Cullen B.R. J.

We expressed a biologically active tandem affinity-tagged derivative of A3G (TAP-A3G) or a negative control TAP protein in human HEK293T cells and employed tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) to identify proteins that specifically copurify with A3G. A3G is strongly associated with ribonucleo-proteins that remain attached throughout a multistep purification procedure in physiological conditions. The proteins thereby identified coimmunoprecipitated specifically from cell extracts with A3G and A3F, including extracts of T lymphocytic cells. Many but not all of the TAP-A3G-associated proteins were released from A3G by RNase A, suggesting that they were linked via RNA. The large rapidly sedimenting A3G complex in cell extracts consists of polysomes, as indicated by changes in its sedimentation behavior caused by protein synthesis inhibitors. A3G was associated with the mRNA component of polysomes, and these A3G-mRNA complexes moved reversibly from polysomes into storage granules in conditions of stress. Conversely, cycloheximide drove dormant A3G-mRNA complexes back into polysomes. In agreement with this evidence, HIV-1 viral RNA and many cellular mRNAs coimmunoprecipitated with A3G. Nearly all of the A3G-associated proteins identified by mass spectrometry were reported previously to bind exclusively or intermittently to mRNAs.

The A3G coding sequence from A3G-Myc was amplified by PCR and cloned into pCMV-TAP (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) (38Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat.

Virology. 2004; 319: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Stephan Bour, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) were described previously. Cells were transfected with equimolar ratios of plasmid DNAs using PolyFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cell extracts were prepared and media collected 36 h post-transfection, unless otherwise noted. Tandem Affinity Purification—A3G-associated proteins were obtained by tandem affinity purification (38Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 41Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods (Amst.). 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells (2 × 106/100-mm diameter dishes) were seeded 24 h before transfection with pTAP-A3G or control pCMV-TAP expression vectors. 36-40 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with cold Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen) and extracts prepared using IPP150 buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The extracts were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min to sediment the nuclei, adjusted to equivalent protein concentrations using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), mixed with IgG-Sepharose (0.3 ml/ml cell lysate) (Amersham Biosciences), and allowed to rotate at 4 °C overnight. Some extracts were treated in the presence or absence of RNase A, DNase-free (20 μg/ml) (Roche Applied Science) at 25 °C for 40 min prior to mixing with the IgG-Sepharose. The IgG-Sepharose with the bound TAP-A3G was pelleted by centrifugation, washed extensively with IPP150 buffer, and subsequently washed and suspended in TEV cleavage buffer (IPP150 buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The samples were incubated with AcTEV (100 units/ml) (Invitrogen) and rotated at 4 °C overnight to release the A3G complexes. The IgG-Sepharose was pelleted and the supernatant containing the cleaved complexes reserved, diluted with 3 volumes of IPP150 calmodulin binding buffer (IPP150 buffer supplemented with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2), mixed with calmodulin-Sepharose 4B (0.075 ml/ml supernatant) (Amersham Biosciences), and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The pelleted calmodulin-Sepharose was washed extensively with IPP150 buffer followed by IPP150 buffer without Nonidet P-40, and the protein complexes were eluted with EGTA-containing buffer (IPP150 calmodulin binding buffer without Nonidet P-40 and CaCl2 supplemented with 2 mm EGTA). The eluted samples were concentrated using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices (Millipore), and aliquots were electrophoresed for analysis of A3G by Western immunoblotting or for SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) staining of the copurified proteins prior to mass spectrometry. Protein Identification by LC/MS/MS—SYPRO Orange-stained proteins resolved on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared for digest by cutting the entire lane into 20-35 individual slices. Bands were excised manually or automatically using a 2DiDx sample preparation robot (Leap Technologies). Gel bands/plugs were placed in a ZipPlate for the entire digestion procedure. However, the ZipPlate was not used to perform any chromatographic cleanup of the samples. Rather, the plate was used as a filter to facilitate manual or automated tryptic digestion. Gel bands were destained in two changes of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (ambic) in 30% methanol. The plugs were dried with neat acetonitrile, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol, and alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide before being washed and dried again. Approximately 100 ng of sequencing grade trypsin (sequencing grade modified trypsin; Promega) in 20 mm ambic was added to each sample with sufficient buffer to immerse the gel plugs. Digestion proceeded overnight at 37 °C. Samples were acidified with the addition of 10 μl of 1% formic acid. Peptide extracts were collected by centrifugation, and the gel slices were subsequently extracted with two additions of 50 and 70% acetonitrile, respectively. Peptide extracts were brought to near dryness before being resuspended in 10 μl of 0.1% formic acid in preparation for mass spectrometric analysis. Tryptic peptides from digests were analyzed by nano-LC/MS/MS. Chromatography was achieved using an Eksigent nano-LC to generate a gradient using the following chromatographic conditions: for the mobile phase A, water, acetonitrile, formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid (95:4.89:0.1:0.01, respectively, v/v); for the mobile phase B, acetonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, water, formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid (80:10:9.89:0.1:0.01, respectively, v/v). Mobile phase B was ramped from 2 to 45% over 40 min, increased to 80% in 5 min, and held for 5 min before being returned to starting conditions. Flow was regulated at 200 nl/min and directed through a 75-mm × 15-cm in-house packed column packed with Astrosil (5-mm particle size, 100 Å pore size, C18 reverse phase chemistry; Stellar Phases) coupled to a 5 μm tapered emitter (New Objectives). Prior to analytical chromatography, 5 μl of tryptic digest was injected onto a sample trap and washed with mobile phase A to remove salts and contaminants after which the trap was switched in-line with the analytical column. Tandem mass spectrometry data were collected using a Qstar XL hybrid time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: spray voltage 1800-1900 V; TOF-MS scan m/z 400-1600, 0.5 s; TOF-MS/MS scan m/z 50-2000, 2.0 and 90 s exclusion; data-dependent product ion acquisition of the three most abundant +2 and +3 ions from the TOF-MS scan. Monoisotopic masses for data base searching were generated using Distiller (Matrix Science) and submitted to MAS-COT version 1.9 (Matrix Science) for X!Tandem for protein identification. Masses were searched against the IPI data base (IPI Human version 3.13) (42Kersey P.J. Duarte J. Williams A. Karavidopoulou Y. Birney E. Apweiler R. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) with the following parameters: digest agent, trypsin; fixed modification, cystine carbamidomethylation; variable modifications, N/Q deamidation, methionine oxidation; 1 missed cleavage allowed, precursor and fragment ion mass tolerances of 0.1 Da. For X!Tandem analysis (43Craig R. Beavis R.C. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1466-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar), the following parameters were used: fixed modification, cystine carbamidomethylation, variable modification, methionine oxidation; refinement, methionine oxidation, N/Q deamidation; refinement of point mutations, one missed cleavage; digest agent, trypsin; no removal of redundant spectra; precursor and fragment ion mass tolerances of 100 ppm and 0.2 Da, respectively. Detailed analysis of protein identification data was carried out using Scaffold (Proteome Software), which is an implementation of the Peptide and Protein Prophet algorithms originally described by Keller and co-workers (44Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar, 45Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar) along with protein identification by X!Tandem. Positively identified proteins were selected using the following parameters: minimum peptide confidence 95%, minimum number of peptides 2, minimum protein confidence 95%. Any protein identified by three or fewer peptides was manually inspected to confirm identification. Protein Analyses—Western immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations were described (13Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with RIPA (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 150 mm NaCl) with complete protease inhibitors followed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min to sediment the nuclei. Postnuclear extracts were adjusted to equivalent protein concentrations using Bradford reagent, and equal aliquots (unless otherwise noted) were then used for Western immunoblotting (46Marin M. Tailor C.S. Nouri A. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8085-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or immunoprecipitations (47Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Some extracts were treated in the presence or absence of RNase A, DNase-free (20 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 20 min prior to analyses. Antibodies used for protein analyses were as follows: mouse anti-Myc 9E10, mouse anti-HA HA-7, rabbit anti-HA, mouse anti-luciferase LUC1, mouse anti-α-tubulin DM 1A, and mouse anti-β-actin peroxidase-conjugated AC-15 (Sigma); mouse anti-PABP1 and rabbit anti-YB1 (Abcam, Inc); mouse anti-PTB clone 1 (Invitrogen); rabbit anti-Ro (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-A3G 9968, rabbit anti-Vif 2221, and HIV-IG 3957(AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program, contributed by Dr. Warner C. Greene and Dr. Dana Gabuzda, NABI Biopharmaceuticals and NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, respectively); rabbit anti-human Stau1 (generously donated by Dr. Gabriella Boccaccio) and rabbit anti-L5 ribosomal protein (generously donated by Dr. Hua Lu). Polysome Analyses—Polysomes were prepared and analyzed as described previously (48Kabat D. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 39: 228-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Transfected HEK293T cells were treated in the presence or absence of puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min prior to lysis. H9 leukemic T cells were treated in the presence or absence of sodium m-arsenite (0.1 mm) (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. Some samples were treated with cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml) (Sigma) at 37 °C for 20 min prior to and subsequently during the 1 h arsenite treatment. Cells were lysed in RIPA supplemented with cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml) and RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (30 units/ml) (Promega). Postnuclear extracts adjusted for equivalent protein concentrations were layered onto 30-ml 15-40% sucrose gradients made in buffer B (0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m KCl, 0.01 m MgCl2) and centrifuged at 86,000 × g for 3 h. Fractions (1 ml), collected from the bottom, and the pellet resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B were used for Western immunoblotting and spectrophotometric A260 analyses. The total RNA isolated from 0.1-ml aliquots of each fraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, was electrophoresed in an agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293T cells were seeded at 10 5 cells/well in 4-well Permanox chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) that had been pretreated with poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) at 25 °C for 20 min, and the cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C. The cultures were transfected with A3G-Myc expression vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 24 h post-transfection the cultures were treated with arsenite (0.5 mm) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide as described above. Cells were fixed in 5% formaldehyde and 2% sucrose in PBS at 25 °C for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 10% sucrose in PBS at 25 °C for 30 min. A3G-Myc was detected with rabbit anti-Myc (Sigma) or mouse anti-Myc 9E10 for colocalization studies with PABP1 or Stau1, respectively. PABP1 and Stau1 were detected with antibodies described above under “Protein Analyses.” Secondary antibodies were as follows: Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor-594 goat anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor-594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). These antibodies reacted only with their species-specific primary antibodies. H9 leukemic T cells were seeded, treated with translational inhibitors, and processed as described above. Endogenous A3G was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the C terminus of A3G and produced as described previously (15Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Slides were mounted in FluoroGuard (Bio-Rad) and examined under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M deconvolution microscope. Viral Assays—HIV-gpt virions were produced and titered using HeLa-CD4 cells (clone HI-J) and mycophenolic acid selection as described previously (36Page K.A. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2074151167,"Paraoxonases (PONs) are a family of proteins that may play a significant role in providing relief from both toxic environmental chemicals as well as physiological oxidative stress. Although the physiological roles of the PON family of proteins, PON1, PON2, and PON3, remain unknown, epidemiological, biochemical, and mouse genetic studies of PON1 suggest an anti-atherogenic function for paraoxonases. To determine whether PON2 plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis in vivo, we generated PON2-deficient mice. When challenged with a high fat, high cholesterol diet for 15 weeks, serum levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were not significantly different between wild-type and PON2-deficient mice. In contrast, serum levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)/low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly lower (–32%) in PON2-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. However, despite lower levels of VLDL/LDL cholesterol, mice deficient in PON2 developed significantly larger (2.7-fold) atherosclerotic lesions compared with their wild-type counterparts. Enhanced inflammatory properties of LDL, attenuated anti-atherogenic capacity of high density lipoprotein, and a heightened state of oxidative stress coupled with an exacerbated inflammatory response from PON2-deficient macrophages appear to be the main mechanisms behind the larger atherosclerotic lesions in PON2-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that PON2 plays a protective role in atherosclerosis.

In contrast, serum levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)/low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly lower (–32%) in PON2-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. However, despite lower levels of VLDL/LDL cholesterol, mice deficient in PON2 developed significantly larger (2.7-fold) atherosclerotic lesions compared with their wild-type counterparts. Enhanced inflammatory properties of LDL, attenuated anti-atherogenic capacity of high density lipoprotein, and a heightened state of oxidative stress coupled with an exacerbated inflammatory response from PON2-deficient macrophages appear to be the main mechanisms behind the larger atherosclerotic lesions in PON2-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that PON2 plays a protective role in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease of chronic inflammation and lipid accumulation. Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease. More specifically, the oxidation of LDL has been shown to trigger a number of pro-inflammatory events that initiate and exacerbate the atherogenic process (1Navab M. Hama S.Y. Reddy S.T. Ng C.J.

These protective effects of HDL have been attributed to the various proteins HDL associates with in the circulation. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is one such HDL-associated protein that has been reported to possess antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties and to protect against atherogenesis (5Shih D.M. Gu L. Xia Y.R. Navab M. Li W.F. Hama S. Castellani L.W. Furlong C.E. Costa L.G. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 6Shih D.M. Xia Y.R. Wang X.P.

As suggested by its name, PON1 was initially discovered for its ability to hydrolyze paraoxon, the metabolite of the organophosphate parathion. Increasing evidence, however, suggests that PON1 may have other functions, including a role in coronary heart disease (CHD). In vitro, PON1 has been shown to protect against LDL oxidation, an important step in atherogenesis. Mice deficient in PON1 develop significantly larger atherosclerotic lesions in their aortas compared with their wild-type counterparts (5Shih D.M. Gu L. Xia Y.R. Navab M. Li W.F. Hama S.

In humans, PON1 activity has been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD (8Mackness B. Durrington P. McElduff P. Yarnell J. Azam N. Watt M. Mackness M. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2775-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). PON1, however, is just one member of a multigene family that includes PON2 and PON3 (9Primo-Parmo S.L. Sorenson R.C. Teiber J. La Du B.N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), both of which surprisingly lack paraoxonase activity. PON1, PON2, and PON3 do, however, possess the ability to hydrolyze lactones with the three PON proteins exhibiting overlapping but distinct substrate specificities (10Draganov D.I. Teiber J.F. Speelman A. Osawa Y. Sunahara R. La Du B.N. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1239-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the PON proteins can hydrolyze a number of acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), molecules that mediate bacterial quorum-sensing signals, which are important in regulating expression of virulence factors and in inducing a host inflammatory response (10Draganov D.I.

Another distinguishing feature between the members of this gene family is that PON2, unlike PON1 or PON3, does not associate with HDL fractions in the circulation but remains intracellular, associated with the membrane fractions (13Ng C.J. Wadleigh D.J. Gangopadhyay A. Hama S. Grijalva V.R. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Reddy S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44444-44449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas human PON1 and PON3 expression is limited primarily to the liver, PON2 is widely expressed in a number of tissues and cell types, including the cells of the artery wall (9Primo-Parmo S.L. Sorenson R.C. Teiber J. La Du B.N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 13Ng C.J. Wadleigh D.J. Gangopadhyay A. Hama S. Grijalva V.R. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Reddy S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44444-44449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). These unique properties of PON2 make it an interesting candidate to study the physiological or pathophysiological function of paraoxonases. The results of population studies on PON2 genetic polymorphisms implicate PON2 in a number of diseases, including Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and CHD (14Janka Z. Juhasz A. Rimanoczy A.A. Boda K. Marki-Zay J. Kalman J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2002; 7: 110-112PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wang X.Y. Xue Y.M. Wen S.J. Zhang N.L. Ji Z. Pan S.Y.

Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 2002; 65: 415-421PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, little is known about the functional role of PON2 in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In vitro studies suggest that PON2 may have an anti-atherogenic function (10Draganov D.I. Teiber J.F. Speelman A. Osawa Y. Sunahara R. La Du B.N. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1239-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Reis S.E. Kammerer C.M. McNamara D.M. Holubkov R. Sharaf B.L. Sopko G. Pauly D.F.

Using cells that overexpress PON2 protein, we have previously demonstrated that PON2 possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities, capable of preventing LDL oxidation and the ability of oxidized LDL to induce monocyte chemotaxis (13Ng C.J. Wadleigh D.J. Gangopadhyay A. Hama S. Grijalva V.R. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Reddy S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44444-44449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Using purified recombinant PON2 protein, Rosenblat et al. (19Rosenblat M. Draganov D. Watson C.E. Bisgaier C.L. La Du B.N. Aviram M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have shown that PON2 can inhibit the oxidative modification of LDL and reduce cellular lipid hydroperoxides. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether PON2 could protect against the development of atherosclerosis in vivo. Using PON2-deficient mice, we demonstrate, for the first time, that PON2 protects against atherogenesis in vivo by modulating lipoprotein properties, reducing cellular oxidative stress, and attenuating the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the PON2-deficient mouse is one of a few unique animal models described to date in which levels of VLDL/LDL cholesterol correlate inversely with atherosclerotic lesion development, making this a unique animal model to delineate the mechanisms of atherogenesis. Generation of PON2-deficient Mice—A mouse embryonic stem cell line (cell line XE661, strain 129/Ola) containing an insertional mutation in PON2 was identified using BayGenomics, a gene-trapping resource (20Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A. Meng E.C. Lee R.E. Yee A. L'Italien L. Chuang P.T. Young S.G. Skarnes W.C. Babbitt P.C. Ferrin T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The gene-trap vector used (pGT1Lxf) contained a splice-acceptor sequence upstream of a reporter gene, βgeo (a fusion of β-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II) (20Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A. Meng E.C. Lee R.E. Yee A. L'Italien L. Chuang P.T. Young S.G. Skarnes W.C. Babbitt P.C. Ferrin T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As determined by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (21Townley D.J. Avery B.J. Rosen B. Skarnes W.C. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the insertional mutation in XE661 occurred in the second intron of PON2. Thus, the mutation results in the production of a fusion transcript consisting of exon 1–2 sequences from PON2 and βgeo. XE661 was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice on a C57Bl6/129 background. After testing for germ line transmission, chimeric mice were backcrossed an additional five generations to the C57Bl6/J background before intercrossing to obtain wild-type, heterozygote, and homozygote knock-out mice. Genotyping—Genomic DNA was isolated from the tails of mice using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). Genotyping was performed by touchdown PCR analysis using Failsafe 2× PCR Premix E (Epicenter) and Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix (Clontech). Primers used for genotyping include the use of gene-trap vector specific primers (LacZ-f311, ACTGGCAGATGCACGGTTACG; LacZ-r920, CGTAGTGTGACGCGATCGGCA) and mouse PON2 intron 2-specific primers (mP2intrn2f, CGGTATGTATGGGAAGATGCTGAC; mP2intrn2r, TTGTTGTTGCTGCTTCTGGGG). Northern and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and mRNA was prepared using a PolyATract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Northern blot analyses were performed using 2 μg of mRNA per sample. A 32P-labeled 650-bp DNA fragment from exons 4 to 9 of the mouse PON2 cDNA was used as the probe. For real-time quantitative RT-PCR, 1 μg of mRNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time RT-PCR was then performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) in an ABI Prism 7700 cycler. Serial dilutions of cloned cDNA plasmids were used as standards. Both samples and standards were assayed in duplicate. The primer pairs used for real-time RT-PCR were: mPON1–350U (AAC AAG AAG GAG CCA GCA GTG TCA GA) and mPON1–474L (AGT GGA CGA GGA GTC TGG ATG GTT TA), mouse PON2–390U (GAG TCA GCT GGG GCT TTG ATC TGG CT) and mouse PON2–607L (ATT GGT GGC GTA GAA GTG GGT GGG C), mPON3–265U (GAT CTG AAT GAG CAA AAC CCA GAG GC) and mPON3–386L (GAG TCC ATG TTG GGG TGA TTC ACG AC), and mouse GAPDH-103U (TGC CAT TTG CAG TGG CAA AGT GG) and mouse GAPDH-517L (TTG TCA TGG ATG ACC TTG GCC AGG). The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 4 °C hold. Antibodies and Western Blots—Mouse PON2 antibody was generated as previously described for human PON2 antibody (13Ng C.J. Wadleigh D.J. Gangopadhyay A. Hama S. Grijalva V.R. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Reddy S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44444-44449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), except mouse PON2-specific peptide CDERPPSLEEL-RVSWGFDL was used as the antigen. Rabbit anti-mouse PON2 antiserum was affinity-purified using purified recombinant mouse PON2 protein (generously provided by D. Draganov) immobilized onto nitrocellulose membrane. Mouse apolipoprotein-B antibody was purchased from Biodesign International. Mouse PON2 and apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) proteins were measured by Western blot analysis. Briefly, crude membrane extracts (10Draganov D.I. Teiber J.F. Speelman A. Osawa Y. Sunahara R. La Du B.N. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1239-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) prepared from livers (15, 30, and 60 μg) or serum (2 μl) from wild-type and PON2-deficient mice were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 0.1% Tween-TBS (T-TBS) plus 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse PON2 antibody was used at 1:5000, whereas mouse apoB antibody was used at 1:2000. Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin plus T-TBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody was used at 1:5000 in 1% bovine serum albumin plus T-TBS for both PON2 and apoB immunoblots and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were illuminated using ECL plus (GE Healthcare-Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). AHL Inactivation Bioassay—Reactions were carried out at room temperature in a 50-μl volume of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2 containing 10 μg of crude membrane extracts (10Draganov D.I. Teiber J.F. Speelman A. Osawa Y. Sunahara R. La Du B.N. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1239-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) prepared from livers and 0.5 μm 3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL). Reactions were stopped with an equal volume of acetonitrile, and 0.01 ml of a 1:100 dilution was used to measure 3OC12-HSL by quantitative bioassay using Escherichia coli MG4 (pKDT17) as described by Pearson et al. (22Pearson J.P. Gray K.M. Passador L. Tucker K.D. Eberhard A. Iglewski B.H. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). 3OC12-HSL and E. coli MG4 (pKDT17) were kindly provided by K. Janda (The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA) and E. Greenberg (University of Iowa), respectively. Diet-induced Atherogenesis—At 8 weeks of age, female PON2-deficient mice and their wild-type and heterozygous littermates were switched from a chow diet to an atherogenic diet consisting of 15.8% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% cholic acid (TD 90221, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). Fifteen weeks later, mice were sacrificed, and the blood and heart were collected for analysis. This protocol was approved by the Animal Research Committee at UCLA. Serum Lipid Analysis and PON1 Activity—Serum was isolated from overnight-fasted mice. Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were measured with enzymatic kits. VLDL/LDL cholesterol was deduced by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol. Serum PON1 activity was measured spectrophotometrically using paraoxon as the substrate. VLDL Production—Fasted mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 g/kg Poloxamer 407 (P-407) (23Millar J.S. Cromley D.A. McCoy M.G. Rader D.J. Billheimer J.T. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2023-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (graciously provided by BASF) in saline. Mice were bled at 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after injection, serum was isolated, and triglyceride concentrations were determined. VLDL production rate was calculated by measuring the change in triglyceride levels following P-407 injection. LDL Clearance—Mice were injected intravenously with 1 mg of human LDL in phosphate-buffered saline and bled 15 min and 2, 6, and 24 h post-injection. Human apoB levels in the serum of these mice were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (24Reardon C.A. Miller E.R. Blachowicz L. Lukens J. Binder C.J. Witztum J.L. Getz G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1347-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using MB47, a monoclonal antibody specific to human apoB-100 (25Young S.G. Witztum J.L. Casal D.C. Curtiss L.K. Bernstein S. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 178-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the capture antibody and biotin-labeled goat anti-human apoB-100 (Biodesign) as the detection antibody. Serum samples were diluted 1:500. To control for any differences in the amount of LDL injected, the concentration of human apoB detected at 15 min post-injection was used as the starting point. Aortic Lesion Analysis—Atheroma formation in the aortic sinus of mice was analyzed as previously described (6Shih D.M. Xia Y.R. Wang X.P. Miller E. Castellani L.W. Subbanagounder G. Cheroutre H. Faull K.F. Berliner J.A. Witztum J.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17527-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Briefly, the heart, including the proximal aorta, was isolated then embedded in OCT compound. Serial 10-μm thick cryosections of aorta were stained with Oil Red O and hematoxylin. The mean area of lipid staining per section from 10 sections was determined for each mouse. Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics) was used for quantitation. Aortic sections were also stained for macrophages using CD68 as the marker. Briefly, sections were blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin plus 10% goat serum for 3 h at room temperature. Rat anti-mouse CD68 primary antibody (Serotec) was used at 1:100 with an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Goat anti-rat alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used at 1:200 with a 1-hour incubation at room temperature. CD68 immunostaining was visualized using Vector Red substrate plus levamisole to inhibit endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Monocyte Chemotaxis—LDL and HDL fractions were isolated from the serum of fasted mice by fast-protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). LDL and HDL induced monocyte chemotactic activity were assayed as described previously (26Castellani L.W. Navab M. Van Lenten B.J. Hedrick C.C. Hama S.Y. Goto A.M. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 464-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Lipid Hydroperoxides—Total lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and lipid hydroperoxides were quantitated spectrophotometrically by the method described by Auerbach et al. (27Auerbach B.J. Kiely J.S. Cornicelli J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Peritoneal Macrophages—Wild-type and PON2 KO mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 ml of solution consisting of 3% thioglycollate broth. Four days later, cells were collected from the peritoneal cavity of these mice and plated onto tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Two hours later, non-adherent cells were removed, and the adherent cells were used the following day. Experiments involving the use of peritoneal macrophages were performed a minimum of three times using at least two mice per group each time. Oxidation of LDL—Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type or PON2-deficient mice were cultured onto 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated with 250 μg of LDL in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% lipoprotein-deficient serum. Eighteen hours later, LDL supernatants were collected, and lipid hydroperoxides were quantitated as described above. Intracellular Oxidative Stress—A 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay was used to quantify intracellular oxidative stress as previously described (13Ng C.J. Wadleigh D.J. Gangopadhyay A. Hama S. Grijalva V.R. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Reddy S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44444-44449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Briefly, peritoneal macrophages from wild-type or PON2-deficient mice were cultured onto 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) and loaded with 100 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then washed with Krebs-Ringer buffer and treated with either 10 ng/ml of LPS (Sigma), 300 μm H2O2 (Sigma), or 1 μg/ml HPODE (13S-hydroperoxy-9Z, 11E-octadecadienoic acid, Biomol) in Krebs-Ringer buffer. Fluorescence was measured at the indicated times using a fluorescence microplate reader (Spectra Max Gemini XS, Molecular Devices) with an excitation filter of 485 nm and an emission filter of 530 nm. LPS-induced Inflammatory Response—Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type or PON2-deficient mice were cultured onto 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and treated with 10 ng/ml LPS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% lipoprotein-deficient serum. 0, 3, and 6 h later, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and collected in RLT buffer (Qiagen RNeasy kit). Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit and RNase-free DNase. Message levels of mouse TNF-α and IL-1β were measured using real-time PCR as described above. Primer sequences used for TNF-α were: forward, 5′-CAC GCT CTT CTG TCT ACT GAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGC TAC AGG CTT GTC ACT CGA-3′, and for IL-1β: forward, 5′-CTG TGT CTT TCC CGT GGA CC; reverse, 5′-CAG CTC ATA TGG GTC CGA CA-3′. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using Student t test or analysis of variance. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. PON2-deficient Mice—PON2-deficient mice were generated using a mouse embryonic stem cell line XE661 (strain 129/Ola) obtained through BayGenomics, a gene-trap resource from NHLBI, National Institutes of Health (20Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A. Meng E.C. Lee R.E. Yee A. L'Italien L. Chuang P.T. Young S.G. Skarnes W.C. Babbitt P.C. Ferrin T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The integration site of the gene-trap vector was determined by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends and long-distance PCR to be located in intron 2 of the mouse PON2 gene (Fig. 1A). This insertional mutation will thus result in a fusion transcript consisting of exon 1–2 sequences from PON2 and βgeo (Fig. 1A). Following successful germ line transmission, PON2-deficient mice were back-crossed for five generations to the C57Bl/6J background before initiating phenotype analyses. Previous studies utilizing mutant mice derived from gene-trap methodology noted that the gene-trap approach may in some cases result in a slight leakiness of the targeted gene (28Roshon M.

To determine the expression status of the trapped PON2 gene, mRNA was isolated from various tissues of PON2 wild-type (WT) and PON2 homozygous genetrap mice (HM) and subjected to Northern analysis for PON2 mRNA. Using 2 μg of poly(A)-mRNA (equivalent to ∼200 μg of total RNA) we were unable to detect PON2 message by Northern blot analysis in various tissues of PON2 HM mice (Fig. 1B). In addition, PON2 protein was virtually undetectable in the livers of PON2 HM mice (Fig. 1C), and lactonase activity was significantly lower in PON2 HM mice as measured by hydrolysis of 3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) (Fig. 1D). However, using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, low levels of PON2 mRNA were detected in tissues of PON2 HM mice. The relative PON2 message levels in the brain, liver, lung, and stomach of PON2 HM mice as compared with those of the WT mice were 8%, 8%, 5%, and 12%, respectively. These results indicate that low levels of PON2 message and protein (<10% in most tissues) may be present in PON2 HM mice and will thus be treated as PON2-deficient mice. Lipid Parameters—To assess the protective capacity of PON2 in atherogenesis, PON2-deficient mice and their wild-type counterparts were placed on a high fat, high cholesterol, cholate-containing diet to induce atherosclerosis. After 15 weeks on the diet, serum lipid levels of wild-type and PON2-deficient mice were measured. Although there was no significant difference in fasting levels of HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, free-fatty acids, glucose, and weight between wild-type and PON2-deficient mice, mice deficient in PON2 exhibited significantly lower levels of total (–24%) and VLDL/LD"
https://openalex.org/W2065625116,"The iron-sulfur cluster-free hydrogenase (Hmd) from methanogenic archaea harbors an iron-containing cofactor of yet unknown structure. X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the active, as isolated enzyme from Methanothermobacter marburgensis (mHmd) and of the active, reconstituted enzyme from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (jHmd) revealed the presence of mononuclear iron with two CO, one sulfur and one or two N/O in coordination distance. In jHmd, the single sulfur ligand is most probably provided by Cys176, as deduced from a comparison of the activity and of the x-ray absorption and Mössbauer spectra of the enzyme mutated in any of the three conserved cysteines. In the isolated Hmd cofactor, two CO, one sulfur, and two nitrogen/oxygen atoms coordinate the iron, the sulfur ligand being most probably provided by mercaptoethanol, which is absolutely required for the extraction of the iron-containing cofactor from the holoenzyme and for the stabilization of the extracted cofactor. In active mHmd holoenzyme, the number of iron ligands increased by one when one of the Hmd inhibitors (CO or KCN) were present, indicating that in active Hmd, the iron contains an open coordination site, which is proposed to be the site of H2 interaction.

Hydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen (1Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Meyer J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 455-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their structure and catalytic mechanism are of considerable applied interest as models for the development of efficient catalysts for hydrogen-fueled processes. Despite intensive efforts, however, the understanding of how hydrogenases react with H2 is only in its infancy.Two of the three known types of hydrogenases are ironsulfur proteins that contain, besides one or several iron-sulfur clusters, a dinuclear metal center, either [NiFe] or [FeFe], which was shown to be the site of H2 reaction. Both dinuclear hydrogenases catalyze the reversible formation of 2e- and 2H+ from H2, the electrons being transferred one by one to electron acceptors via the iron-sulfur clusters. One iron ion in both dinuclear centers is coordinated by sulfur, CO, and cyanide ligands, as supported by crystal structures of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase (2Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C.

Soc. 2001; 123: 1596-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). During the catalytic cycle, the iron ion in the [NiFe] center remains in a low spin ferrous state and is not redoxactive (8Huyett J.E. Carepo M. Pamplona A. Franco R. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 9291-9292Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Frey M. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In the case of the [FeFe]-hydrogenases, the oxidation states of the dinuclear iron center are still under discussion; however, the involvement of a low spin Fe(II) has been predicted based on the spectroscopic and DFT studies (9Frey M. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 10Zhou T.J. Mo Y.R. Liu A.M. Zhou Z.H. Tsai K.R. Inorg.

Despite similarities in structures and properties, [FeFe]- and [NiFe]-hydrogenases are phylogenetically not related. [FeFe]-hydrogenases are found in bacteria and eucarya, whereas [NiFe]-hydrogenases are found in bacteria and archaea. For recent reviews on these two types of hydrogenases, see Frey (9Frey M. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), Zhou et al. (10Zhou T.J. Mo Y.R. Liu A.M. Zhou Z.H. Tsai K.R. Inorg.

Biol. 2004; 8: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).The third type of hydrogenase does not contain any ironsulfur cluster and has been found only in some methanogenic archaea (14Zirngibl C. Hedderich R. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 112-116Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Thauer R.K. Klein A.R. Hartmann G.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3031-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It shows no sequence similarity to [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases (15Thauer R.K. Klein A.R. Hartmann G.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3031-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The enzyme substitutes for [NiFe]-hydrogenases when the cells grow under nickel-limiting conditions (16Afting C. Hochheimer A. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Its systematic name, H2-forming methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase (Hmd), indicates that the enzyme catalyzes the dehydrogenation of methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin (methlylene-H4MPT) 4The abbreviations used are: H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; mHmd, M. marburgensis Hmd; jHmd, M. jannaschii Hmd; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1, 1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; XANES, X-ray absorption near edge structure; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; FT, Fourier transform; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 4The abbreviations used are: H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; mHmd, M. marburgensis Hmd; jHmd, M. jannaschii Hmd; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1, 1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; XANES, X-ray absorption near edge structure; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; FT, Fourier transform; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. to methenyl-H4MPT+. H4MPT is a structural and functional analog of tetrahydrofolate (15Thauer R.K. Klein A.R. Hartmann G.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3031-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). H2+methenyl-H4MPT+=methylene-H4MPT+H+ΔG0'=-5.5kj/molIn the catalytic reaction, a hydride is stereospecifically transferred from H2 into the pro-R position at C14a of methenyl-H4MPT+. In contrast to other hydrogenases, Hmd does not catalyze per se the exchange of H2 with protons of water or the conversion of para-H2 to ortho-H2. Interestingly, these two reactions are, however, mediated in the presence of methenyl-H4MPT+ (17Schwörer B. Fernandez V.M. Zirngibl C. Thauer R.K. Eur. J.

Hedderich R. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 112-116Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Each iron ion in Hmd is tightly bound to a low molecular mass cofactor (19Lyon E.J. Shima S. Boecher R. Thauer R.K. Grevels F.W. Bill E. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14239-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Lyon E.J. Shima S. Buurman G. Chowdhuri S.

The iron-containing cofactor can be extracted from Hmd by unfolding of the enzyme in urea, guanidine·HCl, or methanol in the presence of mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. In the absence of the thiol compounds, essentially only inactive cofactor is obtained. The apoprotein is inactive. The active enzyme can be reconstituted by the addition of the extracted cofactor to heterologously produced Hmd apoprotein (22Buurman G. Shima S. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whose crystal structure has recently been determined (23Pilak O. Mamat B. Vogt S. Hagemeier C.H. Thauer R.K. Shima S. Vonrhein C. Warkentin E. Ermler U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 798-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly to the [NiFe]-hydrogenases, the iron ion in Hmd is not redox-active. Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopy characterize the iron ion in Hmd, in the absence and presence of its substrates as a low spin Fe(II) or low spin Fe(0) (24Shima S. Lyon E.J. Thauer R.K. Mienert B. Bill B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The isolated iron-containing Hmd cofactor has the same oxidation state (24Shima S. Lyon E.J. Thauer R.K. Mienert B. Bill B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).The presence of iron is pivotal for the activity of Hmd; however, its complexation in the holoenzyme as well as its role in the catalytic reaction has yet to be elucidated. A recent IR spectroscopic study shed some light on the active site. The results on Hmd and its iron-containing cofactor are, in both cases, consistent with the presence of two CO molecules coordinated to one iron (19Lyon E.J. Shima S. Boecher R. Thauer R.K. Grevels F.W. Bill E. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14239-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It has been found that upon UV-A/blue-light illumination, both CO molecules are irreversibly flashed off from the active site, which results in the loss of the enzyme activity (20Lyon E.J. Shima S. Buurman G. Chowdhuri S. Batschauer A. Steinbach K. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The isolated iron-containing Hmd cofactor is light- and temperature-sensitive as well. Upon irradiation with UV-A/blue light, the cofactor releases at least 2 CO, 1 iron, and a 542-Da pyridone derivative. The structure of the pyridone derivative could recently be determined (21Shima S. Lyon E.J. Sordel-Klippert M.S. Kauss M. Kahnt J. Thauer R.K. Steinbach K. Xie X.L. Verdier L. Griesinger C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004; 43: 2547-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but its role in iron binding is still unknown.The iron ion in Hmd can bind one inhibitor molecule, either extrinsic CO or cyanide, as indicated by IR spectroscopy (19Lyon E.J. Shima S. Boecher R. Thauer R.K. Grevels F.W. Bill E. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14239-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Hmd cofactor does not bind extrinsic CO at room temperatures (19Lyon E.J. Shima S. Boecher R. Thauer R.K. Grevels F.W. Bill E. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14239-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but it does bind extrinsic CO at much lower temperatures (24Shima S. Lyon E.J. Thauer R.K. Mienert B. Bill B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the presence of cyanide, the iron-containing cofactor rapidly decomposes for reasons not yet known.Heat inactivation of the iron-containing Hmd cofactor was found to be slowed down considerably in the presence of mercaptoethanol both under oxic and anoxic conditions (22Buurman G. Shima S. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These results indicate that in the cofactor at least one of the ligands to iron might be a sulfur atom and that the cofactor might be bound to the protein via Fe-S-Cys bonds. Hmd contains three conserved cysteines (15Thauer R.K. Klein A.R. Hartmann G.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3031-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which could be involved in this type of cofactor binding.To identify all ligands of the iron ion and further elucidate its role in the Hmd active site, we have subjected active Hmd to x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) 4The abbreviations used are: H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; mHmd, M. marburgensis Hmd; jHmd, M. jannaschii Hmd; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1, 1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; XANES, X-ray absorption near edge structure; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; FT, Fourier transform; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and to a mutational analysis. XAS is the only element specific technique, which is able to provide structural information about a local environment of metal atoms in proteins. In [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenase, the use of XAS is limited by the presence of iron-sulfur clusters, whose strong signal mask contributions by the catalytic iron site. In Hmd no iron-sulfur clusters are present. Thus, Hmd is the ideal prototype system for studies on the role of the iron ion in the hydrogenase mechanism.The current investigations were performed with Hmd from Methanothermobacter marburgensis (mHmd) and Hmd from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (jHmd). Active mHmd was purified from M. marburgensis, and active jHmd was reconstituted from jHmd apoprotein heterologuously produced in Escherichia coli. M. jannaschii and M. marburgensis have growth temperature optima of 85 and 65 °C, respectively. The two methanogens are phylogenetically only distantly related. On the protein level, mHmd and jHmd show 65% sequence identity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll experiments were done anaerobically and under red light because of the oxygen and light sensitivity of Hmd and of the Hmd cofactor. Methenyl-H4MPT+ was purified from M. marburgensis (25Shima S. Thauer R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 331: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Preparation of mHmd Samples—mHmd holoenzyme was purified from M. marburgensis (20Lyon E.J. Shima S. Buurman G. Chowdhuri S. Batschauer A. Steinbach K. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Purification was done via ammonium sulfate precipitation, Source 30Q anion exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G25 gel filtration chromatography. The steps were performed anaerobically and in the absence of thiol reagents (mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol). The purified enzyme solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-15 (10 kDa cut-off) and supplemented with 20% glycerol and 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0 (pH at 0 °C), or 50 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.0 (pH at 0 °C). 100-μl samples (75 mg·ml-1, ∼2 mm) (where indicated supplemented with 4 mm KCN or 4 mm methenyl-H4MPT+) in 7-ml vials closed with a rubber stopper were equilibrated at room temperature for 20 min with either 5% H2 plus 95% N2 (gas phase in the anaerobic tent), 100% H2, or 100% CO, and then part of the sample was transferred via a syringe into 75-μl plastic XAS cuvettes, each placed in a 250-ml amber-colored glass bottle closed with a rubber stopper (which was held by a screw cap) and filled with either 5% H2 plus 95% N2, 100% H2, or 100% CO at 1.3 bars. The bottles were then put into a deep freezer at -80 °C for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the caps and the rubber stoppers were removed, and the plastic XAS cuvettes with the frozen samples were quickly transferred into a liquid nitrogen bath. The samples were kept in a Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen until measurement of the XAS spectrum.Preparation of the Iron-containing Hmd Cofactor—The Hmd cofactor was extracted from purified Hmd from M. marburgensis (20Lyon E.J. Shima S. Buurman G. Chowdhuri S. Batschauer A. Steinbach K. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The extracted cofactor was separated from the apoproteins by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-15 (10 kDa cut-off). The Hmd cofactor in the filtrate was ultrafiltrated again using the same filter. The filtrate was dried via anoxic evaporation at 4 °C and then dissolved in 10 mm ammonium carbonate, pH 9.0, supplemented with 10 mm mercaptoethanol. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis indicated no contamination of the active cofactor with apoprotein or inactive cofactor. The Hmd cofactor sample was supplemented with 20% glycerol and then anaerobically transferred into the 75-μl plastic XAS cuvettes as described for the mHmd enzyme.Preparation of jHmd Samples—Hmd apoprotein from M. jannaschii was heterologously produced in E. coli and purified, and the holoenzyme was reconstituted by the addition of purified Hmd cofactor. E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the expression vector pET24b with the wild type or the mutated hmd gene was cultivated aerobically in tryptophan-phosphate medium (26Moore J.T. Uppal A. Maley F. Maley G.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At an A578 of 0.8, Hmd production was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). Three hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The E. coli cells (4-5 g wet mass) were anaerobically suspended in 15 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and then disrupted anaerobically by a French press at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 116,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The Hmd apoprotein was purified from the cell extract under strictly anaerobic conditions using a heat step (20 min, 70 °C) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. After the heat step, precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was supplemented with 2 m ammonium sulfate, recentrifuged, and then applied to the phenyl-Sepharose column (70 ml; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.0, containing 2 m ammonium sulfate and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Hmd apoprotein was eluted with a linear decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate. The fractions containing jHmd apoprotein were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the jHmd apoprotein was washed free of ammonium sulfate and dithiothreitol with 50 mm anoxic Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0. Aliquots of the purified apoprotein were supplemented with Hmd cofactor to reconstitute the holoenzyme (22Buurman G. Shima S. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reconstituted enzyme was supplemented with 20% glycerol and then anaerobically transferred into the 75-μl plastic XAS cuvettes as described for the mHmd enzyme.Generation of Hmd-Apoprotein Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis of the hmd gene from M. jannaschii in the expression vector pET24b was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene following the protocol given by the manufacturer. Primers were constructed as follows: C10A, sense/antisense (5′-GCAATCTTAGGAGCTGGAGCTTACAGAACCCACGCAGC-3′/5′-GCTGCGTGGGTTCTGTAAGCTCCAGCTCCTAAGATTGC-3′); C250A, sense/antisense (5′-GGTCCTGTCGCTGATATGTGTTCAGCAGTTACAGC-3′/5′-GCTGTAACTGCTGAACACATATCAGCGACAGGACC-3′); C176A, sense/antisense (5′-GGAGCTATTGTAACCCACGCAGCTACAATCCCAAC-3′/5′-GTTGGGATTGTAGCTGCGTGGGTTACAATAGCTCC-3′); C176S, sense/antisense (5′-GGAGCTATTGTAACCCACGCATCTACAATCCCAAC-3′/5′-GTTGGGATTGTAGATGCGTGGGTTACAATAGCTCC-3′).Sequencing of the isolated plasmids was performed to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and to show that no additional mutations were generated during the PCR.XAS Measurements—The K-edge iron and selenium x-ray absorption spectra were recorded at beamline D2 of the EMBL Outstation Hamburg at DESY, Germany. The DORIS storage ring operated at 4.5 GeV with the positron beam current ranging from 145 to 80 mA. A Si(111) double-crystal monochromator scanned x-ray energies around the iron K-edge (6.9-8.0 keV) or selenium K-edge (12.3-13.5 keV). Harmonic rejection was achieved by a focusing mirror (cut-off energy at 20.5 keV) and a monochromator detuning to 50% of its peak intensity. The sample cells were mounted in a two-stage Displex cryostat and kept at about 20 K. The x-ray absorption spectra were recorded as iron Kα or selenium Kα fluorescence spectra with a Canberra 13-element germanium solid-state detector. While processing a pulse, the detector is frozen (dead time). We ensured that no more than 20% of the counts occurred in this period and corrected each data point for this effect. For each sample, a different number of scans was collected and averaged to ensure comparable statistics. X-ray energy calibration was achieved by recording Bragg reflections from a static Si(220) crystal in back-reflection geometry during each scan (27Pettifer R.F. Hermes C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1985; 18: 404-412Crossref Google Scholar). Data reduction, such as background removal, normalization, and extraction of the fine structure, was performed with the EXPROG program package (developed by C. Hermes and H. F. Nolting at the EMBL Outstation Hamburg), assuming a threshold energy E0, Fe = 7120 eV and E0, Se = 12,650 eV. Sample integrity during exposure to synchrotron radiation was checked by monitoring the position and shape of the absorption edge on sequential scans. No change in redox state or metal environment was detectable.X-ray Absorption near Edge Structure (XANES) Analysis—The intensities and energies of the 1s → 3d pre-edge features of the normalized iron K-edge absorption spectra were quantified using the program EDG_FIT, which is a part of EXAFSPAK, a suite of computer programs for analysis of x-ray absorption spectra, written by Prof. Graham N. George (available on the World Wide Web at www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/exafspak.html). The spectra were fitted over 7106-7120 eV. The preedge features were modeled by pseudo-Voigt peak shapes (with a fixed 50:50 ratio of Lorentzian and Gaussian functions), and the energy position, the full width at half-maximum, and the peak height were refined. The background underneath the preedge features was modeled the best as a Gaussian function. Typically, one to two pseudo-Voigt functions were required for good reproduction of the pre-edge spectra. All fits matched the data and their second derivative. The total intensity of the 1s → 3d pre-edge feature was assigned to the sum of the areas (approximated by the height x full width at half-maximum) of all pseudo-Voigt peaks used in the single fit.Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) Analysis—The extracted iron K-edge (25-800 eV or 25-680 eV) and selenium K-edge (25-850 eV) EXAFS data were converted to photoelectron wave vector k-space and weighted by k3. The spectra were analyzed with EXCURV98 (28Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The program calculated the theoretical EXAFS for defined structural models based on the curved wave theory. In addition to single scattering contributions, multiple scattering linear units were defined for Fe-C-O and Fe-C-N. Parameters of each structural model, namely the atomic distances (R), the Debye-Waller factors (2σ2), and a residual shift of the energy origin, were refined, minimizing the fit index (Φ) (28Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). An amplitude reduction factor of 1.0 was used throughout the data analysis. The number of free parameters was always inspected to be less than the number of independent data points (29Stern E.A. Phys. Rev. B. 1993; 48: 9825-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The reduced χ2 test was used to verify the significance of an additional ligand contribution (28Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).RESULTSCoordination of Iron in mHmd—Purified Hmd holoenzyme from M. marburgensis with a specific activity of 600 units (μmol/min)/mg of protein at 40 °C (fully active enzyme (20Lyon E.J. Shima S. Buurman G. Chowdhuri S. Batschauer A. Steinbach K. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)) was analyzed by iron K-edge XAS. Two parts of the spectrum were analyzed independently. The edge region (XANES), in particular the intensity of the 1s → 3d transition (pre-edge peak), is sensitive to the electronic and geometric structure of the iron site and serves as an indicator for the coordination number and/or ligand sphere homogeneity (30Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Synchrotron Rad. 2003; 10: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Details on the type of ligands and their metal distances were extracted from the fine structure (EXAFS). The long data range up to k = 14.5 Å-1 resulted in a very good radial discrimination of the different iron ligands.The XANES pattern of the as isolated mHmd enzyme (Fig. 1A) exhibits relatively low intensity of the rising edge at ∼7128 eV (white line) accompanied by an extraordinarily intense preedge peak at ∼7113 eV with an area of ∼54·10-2 eV (supplemental Table S1). The pre-edge peak intensity higher than 40·10-2 eV, to our knowledge, has never been reported previously for any protein-bound iron ion. For comparison, the pre-edge peak area in the spectrum of the oxidized [NiFe] center of the isolated HoxC subunit of the hydrogen-sensing [NiFe] hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha (31Löscher S. Zebger I. Andersen L.K. Hildebrandt P. Meyer-Klaucke W. Haumann M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4287-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is about 16·10-2 eV. The Fe(II) ion in this enzyme is 5- or potentially even 6-coordinated.The EXAFS spectrum of active mHmd provides further insight into the metal coordination (Fig. 2). The sharp oscillations at ∼6 Å-1 indicate the presence of the elements heavier than oxygen and nitrogen in the vicinity of the iron ion. A beat-node-like change in the regular sinusoidal pattern marks a heterogeneous ligand sphere. This is further substantiated by the Fourier transform (FT) of the EXAFS data (Fig. 2). The FT exhibits two closely spaced maxima (at ∼1.8 and ∼2.3 Å) corresponding to iron-first shell ligand back-scattering contributions followed by a strong peak at ∼2.9 Å. Both the short metal ligand distance of 1.8 Å and the strong contribution at ∼2.9 Å indicate the presence of CO molecules bound to the iron. This is in good agreement with recent results obtained by IR spectroscopy (19Lyon E.J. Shima S. Boecher R. Thauer R.K. Grevels F.W. Bill E. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14239-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). An iron-ligand distance of 2.3 Å is typical for heavier atoms, such as sulfur. Based on these considerations, ligand type, number, and bond length were varied in the quantitative ab initio EXAFS analysis. Several different coordination models were analyzed for their consistency with the data. Structural models based only on a mixture of sulfur and carbon monoxide ligands could not reproduce all features of the fine structure. Therefore, an additional light ligand (oxygen) shell at ∼2 Å was incorporated. Different combinations of CO, oxygen, and sulfur ligands summing up to a total number of ligands of 4, 5, or 6 were tested. In addition, the presence of a Fe-Fe dinuclear center was considered. By far the best fit was obtained for a mononuclear iron center coordinated by two CO groups with an average Fe-C distance of 1.80 Å, one oxygen atom at 2.03 Å and one sulfur atom at 2.31 Å (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). Please note that this result is fully consistent with the observed high intensity 1s → 3d transition. Anyhow, typical error margins in coordination numbers derived from EXAFS are on the order of 20%.FIGURE 2Iron K-edge k3-weighted EXAFS spectra (left) and their Fourier transforms (right) of Hmd and of its iron-containing cofactor.

Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease partly through formation of reactive oxygen species and the release of sequestered molecules that initiate programmed cell death pathways. The heat shock proteins (HSP) are cytoprotective against a number of stressors, including accumulations of misfolded proteins and reactive oxygen species. We reported on the property of Hsp70 to protect cultured neurons from cell death caused by intraneuronal β-amyloid. Here we demonstrate that Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 both alone and in combination provide differential protection against intracellular β-amyloid stress through the maintenance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and functionality of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Notably, β-amyloid was found to selectively inhibit complex IV activity, an effect selectively neutralized by Hsp60. The combined effect of HSPs was to reduce the free radical burden, preserve ATP generation, decrease cytochrome c release, and prevent caspase-9 activation, all important mediators of β-amyloid-induced neuronal dysfunction and death.

Current evidence indicates that intracellular accumulation of β-amyloid in neurons leads to the formation of an insoluble pool in which the peptide is highly aggregated as well as a soluble pool in which toxic oligomers are found (1Turner R.S.

Because neuronal mitochondria are frequently found in close association with the endoplasmic reticulum (5Perkins G. Renken C. Martone M.E. Young S.J. Ellisman M. Frey T. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), it is possible that the local concentration of Aβ is relatively higher in their vicinity compared with other cellular locations. Conceivably, exposure of mitochondria to Aβ alters membrane stability and/or their normal oxidative phosphorylation functions. These considerations make it feasible that a direct impact of intracellular β-amyloid on mitochondrial function may contribute to neurodegeneration in AD through energy failure and activation of apoptosis.A recent study of mitochondrial function in a transgenic model and in AD patients has shown that oxidative phosphorylation is inhibited by the presence of intracellular β-amyloid (6Caspersen C. Wang N. Yao J. Sosunov A. Chen X. Lustbader J.W. Xu H.W. Stern D. McKhann G. Yan S.D. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2040-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), leading to a reduction in ATP production. ATP depletion leads to partial membrane depolarization, release of the voltage-dependent Mg2+ block of NMDA receptors, increase in calcium influx, and a decrease in calcium buffering capacity (7Mattson M.P. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1998; 42: 103-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in intracellular calcium enhances free radical generation and triggers several pathways that lead to cellular dysfunction and death (8Hongpaisan J. Winters C.A. Andrews S.B. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10878-10887Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Examination of brains from patients suffering from AD identifies a high fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis, which is suggested as an important mechanism for neuronal cell loss (9LeBlanc A.C. Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2005; 2: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One of the major events related to activation of the intrinsic programmed cell death pathway is the release of mitochondrial factors, e.g. cytochrome c into the cytoplasm (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Increasing evidence suggests a potential involvement of specific molecular chaperones in several neurodegenerative diseases (11Bonini N.M.

Mammalian HSPs have been classified into two groups according to their size, namely high molecular weight HSPs and small HSPs (19Parcellier A. Gurbuxani S. Schmitt E. Solary E. Garrido C. Biochem.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2069-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As they relate to neurodegenerative conditions, Hsp70 and Hsp90 have been implicated in the maintenance of tau solubility and the suppression of tau aggregates (21Dou F. Netzer W.J. Tanemura K. Li F. Hartl F.U. Takashima A. Gouvas G.K. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Hsp70 is induced by neurons in an attempt to suppress intracellular Aβ-mediated toxicity and that engineered overexpression of Hsp70 can limit this toxicity (22Magrane J. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Querfurth H.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial chaperonins, composed of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) and 10 (Hsp10), are primarily found in the mitochondrial matrix, where they participate in the refolding of misfolded mitochondrial proteins. The mitochondria are a specific target of the protective effect of heat shock specifically against oxidative injury (23Polla B.S. Kantengwa S. Francois D. Salvioli S. Franceschi C. Marsac C. Cossarizza A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6458-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).The activation of heat shock gene transcription is mediated by heat shock transcription factor, which binds to heat shock elements in their respective promoter regions (24Amin J. Ananthan J. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3761-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 25Pelham H.R.

Heat shock transcription factor 1 is found to be a primary component of the heat shock element binding activity in cells exposed to heat shock and many other physiological stresses (27Baler R.

Hosokawa et al. (30Hosokawa N. Hirayoshi K. Nakai A. Hosokawa Y. Marui N. Yoshida M. Sakai T. Nishino H. Aoike A. Kawai K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1990; 15: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) reported that specific flavonoids, including quercetin, inhibited the transcription of various HSPs after heat shock and that this effect was due to the inhibition of heat shock transcription factor activation.The possible connection between intracellular Aβ cytotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction suggests a strategy to protect susceptible mitochondrial functions by using molecular chaperones. In the present study we have examined the functional role of several HSPs to protect vital mitochondrial enzymes and respiratory chain components against poisoning caused by intracellular Aβ. An inducible adenovirus system was used to deliver Aβ-(1-42) to neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons, which had previously been infected with adenovirus encoding the expression of Hsp60, -70, and -90. We were able to mitigate the toxic properties of β-amyloid due in part to the preservation of mitochondrial energy generation. The three heat shock proteins are shown to rescue specific energy deficits when present alone or in combination.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: 6E10 (1:300; Signet Laboratories, Dedham, MA), anti-HSP70 (1:100–5000; Stressgen Biotechnologies), anti-Hsp60 (1:5000; Stressgen Biotechnologies), and anti-Hsp60 (1:100; Stressgen Biotechnologies). All other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma.Cell Culture—Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown to 70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), antibiotics, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For primary cortical neurons, cortices from 2-day-old mouse pups were isolated and trypsinized, and the cells were dissociated by repetitive trituration through a Pasteur glass pipette, counted (1500 cells seeded/mm2), and grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% (v/v) B-27 supplement (Invitrogen).Virus-based Expression—Adenoviruses encoding HSP, LacZ, and Aβ-(1-42) as previously described (22Magrane J. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Querfurth H.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) were grown to high titer in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation. Viral titer was determined by plaque assay. Cell cultures were infected with Adenovirus Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 for 24 h. The medium was replaced, and cultures were co-infected with AdTet-On and AdTRE-Aβ-(1–42) for 24 h at a 1:5 ratio (100 multiplicity of infection). Doxycycline-inducible adenoviral construct encoding (AdTRELacZ) bacterial β-galactosidase and the positive regulator virus (AdTet-On) in a 5:1 ratio infection served as controls. Unless otherwise indicated, transgene expression was induced after adding 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Functional activity and/or-expression of HSPs was inhibited after adding 100 μm Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich) 4 h before and again 6 h after induction with doxycycline.Mitochondrial Isolation—Cells were washed and resuspended in ice-cold sucrose-mannitol buffer followed by homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the mitochondria was saved; the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and rehomogenized. Centrifugation of the resuspended homogenate was repeated, and the supernatants were pooled. The pooled supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The final pellet containing the mitochondria was resuspended in 500 μl of isolation buffer for determining the activities of oxidative phosphorylation and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Mitochondrial protein determinations were performed on diluted samples using the microscale version of the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 10 μg of mitochondrial protein from each sample was used in subsequent experiments (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6). The high speed supernatant, consisting of the cytosolic compartment, was probed for cytochrome c release and caspase-9.FIGURE 3a, amyloid expression did not alter activity levels of complex I or complex II + III in SH-SY5Y cells. b, induction of β-amyloid significantly inhibited the complex IV activity compared with control cells (bar 2).

Cortical neurons driven to overexpress Hsp60 resulted in significant restoration of oxygen consumption at complex IV (bar 5). No additive effect is observed in the combined group of HSPs (bar set 8). The addition of quercetin to the HSP-protected, Aβ-stressed group (bar 9) resulted in a noticeable drop-off in oxygen consumption at complex IV to nearly Aβ alone levels (bar set 3). n = 3 in each case. p < 0.05 (#) and p < 0.01 (##) compared with control; **, p < 0.01 and compared with β-amyloid stressed group. ¶, p < 0.05 compared with Aβ stressed group with added with quercetin (bar 4). Error bars ± S.D. b, in the upper panel and the densitometry analysis to the right, Hsp60 was most effective in reducing cytochrome c release (lane 5 versus 3). Simultaneous expression of all three HSPs entirely abolished this release (lane 8). The addition of quercetin to the Aβ-poisoned cells increased cytochrome c release in “HSP deficient” (lane 4) and reestablished cytochrome c release in HSP-endowed (lane 9) primary neurons. In the lower panel an increase in the level of full-length caspase-9 and of its activated subunits by cleavage is shown to result from intracellular Aβ expression (lane 3 and 4). Hsp70 and Hsp90 overexpression are minimally protective against caspase-9 activation and cleavage, whereas again it is shown that Hsp60 alone (lane 5) is most efficient in mitigating Aβ. HSPs in combination abolished this activation (lane 8). The addition of quercetin re-established the activation of caspase-9. Densitometry is normalized with respect to cdk4 levels and their control. WB, Western blot. c, quercetin aggravates heat shock-induced-cleaved caspase levels (lane 7 versus 3) and blocks the induction of Hsp60.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Complex I—Activity was determined in homogenates of isolated mitochondria as rotenone-sensitive NADH dehydrogenase-mediated reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP). Isolated mitochondrial extract were freeze-thawed in hypotonic medium. The addition of 200 μm NADH, 200 μm decylubiquinol, 2 mm KCN, and 0.002% DCPIP to the extract in the presence and absence of 2 μm rotenone started the reaction, which was monitored at 600 nm at 30 °C.Complex II-III—Activity was determined in isolated mitochondrial preparations. Mitochondrial samples were added to buffer containing 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 7.4), 100 mm EDTA, 2 mm succinate, and 1% dodecylmaltoside. The assay was initiated with the addition of 100 mm cytochrome c and followed by the absorbance, measured at 550 nm at 30 °C in the presence and absence of 4 mm antimycin.Complex IV—Activity was determined in isolated mitochondrial preparations. Mitochondrial samples were added to buffer containing 10 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 0.025% dodecyl maltoside, and 80 mm ferrocytochrome c; the addition of cytochrome c was used to initiate the reaction. Incubation with KCN inhibited complex IV activity. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm at 30 °C. One unit of complex IV activity will oxidize 1.0 μmol of ferrocytochrome c/min at pH 7.0 and 25 °C.α-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase (KGDH)—Activity was assayed as the rate of NAD+ reduction at 340 nm upon the addition of 5.0 mm MgCl2, 40 μm rotenone, 2.5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 1.0 mm CoA, 0.2 mm thymine pyrophosphate, and 1.0 mm NAD+. The addition of mitochondrial sample was used to initiate the reaction. One unit of KGDH activity will convert 1.0 μmol of β-NAD to β-NADH/min.Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Assay—PDH activity was determined as the rate of NAD+ reduction at 340 nm upon the addition of (final concentrations) 51 mm MOPS, 0.20 mm magnesium chloride, 0.01 mm calcium chloride, 0.30 mm cocarboxylase, 0.12 mm coenzyme A, 2.0 mm β-NAD, 2.64 mm l-cysteine hydrochloride, and 5.1 mm pyruvate in a 1-ml reaction mix. The addition of mitochondrial sample was used to initiate the reaction. One unit of PDH activity will convert 1.0 μmol of β-NAD to β-NADH/min in the presence of saturating levels of coenzyme A.Polarography Measurement of Respiratory Complex Activity in Mice Cortical Neurons—The mitochondrial fraction from primary cortical neurons was resuspended in respiration buffer (100 mm KCl, 75 mm mannitol, 25 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.4)) and stored on ice before measurement of respiration rate. Oxygen consumption rates are measured polarographically using an oxygraph (Hanstech Instruments Ltd, Norfolk, England) in a water-jacketed chamber. The reaction volume of 500 μl was maintained at 30 °C. The electrode was connected to a PC running Oxygraph Plus™ software. 10 μl of mitochondrial suspension was added to the chamber to a final concentration of 0.4 mg of protein/ml. Final concentrations of 10 mm glutamate and 5 mm malate were added as substrates for complex I. Complex III respiration was supported by the addition of 10 mm succinate. Complex IV respiration was supported by the addition of 10 mm ascorbate, 200 μm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD). The activities were calculated as the fraction sensitive to the respective inhibitors; rotenone for complex I, antimycin for complex III, and potassium cyanide for complex IV.Measurement of ATP Production—ATP levels were determined as described by Manfredi et al. (31Manfredi G. Spinazzola A. Checcarelli N. Naini A. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 133-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the mitochondrial component of ATP synthesis, 5 mm oligomycin (ATP synthase inhibitor) was added to freshly isolated mitochondria and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The inhibition of ATP production was determined by subtracting the oligomycin-treated preparation from identical untreated sample.H2O2/Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production—To measure reactive oxygen species, cells were suspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by sequential freezing/thawing in water. After homogenization the lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and DCF oxidation was measured at 525 nm (excitation at 475 nm) in a microplate reader (CytoFluor 2350, Perseptive).Lactate Dehydrogenase Release Assay—Conditioned cultured medium was clarified by centrifugation, and LDH enzyme activity measured using the BioVision LDH cytotoxicity assay kit (BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Test media were assayed in triplicate for each treatment condition.Heat Shock Experiments—SH-SY5Y cells normally maintained at 37 °C were first preconditioned at 42 °C for 15 min in 5% CO2. Thereafter, heat shock was induced at 45 °C for 30 min. After heat shock cultures were allowed to recover for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in Triton X-lysis buffer, and cell extracts were used for Western blot analysis of caspase-9 products.Protein Extractions, Electrophoresis, and Western Blotting—For routine whole cell lysates, cultures were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS plus protease inhibitors (Complete Protease inhibitor; Roche Applied Science). Protein determinations were performed on diluted samples using the microscale version of the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For Western blotting proteins were electrophoretically separated and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). After the incubation with specific, primary antibodies, blots were exposed to secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO/Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA). The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and film from Amersham Biosciences. For analysis of amyloid levels, samples were fractionated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels using MES running buffer (Invitrogen). For cytochrome c and caspase-9 level determinations, 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Bio-Rad) were utilized.Statistical Analysis—The data were expressed as mean ± S.D. based on data derived from five independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism® Software, and statistical significance was tested by one-way analysis of variance and when appropriate followed by Bartlett's test for equal variances.RESULTSWe first tested the hypothesis that accumulation of intracellular β-amyloid leads to increased production of ROS and energy depletion. Then we examined whether directed expression of Hsp60, Hsp70, and/or Hsp90 would provide protection against these insults. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were infected individually (or in combination) with adenoviral constructs encoding Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90. 36 h after these infections cells were co-infected with a previously validated (22Magrane J. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Querfurth H.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) doxycycline-inducible adenoviral construct encoding human Aβ-(1–42) (AdTREA-(1–42)). Alternatively, cells were induced to express the inert protein, β-galactosidase (AdTRELacZ). In either case the positive regulator virus AdTRETet-on was coinfected in a 5:1 ratio. 24 h after this infection, Aβ or Lac Z expression was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 24 h. Uninduced cultures and LacZ-expressing cultures served as controls. The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the adenoviral systems we employ are competent to direct the expression of the respective heat shock proteins as well as β-amyloid monomer and oligomer in SH-SY5Y cells. Notably, overexpression of Hsp60 did not appear whatsoever to alter the steady-state levels of Aβ (Fig. 1, a, lane 4 versus 6 and e, bars 1 and 2). Hsp70 overexpression slightly attenuated steady-state Aβ levels (∼25%) in steady-state Aβ levels in SH-SY5Y cells as compared with controls (Fig. 1, b, lane 4 versus 6, and e, bar 3 versus 4). Hsp90 expression led to a more significant decrease (∼45%) (Fig. 1, c and e, bar 5 versus 6). Aβ expression had no effects on any of the endogenous HSP levels (Fig. 1, (a, b, and c, lanes 6 versus 1 and 2). Viral-encoded control viral expression (LacZ) had no effect on endogenous (or expressed) HSP levels, and HSP overexpression in turn had no effect on control LacZ levels (Fig. 1d, lanes 6 versus 1 and 2, lane 4 versus 3 and 5, and lane 4 versus 6).FIGURE 1Western blot (WB, upper panels a–c) show Aβ-42 signals in the lysates of SY5Y cells exposed to AdTRE Aβ-42 and induced with Dox. Endogenous and expressed levels of individual HSPs are given in the lower panels. a, overexpression of Hsp60 did not affect levels of β-amyloid. b, Hsp70 overexpression in this system produces a slight reduction in intracellular Aβ accumulation. c, Hsp90 overexpression shows modest reduction in β-amyloid levels. Aβ expression does not in turn affect endogenous HSP levels (a–c, lanes 6 versus 2). d, control LacZ expression is unaltered by HSP co-infection and does not in turn affect HSP levels. e, densitometry summary of Western blots (a–d).

Aβ accumulation in SH-SY5Y cells led to a significant increase in the production of ROS and a concomitant reduction in ATP synthesis (Fig. 2, a and b; bar 2). Levels of ROS in the presence of β-amyloid accumulation were significantly reduced by the individual expressions of either Hsp60 or Hsp70 (Fig. 2a, bars 3 and 4). Hsp90 expression was not as effective in achieving such reduction (Fig. 2a; bar 5). Co-expression of all three HSPs did not lead to any additional protective effects on ROS reduction. Interestingly, this same experimental paradigm yielded a different outcome in terms of cellular ATP biosynthesis (Fig. 2b). Although intracellular Aβ expression led to an ∼50% reduction in ATP biosynthetic capacity, the effect was ameliorated only by the expression of Hsp60 (bar 3). No response was obtained with expression of either Hsp70 or Hsp90. When all three Hsps were co-expressed, the slightly greater preservation of ATP synthesis appeared mainly attributable to Hsp60 (Fig. 2b, bars 6 versus 3, 4, and 5). Control virus expression AdTRELacZ with or without HSPs had no effect significant effect on ATP production (Fig. 2b, bar 7 versus 8).ATP production in the mitochondria is obligately coupled to oxidative phosphorylation through the electron transport chain. Intracellular Aβ-(1–42) expression had no effect on either complex I activity (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) or complex II + III (succinate dehydrogenase + succinate-cytochrome c reductase) activity in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3a). Complex IV activity on the other hand was significantly impaired by the accumulation of Aβ as compared"
https://openalex.org/W2002427009,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer disease are degenerative diseases that may share common pathophysiologic mechanisms. Neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer patients has been linked to overactivity of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and its activator p35. Both of these proteins are expressed in the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Further, glucose enhances p35 gene expression, promoting the formation of active p35/CDK5 complexes that regulate the expression of the insulin gene. In T2D, chronic elevations of glucose, glucotoxicity, impair beta cell function. We therefore postulated that CDK5 and p35 may be responsible for this beta cell impairment and that inhibition of CDK5 might have a beneficial effect. To test this hypothesis, the pancreatic cell line INS-1 was selected as a known in vitro model of glucotoxicity, and roscovitine (10 μm) was used as a CDK5 inhibitor. Chronic exposure of INS-1 cells to high glucose (20-30 mm) reduced both insulin mRNA levels and the activity of an insulin promoter reporter gene. Inhibition of CDK5 prevented this decrease of insulin gene expression. We used DNA binding (gel shift) assays and Western immunoblots to demonstrate that cellular levels of the transcription factor PDX-1, normally decreased by glucotoxicity, were preserved with CDK5 inhibition, as was the binding of PDX-1 to the insulin promoter. Analyses of nuclear and cytoplasmic PDX-1 protein levels revealed that CDK5 inhibition restores nuclear PDX-1, without affecting its cytoplasmic concentration, suggesting that CDK5 regulates the nuclear/cytoplasm partitioning of PDX-1. Using a Myc-tagged PDX-1 construct, we showed that the translocation of PDX-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during glucotoxic conditions was prevented when CDK5 was inhibited. These studies indicate that CDK5 plays a role in the loss of beta cell function under glucotoxic conditions and that CDK5 inhibitors could have therapeutic value for T2D.

Although an understanding of the pathogenesis of these two diseases is limited, similarities in the pathological alterations in their affected cell types (insulin-producing beta cells in diabetes and neurons in Alzheimer disease) led to the identification of a new signaling pathway in pancreatic beta cells (1Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and its activator p35, initially believed to be specific for brain tissue, are also present in pancreatic beta cells. Further, glucose enhances p35 gene expression, promoting the formation of active p35/CDK5 complexes that in turn regulate the expression of the insulin gene (1Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transient elevations of extracellular glucose promote pancreatic beta cell function and survival (2Park B.H. Rho H.W.

J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E784-E793Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas chronic elevations of glucose have the opposite effect, impairing beta cell function and survival (4Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Olson L.K. Sharma A. Peshavaria M. Wright C.V. Towle H.C. Rodertson R.P. Stein R. Proc. Natl.

Investig. 1986; 77: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The deleterious effects of chronically elevated glucose are referred to as glucotoxicity. Milder forms of glucotoxicity are referred to as glucose desensitization. Glucotoxicity is a critical component of the pathophysiology of T2D because it impairs both the actions of insulin on peripheral tissues and the secretion of insulin by beta cells. Impairment of insulin secretion contributes to further glucose elevation and resultant glucotoxicity. This self-perpetuating forward feedback mechanism accelerates the progression of diabetes and the appearance of diabetic complications (7Kaiser N. Leibowitz G. Nesher R. J. Pediatr. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 16: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because intracellular overactivation of CDK5 is a component of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (8Tsai L.H. Lee M.S. Cruz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Cruz J.C. Tsai L.H. Trends Mol.

Alzheimer's Dis. 2003; 5: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and hyperglycemia results in overactivation of CDK5 in beta cells (1Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that CDK5 signaling may be involved in T2D. We hypothesized that chronic elevation of glucose may induce overactivation of CDK5 in beta cells and promote functional alterations that result in deficient insulin release. This hypothesis predicts that inhibition of CDK5 signaling during glucotoxic stimulation will have a beneficial effect by preserving the function of pancreatic beta cells. To test this possibility, we inhibited CDK5 activity with roscovitine and examined the effects on INS-1 cells exposed to high glucose, a well established in vitro model of glucotoxicity. Sustained elevations of glucose concentrations in these cells, for periods as short as 48 h, are known to suppress insulin gene expression (11Olson L.K. Qian J. Poitout V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The suppression of insulin gene expression by glucotoxicity in beta cells involves several transcription factors and different pathophysiological mechanisms. These mechanisms include the translocation of PDX-1 (also known as STF-1, IPF-1, and IDX-1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (12Kawamori D. Kajimoto Y. Kaneto H. Umayahara Y. Fujitani Y. Miyatsuka T. Watada H. Leibiger I.B. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the proteasomal degradation of MafA (RIPE3b1) (13Harmon J.S. Stein R. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11107-11113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the induction of transcription factors such as CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (14Seufert J. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2528-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that act as negative regulators of insulin gene transcription (15Lu M. Seufert J. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28349-28359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We now show that overstimulation of CDK5 in an experimental model of glucotoxicity is involved in the cytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1 during glucotoxicity. In fact, inhibition of CDK5 with roscovitine prevents the loss of insulin gene expression, an effect mediated, at least in part, by the preservation of the nuclear localization of PDX-1 and its corresponding DNA binding and transcriptional activities. These data unveil a new molecular target for therapies aiming to prevent, to cure, or to reduce the pathological alterations of diabetes mellitus. Chemicals and Antibodies—Tissue culture media, serum, and other cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA-modifying enzymes were acquired from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Roscovitine was purchased from Calbiochem. A rabbit polyclonal PDX-1 antibody (Hm 253) was generated by Covance Research Products (Philadelphia, PA) against the carboxyl-terminal portion of PDX-1, and a Myc tag antibody (9E10) was obtained from BD Biosciences. Cell Lines and Cell Culture Conditions—Rat INS-1 cells were provided by C. Wollheim from the University of Geneva, Switzerland. We used cell passages 99-110. INS-1 cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 11.1 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm penicillin G, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Glucose concentration was adjusted to the experimental conditions by adding 1 m glucose to glucose-free RPMI 1640. RNA Preparation and Northern Blots—Total RNA from INS-1 cells was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Valencia, CA). Aliquots of 10 μg of total RNA were lyophilized and denatured at 65 °C in 7.2% formaldehyde and 50% formamide for 5 min. RNAs were then separated on a 0.66 m formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with specific rat insulin and actin probes as described previously (16Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Extraction and Western Blot Assays—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (17Habener J.F. Drug News Perspect. 2002; 15: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in the presence of the protease inhibitors pepstatin A (1 mg/ml), leupeptin (10 mg/ml), aprotinin (10 mg/ml), and p-aminobenzamidine (0.1 mm). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad reagent kit. For Western blots, 50 μg of nuclear extracts and 200 μg of cytoplasmic extracts of total protein were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electro-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (1Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with a primary antibody followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the luminescence-enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—Determination of CDK5 activity in cellular extracts from INS-1 cells grown in normal (5 mm) and high (30 mm) concentration of glucose was achieved as reported previously (1Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated kinase complexes were incubated with histone H1 substrate in the presence of [32P]ATP. Samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to analysis by autoradiography. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Adherent INS-1 cells grown to 80-90% confluence in 24-well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were rinsed twice in serum-free culture medium before the addition of the transfection mix that contained 250 ng of reporter (-410 Ins-Luc). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h before replacing the normal medium with medium containing different concentrations of glucose as indicated in the figure legends and results. Firefly luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI). All experiments were carried out in triplicate (n = 3) on at least three different occasions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—DNA-protein binding assays were carried out by analyzing 10 μg of nuclear extracts and 10 fmol of the radiolabeled double-stranded DNA probe on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The sequence of the E2/A3 element used was: 5′-GATCCTAGACCTAGGGTAATTAGATTATTAACAAGGGGCCAGATGCCGTGATGAAG-3′. The gels were run at 180 V in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, and the radiolabeled proteins were detected by exposure of the dried gels to x-ray film. Inhibition of CDK5 Expression with siRNAs—Specific depletion of CDK5 was achieved by using small (21 bp) interfering double-stranded ribonucleotides (siRNA) specifically designed to target the coding sequence of the rat CDK5 mRNA. The targeted sequence was 5′-GUUCAGCCCUCCGGGAGAUTT-3′. A corresponding 21-bp scramble siRNA was used as control. These siRNAs were synthesized, high pressure liquid chromatography-purified, and annealed (Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, CO). INS-1 cells were transfected with the corresponding ribonucleotides using Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. The specific depletion of CDK5 protein was evaluated by its detection using Western blot assays. Immunocytochemistry—Detection of nuclear and cytoplasmic PDX-1 in individual cultured cells was achieved by the following procedure. Cells grown on microscope slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed in PBS 3 × 5 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 3% normal donkey serum for 45 min at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody at a 1:5000 dilution for PDX-1 antibody and 1:500 for Myc antibody overnight at 4 °C. Slides were then washed in PBS (3 × 5 min) to eliminate excess antibody. Incubations with secondary antibodies (Cy3 and Cy2) for 45 min at room temperature were followed by final washes in PBS (3 × 5 min), and slides were then mounted using fluorescence mounting medium (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were visualized using an epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., New York, NY) equipped with a TEC-470 CCD camera (Optronics International, Chelmsford, MA). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. An analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to estimate the significance of differences in the measured values within and between groups followed by Fisher's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Inhibition of CDK5 by Roscovitine Prevents the Down-regulation of Insulin mRNA Expression Caused by Chronic High Glucose—To test the hypothesis that CDK5 inhibition may protect insulin-producing beta cells from glucotoxicity, we established cultures of INS-1 cells in different concentrations of glucose and examined insulin mRNA levels using Northern blot analysis. A dose-dependent reduction of insulin mRNA was observed after incubating the cells in glucotoxic conditions for 48 h (20 or 30 mm glucose) (Fig. 1A). 3It is important to note that the fasting glucose levels in rats are typically 7.5 mm, 50% higher than they are in humans (5.5 mm) so that 30 mm glucose in rat INS-1 cells is equivalent to 20 mm glucose in human cells. These data corroborated previous findings in cultured beta cell lines (11Olson L.K. Qian J. Poitout V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We confirmed that this reduction of insulin mRNA levels was the result of a transcriptional response by measuring the activity of a luciferase reporter construct driven by the insulin promoter sequence (-410 of the rat insulin-1 gene). The activity of this reporter was also attenuated by elevations in the concentration of glucose in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B) confirming previously reported findings (11Olson L.K. Qian J. Poitout V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We next determined that in these experimental conditions, sustained elevation of glucose concentration produces an increase of CDK5 activity that remains elevated over the 48 h duration of these experiments (Fig. 1C). This phenomenon is mediated by increased expression of the p35 activator and not by changes in CDK5 protein levels (Fig. 1C). To test the effect of CDK5 inhibition on insulin gene expression, we studied the effect of the CDK5 inhibitor roscovitine on the glucotoxicity-induced down-regulation of insulin mRNA. Roscovitine, 10 μm, was added to confluent cultures of INS-1 cells under conditions previously optimized to achieve specific inhibition of CDK5 activity (1Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, roscovitine almost completely prevented the down-regulation of insulin mRNA expression induced by high glucose (Fig. 1D). Densitometry analysis and statistical comparison of this set of data demonstrate that the effect of roscovitine is statistically significant (Fig. 1E). Binding of PDX-1 DNA to the Insulin Promoter—Earlier studies identified that a mechanism by which glucotoxicity decreases insulin gene expression in beta cells is the depletion of transcription factors essential for both tissue-specific and glucose-induced insulin gene expression (4Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Olson L.K. Sharma A. Peshavaria M. Wright C.V. Towle H.C. Rodertson R.P. Stein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9127-9131Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Olson L.K. Qian J. Poitout V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One such transcription factor is PDX-1, a pancreas- and duodenum-specific homeotic transcription factor required for pancreas formation and insulin gene expression (18Harmon J.S. Tanaka Y. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PDX-1 binds to the A-elements of the insulin promoter and enhances insulin gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors that bind to E-boxes within the promoter. Glucotoxicity has been shown to impair the binding of PDX-1 to the insulin promoter (4Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Olson L.K. Qian J. Poitout V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Forced overexpression of PDX-1 under glucotoxic conditions prevents, at least in part, the down-regulation of insulin gene expression (19Poitout V. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role that inhibition of CDK5 has on PDX-1 binding to the E2/A3 motif of the insulin promoter containing the E2 and A3 elements. We observed that prolonged exposure (48 h) of INS-1 cells to glucose results in a dose-dependent decrease of DNA binding to the E2/A3 element (Fig. 2A). This decrease was specific for DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 2A, complexes C and D), whereas other complexes did not change (Fig. 2A, complexes A and B). By using an antibody for PDX-1, we determined that complex D, and to a lesser extent, complex C, contained DNA-PDX-1 binding complexes. The antibody attenuated the corresponding bands and resulted in the appearance of a new supershift band (Fig. 2B, SS). We then investigated whether inhibition of CDK5 with roscovitine affects the binding of PDX-1 to DNA (Fig. 2C) under glucotoxic conditions. We observed that inhibition of CDK5 preserves PDX-1 binding to the E2/A3 element under conditions of glucotoxicity. The intensities of complexes C and D (Fig. 2C) increased when the cells were concomitantly treated with the CDK5 inhibitor roscovitine. Cellular Fractionation Indicates That the Inhibition of CDK5 Preserves the Accumulation of PDX-1 in the Nucleus—To investigate the mechanism responsible for the increase in PDX-1 binding activity in response to the inhibition of CDK5 activity, INS-1 cells were cultured at low (5 mm) and high (30 mm) glucose for a 48-h period in the presence or absence of roscovitine (10 μm). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared, and protein extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis. The results of these studies showed that inhibition of CDK5 restores the level of PDX-1 in the nucleus (Fig. 3A) that is normally reduced by chronic exposure to high glucose. This effect was specific for PDX-1 since the level of another nuclear protein (poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP)) was unaffected (Fig. 3A). Densitometry quantitative analysis demonstrates that the effect is statistically significant (Fig. 3B). To examine the glucose specificity of our observations, the INS-1 cells were co-cultured in glucose (5 mm) plus mannitol (15 mm), the latter a non-metabolizable glucose analog, to block glucose metabolism. Mannitol had no effect on the levels of nuclear PDX-1, indicating that glucotoxicity is dependent on glucose metabolism (Fig. 3B, lower panel). No significant changes of cytoplasmic PDX-1 were observed in these experiments (Fig. 3C). Translocation of PDX-1 from the Nucleus to the Cytoplasm Is Blocked by the inhibition of CDK5 Activity—The selective depletion of PDX-1 in the nucleus in response to glucotoxicity and its reversal by roscovitine suggest that inhibition of CDK5 prevents the translocation of PDX-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm induced by glucotoxicity. Earlier studies indicated that when beta cells are exposed to chronic high glucose or oxidative stress, levels of nuclear PDX-1 decrease due to a translocation to the cytoplasm (12Kawamori D. Kajimoto Y. Kaneto H. Umayahara Y. Fujitani Y. Miyatsuka T. Watada H. Leibiger I.B. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the possibility that the inhibition of CDK5 prevents translocation of PDX-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We prepared a Myc-tagged construct of PDX-1 and examined its cellular distribution in response to glucotoxicity and treatment with roscovitine. Chronic stimulation of INS-1 cells with high glucose increased cytoplasmic and decreased nuclear staining of both the Myc-tagged PDX-1 and the endogenous PDX-1 (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of CDK5 with roscovitine restored the accumulation of PDX-1 in the nucleus and decreased cytoplasmic staining. The proportion of cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was scored for ∼1000 cells/treatment in three independent experiments (Fig. 4B). Glucotoxicity significantly increased the frequency of cells with detectable cytoplasmic PDX-1, and inhibition of CDK5 with roscovitine prevented such an increase. Further, the inhibition of CDK5 restored the frequency of cells positive for nuclear PDX-1 to that of cells unexposed to high glucose (Fig. 4B). No changes were observed when roscovitine was applied to INS-1 cells grown in 5 mm glucose. To further evaluate the specificity of such an effect, we used a set of double-stranded ribonucleotides designed to interfere with the CDK5 mRNA sequence (siRNAs) to induce its specific degradation. First, we tested the efficacy and specificity of this approach by determining the level of CDK5 and β-actin proteins after siRNA administration (Fig. 5A). Then, we studied the effect of CDK5 siRNA on the intracellular distribution of endogenous and Myc-tagged PDX-1 after transfection of the corresponding expression vector. Quantitative analysis of the data indicates that CDK5 siRNA prevents the translocation of PDX-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm induced by glucotoxicity (Fig. 5B). No effect was observed at normal glucose concentrations. These results further corroborate the findings observed with pharmacological inhibition of CDK5 kinase activity and support the notion that sustained activation of CDK5 is a new pathophysiological mechanism that contributes to the impairment of beta cell function due to chronic exposure to high glucose.FIGURE 5Inhibition of CDK5 activity by RNA interference using a double-stranded siRNA indicates that the direct inhibition of CDK5, and not other possible side effects of roscovitine, is the likely mechanism responsible for its effect on glucotoxicity. A, a double-stranded siRNA that specifically targets the rat CDK5 mRNA sequence significantly decreases the amount of CDK5 protein in INS-1 cells without affecting the level of β-actin control protein. Dens units, density units. B, inhibition of CDK5 expression by CDK5 siRNA results in a restoration of the localization of PDX-1 to nuclei under glucotoxic conditions without affecting its localization under normal physiological conditions. This effect reproduces the effect of pharmacological CDK5 inhibition with roscovitine. Statistical significance is depicted as *** (p < 0.001) when compared with control values (panel A) and * (p < 0.05) when compared with control values and # (p < 0.05) when compared with glucotoxic values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The studies presented herein demonstrate that in beta cells, long term exposure to high glucose results in a corresponding sustained elevation of CDK5 activity. This elevation is due to an increased expression level of its p35 activator without changes in the level of CDK5 protein. We also show that inhibition of CDK5 activity with roscovitine protects pancreatic beta cells from some of the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of glucose (glucotoxicity). It is generally believed that many of the alterations associated with diabetes mellitus are induced by the glucotoxic milieu associated with the disease. In T2D, chronic hyperglycemia contributes to both insulin resistance and the functional impairment of beta cells. This circumstance creates a positive forward feedback mechanism responsible for further metabolic deterioration and the eventual appearance of secondary vascular complications. Investigations of beta cell glucotoxicity have utilized several in vitro (4Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Olson L.K.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Nguyen M.D. Julien J.P. NeuroSignals. 2003; 12: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) experimental models that collectively demonstrate decreased rates of insulin release, diminished insulin production, and a reduction in insulin gene expression. In these studies, we have corroborated previous findings in INS-1 cells, indicating that the expression of insulin mRNA is remarkably reduced when the cells are cultured in medium containing a high glucose concentration for a period as short as 48 h. Although this model may not represent the full complexity of pathophysiological alterations associated with diabetes mellitus, it has several advantages over other in vitro models of glucotoxicity. These other models require longer exposure times to high glucose, and therefore, multiple in vitro cell passages are also required. Selective toxicity on actively replicating beta cells may allow for selection of certain cell populations better adapted to survive in high glucose. Because in vivo, beta cells have a very low rate of replication, we consider that our data obtained with confluent INS-1 cells may better represent the pure functional alterations characteristic of glucotoxicity. Glucotoxicity-induced reductions in the levels of transcription factors PDX-1 and MafA (RIPE3b1) in the nuclei of beta cells were identified as potential mediators of impaired insulin production (4Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Olson L.K. Sharma A. Peshavaria M. Wright C.V. Towle H.C. Rodertson R.P. Stein R. Proc. Natl.

Our findings suggest that the inhibition of CDK5 under conditions of glucotoxicity preserves insulin gene expression by a mechanism that involves the restoration of the DNA binding and nuclear localization of PDX-1. We did not consider in these studies the involvement of MafA because its nuclear depletion during glucotoxicity depends on proteasomal degradation and not on a translocation mechanism such as the one we demonstrate for PDX-1. We found that the restoration of the nuclear levels of PDX-1 by inhibition of CDK5 occurs by preventing the translocation of PDX-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. These findings support the notion that overactivation of CDK5 in beta cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2D. Extensive similarities exist between beta cells and neurons and between Alzheimer disease and T2D (1Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Overactivation of CDK5 is a central mechanism of neuronal dysfunction and cell death in Alzheimer disease (8Tsai L.H.

Kaneto H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1011: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Our data, therefore, expand the view that CDK5-induced phosphorylation may be a much more important and widespread cellular process than previously recognized and that dysfunction of CDK5 activity may alter cell function in a way that contributes to the pathophysiology of several common chronic diseases. The mechanism responsible for nuclear depletion of both PDX-1 and MafA during glucotoxicity seems to require the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (12Kawamori D. Kajimoto Y. Kaneto H. Umayahara Y. Fujitani Y. Miyatsuka T. Watada H. Leibiger I.B. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Harmon J.S. Stein R. Robertson R.P. J.

Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because ROS formation and oxidative stress are also characteristic pathogenic alterations in Alzheimer disease, it may be that in beta cells, glucotoxicity-induced oxidative stress is also linked to the pathogenic alterations caused by CDK5 activation. In favor of this possibility are earlier findings, indicating that in human neuroblastoma-derived cells, the induction of reactive oxygen species results in an elevation of p35/CDK5 activity (25Otth C. Mendoza-Naranjo A. Mujica L. Zambrano A. Concha I.I. Maccioni R.B. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 2403-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we suggest that CDK5 activation during chronic exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of glucose may be linked to the generation of ROS. For these reasons, we are currently focusing our investigation on the relationship between CDK5 activation and the generation of ROS species in beta cells.

Aged crystallins have high levels of covalent damage, including glutamine deamidation. Human γD-crystallin (HγD-Crys) is a two-domain β-sheet protein of the lens nucleus. The two domains interact through interdomain side chain contacts, including Gln-54 and Gln-143, which are critical for stability and folding of the N-terminal domain of HγD-Crys. To test the effects of interface deamidation on stability and folding, single and double glutamine to glutamate substitutions were constructed. Equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments of the proteins were performed in guanidine hydrochloride at pH 7.0, 37 °C, or urea at pH 3.0, 20 °C. Compared with wild type, the deamidation mutants were destabilized at pH 7.0. The proteins populated a partially unfolded intermediate that likely had a structured C-terminal domain and unstructured N-terminal domain. However, at pH 3.0, equilibrium unfolding transitions of wild type and the deamidation mutants were indistinguishable. In contrast, the double alanine mutant Q54A/Q143A was destabilized at both pH 7.0 and 3.0. Thermal stabilities of the deamidation mutants were also reduced at pH 7.0. Similarly, the deamidation mutants lowered the kinetic barrier to unfolding of the N-terminal domain. These data indicate that interface deamidation decreases the thermodynamic stability of HγD-Crys and lowers the kinetic barrier to unfolding due to introduction of a negative charge into the domain interface. Such effects may be significant for cataract formation by inducing protein aggregation or insolubility.

Such effects may be significant for cataract formation by inducing protein aggregation or insolubility. Transparency of the human eye lens depends on high concentrations and short range order of the crystallin proteins (1Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 2Fernald R.D. Wright S.E. Nature. 1983; 301: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Enucleated mature lens fiber cells do not actively synthesize protein, and consequently, the crystallin proteins of nuclear lens cells are as old as the lens itself. This unique phenomenon necessitates life long protein stability and solubility despite elevated concentrations and exposure to environmental stresses. A striking feature of cataract is the sharp rise in prevalence with increasing age (3National Eye InstitutePrevent Blindness in America,. 2002; (Bethesda, MD): 22-25Google Scholar). The crystallin proteins accumulate high levels of covalent damage as they age, suggesting that covalent damage of the crystallins may cause or contribute to disease onset. Cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide and affects one in six people over the age of 40 in the United States (3National Eye InstitutePrevent Blindness in America,. 2002; (Bethesda, MD): 22-25Google Scholar). Cataract is associated with the presence of insoluble light-scattering crystallin inclusions. Formation of these inclusions is likely caused by loss of crystallin solubility and/or aggregation. The α-, β-, and γ-crystallins are found in all vertebrate lenses. The α-crystallins associate to form large polydisperse multimers that possess in vitro molecular chaperone activity (4Boyle D. Takemoto L. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is believed that in the lens, the β- and γ-crystallins function solely as structural proteins. The β- and γ-crystallins adopt similar two domain, β-sheet, Greek key motif folds. The wild-type γ-crystallins are remarkably stable in vitro and generally have free energies of unfolding (ΔG0) that are higher than the wild-type α- and β-crystallins (14Bloemendal H. de Jong W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 407-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The two domains of the monomeric γ-crystallins interact intramolecularly via side chain contacts across a domain interface (6Bax B. Lapatto R. Nalini V. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Mahadevan D.

For instance, the domains of βB2-Crys 4The abbreviations used are: Crys, crystallin; HγD-Crys, human γD-crystallin; DTT, dithiothreitol; N-td, N-terminal domain; C-td, C-terminal domain; FI, fluorescence intensity. interact intermolecularly to form a domain-swapped dimer (6Bax B.

Whether they occur intra- or intermolecularly, domain interface interactions are important for folding, stability, and oligomerization of the β- and γ-crystallins (9Hope J.N. Chen H.C.

Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2030-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Glutamine and asparagine deamidation has been observed in all of the major crystallin proteins recovered from cataractous lenses (15Groenen P.J. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 16Lampi K.J. Ma Z. Hanson S.R. Azuma M. Shih M. Shearer T.R. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. David L.L. Exp.

At the atomic level, deamidation can cause backbone isomerization and introduces a negative charge at physiological pH. It has been suggested that deamidation of Asn-143 in human γS-crystallin is specifically associated with mature-onset cataract formation (18Takemoto L. Boyle D. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 164-168PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, deamidated β-crystallins isolated from human lenses have an increased tendency to associate into noncovalent aggregates (19Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Deamidation may cause changes in protein structure or solubility that could instigate cataract formation.

In contrast, deamidation of glutamines in the domain interfaces of dimeric βB1-Crys and βB2-Crys decreased stabilities of the proteins and caused them to populate partially unfolded intermediates in equilibrium experiments (21Kim Y.H.

Specific effects of covalent damage on the properties of the γ-crystallins have not been addressed previously. Human γD-crystallin (HγD-Crys) is one of the most abundant γ-crystallins of the lens nucleus, and covalently damaged forms accumulate in aged lenses (27Hanson S.R. Hasan A. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp.

HγD-Crys adopts the typical two domain fold of the γ-crystallins where the two domains interact intramolecularly (31Basak A. Bateman O. Slingsby C. Pande A. Asherie N. Ogun O. Benedek G.B. Pande J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In vitro stability and folding of HγD-Crys have been studied previously by using fluorescence as a probe of conformation (12Flaugh S.L. Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Flaugh S.L. Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J.

In equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments at pH 7.0 and 37 °C, wild-type HγD-Crys populated a partially folded intermediate that likely had a folded C-terminal domain (C-td) and unfolded N-terminal domain (N-td) (12Flaugh S.L. Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Off-pathway aggregation competed with productive refolding when HγD-Crys was diluted out of high concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) into buffer (34Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the domain interface of HγD-Crys includes a pair of buried glutamines that form hydrogen bonds to four water molecules present in the crystal structure (31Basak A. Bateman O. Slingsby C. Pande A. Asherie N. Ogun O. Benedek G.B. Pande J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A cluster of six hydrophobic residues that are buried in the domain interface are also in close proximity to these apical glutamines. It was shown previously that although neither Gln-54 nor Gln-143 are critical determinants of structure, mutating these residues to alanine destabilized the N-td and slowed its rate of refolding in vitro (13Flaugh S.L. Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2030-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Glutamine is conserved in these positions among β- and γ-crystallins from diverse species at ∼78% identity for Gln-54 and ∼80% identity for Gln-143. Given the importance of Gln-54 and Gln-143 in stability and folding, and that deamidation of analogously positioned glutamines in the β-crystallins causes destabilization, we suspected that deamidation of these residues would destabilize HγD-Crys due to introduction of a negative charge into the domain interface. To test this, single and double glutamine to glutamate mutants were constructed, and in vitro properties of the mutant proteins were studied. The deamidation mutations destabilized the proteins at pH 7.0 but not pH 3.0. Additionally, the mutations reduced the rate of refolding and increased the rate of unfolding of the N-td resulting in a decreased kinetic barrier to unfolding. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant HγD-Crys—Single and double glutamine to glutamate substitutions of residues Gln-54 and Gln-143 were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant primers (IDT-DNA) were used to amplify the gene for HγD-Crys with an N-terminal His6 tag in a pQE.1 plasmid (33Kosinski-Collins M.S. Flaugh S.L. King J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2223-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Substitutions were confirmed by DNA sequencing of all amplified plasmids (Massachusetts General Hospital). Wild-type and mutant HγD-Crys proteins were expressed and purified as described by Kosinski-Collins et al. (33Kosinski-Collins M.S. Flaugh S.L. King J.

The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), and finally dialyzed into 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.0). Concentrations of purified proteins were calculated from absorbance data at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 41,040 cm-1 m-1 for all proteins. Calculating Solvent-accessible Surface Areas—Solvent-accessible surface areas of Gln-54 and Gln-143 were calculated from the crystal structure of HγD-Crys, Protein Data Bank code 1HK0 (31Basak A. Bateman O. Slingsby C. Pande A. Asherie N. Ogun O. Benedek G.B. Pande J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), using the program GETAREA 1.1 (35Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant proteins were recorded with an AVIV model 202 CD spectrometer (Lakewood, NJ). Proteins were present at 100 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The temperature was maintained at 37 °C using an internal Peltier thermoelectric temperature controller. Far-UV CD spectra were collected from 195 to 260 nm in a 1-mm cuvette. Buffer signal was subtracted from all spectra, after which mean residual ellipticity was calculated. Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra of the wild-type and mutant HγD-Crys proteins were measured with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorimeter. Samples at pH 7.0 and 37 °C contained 10 μg/ml purified protein in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), and 5.5 m GdnHCl where appropriate. Samples at pH 3.0 and 20 °C contained 10 μg/ml protein in 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 3.0). Temperature was maintained at 37 or 20 °C using a circulating water bath. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used to selectively monitor tryptophan fluorescence. Emission spectra were recorded over a range of wavelengths from 310 to 400 nm using slit widths of 10 nm for both excitation and emission. Fluorescence emission spectra were corrected for the buffer signal. Equilibrium Unfolding and Refolding—Equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments at pH 7.0 were performed in GdnHCl at 37 °C. For equilibrium unfolding experiments, purified protein was diluted into solutions containing 0-5.5 m GdnHCl (purchased as an 8.0 m solution from Sigma) to give a final protein concentration of 10 μg/ml. All pH 7.0 unfolding samples contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm DTT, and 1mm EDTA (pH 7.0). Unfolding samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to ensure equilibrium had been reached. For equilibrium refolding experiments, purified proteins were first unfolded in 5.5 m GdnHCl at a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml. These unfolded stocks were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h to ensure complete unfolding. The unfolded stock solutions were then diluted into refolding samples, which contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), and GdnHCl from 0.55 to 5.5 m. Refolding samples were allowed to reach equilibrium by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h prior to recording fluorescence spectra. Equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments at pH 3.0 were performed in urea at 20 °C. Samples were set up in a manner identical to that described above for pH 7.0 experiments where the final protein concentration was 10 μg/ml. Unfolding and refolding samples were buffered with 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 3.0) and did not contain DTT or EDTA due to concerns of low solubility at pH 3.0. A 24-h incubation time was used for both unfolding and refolding samples. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded for each unfolding and refolding sample using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorimeter as described above. The concentration of GdnHCl or urea in the unfolding/refolding samples was determined by measuring the refractive index of each sample. Data were analyzed by plotting the concentration of GdnHCl for each sample versus the fluorescence intensity at 360 nm and the concentration of GdnHCl versus the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 360 and 320 nm (FI 360/320 nm). Equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments of the wild-type and mutant proteins were performed three times each. Equilibrium unfolding and refolding data were fit to a two-state model by the methods of Greene and Pace (36Greene Jr., R.F. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5388-5393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a three-state model by the methods of Clark et al. (37Clark A.C. Sinclair J.F. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the curvefitting feature of Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The model that best fit the data was selected based on a random distribution of residuals. Transition midpoints, ΔG0, and m values were calculated for all transitions and averaged over the three trials. Thermal Denaturation—Thermal denaturation experiments were performed using an AVIV model 202 CD spectrometer equipped with an internal Peltier thermo-electric temperature controller (Lakewood, NJ). All samples contained 100 μg/ml protein in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The solution conditions differed from equilibrium experiments because of the optical interference of EDTA and DTT and higher concentrations of sodium phosphate. A 4-mm cuvette with an air-tight screw cap was used for the measurements to prevent loss of sample at high temperatures due to evaporation or boiling over. Changes in molar ellipticity at 218 nm were monitored every 1 °C from 25 to 90 °C. The samples were allowed to equilibrate at each temperature for 1 min before measuring ellipticity over a 3-s averaging time. The fraction of native (FN) protein at each temperature was calculated according to Equation 1, FN=(y-yU)/(yN-yU) where y is the ellipticity at 218 nm; yU is the unfolded/aggregated base line, and yN is the native base line. Melting temperatures were calculated by determining the midpoints of the thermal transitions. The experiments were repeated three times for each protein, and melting temperatures of the three trials were averaged. Productive Refolding Kinetics—Kinetic refolding experiments were performed by initially unfolding in 5.5 m GdnHCl at a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml. These unfolded stocks were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h to ensure complete unfolding. The unfolded stocks were injected into constantly stirred refolding buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) at 37 °C. A syringe-port injection system with a dead time of 1 s was used. Changes in fluorescence over time were monitored with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorimeter using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and emission wavelength of 350 nm. The final protein concentration of refolding samples was 10 μg/ml in 1.0 m GdnHCl. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured at the end of each experiment to ensure that the proteins had completely refolded into native-like conformations. Kinetic refolding data were fit to two and three exponentials using the curve-fitting feature of Kaleidagraph and residuals of the fits were calculated (Synergy Software). The model with the most random distribution of low magnitude residuals was selected as the best fit. Kinetic refolding experiments of the wild-type and mutant proteins were performed three times each, and parameters of the fits were averaged. Unfolding Kinetics—Kinetic unfolding experiments were performed by diluting purified proteins into 5.0 m GdnHCl and monitoring fluorescence emission at 350 nm over time using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The kinetic unfolding samples contained proteins at final concentrations of 10 μg/ml in 5.0 m GdnHCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) at 37 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at the end of each experiment to ensure that the proteins had fully unfolded. Kinetic unfolding data were fit to two and three exponentials, and residuals of the fits were calculated using the curve-fitting feature of Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The best fit was chosen by a random arrangement of residuals. Experiments were performed three times for each protein, and parameters were averaged. Protein Purification and Structure Characterization—To probe the site-specific effects of domain interface glutamine deamidation in HγD-Crys, single and double glutamine to glutamate substitution mutants were constructed as follows: Q54E, Q143E, and Q54E/Q143E. The mutant proteins were purified out of E. coli, and the stabilities and folding properties of the proteins were determined in vitro. The wild-type and mutant proteins all had exogenous N-terminal His6 tags that were utilized during affinity purification. Previous studies of wild-type HγD-Crys with and without the N-terminal His6 tag confirmed that the additional sequence did not discernibly affect the structure or thermodynamic and kinetic unfolding/refolding properties of the protein (33Kosinski-Collins M.S. Flaugh S.L. King J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2223-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, the His6 tag was not removed for these investigations. The single and double deamidation mutants of residues Gln-54 and Gln-143 expressed at levels similar to wild type and behaved like wild type during affinity purification. The mutant proteins were found primarily in the soluble fractions of cell lysates indicating that the mutations did not prevent in vivo folding into soluble native-like conformations. Structures of wild-type HγD-Crys, Q54E, Q143E, and Q54E/Q143E were probed with CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. These experiments addressed gross changes in secondary and tertiary structure and were not aimed at distinguishing atomic resolution differences in conformation. Similar to previous results, the far-UV CD spectrum of wild-type HγD-Crys at pH 7.0 displayed a distinct minimum at 218 nm, indicative of high β-sheet content, and a small shoulder at 208 nm (38Andley U.P.

Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6116-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The single and double deamidation mutants all displayed similar minima at 218 nm and a shoulder at 208 nm (Fig. 2). CD spectra of the single mutants Q54E and Q143E were indistinguishable from that of wild type in the region analyzed, whereas the spectra of Q54E/Q143E differed about 20% in intensity at lower wavelengths (Fig. 2). This difference may be due to actual changes in conformation or slight differences in solution conditions. Domain tertiary structures of wild-type HγD-Crys and of the deamidation mutants were surveyed using tryptophan fluorescence emission. HγD-Crys has four intrinsic tryptophans, two per domain, that are buried in the hydrophobic cores of the domains. HγD-Crys also has 14 tyrosines located throughout the protein. Tryptophan fluorescence was selectively monitored by using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and monitoring emission from 310 to 400 nm. In accord with previous results, native wild-type HγD-Crys displayed a fluorescence emission maximum at 325 nm (Fig. 2), and upon denaturing in 5.5 m GdnHCl, the fluorescence emission maximum shifted to 350 nm and increased in intensity (34Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The native fluorescence emission spectrum of Q54E was indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 2). In contrast, although the spectra of Q143E and Q54E/Q143E had identical emission maxima as wild type, the overall intensities were increased ∼10% (Fig. 2). Solvent-accessible surface areas of Gln-54 and Gln-143 in the crystal structure of HγD-Crys (31Basak A. Bateman O. Slingsby C. Pande A. Asherie N. Ogun O. Benedek G.B. Pande J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were calculated with the program GETAREA 1.1 (35Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The solvent-accessible surface area of the Gln-54 side chain was calculated to be 20.22 Å2, and the solvent-accessible surface area of Gln-143 was calculated to be 3.2 Å2. Relative to the total surface area of the glutamine side chain (143.7 Å2), 86% of the side chain surface area of Gln-54 is buried, and 97% of the side chain surface area of Gln-143 is buried. Despite being highly buried, the side chain amide nitrogen of Gln-54 and the side chain amide oxygen of Gln-143 form hydrogen bonds to two water molecules each as seen in the crystal structure and shown in Fig. 1 (31Basak A. Bateman O. Slingsby C. Pande A. Asherie N. Ogun O. Benedek G.B. Pande J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Unfolding/Refolding of Wild Type at pH 7.0—The thermodynamic stability of wild-type HγD-Crys was analyzed by equilibrium unfolding/refolding using the chemical denaturant GdnHCl, at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. GdnHCl was used in these experiments instead of urea because wild-type HγD-Crys has been shown previously to resist denaturation up to 8 m urea at pH 7.0 (34Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The conformation of proteins in equilibrium experiments was probed with tryptophan fluorescence. To this end, the fluorescence intensity changes at 360 nm and changes in the ratio of intensities at 360 and 320 nm (FI 360/320 nm) were used for data analysis. The FI 360/320 nm ratio data are shown in Fig. 3 instead of changes in the intensity at 360 nm because the transition plateau was visually more perceptible."

Accumulating evidence indicates that members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family are components of SOCs in mammalian cells. Agonist stimulation activates SOCs and TRP channels directly and by inducing translocation of channels in intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane (PM). The mechanism of TRP channel translocation in response to store depletion and agonist stimulation is not known. Here we use TRPC3 as a model to show that IP3 and the scaffold Homer 1 (H1) regulate the rate of translocation and retrieval of TRPC3 from the PM. In resting cells, TRPC3 exists in TRPC3-H1b/c-IP3Rs complexes that are located in part at the PM and in part in intracellular vesicles. Binding of IP3 to the IP3Rs dissociates the interaction between IP3Rs and H1 but not between H1 and TRPC3 to form IP3Rs-TRPC3-H1b/c. TIRFM and biotinylation assays show robust receptor- and store-dependent translocation of the TRPC3 to the PM and their retrieval upon termination of cell stimulation. The translocation requires depletion of stored Ca2+ and is prevented by inhibition of the IP3Rs. In HEK293, dissociating the H1b/c-IP3R complex with H1a results in TRPC3 translocation to the PM, where it is spontaneously active. The TRPC3-H1b/c-IP3Rs complex is reconstituted by infusing H1c into these cells. Reconstitution is inhibited by IP3. Deletion of H1 in mice markedly reduces the rates of translocation and retrieval of TRPC3. Conversely, infusion of H1c into H1-/- cells eliminates spontaneous channel activity and increases the rate of channel activation by agonist stimulation. The effects of H1c are inhibited by IP3. These findings together with our earlier studies demonstrating gating of TRPC3 by IP3Rs were used to develop a model in which assembly of the TRPC3-H1b/c-IP3Rs complexes by H1b/c mediates both the translocation of TRPC3-containing vesicles to the PM and gating of TRPC3 by IP3Rs.

A newly discovered and apparently a general regulatory mechanism of TRPC channel activity is agonist-stimulated translocation of the channels to the PM. In HEK293 cells, receptor stimulation but not passive store depletion was reported to stimulate the translocation of TRPC3 to the PM in a mechanism that was inhibited by cleavage of VAMP2 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 2) with tetanus toxin (38Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Liu X. Bollimuntha S. Brazer S.C. Combs C. Das S. Leenders A.G. Sheng Z.H. Knepper M.A. Ambudkar S.V. Ambudkar I.S. Mol.

However, unlike the role of VAMP2, phospholipase Cγ does not affect the acute expression or translocation of TRPC3 but rather the steady-state level of TRPC3 in the PM (22van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Sharma S. Barrow R.K. Kornberg M. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor resulted in translocation of TRPC5 to the PM in a mechanism that was dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase, the Rho GTPase Rac1, and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP(5)Kα) (24Bezzerides V.J. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S. Greka A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Finally, stimulation of the muscarinic M3 receptor resulted in translocation of TRPC6 to the PM in a time course that coincides with activation of Ca2+ influx (25Cayouette S. Lussier M.P. Mathieu E.L. Bousquet S.M. Boulay G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7241-7246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For the most part, TRPC channel translocation has been studied in cell lines. Whether such a mechanism also operates in native cells is not known. Furthermore, TRPC3, -5, and -6 bind Homers and IP3Rs (33Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Muallem S. Worley P.F.

The potential role of Homer and IP3Rs in this form of regulation of TRP channels activity is not known. Here, we used cells transfected with TRPC3 and Homer 1 (H1) isoforms and cells prepared from WT and H1-/- mice to report that H1 regulates the agonist- and store-dependent translocation and antagonist-mediated retrieval of TRPC3 from the PM. This process requires the dissociation of the IP3Rs-H1-TRPC3 complex by binding of IP3 to the IP3Rs. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which store depletion leads to activation of TRPC channels and Ca2+ influx. Materials and Solution—Anti-TRPC3 antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Craig Montell (Johns Hopkins University) or batch 2 from Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel). Anti-IP3R3 antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories, and anti-HA antibodies were from Covance (Princeton, NJ). pRK5-HA-TRPC3, pRK5-HA-Homer 1a, and pRK5-HA-Homer 1c were prepared as detailed elsewhere (33Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Muallem S. Worley P.F.

All biotinylation-related products were purchased from Pierce. Cell Culture, Transfection, Co-immunoprecipitation, Pull-down Assay, and IP3 Competition Assay—M3-HEK cells stably expressing the type 3 muscarinic receptor were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and used 36-48 h post-transfection. For co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), the cells were lysed in a buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences). Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA antibodies and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the IP3 competition assay, M3-HEK cell lysates and pancreatic microsomal lysates were incubated with or without 100 μm IP3 for 30 min at 0 °C (ice water bath) to bind IP3 to the IP3Rs. GST, GST-H1a, or GST-H1c coupled to beads was then added to the extracts, and the incubation at 0 °C continued for 4-12 h. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and proteins were released by incubation in SDS sample buffer. Pulled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Due to the long incubation required for the pull-down and co-IP assays (≥4.5 h), 100 μm IP3 was used to ensure the presence of IP3 during the entire incubation periods. Isolation of Pancreatic Acinar Cells—The pancreases of 1-2 mice were removed and digested with collagenase and trypsin to isolate single cells to improve access to biotin. Single pancreatic acinar cells were prepared as described before (40Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pancreases were finely minced and digested with 4 mg/15 ml collagenase P for 5 min at 37 °C in a solution named PSA that contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 10 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor. The cells were then washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and treated for 2 min at 37 °C with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma), washed with PSA, and digested again with collagenase for 3-4 min at 37 °C. Finally, the cells were washed with PSA and stored on ice until use. Protein Extraction—Mice were scarified, and the tissues of interest were collected. To prepare microsomes, each tissue was washed with a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized in 5 ml of buffer by 20 strokes with a Dawn's homogenizer. After centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 rpm, the supernatants were centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 rpm. The microsomes were dissolved in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaEDTA, 5 mm NaEGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm benzamidine and kept on ice for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by 15-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentration in the extracts was measured by the Bradford method. Surface Biotinylation Assay—Sulfo-NHE-ss-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2 was added to control cells or cells treated with agonist, antagonist, or CPA, and the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. Free biotin was quenched by the addition of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+, and then the cells were washed once with PBS. Lysates were prepared in lysis buffer by passing 7-10 times through a 27-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration in the supernatants was determined. Volume and protein content were adjusted to be the same in all samples, and to each sample was added 10% streptavidin beads (Pierce) in 300 μl. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and the proteins were extracted by suspending the beads in sample loading buffer. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining was performed as detailed previously (41Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Pancreatic, parotid, or submandibular cells were immobilized on a poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip and were permeabilized with 0.5 ml of cold methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. The samples were washed with PBS, and the nonspecific sites were blocked by a 1-h incubation with a solution containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin in PBS (blocking medium). The medium was aspirated and replaced with 50 μl of blocking medium containing control serum or a 1:50 dilution of anti-TRPC3, 1:100 dilution of anti-IP3R3, and a 1:10 dilution of anti-ZO1 antibodies. After incubation with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and three washes with the incubation buffer, the antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine. Images were analyzed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. TRPC3 Current Recording in HEK Cells—M3-HEK cells were transfected with TRPC3 and green fluorescent protein. Whole cell current measurement was accomplished 48 h post-transfection. Cells on coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber, and green fluorescent protein fluorescence was used to identify the transfected cells. The cells were perfused with bath solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Na+-free bath solution contained 150 mm NMDG-Cl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4 with Tris. The pipette solution contained 140 mm NMDG-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 150 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2 with Tris to eliminate the native K+ current. The patch pipette had a resistance of 2-4 megaohms. After gigaseal (>8 gigaohms) was formed on the cell surface, the whole cell configuration was established by gentle suction. The current was measured by holding the membrane potential at 0 mV and sampled by a 200-ms rapid alterations of membrane potential (RAMPs) between -100 mV and +60 mV. The current at -100 mV was extracted and plotted as a function of time. Whole Cell Current Recording in Single Pancreatic Acinar Cells—Single pancreatic acinar cells were prepared by a three-step method described previously with some modification (42Zeng W. Mak D.O. Li Q. Shin D.M. Foskett J.K. Muallem S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 872-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mouse pancreas was minced into fine pieces of ∼1mm3, washed, and digested with collagenase type IV (40 units/ml for 6 min at 37 °C). The tissue was washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and digested with PBS solution containing 0.025% trypsin for 3 min at 37 °C. The tissue was washed twice with PSA and digested with PSA containing collagenase type IV 20 units/ml for 3 min at 37 °C. Finally, the cells were filtered, suspended in PSA, and kept on ice until use. The cells were perfused with a bath solution containing 140 mm NaC1, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, with NaOH) (divalent free). The patch pipette resistance was 2-5 megaohms when it was filled with internal solution containing 140 mm NMDG-Cl, 1mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3 with Tris). After a gigaseal (>5 gigaohms) was obtained, the holding potential was changed from 0 to -80 mV. The whole cell configuration was established by a pulse of suction. The current output from the patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch-200B; Axon Instruments) was filtered at 20 Hz, sampled at 1 kHz, and stored in computer with a Digi-Data 1200 interface and pclamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments). TIRF Analysis—TRPC3-YFP translocation was monitored in HEK cells expressing TRPC3 alone or co-transfected with H1a. Live cell TIRF imaging was performed with a ×60 objective on a Nikon TIRF microscopy system. Images were analyzed with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). H1a Translocates TRPC3 to the Plasma Membrane—Homer 1a (H1a) has an EVH domain but lacks the multimerizing coiled-coil and leucine zipper domains and dissociates complexes formed by dimerizing H1b/c. H1a is thus a useful tool to study the role of Homer proteins in Ca2+ signaling (33Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Cell. 2003; 114: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The role of Homer in agonist-mediated translocation of TRPC3 to the plasma membrane (PM) was evaluated by TIRF in HEK293 cells expressing the muscarinic M3 receptors and transfected with TRPC3-YFP or TRPC3-YFP and H1a. The images in Fig. 1A and the time lapse movies in the supplement show that a significant portion of TRPC3 was found in intracellular vesicles. Stimulation with carbachol resulted in a rapid disappearance of the vesicles as they fused with the PM. The rapid fusion precluded observing accumulation of the vesicles at the PM, but this was confirmed by surface biotinylation assays in Fig. 1B. Removal of carbachol and treatment of the cells with atropine resulted in partial recovery of the vesicles within 40 s of the treatment with atropine. Expression of H1a inhibited translocation of TRPC3-YFP that remained in intracellular vesicles. However, the frequency of finding intracellular vesicles was low, and when found, the vesicles appeared smaller (average size of vesicles in the presence of H1a was 61 ± 4% (n = 32) smaller than in the absence of H1a). These vesicles were not translocated to the PM upon agonist stimulation. The effect of H1a was quantitated by a biotinylation assay to measure the surface expression of TRPC3. Fig. 1B shows that cell stimulation resulted in rapid translocation of TRPC3 to the PM. Expression of H1a increased the level of TRPC3 present at the PM of resting cells to a level caused by cell stimulation. Subsequent stimulation of cells expressing H1a resulted in only a small further increase in PM expression of TRPC3. The dimerizing H1b increased the total cellular level of TRPC3, perhaps by decreasing degradation of the channel, but did not change its surface expression at the resting state or its translocation to the PM by cell stimulation. Similar results were observed with TRPC3-YFP (not shown). The functional consequences of the effects of H1a and H1b on TRPC3 translocation are depicted in Fig. 1, C-E. Fig. 1C shows examples of current traces, Fig. 1D shows the typical TRPC3 I/V in TRPC3-transfected cells, and Fig. 1E is the summary. HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector, H1a alone, or H1b alone did not show a typical TRPC3 current (Fig. 1, C and D). Resting HEK293 cells expressing TRPC3 showed very small spontaneous TRPC3-specific current. Stimulation of the M3R resulted in activation of TRPC3. In the presence of H1a, mostly spontaneous TRPC3 current was detected, consistent with PM localization of the channel and indicating that TRPC3 was fully active in the presence of H1a. H1b only increased the stimulated activity of TRPC3 (Fig. 1C, red trace), as expected from increased expression of the channel and receptor-mediated translocation to the PM. IP3 Dissociates IP3Rs-H1 Interaction—Co-IP experiments showed that expression of H1b/c increases, whereas expression of H1a decreases, the co-IP of TRPC3 and IP3 receptors (not shown), suggesting that H1b/c assembles and H1a dissociates TRPC3-H1b/c-IP3Rs complexes. The question that arises is how disassembly of the complexes occurs under physiological conditions and its role in regulating TRPC3 activity. A clue was provided by a recent crystal structure of the ligand-binding suppressor domain of the IP3R1, which showed that the Homer binding motif of the IP3Rs is adjacent to the IP3 binding core (43Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-Ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We reasoned that binding of IP3 to activate the IP3Rs and evoke Ca2+ release from the stores may also allosterically inhibit binding of H1 to the IP3Rs and dissociate the TRPC3-H1b/c-IP3Rs complexes.

No information is available on the molecular mechanisms recruited by native interleukin-1β produced under this type of condition. Using a sandwich co-culture of primary hippocampal neurons and glia, we investigated whether native interleukin-1β released by HIV-gp120-activated glia (i) affects NMDAR functions and (ii) the relevance on neuronal spine density and survival, two specific traits of HAD. Increased phosphorylation of NR2B Tyr-1472 was observed after 24 h of exposure of neurons to 600 pm gp120. This effect occurred only when neurons were treated in the presence of glial cells and was abolished by the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Gp120-induced phosphorylation of NR2B resulted in a sustained elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in neurons and in a significant increase of NR2B binding to PSD95. Increased intracellular Ca2+ was prevented by 10 μm ifenprodil, that selectively inhibits receptors containing the NR2B, by interleukin-1ra and by Ca-pYEEIE, a Src family SH2 inhibitor peptide. These last two inhibitors, prevented also NR2B binding to PSD95. Finally, gp120 reduced by 35% of the total PSD95 positive spine density after 48 h of treatment and induced by 30% of the neuronal death. Again, both of these effects were blocked by Ca-pYEEIE. Altogether, our data show that gp120 releasing interleukin-1β from glia increases tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation may contribute to the sensitization of the receptor increasing its function and synaptic localization. Both of these effects are relevant for neurodegeneration.

Med. 2004; 4: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and it is therefore relevant in the dynamic modulation of NMDARs. The ability of IL-1β to specifically recruit NR2 tyrosine phosphorylation in neurons (17Viviani B. Bartesaghi S. Gardoni F. Vezzani A. Behrens M.M. Bartfai T. Binaglia M. Corsini E. Di Luca M. Galli C.L. Marinovich M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8692-8700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Salter M.W. Kalia L.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) could provide a plausible biochemical explanation of the effects exerted in vivo by this cytokine and supports IL-1β as a neuromodulator possibly involved in those physiological and pathological aspects relying on NMDAR.IL-1β enhancement of NMDA functions may represent an important part of the complex cascade of events in AIDS dementia complex (HAD). It is well established that overstimulation of NMDAR represents a key event in HAD (21Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 22Haughey N.J. Mattson M.P. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2002; 31: S55-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the most common cause of dementia worldwide among people aged 40 or less (23Ellis R.J. Deutsch R. Heaton R.K. Marcotte T.D.

Behavioral symptoms characteristic of HAD such as cognitive decline, personality change, and motor deficits (24Brew B.J. Rosenblum M. Cronin K. Price R.W. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 25Lipton S.A. Gendelman H.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) appear to be consequent to decreased synaptic density, spine loss, dendritic simplification, and neuronal loss (26Masliah E. Ge N. Mucke L. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Masliah E. Heaton R.K. Marcotte T.D. Ellis R.J. Wiley C.A. Mallory M. Achim C.L. McCutchan J.A. Nelson J.A. Atkinson J.H. Grant I. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) all of which are thought to result from release of toxic factors from activated macrophages and glial cells (21Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 28Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Uhl G.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3256-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). At the moment, no information is available on the possible recruitment of NR2 subunits, Tyr phosphorylation in HAD, and the involvement of glial released IL-1β.To test this hypothesis we exposed primary hippocampal neurons and glial cells to HIV-envelope glycoprotein gp120, considered one of the pathological agents of HAD (29Toggas S.M. Masliah E. Rockenstein E.M. Rall G.F. Abraham C.R. Mucke L. Nature. 1994; 367: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). We then examined NR2B Tyr-1472 phosphorylation in neurons, part of the pathway leading to this process and the relevance on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Finally, we evaluated the functional consequences of two hallmarks of HAD: dendritic spine density and neuronal survival.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSandwich Co-cultures of Hippocampal Neurons and Glial Cells—Primary cultures of glial cells were prepared from 1- to 2-day-old newborn rats (Sprague-Dawley). All animal care procedures were in accordance with the local Animal Care Committee, and no weight loss or death was observed after receipt of rats in our animal facility. Pregnant rats were housed over wood chip bedding, acclimatized to a 12-h light-dark cycle and allowed food and water ad libitum. All efforts were made to minimize the suffering of animals.Cerebral hemispheres were freed from the meninges and mechanically disrupted. Cells were dispersed in a solution of trypsin 2.5% and DNase 1%, filtered through a 100-mm nylon mesh and plated (140,000 cells per 35-mm dish) in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.6% glucose, streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 international units/ml). Glial cultures were fed twice a week and grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Neuronal cultures were established from the hippocampus of 18-day rat fetuses. Briefly, brains were removed and freed from meninges, and the hippocampus was isolated. Cells were then dispersed by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C in a 2.5% trypsin solution followed by trituration. The cell suspension was diluted in Neurobasal media supplemented with 1% B-27 (Invitrogen) and plated onto polyornithine-coated coverslips at a density of 80,000 cells per coverslip. Three days before treatment with gp120, coverslips were transferred to dishes containing a glial monolayer in neuron maintenance medium. Coverslips were inverted so that the hippocampal neurons faced the glia monolayer; both cell preparations were immersed in the same culture medium. Paraffin dots adhering to the coverslips supported them above the glia, creating a narrow gap that prevented the two cell types from contacting each other but allowed the diffusion of soluble substances. These culture conditions allowed us to grow differentiated neuronal cultures with >96% homogeneity, as assessed by immunocytochemistry of microtubule-associated protein 2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Molecular Probes). Hippocampal neurons were used after a culturing period of 14 days.Gp120 and Treatments—Recombinant HIV-gp120 protein type IIIB (Bartels, Carlsbad, CA) was used in all the experiments. Neurons were exposed to drugs in their culture medium (Neurobasal media supplemented with 1% B-27). Treatment with the glycoprotein was mainly performed in the presence of glia. To this purpose, primary hippocampal neurons were transferred on a glial monolayer for 3 days before exposure to gp120. Glass coverslips with primary hippocampal neurons were detached from the glial monolayer at the end of the exposure and assessed for NMDAR Tyr phosphorylation and trafficking, Ca2+ homeostasis, cell fractionation, confocal microscopy, and cell death.1 μg/ml human recombinant IL-1ra (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 10 μm ifenprodil hemitartrate (Tocris, Bristol, UK), 10 μm TAT-2B (Primm, Milano, Italy) were incubated with gp120 and kept in the incubation medium until the end of the treatment. In contrast, 10 μg/ml caffeic acid-pYEEIE (CapYEEIE; Tocris) was delivered only in primary hippocampal neurons, prior to gp120 treatment, by means of the lipid base transfection reagent Chariot (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium) according to supplier instructions. Briefly, caffeic acid-pYEEIE was incubated with Chariot dilution at room temperature for 30 min to allow the formation of the Chariot-molecule complex. Neuronal cells without glia were then overlaid with the Chariot-macromolecule complex solution diluted in Neurobasal and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. At the end, complete growth medium was added, and incubation continued for another hour. Ca-pYEEIE loaded neurons were then washed to remove extracellular Ca-pYEEIE and transferred to the glial monolayer for gp120 exposure. Control neuronal cultures were run in parallel under each experimental condition and incubated for the appropriate times in the presence or absence of glia.IL-1β Assay—IL-1β release was measured by means of an interleukin-1L rat ELISA system (Quantikine, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK).Determination of the Cytosolic-free Ca2+ Concentration [Ca2+]i—At the end of exposure to gp120, neurons on glass coverslips were detached from glial cells and loaded with 10 μm Fura 2-AM (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C in the treatment culture medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% pluronic (Sigma). [Ca2+]i measurement was performed in neurons only in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, as previously described (9Viviani B. Corsini E. Binaglia M. Galli C.L. Marinovich M. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Fura 2 fluorescence ratio signal was measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50 B double wavelength fluorometer and calibrated in terms of [Ca2+]i as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (30Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Labeling, Image Acquisition, and Quantification—Hippocampal neurons were fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied in GDB buffer (30 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.8 m NaCl). Fluorescence images were acquired using Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope. Confocal images were obtained using a Nikon 60× objective with sequential acquisition setting at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. Each image consisted of a z-stack of pictures taken at a depth interval of 0.1 μm and then projected into one image. Both image acquisition and quantification of the fluorescence signal were performed by operators blind to the experimental condition. PSD-95 staining puncta were defined by thresholding images at three times the background measured within the dendritic shaft. The ratio of average immunofluorescence intensity between the spine head and the dendritic shaft next to it was measured on manually selected spine head and dendritic shaft areas. Neurons selected for analysis had a similar local environment; synapses on soma were not analyzed. For statistical analysis of spine number, a dendritic shaft of 100 μm starting from the cell soma from 12 neurons for each experimental condition was analyzed. Colocalization analysis was performed using Bio-Rad Laserpix software.Subcellular Fractionation—Triton-insoluble fractions (TIF) were isolated from neurons harvested at 14 DIV as previously described (31Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PSDs from rat hippocampus were purified as previously described (32Gardoni F. Caputi A. Cimino M. Pastorino L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Hippocampal neurons were harvested in ice-cold solubilization buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, in the presence of a complete set of proteases inhibitors (Complete™). Each solubilized sample was incubated overnight with NR2B polyclonal antibody and then for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose beads. Following this incubation, the supernatants were removed, and the beads were washed five times with solubilization buffer. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and briefly centrifuged; the supernatants were loaded on 7% SDS-PAGE gels. Western blot analysis was performed by computer-assisted imaging (Quantity-OneR System; Bio-Rad).Antibodies—Polyclonal IL-1R antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; α-CaMKII monoclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc., (Temecula, CA); monoclonal PSD-95 antibody was purchased from Affinity BioReagents Inc. (Golden, CO); monoclonal PY20 antibody and polyclonal pTyr-1472-NR2B antibody were purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK), polyclonal anti-β-tubulin was purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA); monoclonal anti-NR2A was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; monoclonal anti-synaptophysin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; polyclonal anti-NR2A, polyclonal anti-NR2B, and AlexaFluor 488, 555, and 568 secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon).Viability Assay—Neuronal cell death was monitored over 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. In a set of experiments neurons were loaded with caffeic acid-pYEEIE or IL-1ra, and exposed to 600 pm gp120 for 72 h. Cell viability was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (33Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4258) Google Scholar). MTT tetrazolium salt was dissolved in serum-free medium to a final concentration of 0.75 mg/ml and added to the cells before the end of the experiment for 3 h at 37 °C. The medium was then removed and the formazan was extracted with 1n HCl:isopropyl alcohol (1:24). Absorbance at 560 nm was read on a Multiscan reader.Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a multiple comparison test (Tukey's test). A significance level of 95% (p < 0.05) was accepted.RESULTSgp120 Effect on Tyr-1472 Phosphorylation of NR2B Subunits: Relevance of Glial Cells and Role of IL-1β—In the last few years, several potential Src phosphosites have been described within the NR2B C-terminal tail (34Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 35Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B. Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Not only Tyr-1472 but also Tyr-1252 and Tyr-1336 have been demonstrated as Src family phosphorylation sites at least in transfected cells. To check for endogenous NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation in cultured hippocampal neurons co-cultured with glia, Western blotting analysis was performed from DIV14 neuronal lysates.No signal for both NR2B Tyr-1336 and NR2B Tyr-1252 was found at the expected 170-kDa molecular mass (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, a nice immunosignal for both total NR2B and NR2B Tyr-1472 was present in the same samples. These data suggest that Tyr-1252 and Tyr-1336 could represent Src family phosphosites only in vitro in transfected cells, but not under our experimental conditions in neurons.Hippocampal neurons co-cultured with glia were treated with 600 pm gp120 for 6 and 24 h, and NR2B subunit Tyr phosphorylation was evaluated. Neurons were then separated by glia and lysed, and phosphorylation at NR2B Tyr-1472 was assessed with a specific antibody. A significant increase of NR2B Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was evident 24 h after gp120 treatment (Fig. 1B, **, p < 0.01 gp120 versus control), whereas6hof treatment was ineffective (Fig. 1B). This effect was specifically limited to phosphorylation processes because NR2B protein level was not affected at the above time points (Fig. 1B). No phosphorylation of NR2B Tyr-1336 and NR2B Tyr-1252 was observed after 24 h of gp120 treatment (Fig. 1C), suggesting that these two phosphosites were not involved in the effects induced by gp120 treatment.The effect of gp120 on NR2B Tyr-1472 phosphorylation in neurons required the presence of glia, because it was undetectable when primary hippocampal neurons were exposed alone to 600 pm gp120 for 24 h (p1472 immunostaining % of control: controls 100 ± 31.6, gp120: 88 ± 33.0 n = 3).Exposure of primary glial cells to 600 pm gp120 induces a significant release of IL-1β within 24 h (IL1β, pg/ml: controls: 62.4 ± 3.19, gp120: 139 ± 18 (n = 6); *, p < 0.05 gp versus control). The glial necessity for gp120 to trigger Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit together with the promotion of IL-1β release suggest the possible involvement of this cytokine in the observed effect. Hippocampal neurons co-cultured with glia were then incubated with 600 pm gp120 in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). IL-1ra per se did not affect basal p1472 immunostaining but prevented gp120-induced increase of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D; **, p < 0.01 versus control, §, p < 0.05 versus gp120), supporting our hypothesis.Characterization of IL-1R, NR2B, and PSD-95 Colocalization—The ability of IL-1ra to prevent Tyr-1472 phosphorylation induced by gp120, suggests the recruitment of IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) in the observed effect. We first examined the relative abundance of IL-1R in rat hippocampal subcellular compartments by a biochemical fractionation method, as described previously (32Gardoni F. Caputi A. Cimino M. Pastorino L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). PSD was purified from rat hippocampus, and the expression of IL-1R, NR2B, as well as, pre- and postsynaptic marker proteins in several subcellular compartments was investigated by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, IL-1R was present with a similar distribution in the total homogenate (H) and in the crude membrane fraction (P2), at a low level in the synaptosomal membrane (Syn) and in the low speed supernatant (S1) fractions. IL-1R was enriched in the PSD fraction and in the Triton-insoluble PSD-enriched fraction (TIF). In the same samples, we examined the subcellular distribution of NR2B, αCaMKII, synaptophysin (a presynaptic marker), and PSD-95 (a postsynaptic marker). As expected, synaptophysin was present in all subcellular compartments analyzed, but not in the PSD or in the TIF-purified fractions, whereas PSD-95 and αCaMKII showed a similar distribution pattern with enrichment in synaptosomes and PSD fractions (Fig. 2A). The partition pattern of NR2B subunit closely resembled IL-1R being similarly distributed in the different subcellular fractions. A modified fractionation method was then used to analyze the presence of endogenous IL-1R at synaptic sites also in primary hippocampal cultures; in particular, a Triton-insoluble postsynaptic fraction (TIF) was prepared and the presence of IL-1R, NR2B, and PSD-95 evaluated by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, IL-1R has a similar enrichment in the TIF fraction compared with both NR2B and PSD-95, confirming the results obtained in rat hippocampal tissue (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Characterization of IL-1R, NR2B, and PSD-95 colocalization in neurons. A, isolated biochemical fractions from hippocampal tissues were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the blots were probed with antibodies against NR2B, PSD-95, IL-1R, synaptophysin, and αCaMKII. H, homogenate; S1, low speed supernatant; P1, nuclei-associated membranes; S2, cytosol; P2, crude membrane fraction; Syn, synaptosomes. B, representative Western blot analysis of NR2B, PSD-95 and IL-1R from homogenate (Homo, left lane) and TIF (right lane) obtained from DIV14 hippocampal cultures. The same amount of protein was loaded in each lane. C, DIV14 hippocampal neurons were immunolabeled for IL-1R (left panels) or PSD-95 (middle panels). Merge data are shown on the right. Areas of overlap in merge panels appear yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined by confocal labeling the distribution pattern of IL-1R in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2C); PSD-95 was used as a marker of postsynaptic structures. IL-1R displayed a very low labeling in the somatic cytoplasm; immunoreactivity was present in dendrites where a punctate staining was present. A nice colocalization pattern with PSD-95 was observed (arrowheads, Fig. 2C), confirming the presence of endogenous IL-1R at the postsynaptic side of cultured neurons.Effect of gp120-induced Phosphorylation of NR2B Subunits at Tyr-1472 on Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) Homeostasis—Tyr phosphorylation is a well recognized pathway adopted from neurons to upregulate NMDA receptor function (for review see Ref. 18Salter M.W. Kalia L.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and has been involved in pathological conditions such as ischemic neuronal death (36Takagi N. Shinno K. Teves L. Bissoon N. Wallace M.C. Gurd J.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1060-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Cheung H.H. Takagi N. Teves L. Logan R. Wallace M.C. Gurd J.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Neuronal injury consequent to gp120 is also predominantly mediated by overactivation of NMDAR-coupled ion channels that allows excessive Ca2+ influx and a general imbalance of its homeostasis (21Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 22Haughey N.J. Mattson M.P. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2002; 31: S55-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We thus evaluated whether gp120-induced NR2B Tyr phosphorylation, through the release of IL-1β, could be implicated in the altered [Ca2+]i homeostasis in neurons. Primary hippocampal neurons were treated with 600 pm gp120 in the presence or absence of glia, separated at the end of treatment and monitored for [Ca2+]i. The exposure of primary hippocampal neurons to 600 pm gp120 in the presence of glia significantly increased neuronal [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3A) after 24 h. This effect was caused predominantly by Ca2+ influx through the NR2BNMDA receptor channels because the addition of 10 μm ifenprodil, a channel blocker that binds only to the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors, inhibited the rise of gp120-induced neuronal [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Involvement of NR2B subunit Tyr phosphorylation, and IL-1β in gp120-induced [Ca2+]i increase in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.

Human TRBP was originally characterized and cloned 15 years ago based on its high affinity for binding the HIV-1 encoded leader RNA, TAR. RNAi is used, in part, by cells to defend against infection by viruses. Here, we report that transfected TAR RNA can attenuate the RNAi machinery in human cells. Our data suggest that TAR RNA sequesters TRBP rendering it unavailable for downstream Dicer-RISC complexes. TAR-induced inhibition of Dicer-RISC activity in transfected cells was partially relieved by exogenous expression of TRBP.

Classically, cells react to infection by RNA viruses by triggering an interferon response (1Le Page C. Genin P. Baines M.G. Hiscott J. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 374-386PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, evidence suggests that a newly characterized activity, RNAi, 2The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRBP, TAR RNA-binding protein; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; Ago2, argonaute 2; miRNA, microRNA; IFN, interferon; PKR, protein kinase R; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RT, reverse transcription; LTR, long terminal repeat; wt, wild type; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; CMV, cytomegalovirus.2The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRBP, TAR RNA-binding protein; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; Ago2, argonaute 2; miRNA, microRNA; IFN, interferon; PKR, protein kinase R; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RT, reverse transcription; LTR, long terminal repeat; wt, wild type; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; CMV, cytomegalovirus. provides an additional cellular defense against invading viral nucleic acids (2Voinnet O. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Relevant to the mechanism of RNAi, long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) originating from viruses are first recognized inside cells by an RNase III enzyme, Dicer, which cleaves the RNA into smaller 21- to 23-nucleotide duplexes, commonly termed small interfering RNAs (siRNA). For this activity, Dicer is assisted by a protein-protein complex formed with a cellular RNA-binding protein called TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) (3Haase A.D. Jaskiewicz L. Zhang H. Laine S. Sack R. Gatignol A. Filipowicz W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 4Forstemann K. Tomari Y. Du T. Vagin V.V. Denli A.M. Bratu D.P. Klattenhoff C. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. PloS Biol. 2005; 3: e236Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Dicer-TRBP is thought to shuttle the siRNA into a multiprotein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to interact further with a protein called argonaute 2 (Ago2) (5Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 436: 740-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). One strand of the siRNA duplex is then loaded onto Ago2 to serve as a guide RNA. Using this guide RNA, RISC becomes armed with the capacity to recognize target RNAs via base complementarity for purposes of enforcing sequence-specific degradation. The RNAi machinery also processes structured dsRNA hairpins into microRNAs (miRNAs), another class of small RNAs that modulate gene expression (6Yeung M.L. Bennasser Y. Le S.Y. Jeang K.T. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). miRNAs are derived from transcription of large highly structured precursors (pri-miRNA) of ∼70 nucleotides encoded by cellular genes. A primiRNA is processed in the nucleus of the cell into an imperfect shorter stem-loop structure (pre-miRNA) by Microprocessor, a large complex that includes Drosha and the RNA-binding protein DGCR8. Pre-miRNA is subsequently exported by Exportin 5 into the cytoplasm where it is additionally processed to maturity by Dicer. Similar to siRNA, one strand of the mature miRNA is then ferried by TRBP-Dicer to RISC to serve as a guide template. However, miRNA-armed RISC silences complementary mRNAs not by degradation but by virtue of being shunted into a ribosome-free cytoplasmic compartment called P-body (for “processing body”) (7Liu J. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Hannon G.J. Parker R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 8Sen G.L. Blau H.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Hence, miRNAs primarily trigger translational repression, while siRNAs induce mRNA degradation (6Yeung M.L. Bennasser Y. Le S.Y. Jeang K.T. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). While the complete protein composition of RISC still remains to be fully elucidated (9Meister G.

Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 436: 740-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). The importance of TRBP to Dicer-RISC activities was revealed by findings that intracellular depletion of TRBP led to a loss in the RNA silencing function of the cell (5Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 436: 740-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). As yet, the exact details of how loss of TRBP leads to suppression of RNAi remain incompletely understood and somewhat contested (13Gatignol A. Laine S. Clerzius G. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Rossi J.J. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, consistent with TRBP's the currently inferred physiological role of TRBP in the defense against foreign nucleic acids of the cell, this protein was first cloned and identified by us based on its avid binding to a small HIV-1 hairpin RNA, TAR (15Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). TAR is the trans-activation-responsive RNA sequence (15Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), which is located in the R region of the HIV-1 LTR and is present twice (once at the 5′ end and another time at the 3′ end) in all HIV-1 transcripts. TAR forms a stem-bulge-loop RNA structure (16Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which is required for recognition by the HIV-1 Tat protein and cellular factor P-TEFb in order for viral transcription to occur efficiently (17Rana T.M. Jeang K.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Brady J. Kashanchi F. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 69Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In principle, the interferon (IFN)-protein kinase R (PKR) network and RNAi constitute two formidable defenses in mammalian cells against viral nucleic acids. Curiously, in practice, most viruses replicate well, once they have gained entry into mammalian cells. This empiricism suggests that viruses may likely have evolved ways to solve the restrictions imposed by RNAi and IFN-PKR. Indeed, the literature contains many examples of viral means employed to neutralize IFN-PKR. These include vaccinia virus E3L protein binding to dsRNAs making them unavailable for PKR activation (19Davies M.V. Chang H.W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HCV envelope protein 2 (E2), and nonstructural 5A (NS5A)-mediated direct suppression of the kinase activity of PKR (20He Y. Katze M.G.

Perhaps not unexpected, there is now increasing evidence that plant and animal viruses can also manipulate the RNAi defense of the cell (2Voinnet O. Nat. Rev.

Lecellier C.H. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Toward the latter goal, viruses can mutate both their primary nucleic acid sequences and secondary RNA structures to evade complementarity-based targeting (24Westerhout E.M. Ooms M. Vink M. Das A.T. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar); and many viruses also encode suppressor factors (25Kasschau K.D. Carrington J.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 461-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 26Voinnet O. Pinto Y.M. Baulcombe D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 2004; 78: 12868-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) that interfere with discrete steps in the RNA silencing machinery of the cell. Based on the recent finding that TRBP plays an essential role in the Dicer-RISC activities of the cell(12Gregory R.I. Chendrimada T.P. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), and because TAR is the highly abundant HIV-1-encoded RNA originally characterized as a tight TRBP-substrate (15Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), we wondered if TAR RNA could be a means used by HIV-1 to defeat the RNAi defense of the cell. Here, we show that intracellular TAR RNA can decoy TRBP from Dicer-RISC and reduce RNA silencing in human cells. Plasmids and Reporters—Plasmids were pGL2-luciferase (Invitrogen), pEGFP-C1, pCMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech), and TAR (15Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). pcDNA-Dicer-myc vector was from Dr. Patrick Provost (31Provost P. Dishart D. Doucet J. Frendewey D. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5864-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity and GFP fluorimetry were measured 48 h after transfection (29Bennasser Y. Le S.Y. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Immunity. 2005; 22: 607-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In vitro Dicer Assay—293T cells were transfected with pcDNA-Dicer-myc with or without RNA using Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h later, cells were lysed (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with anti-myc beads (Sigma) (31Provost P. Dishart D. Doucet J. Frendewey D. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5864-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). 1 μg of 700-bp [32P]UTP dsRNA was incubated for 4 h with immunoprecipitated Dicer-myc. The RNA products were purified and analyzed on a 15% native polyacrylamide gel. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Small RNAs (<200 bp) were isolated using mirVana miRNA kit (Ambion). miRNA quantitation was as described previously (32Shi R. Chiang V.L. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 33Yeung M.L. Bennasser Y. Myers T. Jiang G. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). RNA was polyadenylated with ATP by poly(A) polymerase at 37 °C for 1 h using the RNA tailing kit (Ambion) and reverse transcribed using 0.5 μg of poly(T) adapter primer (Invitrogen). For each PCR, equal amounts of cDNA (first normalized using the snU6 RNA) were mixed with SYBR Green PCR mix (Applied Biosystems) and 5 pmol of forward primer (designed on the entire tested miRNA sequence) and reverse primer (based on the adapter sequence). Amplification was for 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C for 55 cycles in an Opticon real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) (32Shi R. Chiang V.L. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). TAR Inhibits Processing of RNA Hairpins in Cells—TRBP binds TAR RNA with high affinity (15Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a surfeit of TAR RNA may act to sequester TRBP, shunting the latter away from Dicer-siRNA-RISC complexes. Others have found that intracellular depletion of TRBP diminishes RISC-mediated gene silencing (12Gregory R.I. Chendrimada T.P. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar); and our reasoning predicts that TAR overexpression could similarly suppress Dicer-RISC-function. To test the above, we assessed the effect of increased TAR RNA on TRBP-dependent activity. To model the situation seen in an HIV-infected cell, we transcribed in vitro wild type TAR RNA (wtTAR) and a control mutant (mutTAR) RNA with a disrupted duplexed-hairpin (Fig. 1A). The transcribed RNAs were purified and transfected into cells. To verify that transfected RNAs functioned inside the cell, we first assayed them for the well described ability of TAR to decoy Tat from its transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 1B). Using a HeLa cell line stably integrated with an HIV-LTR-luciferase reporter, which was transiently transfected with a Tat-plasmid, the level of luciferase was measured. We found that Tat transactivation of the LTR reporter was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (up to 60%) by the provision of transfected TAR RNA in trans. As control, mutTAR RNA, which was engineered to be incapable of forming a stable stem-bulge-loop hairpin, did not reduce the transactivation of the LTR-luciferase reporter of Tat. These results support that transfected TAR RNA is intact and functionally active inside cells. We also checked that the amounts of TAR RNA that we transfected into cells are approximate to the level of viral RNAs expressed from an integrated HIV-1 provirus. In Fig. 1C, we demonstrated by Northern blotting that the intracellular level of transfected TAR RNA is in the same range of expression as HIV-1 RNAs transcribed from an intact latent proviral genome in the ACH2 cell line (34Folks T.M. Clouse K.A. Justement J. Rabson A. Duh E. Kehrl J.H. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2365-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) after induction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. We next asked how transfected TAR RNA might impact Dicer activity. For this aim, 293 cells were transfected with a myc-tagged Dicer construct with or without wtTAR RNA. 48 h later, using anti-myc beads, we immunoprecipitated myc-Dicer, and Dicer activity was tested in vitro using a 32P-labeled long GFP dsRNA as substrate (Fig. 2). We observed that myc-Dicer immunoprecipitated from control myc-Dicer-transfected cells efficiently processed long GFP-dsRNA (700 bp) to short (22 nucleotides) GFP-siRNA. However, parallel cells, which were co-transfected with myc-Dicer plus wtTAR RNA, yielded immunoprecipitated myc-Dicer that exhibited a wtTAR-dependent attenuation in dsRNA processing activity (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5). That the reduction in Dicer activity is due to a TAR-TRBP effect rather than a direct TAR-Dicer effect was supported by findings from co-transfection of a TRBP expression vector into wtTAR+myc-Dicer cells. Supplying TRBP in this way partially restored the RNA processing activity to myc-Dicer (Fig. 2A, lane 6), which was originally suppressed by wtTAR. We performed two control experiments, which demonstrated that transfection into cells of either mutant TAR RNA or TRBP alone showed any effect on the processing activity of immunoprecipitated myc-Dicer (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–10). Consistent with a published report (35Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar), none of our manipulations destabilized Dicer since the amounts of immunoprecipitated Dicer appeared to be uniform in all samples (see Fig. 2A, bottom Western blottings, Dicer). While other interpretations are possible, these results are consistent with wtTAR RNA decoying or occluding TRBP from Dicer leading to reduced dsRNA-processing activity of immunoprecipitated myc-Dicer. That TAR RNA might sequester TRBP to make it less accessible to Dicer was checked by monitoring the amount of TRBP bound to Dicer when TAR was transfected into cells. Indeed, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in the amounts of TRBP that co-immunoprecipitated with Dicer from cells transfected with TAR RNA (Fig. 2B, see lanes 1–5). TAR Interferes with Intracellular Luc- and GFP-shRNA Activity—We next asked if the ability to reduce in vitro Dicer activity correlated with a capacity to lower intracellular RNA silencing function. To address this point, two previously characterized reporter systems were used to evaluate the effect of TAR RNA on RNAi function. We employed the pGL2 luciferase (Luc-shRNA (short hairpin RNA)) (Fig. 3A) and the CMV GFP (GFP-shRNA) (Fig. 3C) assays (29Bennasser Y. Le S.Y. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Immunity. 2005; 22: 607-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). When co-expressed, Luc-shRNA inhibited luciferase (luc) mRNA expressed from the pGL2 plasmid by 83%. Intriguingly, when wtTAR was titrated into cells, the ability of Luc-shRNA to silence Luc-mRNA was blunted. Hence, when we introduced 500 ng of wtTAR into cells, the silencing effect of Luc-shRNA dropped from 83 to 44% (Fig. 3A, middle bars). This reduction is specific to wtTAR since the sequence altered TAR mutant did not perturb the silencing activity of Luc-shRNA (Fig. 3A, +mutant TAR lanes). The effect of TAR on the silencing function of Luc-shRNA might be explained by the sequestration of the former of the limiting amount of TRBP of the cell. If such were to occur, we reasoned that TRBP-dependent Dicer-RISC function should be affected. To verify this reasoning, we transfected increasing amounts of TRBP-plasmid into wtTAR+ Luc-shRNA cells. Interestingly, whereas wtTAR suppressed the action of Luc-shRNA, we found that the ability of Luc-shRNA to silence Luc-mRNA became progressively restored with increasing doses of transfected TRBP (Fig. 3B). Since TRBP has no effect on the transcription from the SV40 promoter in pGL2 (data not shown), these results support the interpretation that exogenous TRBP complemented the function lost due to endogenous TRBP being sequestered by TAR. We next checked the pGL2 luciferase (Luc-shRNA) findings using the CMV EGFP (EGFP-shRNA) pairing. We found that EGFP-shRNA effectively inhibited EGFP fluorescence up to 79% as observed by microscopy and quantified by fluorimetry (Fig. 3C). Here, wtTAR RNA (Fig. 3C, panels 3 and 4), but not mutant TAR RNA (Fig. 3C, panel 7), when co-expressed led to a 3-fold reduction in the silencing activity of EGFP-shRNA. Co-transfection of exogenous TRBP countermanded the RNAi suppressive activity of wtTAR RNA (compare Fig. 3C, panel 3 versus panel 5, and panel 4 versus panel 6), but transfected TRBP in the context of mutTAR RNA did not affect the activity of EGFP-shRNA (Fig. 3C, panel 8). As additional controls, neither TAR alone nor TRBP alone significantly affected EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 3C, panels 9 and 10). Collectively, the luciferase and EGFP findings are consistent with TAR RNA targeting TRBP to interfere with the RNAi of the cell. TAR Affects Cellular miRNA Expression—HIV-1 encodes a viral RNA-binding protein, Tat, which partially suppresses the Dicer function of the cell (29Bennasser Y. Le S.Y. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Immunity. 2005; 22: 607-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The above reporter assays (Figs. 1 and 3) suggest that HIV-1 may additionally use a viral RNA, TAR, to target TRBP. Because reporter assays may occasionally yield unrepresentative findings, we wished to employ a more physiological readout to assess the consequence of TAR-TRBP interaction. In this regard, in addition to processing artificially constructed shRNA, TRBP-Dicer is involved in authentic processing of the miRNAs of the cell. Hence, we asked whether TAR has an effect on TRBP-Dicer function when assessed in the context of the miRNA maturation of the cell. Earlier, we reported that transfection of an infectious HIV molecular clone into cells reduced the abundance of many mature human miRNAs (33Yeung M.L. Bennasser Y. Myers T. Jiang G. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Retrospectively, such findings could be explained by TAR RNA expressed from transfected HIV-1 molecular clone modulating the TRBP function of the cell, which is required for miRNA maturation. Previously (33Yeung M.L. Bennasser Y. Myers T. Jiang G. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the three human miRNAs most notably suppressed by HIV-1 were miR-16, miR-93, and miR-221 (21Park H. Davies M.V. Langland J.O. Chang H.W. Nam Y.S. Tartaglia J. Paoletti E. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. Venkatesan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4713-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To ask if TAR RNA alone can explain all or part of the effect on miRNA processing of HIV-1, we used these three miRNAs as readouts in cells transfected singly with wtTAR or mTAR RNA. Mature miR-16, miR-93, and miR-221 were measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (32Shi R. Chiang V.L. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) with internal normalization to an invariant U6 snRNA control (Fig. 4). Provocatively, while the level of the U6 snRNA was unchanged, miR-16, miR-93, and miR-221 were all down-regulated in the presence of wtTAR, but not mutant TAR, by 5.5-, 3.6-, and 38.5-fold, respectively. Viewed collectively with its effect on shRNA maturation, the effect of TAR RNA on miRNA processing suggests that it acts at a step shared by both pathways (i.e. TRBP-Dicer). For survival, viruses apparently have evolved varied and complex stratagems to neutralize the RNAi-antiviral defense of the cell (26Voinnet O. Pinto Y.M. Baulcombe D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14147-14152Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 29Bennasser Y. Le S.Y. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Immunity. 2005; 22: 607-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Previously, it was described that viruses can escape base pair complementarity-mediated attack through mutations in viral genomes, which alter primary sequences and secondary structures (24Westerhout E.M. Ooms M. Vink M. Das A.T. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 36Das A.T. Brummelkamp T.R. Westerhout E.M. Vink M. Madiredjo M. Bernards R. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 37Bennasser Y. Yeung M.L. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Curr. Opin. HIV AIDS. 2006; 1: 208-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, viruses can also encode proteins that interfere negatively with various steps of the si/miRNA processing machinery of the cell (2Voinnet O. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Here we provide the first evidence that HIV-1 could use an abundantly expressed RNA to attenuate antiviral RNAi by targeting TRBP, a key component of Dicer-RISC complexes. It makes sense that HIV-1 might use TAR, since this RNA sequence is found in all viral transcripts, twice. However, we should point out that our current study employed tranfected TAR RNA, and the true biological role of virally transcribed TAR in the miRNA pathway in HIV-1 infected cells requires further study. We anticipate that with further investigation many other viruses may also be found to use decoy RNAs to quell the RNAi defenses of the cell. Indeed, the adenovirus RNA polymerase III transcribed VA RNA has been proposed to quench Dicer function through binding (30Lu S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12868-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), (38Andersson M.G. Haasnoot P.C. Xu N. Berenjian S. Berkhout B. Akusjarvi G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9556-9565Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Unlike TAR, VA acts not via TRBP but by direct contact to Dicer (30Lu S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12868-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We note with interest that PACT, a human dsRNA-binding protein related to TRBP, has been identified recently to provide a si/miRNA processing function partially redundant to TRBP (39Lee Y. Hur I. Park S.Y. Kim Y.K. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Because PACT and TRBP conserve RNA-binding domains, in principle, excess TAR RNA can also sequester PACT and inhibit PACT activity. Because a part of PACT activity is divergent from TRBP activity in si/miRNA processing, this fact may explain why exogenous complementation of TRBP only partially restored wtTAR RNA-mediated suppression of Luc- and GFP-shRNA interference activity (Fig. 3). Our current understanding of Tat, TAR, VA, TRBP, PACT, and Dicer leaves unresolved many details about how small viral dsRNAs, viral dsRNA-binding proteins (40Lichner Z. Silhavy D. Burgyan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and cellular dsRNA-binding proteins interact either cooperatively (41Jopling C.L. Yi M. Lancaster A.M. Lemon S.M. Sarnow P. Science. 2005; 309: 1577-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar) or antagonistically (6Yeung M.L. Bennasser Y. Le S.Y. Jeang K.T.

Merr.) and certain other legumes excrete isoflavones from their roots, which participate in plantmicrobe interactions such as symbiosis and as a defense against infections by pathogens. In G. max, the release of free isoflavones from their conjugates, the latent forms, is mediated by an isoflavone conjugate-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase. Here we report on the purification and cDNA cloning of this important β-glucosidase from the roots of G. max seedlings as well as related phylogenetic and cellular localization studies. The purified enzyme, isoflavone conjugate-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase from roots of G. max seedling (GmICHG), is a homodimeric glycoprotein with a subunit molecular mass of 58 kDa and is capable of directly hydrolyzing genistein 7-O-(6 ″-O-malonyl-β-d-glucoside) to produce free genistein (kcat, 98 s-1; Km, 25 μm at 30 °C, pH 7.0). GmICHG cDNA was isolated based on the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. GmICHG cDNA was abundantly expressed in the roots of G. max seedlings but only negligibly in the hypocotyl and cotyledon. An immunocytochemical analysis using anti-GmICHG antibodies, along with green fluorescent protein imaging analyses of Arabidopsis cultured cells transformed by the GmICHG:GFP fusion gene, revealed that the enzyme is exclusively localized in the cell wall and intercellular space of seedling roots, particularly in the cell wall of root hairs. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that GmICHG is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 1 and can be co-clustered with many other leguminous β-glucosidases, the majority of which may also be involved in flavonoid-mediated interactions of legumes with microbes.

GmICHG cDNA was isolated based on the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. GmICHG cDNA was abundantly expressed in the roots of G. max seedlings but only negligibly in the hypocotyl and cotyledon. An immunocytochemical analysis using anti-GmICHG antibodies, along with green fluorescent protein imaging analyses of Arabidopsis cultured cells transformed by the GmICHG:GFP fusion gene, revealed that the enzyme is exclusively localized in the cell wall and intercellular space of seedling roots, particularly in the cell wall of root hairs. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that GmICHG is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 1 and can be co-clustered with many other leguminous β-glucosidases, the majority of which may also be involved in flavonoid-mediated interactions of legumes with microbes. The roots of legumes excrete large amounts of flavonoids, which play very important roles in the interactions of these plants with microorganisms (1Buchanan B. Gruissen W. Jones R. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002: 796-815Google Scholar). The major flavonoids secreted from soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) roots, for example, are isoflavones (2Graham T.L. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), a class of flavonoids with a 3-phenylchromone structure. The isoflavones genistein and daidzein (see Fig. 1) in root exudates serve as chemoattractants (3Phillips D. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1992; 26: 201-231Google Scholar) for specific symbionts, Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Sinorhizobium fredii, as well as genetic inducers of nodulation (4Hungria M. Stacey G. Soil Biol. Biochem. 1997; 29: 819-830Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, these flavonoids have been proposed to play important roles in defensive mechanisms against infections by pathogens (5Barz W. Welle R. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. 26. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 139-164Google Scholar, 6Rivera-Vargas L. Schmitthenner A. Graham T.

APS Press, St. Paul, MN2000: 181-220Google Scholar). Isoflavones are synthesized from flavanones (liquiritigenin or naringenin) by aryl migration, which is catalyzed by 2-hydroxy-flavanone synthase (10Akashi T. Aoki T. Ayabe S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Steele C.L. Gijzen M. Qutob D. Dixon R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In G. max cells, the resulting free isoflavones are then 7-O-glucosylated and 6″-O-malonylated by the combined actions of UDP-glucose:isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase (IF7GT) 2The abbreviations used are: IF7GT, UDP-glucose:isoflavone 7-O-glucosyl-transferase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; Gen7G, genistein 7-O-β-d-glucoside; Gen7MG, genistein 7-O- (6″-O-malonyl-β-d-glucoside); GmICHG, ICHG from roots of G. max seedling; GH, glycoside hydrolase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ICHG, isoflavone conjugate-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase; IF7MaT, malonyl-CoA:isoflavone 7-O-glucoside 6″-O-malonyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. and malonyl-CoA:isoflavone 7-O-glucoside 6″-O-malonyltransferase (IF7MaT), respectively (5Barz W. Welle R. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. 26. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 139-164Google Scholar). These conjugates (i.e. 7-O-β-d-glucosides and 7-O-(6″-O-malonyl-β-d-glucosides) of isoflavones) are more water-soluble than the aglycons and accumulate in large amounts in vacuoles (5Barz W. Welle R. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. 26. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 139-164Google Scholar). These isoflavone conjugates are considered to be latent forms of isoflavonoids and must ultimately be converted to aglycons for interactions with symbiotic or pathogenic microorganisms (5Barz W. Welle R. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. 26. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 139-164Google Scholar, 7Dakora F. Phillips D. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1996; 49: 1-20Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12Hsieh M.C. Graham T.L. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzyme(s) involved in this conversion must be spatially separated from those of IF7GT and IF7MaT and the vacuolar conjugate pools (5Barz W. Welle R. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. 26. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 139-164Google Scholar). The release of aglycons in the chickpea (Cicer arietinum) has been proposed to involve a two-step hydrolysis of the isoflavone conjugates, where the isoflavone 7-O-(6″-O-malonyl-β-d-glucosides) undergoes ester hydrolysis by a malonylesterase followed by hydrolysis of the β-glucosidic linkage by a β-glucosidase (5Barz W. Welle R. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. 26. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 139-164Google Scholar). In G. max, however, the release of isoflavone aglycons from their conjugates appears to be mediated by a single enzyme, an isoflavone conjugate-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase (GmICHG) (12Hsieh M.C. Graham T.L. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), which appears to play a critical role in the turnover of conjugates for plant-microbe interactions. However, the cDNA encoding this important β-glucosidase has not been identified to date, and hence, the primary structure and phylogenetics of the enzyme remain unclear. In addition, the cellular localization of the enzyme remains to be conclusively established. In this study, GmICHG was purified 4200-fold from roots of G. max seedlings, and its molecular properties were established. This achievement permitted the identification of the GmICHG cDNA and phylogenetic as well as cellular localization studies of the enzyme. The results obtained in these studies provide important information concerning the biochemical mechanism that controls the release of free isoflavones in the G. max root exudates regarding interactions of the G. max plant with microorganisms. Soybean seeds (G. max (L.) Merr. cv. Wase-Hakucho; Takii, Kyoto, Japan) were pretreated with running tap water for 10 min and then germinated at 20-23 °C in the dark on an agar medium consisting of 10 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.5% (w/v) agar. Roots of 5-7-day-old seedlings were washed with tap water to remove the medium and then frozen at -80 °C until used. Genistein, Gen7G, Gen7MG, daidzein, daidzein 7-O-β-d-glucoside, and daidzein 7-O-(6″-O-malonyl-β-d-glucoside) were products of Fujicco (Kobe, Japan). Other flavonoids, including anthocyanins, were obtained as described previously (13Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Fukui Y. Nakamura N. Yamaguchi M.-A. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Nishino T. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2142-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. GmICHG activity was routinely assayed using Gen7MG as a substrate. The standard reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μl) consisted of 50 μm Gen7MG, 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, and enzyme (final concentrations). The mixture without enzyme was preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of ice-cold 1.0% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The isoflavonoids in the reaction mixture were routinely analyzed by reversed phase HPLC on a J'sphere ODS-M80 column (4.6 × 150 mm; YMC, Kyoto, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. After injection (100 μl) onto the column, which had been equilibrated with 14% (v/v) CH3CN containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, the column was isocratically developed for 3 min, followed by a linear gradient of 14-90% (v/v) CH3CN in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 15 min, and then isocratically developed for 1 min, followed by a linear gradient of 90 to 14% (v/v) CH3CN in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 1 min. The isoflavonoids were detected by UV absorption at 260 nm using an SPD-10A VP UV-visible detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Kinetic parameters and standard errors were determined by fitting the initial velocity data to the MichaelisMenten equation by means of a nonlinear regression analysis (14Leatherbarrow R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All operations were performed at 4 °C. Step 1, Preparation of Crude Extract—Soybean roots (200 g, fresh weight; see above) were suspended in 800 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, containing 30 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and were disrupted for 30 s in a Waring blender, followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was used for further purification. Step 2, Ammonium Sulfate Fractionation—The protein fraction that precipitated between 0 and 60% saturation of ammonium sulfate was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in 100 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, containing 30 mm 2-mercaptoethanmol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Polyethyleneimine was then added to the solution to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v). After allowing the mixture to stand for 30 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was extensively dialyzed against 10 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, containing 7.5 mm 2-mercaptoetanol (termed buffer A). Step 3, DEAE-Sepharose 4FF—The enzyme solution was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose 4FF column (bed volume, 30 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with the same buffer. The flow-through fractions that contained enzyme activity were combined. Step 4, CM-Sepharose 4FF—The enzyme solution was applied to a CM-Sepharose 4FF column (bed volume, 20 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min using an FPLC system. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in buffer B (20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0) in 100 min. The active fractions were combined. Step 5, Resource PHE—Ammonium sulfate was added to the enzyme solution to 20% saturation. The enzyme solution was applied to a Resource PHE column (bed volume, 6 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B containing 20%-saturated ammonium sulfate at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using an FPLC system. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with a linear gradient between the equilibration buffer and buffer B containing 50% (v/v) ethylene glycol in 30 min. The active fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 3.5 ml. Step 6, Gel Filtration—The enzyme solution was applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200pg column (Amersham Bio-sciences) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.15 m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using an FPLC system. The active fractions were combined and equilibrated with 10 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0 (buffer C), by repeated concentration and dilution by ultrafiltration. Step 7, HiTrap Heparin—The enzyme solution (2.5 ml) was applied to a HiTrap heparin column (1 ml; Amersham Bio-sciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using an FPLC system. The column was washed with buffer C containing 0.15 m NaCl. The enzyme activity was eluted with buffer C containing 1 m NaCl. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, equilibrated with buffer C, and subjected to rechromatography on a HiTrap heparin column in the same manner as described above. Proteins in the SDS-polyacrylamide gels (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The glycoprotein blots were visualized using methods reported previously (17Clarke J.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), using a kit (G. P. Sensor, Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Based on the amino acid sequences determined (see “Results”), degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed as follows: PepF1, 5′-GGICCIAGYATHTGGGAYAC-3′; PepF2, 5′-TGGGAYACITTYACICAYAA-3′; PepR1, 5′-TCCATRTACCAICCRTAYTG-3′; PepR2, 5′-CCRTAYTGRAARTCDATIGC-3′, where I indicates inosine and R, H, and Y indicate degenerate sites (R, A/G; H, A/C/T; and Y, C/T). The total RNA was isolated from the G. max seedling roots using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using Qiagen One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with the primers, PepF1 and PepR1, and the total RNA of the G. max seedling roots as a template. An amplified fragment was further subjected to nested PCR using primers PepF2 and PepR2. The amplified fragment, which was ∼0.6 kbp in length, was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subjected to sequencing using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) with the CEQ 2000 DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from G. max seedling roots using a kit (Straight As mRNA Isolation System; Novagen, Madison, WI). A cDNA library of the G. max seedling roots was constructed using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Gigapack III gold cloning kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's guidelines. The cDNA library, ∼400,000 plaques, was screened using an amplified DNA fragment as a probe. The DIG DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used to label the amplified fragment and detect cDNA clones, following the manufacturer's guidelines. Because the longest cDNA clone was found to lack a translation initiation codon, the 5′-fragment was obtained using a system for the rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA ends (Invitrogen) with the primers GSP1 (5′-CTTCCACCTTCCTTTG-3′), GSP2 (5′-GGCTGAGGATCCAGCCCC-3′), GSP3 (5′-GCAGCGTCATGAACAGGCG-3′), and total RNA of the G. max seedling roots. The mature form of GmICHG (residues 26-514 of the precursor; see “Results” and supplemental Fig. 1S) was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli Origami cells as an N-terminal fusion protein with a thioredoxin molecule using a pET Trx Fusion 32a(+) system (Novagen). The expressed product, 71 kDa in size, was purified to homogeneity as described in the Supplemental Material. Total RNA was prepared from the individual organs of the 15-day-old G. max seedlings using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA contamination in total RNA was eliminated by the treatment with DNase I (Takara-bio, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 30 min. For amplification of a 220-bp partial cDNA of GmICHG, a pair of gene-specific primers was designed as follows: GmICHG-S, 5′-CATAAAGGCTGCGAGAAGGGC-3′; GmICHG-A, 5′-TGTCGTTGCTTGGAGGGACAC-3′. For amplification of a 260-bp partial cDNA of G. max ubiquitin, a pair of gene-specific primers was also designed: GmUBQ-F, 5′-GGGTTTTAAGCTCGTTGT-3′; GmUBQ-R, 5′-GGACACATTGAGTTCAAC-3′. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using mRNA Selective PCR kit (Takara-bio, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Cut roots (5-10 mm in length) of the 7-day-old G. max seedlings were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, containing 4% paraformaldehyde. After the fixed samples were washed extensively with 0.05 m potassium Pi, pH 7.5, they were embedded in 5% agar. The root sections (50-μm thickness) were prepared from the agar-embedded material with a Vibratome Series 3000 Plus-Tissue Sectioning System (Technical Products International, Inc.; St. Louis) using a razor blade. Immunocytochemical labeling of GmICHG was carried out using a kit (TSA kit 12 with horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 488 tyramide; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The resulting sections were observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a filter set (BA5101F-BA550RIF). To construct the 35S-GmICHG:GFP construct, a full-length GmICHG cDNA fused in-frame with sGFP (S65T) (18Chiu W.-I. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), provided from Dr. Niwa (University of Shizuoka, Japan), was sub-cloned into the binary vector pBE2113Not (19Mitsuhara I. Ugaki M. Hirochika H. Ohshima M. Murakami T. Gotoh Y. Katayose Y. Nakamura S. Honkura R. Nishimiya S. Ueno K. Mochizuki A. Tanimoto H. Tsugawa H. Otsuki Y. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thaliana T87 cultured cells (20Axelos M. Curie C. Mazzolini L. Bardet C. Lescure B. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 123-128Google Scholar) were transformed by co-cultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101(pMP90) carrying the resulting construct, as described in the Supplemental Material. For GFP imaging, T87 cells expressing GFP-fused GmICHG were counterstained with a 10 μg/ml solution of propidium iodide (Sigma). The cells were observed under a BX50 microscope equipped with a confocal scanning system (Fluoview; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Green (sGFP) and red (propidium iodide and chlorophyll autofluorescence) emissions were detected with filters BA510IF-BA550RIF and BA585IF, respectively. The images were then pseudo-colored and combined into one image. Purification of GmICHG from the Roots of G. max Seedlings—Our preliminary studies, as well as previous studies by Hsieh and Graham (12Hsieh M.C. Graham T.L. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), showed that roots of the G. max seedling contain significantly higher (e.g. ∼50-fold) ICHG activity than hypocotyls and cotyledons. Thus, we chose the roots of 5-7-day-old seedlings as the starting materials for the enzyme purification. The enzyme activity was highly stable throughout the purification procedures and was recovered in high yields at each purification step. Finally, a 4200-fold purification was achieved with an overall activity yield of 30% (Table 1). SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme indicated a single major protein band with an estimated molecular mass of 58 kDa (Fig. 2A), which stained positive for the presence of sugar (Fig. 2B), indicating that GmICHG is a glycoprotein. The native molecular mass of the purified GmICHG was estimated to be 100 kDa by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200, indicating that the enzyme is dimeric. The N-terminal amino acid sequence (five cycles) of the purified enzyme, determined by automated Edman degradation, was Asp-Ser-Val-Pro-Leu-(termed sequence 1; see supplemental Fig. 1S). To obtain the internal amino acid sequences of the purified protein, it was digested with a lysylendopeptidase from Achromobacter lyticus M497-1 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC as described previously (21Fujiwara H. Tanaka Y. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Nakao M. Fukui Y. Yamaguchi M.-A. Ashikari T. Kusumi T. Plant J. 1998; 16: 421-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nakayama T. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Sato T. Kikuchi S. Fukui Y. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Ueda T. Nakao M. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Nishino T. Science. 2000; 290: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of some of these peptides were determined to be as follows: Glu-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ile-Trp-Asp-Thr-Phe-Thr-His-Asn-(sequence 2) and Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ile-Asp-Phe-Gln-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Tyr-Met-Glu-(sequence 3).TABLE 1Purification of GmICHG from roots of G. max seedlingsStepTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgnanokatal·protein mg−1-fold%1) Crude extract5900.1611002) (NH4)2SO4 fractionation2200.4531043) DEAE-Sepharose591.610984) CM-Sepharose127.345935) Resource PHE2.534210886) Superdex 2000.68120720837) Heparin-Sepharose0.043660419930 Open table in a new tab cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—We designed the PCR primers on the basis of the amino acid sequences determined for the purified GmICHG (sequences 2 and 3, see supplemental Fig. 1S) and executed a first-round PCR using total RNA of the G. max seedling roots as a template. The amplified fragment was further subjected to nested PCR, yielding a PCR product of ∼0.6 kbp. Using this fragment as a probe, the cDNA library (∼400,000 plaques) was screened under high stringency conditions to give 23 positive clones. The longest cDNA from these clones was completely sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the clone contained all of the partial amino acid sequences determined from the purified enzyme (see below); however, it was found to lack the 5′-terminal portion of an open reading frame. The missing portion (33 bp) was revealed by means of a rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA ends strategy. The deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length cDNA encoded a protein (DDBJ accession number, AB259819; calculated molecular mass, 58,313 Da) of 514 amino acids (Fig. 1S). The internal amino acid sequences determined for the purified enzyme were identified at positions 66-80 and 294-308, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequences determined for the purified enzyme were located at positions 26-30 (Fig. 1S), suggesting that the enzyme was initially biosynthesized in the form of a precursor protein, the N-terminal 25-residue portion of which may encode a signal peptide that is eventually removed during maturation. The molecular mass of the mature enzyme (without sugar chain(s)) is predicted to be 55,686 Da. Properties of GmICHG—The GmICHG purified from the seedling roots (Fig. 2A) efficiently hydrolyzed both the malonylated and nonmalonylated forms of isoflavone 7-O-β-d-glucosides, with the malonylated form being the preferred substrate. The kcat and Km values at pH 7.0, 30 °C for Gen7MG were 98 ± 3s-1 and 25 ± 2 μm, respectively, and those for Gen7G were 13 ± 1s-1 and 32 ± 2 μm, respectively (Table 2); thus, the calculated specificity constant (kcat/Km) for Gen7MG was ∼10 times higher than the value for Gen7G. The 7′-O-(6″-O-β-d-malonyl-β-d-glucoside) and the 7′-O-β-d-glucoside of daidzein also acted as effective substrates, the specificity constants for which were 62 and 23% of the value for Gen7MG, respectively. The enzyme had negligible activity for the following glucosides (relative activity, less than 0.01% of activity for Gen7MG): cyanidin 3-O-β-d-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-(6″-O-malonyl-β-d-glucoside), quercetin 3-O-β-d-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-(6″-O-malonyl-β-d-glucoside), p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucoside, p-nitrophenyl α-d-glucoside, and p-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside. Thus, the enzyme was highly specific for isoflavone conjugates.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of native GmICHGSubstrateRelative activityaThe % activity was determined under the standard assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), with the value of the substrate exhibiting the highest activity taken to be 100%.kcatKmkcat/Km%s−1μMs−1·μM−1Gen7MG10098 ± 325 ± 23.9Gen7G913 ± 132 ± 20.4Dai7MG6446 ± 219 ± 22.4Dai7G1722 ± 125 ± 20.9a The % activity was determined under the standard assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), with the value of the substrate exhibiting the highest activity taken to be 100%. Open table in a new tab Other enzymatic properties of the recombinant enzyme were also examined. The recombinant enzyme was successfully obtained as a soluble, catalytically active form, only when the mature form was expressed in E. coli cells as an N-terminal fusion protein with a thioredoxin molecule. The recombinant protein, 71 kDa in size, could be purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2S) in an activity yield of 22% (see Supplemental Material for details). It displayed a strong GmICHG activity that was highly specific for 7-O-β-d-glucosides and 7-O-(6″-O-malonyl-β-d-glucosides) of isoflavones, as is the case for the native GmICHG. Unlike the native GmICHG, however, the recombinant enzyme appeared to be unstable during purification and displayed lower kcat values as well as a somewhat altered preference for isoflavonoids (see Table 1S). This could be related, at least in part, to the fact that the recombinant GmICHG was obtained as a fusion protein with a thioredoxin molecule and lacked sugar chain(s) in the molecule. The recombinant enzyme was active over the pH range 4.0-7.5 with a maximum activity at pH 5.5 and was stable at pH 6.5 (at 20 °C for 8 h). The enzyme activity was inhibited by 0.1 mm Hg2+ ion (residual activity, 11%). Other 0.1 mm metal ions (Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) and 0.1 mm EDTA had negligible effects on catalytic activity (residual activity, in excess of 88%). The recombinant GmICHG was not inhibited by 0.1 mm glucono-δ-lactone, which has been reported to serve as a weak inhibitor for chickpea ICHG (23Hosel W. Barz W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).

The Polycomb group protein Enhancer of Zeste has been shown in vitro to methylate specifically lysine 27 and lysine 9 of histone H3 but the role of this modification in Polycomb silencing is unknown. We show that H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 is found on the entire Ubx gene silenced by Polycomb. However, Enhancer of Zeste and other Polycomb group proteins stay primarily localized at their response elements, which appear to be the least methylated parts of the silenced gene. Our results suggest that, contrary to the prevailing view, the Polycomb group proteins and methyltransferase complexes are recruited to the Polycomb response elements independently of histone methylation and then loop over to scan the entire region, methylating all accessible nucleosomes. We propose that the Polycomb chromodomain is required for the looping mechanism that spreads methylation over a broad domain, which in turn is required for the stability of the Polycomb group protein complex. Both the spread of methylation from the Polycomb response elements, and the silencing effect can be blocked by the gypsy insulator.

Many genes are thought to be regulated by these transcriptional repressors but their best known role is in the control of the homeotic genes in Drosophila. The expression pattern of these genes is initially established by segmentation gene products that act as activators and repressors. After early embryogenesis, the PcG silencing mechanisms take over to maintain the silenced state through the rest of development (1Pirrotta V. Cell. 1998; 93: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Qian S. Capovilla M. Pirrotta V.

PcG repression is mediated by Polycomb response elements (PREs), DNA regions of several hundred base pairs that are situated in the vicinity of their target genes. Ectopically introduced PREs cause silencing of reporter genes (4Chan C.S. Rastelli L. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2553-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Chiang A. O'Connor M.B.

Genetics. 1997; 147: 209-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional repression by PcG proteins remain far from clear despite substantial efforts. Biochemical analysis has shown that PcG proteins form two types of large multiprotein complexes: a multi-megadalton polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and a 600-kDa ESC·E(Z) complex. PRC1 contains Polycomb (PC), polyhomeotic, posterior sex combs (PSC), dRING, Zeste, and, surprisingly, a number of TBP-associated factors as well as other polypeptides (7Saurin A.J. Shao Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 8Shao Z. Raible F. Mollaaghababa R. Guyon J.R. Wu C.-T. Bender W. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 37-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Whereas very little is known about the biological role of PRC1, in vitro studies have shown that it can block chromatin remodeling by the human SWI·SNF complex on nucleosomal templates (8Shao Z. Raible F. Mollaaghababa R. Guyon J.R. Wu C.-T. Bender W. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 37-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The ESC·E(Z) complex contains a different set of proteins, including Enhancer of Zeste (E(Z)), Extra Sex Combs (ESC), Suppressor of Zeste 12, and the histone chaperone protein p55. These proteins are typically found in a 600-kDa complex although forms of higher molecular weight have also been described and it remains unclear which are responsible for silencing (9Ng J. Hart C.M.

E(Z) is a methyltransferase that, in vitro, can transfer three methyl groups to lysine 27 (K27) and lysine 9 (K9) of histone H3 (12Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

As has been proposed for the heterochromatin protein HP1 (16Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T.

It has also been suggested that the methylated nucleosomes might directly interfere with transcription by altering adjacent interactions (15Müller J. Hart C.M. Francis N.J. Vargas M.L. Sengupta A.

In this work we examined the in vivo distribution of me3K27 and several PcG proteins in the repressed Ubx gene using quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). While this article was in preparation, other reports have described the distribution of PcG proteins over part or all of the Ubx gene using nonquantitative or semiquantitative analyses of chromatin immunoprecipitation that have given different results from ours (12Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar, 19Ringrose L. Ehret H. Paro R. Mol.

While these reports are not always in agreement with one another, the most common finding is that PcG proteins are present at the PRE and promoter regions, H3 K27 methylation is localized over the PRE but K9 methylation is widely distributed. We find that PcG proteins are localized primarily to the PREs while me3K27 is spread over the entire gene. Surprisingly, the PREs are the least methylated parts of the Ubx gene, probably because of the fact that these regions are depleted of nucleosomes. We show that the spread of H3 methylation is blocked by a gypsy Su(Hw) insulator, consistent with the observation that the insulator prevents silencing of a gene when interposed between PRE and promoter. Our results suggest that trimethylation of H3 at K27 is unlikely to serve as a recruiter of PcG proteins to their response elements but may be important for stabilizing the complexes and may participate more directly in transcriptional repression.

Fixed cells or embryos were resuspended in TEN140 buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) to a concentration of ∼1 × 108 cells/ml or 100 mg/ml, respectively. 5 ml of suspension were subjected to sonication with a Branson 250 sonifier equipped with microtip under conditions described in Ref. 25Schwartz Y.B.

The antibody complexes were precipitated, and DNA recovered as described (25Schwartz Y.B. Kahn T.G. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2005; 25: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated DNA was dissolved in 150 μl of water (V1). Analysis of ChIP Products—The primers used for real-time PCR analysis of the immunoprecipitated chromatin are listed in supplementary Table S1. PCR reactions were assembled by mixing 5 μl (V2) of immunoprecipitated DNA solution with 10 μlof2×SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 0.1 μm of corresponding primers and pure water to 20 μl. The starting amount of the template DNA relative to the total amount of the same DNA fragment that had been present in the corresponding ChIP reaction (the X value expressed in percent) was derived from the comparison of the reaction threshold cycle value (Ct)tothe appropriate 5-point standard curve. Standard curves were made separately for each combination of cross-linked lysate and primer pair by amplification of serial dilutions of the input DNA isolated from an aliquot of lysate that did not undergo immunoprecipitation. The yield of ChIP reaction (N) was then calculated using Equation 1. N=X×V1V2.(Eq. 1) The hybridization of ChIP materials with GeneChip Drosophila Forward Tiling Array (Affymetrix; P/N: 511262) is described in details elsewhere (26Schwartz Y.B. Kahn T.G. Nix D.A. Li X.-Y. Bourgon R. Biggin M. Pirrotta V. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The hybridization data are deposited to ArrayExpress data base with accession number: E-MEXP-535. PREs Are the Major Binding Sites of PcG Proteins—In Drosophila Schneider L2 (SL2) tissue culture cells, the Ubx gene is silenced by PcG mechanisms (27Breiling A.B. Turner M. Bianchi M.E. Orlando V. Nature. 2001; 412: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The PREs are known to recruit PcG proteins but we were interested in determining if in a repressed gene other sites, the promoter in particular, are associated with characteristic components of PcG complexes. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitations using cross-linked chromatin and antibodies against PC, PSC, and E(Z) proteins. The localization of these proteins was determined by sampling sequences uniformly scattered along the Ubx gene (Fig. 1A) and amplifying them by quantitative real-time PCR. The absolute amount of DNA immunoprecipitated was calculated from the threshold cycle value and a five-point standardization curve made by serial dilution of DNA isolated from chromatin immunoprecipitation input material. This is essential to obtain meaningful data because different sequences and different primers have very different amplification efficiencies, which cannot be taken into account by simple end-point PCR analysis. The precipitation profiles for these three proteins look qualitatively similar (Fig. 1C). Two distinct peaks of precipitation with antibodies against the PcG proteins are visible, with the stronger peak corresponding to the bxd-PRE and the weaker one to the bx-PRE. Neither the promoter nor any other part of the Ubx gene show preferential association with PcG protein complexes although PC levels slightly above background are consistently detected along much of the gene. Although these levels are very low, these and other results described below suggest that weaker or sparser or more transient interactions do occur between some PcG proteins and Ubx regions other than the PREs. Nevertheless the PREs appear to be the only sites in the chromatin of the silenced Ubx gene that are stably associated with PcG proteins. A less quantitative but more detailed distribution profile was obtained by hybridizing the immunoprecipitated DNA to genomic tiling microarrays (Affymetrix). While the genomic data obtained in this work are reported elsewhere (26Schwartz Y.B. Kahn T.G. Nix D.A. Li X.-Y. Bourgon R. Biggin M. Pirrotta V. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), here we will compare the results obtained for the Ubx gene with those obtained by real-time PCR analysis. The two approaches agree in all essential aspects but, quantitatively, the real-time PCR method gives a greater dynamic range. The PcG proteins are primarily bound at the PREs but, of the three, PSC is the most tightly localized at the PRE while the PC peak is broader and PC levels are visibly elevated over a broader region of the gene. This broader distribution is characteristic of PC and raises the question whether PC alone is present over a broader region or whether it is more likely to become cross-linked to these sites. Above this level, no specific enrichment for PcG proteins is detectable in the promoter region. We note, however, a small prominence in the profiles for all three PcG proteins near the 3′-exon. This corresponds to the promoter of a small antisense transcript reported in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project. The significance of this transcript is unknown. Chromatin of the Repressed Ubx Gene Is Enriched in Methylated Histone H3—To determine the relationship of histone H3 methylation to the distribution of PcG proteins, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations using antibodies against histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (me3K27). Fig. 1B shows that most fragments from the Ubx region, comprising 40-kb upstream of the transcription start and the entire 75 kb of the transcribed region, are precipitated well above the background level. A similar distribution profile was obtained using anti-me3K9. As background control, we took the degree of precipitation of DNA from the coding region of the white gene, which is not transcribed in these cells. Surprisingly, while all parts of the silenced Ubx gene appear to be associated with me3K27, little methylated histone H3 could be detected at fragment BP (Fig. 1B), which corresponds to the core of the bxd-PRE, the major PRE of the Ubx gene (28Horard B. Tatout C. Poux S. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3187-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To a lesser extent, this is also true for the BX1 fragment, which corresponds to the weaker BX-PRE (5Chiang A. O'Connor M.B. Paro R. Simon J. Bender W. Development. 1995; 121: 1681-1689PubMed Google Scholar, 2Qian S. Capovilla M. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3865-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When chromatin immunoprecipitation results were analyzed by hybridization to the Affymetrix genomic tiling microarrays, the resulting profile confirms the results obtained by real-time PCR. The level of me3K27 is high over the upstream regulatory region and entire Ubx gene, tapering off around the 3′-end of the transcription unit. Instead of a level plateau, methylation shows a reproducible series of rapid oscillations with a period of the order of 2 kb. It is possible that these fluctuations reflect a higher order structure of the Ubx chromatin or the process by which methylation spreads from the PRE site (see “Discussion”). We also note that the methylation profile drops sharply over the two PRE sites, in agreement with the real-time PCR data. This undermethylation of presumptive PREs is found frequently but not universally at other PcG target genes (26Schwartz Y.B. Kahn T.G. Nix D.A. Li X.-Y. Bourgon R. Biggin M. Pirrotta V. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). These results are in contradiction with several recent publications that reported finding H3 K27 methylation localized over the bxd PRE, not elsewhere on the Ubx gene (12Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar, 19Ringrose L. Ehret H. Paro R. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 14: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This led us to devote considerable effort to ascertain the validity of our results and the reasons for the discrepancy. We first confirmed that our results were not antibody-dependent. We used two different anti-me3K27 antibodies with essentially similar results. We also tested different degrees of chromatin cross-linking and found that, except at the extremes of under- or over-cross-linking, the results were not qualitatively altered over a 10-fold range of formaldehyde concentration. We asked if the methylation profile reflected that of total histone H3. To determine this, we performed chromatin IP using antibodies against the C-terminal part of H3 (anti-H3total). This region of H3 is not subject to known modifications hence anti-H3total should recognize all forms of this histone. As shown in Fig. 1B, DNA from the coding region of the white gene as well as most DNA fragments from the Ubx locus were precipitated with anti-H3total roughly to the same extent. In contrast, there is indeed much less precipitation of the BP fragment. Some decrease in precipitation compared with the surrounding regions is also visible for the BX1 fragment. In contrast with specific binding proteins or histone modifications, antibody against H3total is expected to precipitate nearly the entire genomic DNA complement. In this case clearly, the antibody added was only a very small fraction of the amount necessary to bind all the H3 present, probably explaining the lower signal to noise ratio obtained. We have also carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-histone H2B with similar results (not shown) indicating a local depletion of histone at the PRE. These results suggest the possibility that the H3 K27 undermethylation might be because of the absence of nucleosomes at the PRE core. Detailed Analysis of the PRE Region—The bxd PRE, the major PRE of the Ubx gene, is a complex region encompassing more than one 1.5 kb of DNA whose core sequences, rich in binding sites for PHO and GAGA factors have the strongest silencing activity (28Horard B. Tatout C. Poux S. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3187-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The core is flanked by sequences that, on their own, have weaker silencing activity. Both core and flanking sequences can bind in vitro PcG complexes from embryonic nuclear extracts, implying that they contain binding sites for PcG-associated recruiting proteins (28Horard B. Tatout C. Poux S. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3187-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We examined in greater detail the PRE region by ChIP assays for PC, PSC, E(Z), GAGA factor, TRX as well as H3 me3K27, H3 me2K27 and total histone H3. The results, shown in Fig. 2, confirm that the PRE core is most highly enriched for PC and, at the same time, contains the least H3 me3K27 or total histone H3. Immediately flanking fragments contain progressively less PC and increasing amounts of me3K27 and core histone. We suppose that these fragments are probably still capable of intrinsically recruiting PC complexes through DNA binding recruiting proteins. Interestingly, none of the PRE fragments showed strong precipitation with antibodies against H3 dimethylated at lysine 27 (me2K27). The distribution of E(Z) and PSC, is more sharply localized at the PRE core than that of PC, much as indicated by the microarray profiles. A similar very sharp localization is obtained for TRX and for GAGA factor. The latter, a DNA-binding protein binds cooperatively to clustered consensus sequences GAGAG and should be confined to DNA containing these motifs. In fact, the binding observed reflects remarkably well the number of clustered GAGA consensuses. We note also that these results imply that the PcG complexes constitute no hindrance to antibody access to GAGA factor bound to DNA. Remarkably TRX, which is thought to be antagonistic to PcG binds exactly the same DNA fragments. Chromatin State of the PRE Core—The ChIP experiments reveal that the bxd PRE is the binding site of a large number of proteins but, curiously, not histone H3 whether methylated or not. To account for this absence, we considered three possible explanations: 1) The binding of large PcG complexes at the PRE might prevent the access of the antibody to the histone H3. This would be surprising, as accessibility problems with chromatin immunoprecipitation have not been reported previously. There appears to be no interference with the access of antibody to other PRE proteins, including GAGA factor, which lies closest to the DNA and is thought to form a multimeric complex that binds to clustered DNA consensus sequences. Another possible explanation is that the me3K27 epitope is pre-empted by interactions with the chromodomain of PC or other proteins. The fact that both me3K27 and total H3 appear similarly depleted at the PRE argues against the idea that the me3K27 epitope might be masked by the PC chromodomain. As a further control, we have carried out salt extraction experiments to remove PcG complexes but not the nucleosomes prior to cross-linking the chromatin. Subsequent ChIP with anti-H3tot or anti-H3 me3K27 confirmed that the PRE core was still low for both epitopes (see supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). 2) A more serious concern is that the low histone immunoprecipitation of the PRE core is because of its smaller DNA fragment size. We have previously reported that the PRE region is highly sensitive to sonication and is rapidly reduced to fragments of 300 bp while the bulk chromatin is still 1-2 kb on the average (25Schwartz Y.B. Kahn T.G. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2005; 25: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Short chromatin fragments, containing one or two nucleosomes, would be poorer targets for an anti-histone antibody and therefore be less well precipitated than longer fragments. This effect could account for an under-representation of histone H3 at the PRE but could not result in a complete loss of a major peak of methylation over the PRE and a gain in methylation in the flanking regions. 3) The PRE might in fact be depleted of nucleosomes and histones. This is the simplest and most straightforward explanation for the absence of methylation. Loss of nucleosomes and nuclease sensitivity have been reported previously for the Fab-7 PRE (29Mishra R.K. Mihaly J. Barges S. Spierer A. Karch F. Hagstrom K. Schweinsberg S.E. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It would be consistent with the large number of binding sites for GAGA factor and other proteins. It has been suggested that the binding of GAGA factor, which interacts cooperatively with multiple consensus sequences (30Katsani K.R. Haj"

The lungs of chow-fed Abcg1(-/-) mice, >6-months old, exhibit extensive subpleural cellular accumulation, macrophage, and pneumocyte type 2 hypertrophy, massive lipid deposition in both macrophages and pneumocytes and increased levels of surfactant. No such abnormalities are observed at 3 months of age. However, gene expression profiling reveals significant changes in the levels of mRNAs encoding key genes involved in lipid metabolism in both 3- and 8-month-old Abcg1(-/-) mice. These data suggest that the lungs of young Abcg1(-/-) mice maintain normal lipid levels by repressing lipid biosynthetic pathways and that such compensation is inadequate as the mice mature. Studies with A-549 cells, a model for pneumocytes type 2, demonstrate that overexpression of ABCG1 specifically stimulates the efflux of cellular cholesterol by a process that is dependent upon phospholipid secretion. In addition, we demonstrate that Abcg1(-/-), but not wild-type macrophages, accumulate cholesterol ester droplets when incubated with surfactant. Together, these data provide a mechanism to explain the lipid accumulation in the lungs of Abcg1(-/-)mice. In summary, our results demonstrate that ABCG1 plays essential roles in pulmonary lipid homeostasis."

All members of the IAP family have at least one baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) motif that is essential for their anti-apoptotic activity. The t(11, 18)(q21;q21) translocation fuses the BIR domains of c-IAP2 with the paracaspase/MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) protein, a critical mediator of T cell receptor-stimulated activation of NF-κB. The c-IAP2·MALT1 fusion protein constitutively activates the NF-κB pathway, and this is considered critical to malignant B cell transformation and lymphoma progression.

The c-IAP2·MALT1 fusion protein constitutively activates the NF-κB pathway, which is potentially seminal for development of inflammation-associated tumors (19Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat.

MALT1, also known as paracaspase, contains a death domain, two immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig-like), a region homologous to caspases, and a globular domain. Despite having a caspase-like region, MALT1 does not have any protease activity (22Snipas S.J. Wildfang E. Nazif T. Christensen L. Boatright K.M. Bogyo M. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biol.

Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The c-IAP2·MALT1 protein appears to stimulate NF-κB signaling through self-oligomerization that deregulates the ubiquitin ligase activity of MALT1 (24Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A report by Zhou et al. (24Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M.

In the present study, we investigated the importance of TRAF1 and TRAF2 for c-IAP2·MALT1-stimulated NF-κB activation. We identified a novel epitope within the BIR1 domain, comprising residues in the first α-helix of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, that is critical for the physical interaction with TRAF1 and TRAF2. The importance of these residues is highlighted in binding studies with endogenous TRAF proteins. Finally, we established that binding to TRAF1 and TRAF2 is not required for c-IAP2·MALT1-stimulated NF-κB activation. These results suggest that, despite binding TRAF1 and TRAF2 through the BIR1 domain of c-IAP2, the c-IAP2·MALT1 fusion activates NF-κB through oligomerization.

The Amino-terminal Portion of the BIR1 of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 Is Responsible for Binding TRAF2—TRAF2 has been shown to associate with c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 but not with other IAPs (7Rothe M. Pan M.G.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To verify the specificity of this interaction, we co-expressed TRAF2 with c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, and ML-IAP (Fig. 1A). c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 immunoprecipitated TRAF2, whereas no interaction was observed between either XIAP or ML-IAP and TRAF2 (Fig. 1A). To identify the portion of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 responsible for TRAF2 binding, we expressed individual BIR domains and CARD-RING finger motifs of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 (Fig. 1B). For both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, the BIR1 domain associated with TRAF2, whereas the BIR2, BIR3, and CARD-RING finger motifs did not (Fig. 1, C and D). Functional properties of XIAP, ML-IAP, and the other BIR domains of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were confirmed by binding to SMAC (data not shown). To define the region within the BIR1 domain of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 responsible for interaction with TRAF2, we undertook an unbiased approach and replaced portions of the BIR1 domain with corresponding portions of the BIR2 domain of c-IAP1. BIR domains of IAP proteins generally contain two α-helices followed by three β-strands and an additional three α-helices at the carboxyl-terminal portion of the domain (Fig. 2A). We made constructs that exchanged either the last three α-helices or the first two α-helices and three β-strands or just the first two α-helices between BIR1 and BIR2 of c-IAP1 (Fig. 2B). Substitution of the last three α-helices resulted in a construct that still co-immunoprecipitated with TRAF2, whereas constructs involving substitutions of the first two α-helices did not (Fig. 2C). This result suggested that the amino-terminal portion of the BIR1 domain might be critical for the interaction with TRAF2. To further verify this hypothesis, we substituted the first α-helix of the BIR1 domain with the corresponding region of the BIR2 domain from c-IAP1 (Fig. 2B). This mutant protein failed to bind TRAF2, either in the context of full-length c-IAP1 protein or as an individual BIR1 domain (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Closer examination of the first α-helix of the BIR1 domain and sequence comparisons between IAP proteins revealed a signature motif containing several amino acid residues specific to c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 that are not present in XIAP or ML-IAP (Fig. 2E). We substituted these residues with alanine and found that substitution prevented binding to TRAF2 (Fig. 2F). A recent report by Samuel et al. (11Samuel T. Welsh K. Lober T. Togo S.H. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1080-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggested that another pair of residues (Glu-64 and Arg-65) at the amino-terminal end of the second α-helix of the BIR1 domain is required for TRAF2 binding. To compare our mutants with those reported previously, we generated constructs of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 with the following substitutions: substitutions of the four α-helix-1-encompassing residues (Cys-45, Leu-47, Tyr-48, Ser-51) with Ala, substitutions of the two residues in α-helix-2 (Glu-64 and Arg-65) with Ala, or a combination of all six substitutions (Fig. 2A). We tested the ability of these constructs to bind endogenous TRAF2 protein from 293T cells and found that both sets of mutations, as well as their combination, failed to immunoprecipitate TRAF2 (Fig. 2F). Structural integrity of TRAF2-binding mutants was confirmed by recognition of these proteins by c-IAP1 BIR1-specific antibodies (data not shown). Homology modeling of the BIR1 domain of c-IAP1 revealed that the conserved residues are clustered together on the surface of the BIR domain, either proximal to (Cys-45) or within (Leu-47, Tyr-48, and Ser-51) α-helix-1 (Fig. 2G). Amino acids Glu-64 and Arg-65 are located at the amino-terminal end of α-helix-2, immediately adjacent to the conserved residues identified in the current study (Fig. 2G). Therefore, we have identified a novel binding site for TRAF2 on the BIR1 domain of c-IAPs that represents a contiguous surface and that includes the previously described binding site. c-IAP2·MALT1-stimulated NF-κB Activation Is Not TRAF2-dependent—The BIR1 domain of c-IAP2 has been implicated as critical for c-IAP2·MALT1-induced NF-κB activation (24Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since we had identified the BIR1 domain as a crucial region for binding TRAF2, we investigated the importance of TRAF2 for c-IAP2·MALT1-induced NF-κB activation. Additionally, Samuel et al. (11Samuel T. Welsh K. Lober T. Togo S.H. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1080-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggested in their report that TRAF2, by virtue of its binding to the BIR1 domain of c-IAP2, might be required for NF-κB activation by c-IAP2·MALT1. To that end, we tested BIR deletion constructs of the c-IAP2·MALT1 fusion protein (hereafter referred to as case2) for binding to TRAF2 (Fig. 3A). Binding assays demonstrated that the BIR1 domain of case2 is required for binding of either overexpressed or endogenous TRAF2 (Fig. 3, B and C). To verify the importance of the identified conserved residues in the first and second α-helices of the BIR1 domain, we introduced the aforementioned substitutions into case2 expression constructs and analyzed for TRAF2 binding. Neither set of mutations, alone or in combination, immunoprecipitated endogenous TRAF2, confirming the importance of those residues for TRAF2 binding by case2 as well as by the c-IAPs (Fig. 3D). To investigate the contribution of TRAF2 binding in case2-induced NF-κB activation, we transfected the TRAF2-binding mutants of case2 into 293T cells and tested their ability to activate NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression. Case2 constructs with TRAF2-binding mutations stimulated NF-κB activity at comparable levels with the wild-type case2 (Fig. 3E). As reported previously (21Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a BIR1 deletion construct of case2, or c-IAP2 or MALT1 alone, did not appreciably activate NF-κB (Fig. 3E). This result suggests that a BIR1 domain-mediated physical interaction with TRAF2 is not required for case2-stimulated NF-κB activation. To confirm that TRAF2 is not required in case2-induced NF-κB activation, we tested case2 mutants for their ability to activate NF-κB in wild-type or TRAF2-deficient MEFs. TRAF2-binding mutants of case2 and wild-type case2 activated NF-κB in both wild-type and TRAF2-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3, F and G). These data indicate that TRAF2 is not required for case2-stimulated NF-κB activation. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 Physically Interact with TRAF1 in a Similar Manner to TRAF2—In addition to TRAF2, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 also interact with TRAF1 (7Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 31Uren A.G. Pakusch M. Hawkins C.J. Puls K.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To examine whether TRAF2-binding mutations in the BIR1 domain of case2 affect association with TRAF1, we expressed TRAF1 along with BIR domain deletions and mutations of case2 and tested for binding. As with TRAF2, case2 associated with TRAF1 through the BIR1 domain of its c-IAP2 component, and mutations in the first and in the second α-helix of the BIR1 domain abrogated that interaction (Fig. 4A). We performed similar experiments with endogenous TRAF1 and confirmed the importance of the conserved amino acid residues at the amino-terminal portion of the BIR1 domain (Fig. 4B). Finally, we examined the same mutations in the context of c-IAP1 and demonstrated that they eliminate binding to endogenous TRAF1 (Fig. 4C). We used XIAP and ML-IAP, IAP proteins that do not interact with TRAFs, as additional controls to emphasize the specificity of this association (Fig. 4C). Thus, TRAF1 and TRAF2 associate with c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 in a similar manner by binding to a surface comprising residues within the first two α-helices of the BIR1 domain. Knockdown of TRAF1 and TRAF2 Does Not Inhibit Case2-stimulated NF-κB Activation—To investigate the joint contribution of TRAF1 and TRAF2 in case2-induced NF-κB activation, we used small interfering RNA technology to down-regulate these two TRAFs individually or in combination. Knockdown of TRAF1 or TRAF2 or simultaneous knockdown of both did not prevent NF-κB activation by case2 (Fig. 5A). As we have shown in Fig. 3, the case2 construct containing all six TRAF1-/TRAF2-binding mutations (case2-comb (where “comb” indicates a combination of all mutations) failed to immunoprecipitate these two TRAFs but still activated NF-κB in their absence (Fig. 5, A and B). Finally, we examined whether the TRAF-binding mutants of case2 affect the oligomerization of case2 since the BIR1 domain of c-IAP2 has been implicated as crucial for oligomerization of case2 (24Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). HA-tagged case2 constructs containing either the four mutations in α-helix 1 or the two mutations in α-helix 2 or the combination of all six mutations all immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged case2 at comparable levels with HA-tagged case2 (Fig. 5C). Thus, we conclude that case2 oligomerization does not seem to be dependent upon a physical interaction with TRAF1 or TRAF2. IAP proteins interact with a variety of inducers and effectors of apoptosis, and the IAP signature motifs, the BIR domains, mediate most of those interactions. However, with the possible exception of SMAC, most IAP proteins and their BIR domains have distinct binding partners. XIAP, for example, is a potent binder and inhibitor of caspases 3, -7, and -9, whereas other IAPs are not. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 make an IAP subgroup of their own since they associate with TRAF1 and TRAF2. We have investigated the importance of the individual BIR domains of c-IAPs for TRAF1 and -2 binding and have found the BIR1 domain to be both necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Most of the well studied TRAF2 interactions (TRADD, TNFR2) involve the TRAF-C domain and have led to the identification of a TRAF2-binding motif (32Park Y.C. Ye H. Hsia C. Segal D. Rich R.L. Liou H.C. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2000; 101: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 33Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, TRAF2 associates with c-IAPs via the TRAF-N domain that encompasses the coiled-coil region (7Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The TRAF-N domain has not been extensively studied, and there are no known structures that would allow modeling of binding sites. To gain further insight into the interaction between c-IAP1/2 and TRAF1/2, we undertook an unbiased approach and examined different portions of the BIR1 domain for TRAF1/2 binding. We found that residues proximal to and within the first α-helix are critical for the c-IAP-TRAF1/2 interaction. These residues constitute a novel interaction site for TRAF1 and -2 on the BIR1 domains of the c-IAPs that is evolutionarily conserved and highly specific for c-IAPs. Interestingly, these residues, in combination with two previously identified residues at the amino-proximal end of α-helix-2, form a contiguous area on the surface of the BIR1 domain. This highlights the difference between the potentially larger binding interface for c-IAP-BIR1-TRAF1/2 association and the BIR3-SMAC-binding interface where a surface groove on the BIR3 domain creates a binding pocket for the amino-terminal four amino acids of mature processed SMAC (30Franklin M.C.

Structural studies of the interaction between the c-IAP BIR1 domain and the TRAF-N domain should further elucidate the mechanism of interaction of these proteins. The most common chromosomal translocation associated with MALT lymphoma, t(11, 18)(q21;q21), generates a fusion protein (case2) containing the BIR domains of c-IAP2 and the caspase-like and IgG-like regions of paracaspase/MALT1. The BIR1 domain of case2 seems to be critical for case2-stimulated NF-κB activation and is also essential for the interaction with TRAF2. Therefore, we and others (11Samuel T. Welsh K. Lober T. Togo S.H. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1080-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have speculated that TRAF2 might be crucial for case2-induced NF-κB activation, either by serving as an adaptor for NF-κB activation or as an oligomerization facilitator for case2. In support of this hypothesis, a TRAF2 dominant negative RING-less construct blocks case2-stimulated NF-κB activation in overexpression studies (21Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, another TRAF that has been implicated in case2-induced NF-κB activation, TRAF6 (37Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), does not appear to be important for this case2-mediated signaling (24Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, our mutagenesis studies, experiments in TRAF2-deficient cells, and down-regulation of TRAF2 all demonstrate that TRAF2 does not play a role in case2-stimulated NF-κB activation. We have also investigated the possibility that another c-IAP-binding TRAF, TRAF1, mediates case2-induced NF-κB activation. TRAF1 does not have a RING finger and cannot activate NF-κB on its own (6Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, since it directly binds the BIR domains of c-IAPs (7Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), it could bridge case2 molecules and mediate their oligomerization. However, as with TRAF2, elimination of TRAF1 binding or down-regulation of TRAF1 had no effect on case2-induced NF-κB activation. Therefore, TRAF1 and TRAF2 do not appear to be involved in case2-stimulated NF-κB activation. Case2 mutants that lost the ability to associate with TRAF1 and TRAF2 still activate NF-κB and can still oligomerize, suggesting that TRAF1 and TRAF2 do not play a role in this component of case2-mediated NF-κB stimulation. Our study demonstrates that the chromosomal translocation that generates the c-IAP2·MALT1 fusion protein can activate NF-κB and contribute to human malignancy in the absence of signaling adaptors that might otherwise regulate its activity.

Elevated levels of interleukin-6, the major inducer of the APR, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. One of the clinical hallmarks of atherogenesis is endothelial dysfunction, characterized by a decrease in endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO). We hypothesized that interleukin-6 (IL-6) decreases endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression. We now show that IL-6 treatment of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) decreases steady-state levels of human eNOS mRNA and protein. This decrease in eNOS expression is caused in part by IL-6 inhibition of transactivation of the human eNOS promoter. To explore the mechanism by which IL-6 affects eNOS expression, we examined activation of signal transducer and transactivator-3 (Stat3). The IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is expressed in HAEC, and Stat3 is phosphorylated in response to IL-6 stimulation of the IL-6R. We identified four consensus sequences for Stat3 binding (SIE) in the eNOS promoter at positions -1520, -1024, -840, and -540. Transfection of eNOS promoter mutants revealed that the SIE at -1024 mediates Stat3 inhibition of eNOS promoter activity. Gel-shift analysis of nuclear extracts from HAEC treated with IL-6 confirms that Stat3 binds to a complex containing the SIE at -1024. RNA silencing of STAT3 blocks the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on eNOS expression. Our data show that IL-6 has direct effects upon endothelial cells, inhibiting eNOS expression in part through Stat3.

A variety of triggers such as infection or trauma lead to the rapid synthesis and circulation of a large number of acute phase effector molecules, including anti-microbial proteins, pro-coagulant factors, and metabolic regulators. Although the APR is a rapid response to acute stress, chronic activation of the APR is associated with various diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and coronary artery disease. For example, levels of acute phase effector proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and sICAM-1 are higher in patients with atherosclerosis or acute coronary syndromes compared with healthy controls (3Libby P.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a major activator of the acute phase response (1Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 9Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). IL-6 induces hepatocytes to activate or suppress the synthesis of a variety of acute phase response effector proteins. IL-6 initiates its action by binding to the IL-6 receptor, which is composed of two subunits: an 80-kDa IL-6-binding protein and a 130-kDa transmembrane signal-transducing component (gp130) (9Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Activation of IL-6 signal transduction involves gp130 dimerization, ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Stat3 is a transcription factor that mediates the cellular response to IL-6 (10Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Stat3 is expressed in most cell types and can be activated by other cytokines and growth factors including: IFN-α, IL-10, IL-6, IL-11, LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor), G-CSF (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor), IL-12, IL-2, GH (growth hormome), EGF, PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), and CSF-1. Jak phosphorylates Stat3 on a tyrosine residue (Tyr705) within a conserved SH2 domain, allowing homodimerization or heterodimerization with other Stat family members, nuclear translocation, and transcription activation. The specific regulatory elements that Stat3 interacts with include the APRE (acute phase response element) and the SIE (c-sis inducible element). IL-6 and other factors can also activate phosphorylation of Stat3 at a single residue (Ser727), which enhances Stat3 transcriptional activation. Since effectors of the APR are elevated in apparently healthy subjects who later develop coronary artery disease, the APR may play a role in the early stages of atherogenesis, including endothelial dysfunction (14Rader D.J.

Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by decreased bioavailability of NO, caused in part by increased oxidant stress and by decreased NO synthesis (16Walford G. Loscalzo J. J. Thromb.

The expression of eNOS can be regulated by biophysical stimuli (such as shear stress or hypoxia), growth factors (such as TGF-β, FGF, VEGF, or PDGF), hormones (such as estrogens, insulin, angiotensin II, or endothelin 1), or NO itself (23Dudzinski D.M.

We now show that the APR inducer IL-6 decreases eNOS expression in human aortic endothelial cells by activating the binding of Stat3 to a specific site in the human eNOS promoter.

In brief, cellular monolayers were washed with PBS and harvested in protein lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH = 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 500 nm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml of antipain and leupeptin). 25 μg of total protein were separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Polyscreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For protein detection, blocked membranes were incubated with specific antibodies, washed, and incubated with a secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with the SuperSignal detection system according to the manufacture's procedures (Pierce). Nitrite Production—Nitrite release from endothelial cells was evaluated by a fluorometric assay using 2,3-diaminonaphthalene as described. Fluorescence was determined in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B fluorometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 450 nm, respectively. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA from HAEC was isolated with the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. Total RNA 10 μg was fractionated by electrophoresis through denaturing 1% agarose, 0.66 m formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and UV cross-linked before hybridization. For Northern analysis, a 1700-bp fragment of human eNOS cDNA were labeled with [32P]dCTP and random hexamers using a kit (Redi Prime, Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 12-16 h; membranes were then washed and exposed with XAR Kodak film, using an intensifying screen. Blots were re-hybridized with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. eNOS Promoter Activity—Cell transfection was performed using methods previously reported. HAECs grown to 50-60% confluence in 6-well plates were preincubated in 0.5% endothelial growth media for 30 min at 37 °C. The eNOS promoter constructs (1 μg) and a plasmid containing SV40-driven Renilla luciferase gene (Promega) were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HAEC were incubated with the plasmids for 6 h and then fed with media. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual Luciferase reporter kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's directions. Firefly luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) and normalized against Renilla activity. The results were normalized as relative luciferase light units/μg of protein. Transfection efficiency was between 30 and 40%. Site-Directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of the eNOS 5′-flanking region was performed with the QuikChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The SIE consensus sites present in the eNOS promoter were mutated by substituting CC for the TT nucleotides within the SIE consensus binding site TTN(4Ridker P.M. Cushman M. Stampfer M.J. Tracy R.P.

Zaragoza C. Cao W. Bao C. Rodriguez-Puyol M. Rodriguez-Puyol D. Lowenstein C.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) from HAECs were incubated with a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide containing the -1024 eNOS promoter SIE binding element at 22 °C for 30 min. DNA-protein complexes were then electrophoresed through a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. For competition experiments, a 200-fold molar excess of competitor DNA was incubated in the mixture prior to the addition of the nuclear extracts. For supershift experiments 2 μg of specific antibody against Stat3 or Stat1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were included in the reaction. RNA Interference—STAT-3 expression was knocked down in BAEC with the Silencer siRNA Construction kit from Ambion (Madrid, Spain), according to the manufacturer's guidelines (26Saura M. Zaragoza C. Cao W. Bao C. Rodriguez-Puyol M. Rodriguez-Puyol D. Lowenstein C.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Predesigned and annealed STAT-3 dsRNA, as well as STAT-3-negative control dsRNA, were also from Ambion (catalog numbers 16704 and 4611, respectively). Statistical Analysis—Experiments were performed in duplicate and each experiment was repeated at least three times. The variability of the data were described by analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's modification of the t test whenever comparisons were made with a common control. The unpaired twotailed Student's test was used for other comparisons. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. IL-6 Decreases eNOS Expression—To test our hypothesis that IL-6 decreases eNOS expression, HAECs were incubated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of IL-6, and eNOS protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. IL-6 decreases steady-state eNOS protein levels in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A). As little as 10 ng/ml of IL-6 can decrease eNOS expression. IL-6 affects eNOS expression within 8-16 h of treatment (Fig. 1B). We next determined the effect of IL-6 upon eNOS mRNA expression. IL-6 decreases steady-state levels of eNOS within6hof treatment (Fig. 1C). We also measure the nitrite levels produced by the cells in response to IL-6 stimulation. IL-6 decreases the basal nitrite release from HAECs in a dose-response manner (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data show that IL-6 decreases eNOS expression and NO synthesis in endothelial cells in vitro. IL-6 Does Not Affect eNOS mRNA Stability—To determine whether IL-6 decreases eNOS mRNA by destabilizing eNOS mRNA, we treated HAEC with IL-6 or vehicle for 8 h, then stopped transcription by adding actinomycin D (5 μm), and then harvested total RNA at increasing times for use in Northern analysis of eNOS mRNA. IL-6 does not affect the stability of the eNOS mRNA transcript (Fig. 2). These results indicate that IL-6 induced changes in eNOS expression involved a transcriptional effect rather than a decrease in mRNA stability. IL-6 Decreases eNOS Promoter Activity—We first studied the effects of IL-6 upon the human eNOS 5′-flanking region extending 1600 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site. We transfected HAEC with an eNOS promoter luciferase construct (eNOS-Luc) and then treated them with IL-6. (As an internal control, cells were also co-transfected with a plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase.) Human eNOS promoter transactivation was measured as firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. IL-6 inhibits eNOS promoter activity in endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Since IL-6 activates Stat3, we examined the eNOS promoter region for potential Stat3 binding elements (SIE). The eNOS promoter contains four consensus SIE sites TTN(4Ridker P.M. Cushman M. Stampfer M.J. Tracy R.P. Hennekens C.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (4902) Google Scholar, 5Ridker P.M. Hennekens C.H. Buring J.E. Rifai N. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (5039) Google Scholar)AA (at -1501, -1021, -840, and -640) (Fig. 3B). Stat3 Binding Element at-1024 Mediates IL-6 Inhibition of eNOS Expression—To identify which of the SIE mediate IL-6 inhibition of eNOS expression, we first constructed plasmids containing deletions of the human eNOS promoter driving luciferase expression. We co-transfected HAEC with these human eNOS promoter-luciferase plasmids (along with plasmids constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase as internal controls). We then added IL-6 to transfected HAEC and after 24 h measured firefly and Renilla luciferase activity in cell lysates. IL-6 decreases transactivation of the full-length -1600 bp eNOS promoter (Fig. 4A, top row). IL-6 also decreases transactivation of the -1300-bp truncated eNOS promoter (Fig. 4A, second row). However, IL-6 does not affect transactivation of the eNOS promoter deletion constructs lacking bp -1600 to -1000 upstream of the eNOS regulatory region (Fig. 4A, lower three rows). These data suggest that elements within -1600 to -1000 bp upstream of the eNOS transcription start site mediate IL-6 suppression of the eNOS promoter. We next sought to identify the precise sites within the eNOS promoter that mediate IL-6 suppression of eNOS expression. Based on our promoter deletion data (Fig. 4), we selected the SIE elements between -1000 and -1600 bp for further analysis. To determine which of the SIE elements at -1501 or -1024 mediate IL-6 suppression of the human eNOS promoter, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a set of eNOS promoter mutants, each construct containing a 2-bp mutation disrupting one of the three distal SIE elements. HAEC were transfected with these mutants and stimulated with IL-6 for 24 h, and cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity. IL-6 decreases the eNOS promoter activity of the wild-type eNOS promoter, and IL-6 also decreases eNOS promoter activity of the eNOS promoter lacking the functional SIE at -1540 bp (Fig. 4B). However, IL-6 does not affect promoter activity of the eNOS promoter lacking the SIE at -1024. Taken together, our data suggest that the SIE at -1024 upstream of the eNOS transcriptional start site mediates IL-6 suppression of the eNOS promoter. IL-6 Stimulates Stat3 Phosphorylation in Human Endothelial Cells—IL-6 activates the APR in part by interacting with the IL-6 receptor which in turn triggers Jak phosphorylation of Stat3. The IL-6 receptor is composed of two subunits, IL-Rα and gp-130. To further investigate the molecular mechanism by which IL-6 inhibits eNOS expression, we analyzed Stat3 phosphorylation in response to IL-6 in endothelial cells. We treated HAEC with IL-6 for 0-240 min and then measured phosphorylation of Stat3. Phosphorylated Stat3 levels increase within 15 min of IL-6 treatment, decrease within 60 min, but remain above basal levels for up to 240 min (Fig. 6A, top). The IL-6 receptor subunit gp-130 is expressed in HAECs, and IL-6 does not change its expression (Fig. 5A, bottom). The treatment of HAECs with a Jak inhibitor (tyrphostin A) was able to completely prevent IL-6 induced Stat3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). Thus IL-6 is capable of initiating the JAK/stat3 pathway in HAEC.FIGURE 5IL-6 activates Stat3 in endothelial cells. A, HAEC were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 0-4 h, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. B, HAEC were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 30 min in the presence or the absence of tyrphostin A (1 μm). C, nuclear extracts from HAEC stimulated with IL-6 were incubated with radiolabeled SIE probe, non-labeled probe (C), mutant non-labeled probe (M), or antibody to Stat1 or Stat3 or IgG. These experiments were repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that IL-6 activates the ability of Stat3 to interact with its DNA response element, we measured binding activity in endothelial nuclear extracts. We treated HAEC with IL-6, harvested nuclear extracts, and incubated nuclear extracts with a radiolabeled eNOS fragment spanning -1031 to -1011 that contained the Stat3 binding site SIE at -1024. Nuclear protein-DNA complexes were fractionated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. IL-6 increases SIE binding activity in endothelial cells 15 min after treatment and peaks 30 min after treatment (Fig. 5C). Excess non-labeled SIE oligonucleotide competes for this binding activity. Addition of an antibody to Stat3 produces a supershift in the binding to the SIE element, indicating that Stat3 is present in the protein-DNA complex. In contrast, an antibody to Stat1 has no effect on the protein-DNA complex. Normal mouse IgG does not affect the protein-DNA complex. Thus IL-6 activates Stat3 binding to a complex containing the eNOS SIE-1024 site oligonucleotide. These data suggest that IL-6 activates Stat3 interaction with the eNOS promoter at an SIE site at position-1024. Stat3 Pathway Mediates eNOS Inhibition by IL-6—To confirm our results that Stat3 mediates Il-6 suppression of eNOS, we tested the effects of other Stat3 activating cytokines upon eNOS protein expression. Onconstatin M (OSM), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and EGF are each capable of stimulating Stat3. HAEC were stimulated with OSM, TNF-α, EGF, or IL-6 at increasing concentrations for 24 h. OSM and TNF-α reduced eNOS expression in parallel to IL-6 in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 6A). However, EGF treatment had little effect on eNOS expression. Furthermore, IL-6, OSM, and TNF-α also reduced nitrite production whereas EGF did not (Fig. 6B). Thus, cytokines that activate the Stat3 pathway also reduced eNOS expression and activity. We next used RNA interference to test the role of Stat3 in IL-6 suppression of eNOS. HAEC were transfected with Stat3 siRNA or a nonspecific siRNA as control. Stat3 siRNA decreases Stat3 levels (Fig. 7A, middle panel). We then treated HAEC with IL-6 for 24 h. As before, IL-6 decreases eNOS expression in control transfected cells (Fig. 7A, right top lanes). In contrast, IL-6 has no effect upon eNOS expression in HAEC transfected with the Stat3 siRNA (Fig. 7A, left top lanes). Taken together, these results suggest that Stat3 mediates IL-6 suppression of eNOS expression by interacting with an SIE element at -1024 within the human eNOS regulatory region. The main finding of our study is that IL-6 decreases eNOS gene expression in part by activating Stat3 binding to the eNOS 5′-flanking region. Inflammatory Signals Decrease eNOS Expression—Our results support the findings of others that inflammatory mediators decrease eNOS expression (27Tai S.C. Robb G.B. Marsden P.A. Arterioscler. Thromb.

TNF-α can decrease eNOS expression by inhibiting eNOS promoter transactivation and also by destabilizing eNOS mRNA (30Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. Lee M.E. Circ.

Stat3 Isoforms and eNOS Regulation—The Stat3 gene is alternatively spliced into two distinct mRNA species encoding separate isoforms, Stat3α and Stat3β (38Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R.

Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stat3α contains a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain, so Stat3 can interact with SIE elements and drive transcription of genes. However, Stat3β only contains a DNA binding domain and lacks a transcriptional activation domain, so Stat3β can interact with SIE elements but does not drive transcription. Traditionally, Stat3β has been considered a dominant negative isoform of Stat3. The ratio of Stat3α and Stat3β varies in cells, ranging from 1:3 to 10:1 at the protein level. This variation may have important biologic consequences. Specific ablation of the Stat3β isoform dramatically affects the pattern of gene expression in endotoxic shock, indicating a central role of this isoform in modulating systemic inflammation (40Desiderio S. Yoo J.Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 987: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 41Yoo J.Y. Huso D.L. Nathans D. Desiderio S. Cell. 2002; 108: 331-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, an important study showed that Stat3α and Stat3β have distinct functions and that Stat3β is not merely a dominant-negative factor, as has been generally thought. Expression of Stat3β can rescue the embryonic lethality of the Stat3α null mutation, and it can, by itself, induce the expression of specific Stat3 target genes. Nevertheless, Stat3α is the isoform that mediates the cell response to cytokines such as IL-6 or IL-10 (41Yoo J.Y. Huso D.L. Nathans D. Desiderio S. Cell. 2002; 108: 331-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although our studies show that IL-6 treatment leads to Stat3 phosphorylation and binding to the eNOS promoter, our studies do not distinguish which Stat3 isoform represses eNOS transcription.

Chronic inflammation may trigger synthesis of IL-6, which activates Stat3; Stat3 in turn drives transcription of acute phase response reactants such as CRP which contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis (42Paffen E.

Paradoxically, activation of S6K1 also leads to the development of insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated the effect of TRB3, which acts as an endogenous inhibitor of Akt, on S6K1 activity in vitro and in vivo. In cultured cells, overexpression of TRB3 completely inhibited insulin-stimulated S6K1 activation by mammalian target of rapamycin, whereas knockdown of endogenous TRB3 increased both basal and insulin-stimulated activity. In C57BL/6 mice, adenoviral overexpression of TRB3 inhibited insulin-stimulated activation of hepatic S6K1. In contrast, overexpression of TRB3 did not inhibit nutrient-stimulated S6K1 activity. We also investigated the effect of starvation, feeding, or insulin treatment on TRB3 levels and S6K1 activity in the liver of C57BL/6 and db/db mice. Both insulin and feeding activate S6K1 in db/db mice, but only insulin activates in the C57BL/6 strain. TRB3 levels were 3.5-fold higher in db/db mice than C57BL/6 mice and were unresponsive to feeding or insulin, whereas both treatments reduced TRB3 in C57BL/6 mice. Akt was activated by insulin alone in the C57BL/6 strain and but not in db/db mice. Both insulin and feeding activated mammalian target of rapamycin similarly in these mice; however, feeding was unable to activate the downstream target S6K1 in C57BL/6 mice. These results suggest that the nutrient excess in the hyperphagic, hyperinsulinemic db/db mouse primes the hepatocyte to respond to nutrients resulting in elevated S6K1 activity. The combination of elevated TRB3 and constitutive S6K1 activity results in decreased insulin signaling via the IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.

Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Conversely, S6K1 activity is elevated in several tissues of animal models of obesity, and/or type 2 diabetes, and correlates with increased insulin resistance (6Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Both insulin and amino acid induction of S6K1 activity are mediated by mTOR, an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that is the mammalian target of rapamycin (7Hara K. Yonezawa K.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). mTOR is found in a complex (mTORC1) with raptor and mLST8 and is activated by the small GTPase Rheb (9Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 10McMahon L.P. Yue W. Santen R.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 and TSC2 maintain Rheb in the inactive GDP-bound state because of the Rheb-GAP enzyme activity of TSC2. Activation of mTOR by insulin is associated with phosphorylation of TSC2, dissociation of the Rheb-TSC1-TSC2 complex, and relief of Rheb repression (11Zhang Y. Gao X. Saucedo L.J. Ru B.

Walker C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). One of the key enzymes responsible for phosphorylation of TSC2 by insulin is the serine/threonine kinase Akt (14Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 15Aoki M. Blazek E. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, nutrients such as amino acids activate the mTOR-S6K1 pathway independently of the insulin pathway, via the class III PI 3-kinase hVps34 (18Hinault C. Mothe-Satney I. Gautier N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Van Obberghen E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1894-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Dann S.G. Kim S.Y. Gulati P. Byfield M.P. Backer J.M.

Unlike insulin, amino acids cause GTP loading on Rheb in a TSC2-independent manner suggesting a parallel pathway leading to mTOR activation. This nutrient-regulated pathway is essential for Akt/TSC2/mTOR signaling, however, because inhibition of hVps34 or its product PI(3)P prevents the insulin stimulation of S6K1 (19Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Dann S.G. Kim S.Y. Gulati P. Byfield M.P. Backer J.M. Natt F. Bos J.L. Zwartkruis F.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14238-14243Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Recently, Du et al. (21Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) identified TRB3, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila tribbles, also called NIPK (neuronal cell death-inducible protein kinase) (20Mayumi-Matsuda K. Kojima S. Suzuki H. Sakata T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), as an endogenous inhibitor of Akt. TRB3 binds to unphosphorylated Akt and prevents its activation. Expression of TRB3 mRNA is induced in the liver by fasting and is elevated in db/db mice. Adenoviral expression of TRB3 impairs insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis and prevents inhibition of gluconeogenesis, thus increasing blood glucose levels (21Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 22Koo S.H. Satoh H. Herzig S. Lee C.H. Hedrick S. Kulkarni R. Evans R.M. Olefsky J. Montminy M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that TRB3 elevation contributes to the development of insulin resistance. In support of this notion, knockdown of TRB3 improves glucose tolerance in C57BL/6 mice, and TRB3 overexpression reverses the insulin-sensitive phenotype of PGC1-deficient mice (22Koo S.H. Satoh H. Herzig S. Lee C.H. Hedrick S. Kulkarni R. Evans R.M. Olefsky J. Montminy M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, TRB3-mediated inhibition of Akt may also inhibit insulin-induced S6K1 activation and protein synthesis. Inhibition of S6K1 is associated with insulin sensitization because of negative feedback on IRS1 (6Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), so TRB3 might mitigate insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated the role of TRB3 in nutrient- and insulin-induced activation of S6K1, both in vitro and in vivo. We find that TRB3 is a potent inhibitor of insulin-stimulated, but not nutrient-stimulated, S6K1 activation. TRB3 protein levels are constitutively elevated in db/db mice and are not responsive to nutrients or insulin. Consequently, Akt signaling is severely compromised, but surprisingly, insulin activation of S6K1 is normal in db/db mice despite the elevated TRB3. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p-Akt (Thr-380 and Ser-473), p-TSC2/tuberin (Thr-1462), p-mTOR (Ser-2448), p-S6K1 (Thr-389), p-S6K1 (Thr-421/Ser-424), p-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-235/236), p-4E-BP1 (Ser-65), and p-GSK3α/β (Ser-21/9) and antibodies against Akt, mTOR, S6K1, 4E-BP1, GSK3, and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/ERK2) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against TRB3-(1–145) were purchased from Calbiochem. Analytical grade porcine insulin was from Sigma. Plasmids—Mammalian expression plasmids were used to express the following proteins: TRB3 (Dr. M. Montminy, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA); FLAG-tagged 4E-BP-1 (FLAG-4E-BP1) (Dr. K. L. Guan, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI); and HA-tagged S6K1 (HA-S6K1) (Dr. J. Blenis, Harvard Medical School, Boston). Preparation of Recombinant Adenovirus—The recombinant adenoviruses encoding TRB3, or green fluorescent protein (GFP), were generated using the AdEasy system, as described previously (23He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus was amplified in HEK293 cells, and the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was determined as pfu/ml (24Katome T. Obata T. Matsushima R. Masuyama N. Cantley L.C. Gotoh Y. Kishi K. Shiota H. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28312-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Recombinant Adenovirus Infection—HepG2 cells and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Mouse hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of male ddY mice (25–35 g, 8–10 weeks) using collagenase perfusion (25Ichihara A. Nakamura T. Tanaka K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 43: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and were plated onto culture dishes. Prior to experimentation, hepatocytes were maintained in William's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 nm dexamethasone, and 1 nm insulin. Cells were infected by adenovirus at the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i. pfu/cell) indicated. Preparation and Transfection of Synthetic siRNA—All DNA/RNA chimeric oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Double-stranded RNA duplexes, corresponding to amino acids 34–40 of human TRB3 (5′-CGAGCUCGAAGUGGGCCCC-3′), and control GFP were purified and transfected into human HepG2 hepatocytes using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were used 24–48 h following transfection. Stimulation of Liver Cells with Insulin, Pervanadate, Amino Acids, or Nutrients—Primary mouse hepatocytes, and HepG2 cells, were treated with insulin (100 nm) for the indicated times. In some experiments, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated for 15 min with pervanadate (100 μm), an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases that causes activation of Akt. For amino acid stimulation, subconfluent HepG2 cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated in amino acid-free medium for 2 h. Cells were then incubated for 60 min with, or without, an isomolar mixture of amino acids. The concentrations of each amino acid used were based on levels from the portal vein of a fasted rat (26Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). For nutrient stimulation, cells were washed and preincubated with PBS for 1 h and then incubated in either PBS or DMEM for 30 min. In some experiments, wortmannin (50 nm) or rapamycin (25 ng/ml) was added to the incubation medium 30 min prior to and during the stimulation with insulin, amino acids, or nutrients. Following stimulation, cells were washed once with PBS and then harvested. Cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were processed for immunoblotting or the S6K1 assay. Stimulation of Epitope-tagged S6K1 or 4E-BP1 by Nutrients in HepG2 Cells—HepG2 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-S6K1 and FLAG-4E-BP1, and then nutrient stimulation was conducted 48 h following transfection. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-HA tag antibody (Sigma) or anti-FLAG tag antibody (Sigma) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitated proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting, using the antibodies indicated. Immunoblotting—The antibodies used for immunoblotting were as indicated, and signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-mediated chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (24Katome T. Obata T. Matsushima R. Masuyama N. Cantley L.C. Gotoh Y. Kishi K. Shiota H. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28312-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Assay of S6K1 Activity—S6K1 activity was measured using the p70S6 kinase assay kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, cells were homogenized using ultrasonication in lysis buffer (10 nm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and the endogenous S6K1 in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-S6K1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS at pH7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was performed for each precipitated sample in an assay mixture containing 50 μm substrate peptide (AKRRRLSSLRA) and 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP. Following incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, aliquots were applied onto P81 phosphocellulose squares and washed, and radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. Animal Experiments—In vivo experiments were conducted using 8–9-week old-male C57BL/6 and db/db mice. The mice were housed under controlled light/dark (12/12 h) and temperature conditions. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Animal Subjects Committee of the University of California, San Diego. Mice were fed normal rodent chow (type MF, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) and tap water ad libitum. Exogenous overexpression of TRB3 or GFP was induced in the livers of C57BL/6 mice via the injection of 5 × 108 pfu/ml of virus into the tail vein as described (27Miyake K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Nakamura T. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mice were euthanized 7 days following virus injection. During the course of the experiments, mice were fasted for 24 h with free access to water, and the fasting blood glucose was monitored. Mice were refed for the following 24 h, and blood glucose was again determined. This fasting-feeding protocol was repeated for 7 days. All mice were sacrificed for blood and liver collection at the end of the experiments. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of collected blood and assayed for insulin. Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were determined as described previously (28Kanezaki Y. Obata T. Matsushima R. Minami A. Yuasa T. Kishi K. Bando Y. Uehara H. Izumi K. Mitani T. Matsumoto M. Takeshita Y. Nakaya Y. Matsumoto T. Ebina Y. Endocr. J. 2004; 51: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Some of the mice were subjected to insulin injection (0.75 units/kg body weight, 10 min) prior to sacrifice. For glucose tolerance tests, mice fasted for 24 h were injected intraperitoneally with 2 g of glucose per kg of body weight. For insulin tolerance tests, mice fasted for 24 h were injected intraperitoneally with 0.75 units of insulin per kg of body weight. Blood glucose level was measured in tail vein blood collected at the designated times. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. and were analyzed using analysis of variance and Bonferroni multiple comparison tests. p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. TRB3 Inhibits Insulin-induced Activation of S6K1 Both in Vitro and in Vivo—TRB3 is an endogenous inhibitor of Akt (21Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Therefore, enhanced expression of TRB3 is expected to inhibit insulin-induced activation of S6K1 through the inhibition of Akt. Adenoviral overexpression of TRB3 in primary mouse hepatocytes inhibited insulin-stimulated S6K1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). TRB3 overexpression inhibited phosphorylation of Akt (Thr-308 and Ser-473), TSC2/tuberin (Thr-1462), and mTOR (Ser-2448), all of which are located upstream of S6K1 activation in the insulin signaling pathway, and also inhibited phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-235/236), a substrate of S6K1 (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that stimulation of endogenous S6K activity as measured by S6 phosphorylation is greater than measurement of S6K activity in vitro. We ascribe this difference to the high basal activity associated with the in vitro kinase assay. Additionally, overexpression of TRB3 inhibited the insulin-induced phosphorylation of another mTOR target, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which regulates the initiation of 5′-capped mRNA translation (29Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1092-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the major mTOR-regulated site (Ser-65) is dramatically inhibited (30Gingras A.C. Raught B. Gygi S.P. Niedzwiecka A. Miron M. Burley S.K. Polakiewicz R.D. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, TRB3 had little effect on insulin-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (Fig. 1B). Similar results are seen when cells are stimulated with sodium pervanadate (21Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The level of S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr-389, a site targeted by mTOR (31Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar), was elevated by pervanadate treatment (Fig. 1C). No phosphorylation of S6K1 on Thr-421/Ser-424 was observed (Fig. 1C). These are the rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation sites in mouse hepatocytes (31Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Adenoviral overexpression of TRB3 greatly inhibited the phosphorylation of Thr-389 in response to pervanadate (Fig. 1C), in agreement with the insulin results. We examined the effect of RNA interference (RNAi) of TRB3 in HepG2 cells that are known to express endogenous TRB3 (21Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Knockdown of TRB3 enhanced basal S6K1 activity 1.2-fold (p < 0.01), and enhanced insulin-stimulated S6K1 activity 1.6-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). Transfection with TRB3 RNAi caused a 70% reduction in endogenous TRB3 protein levels in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2B). We also examined the effects of TRB3 RNAi on the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1. Knockdown of TRB3 resulted in no effect on basal S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but increased the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1 2.5-fold (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, endogenous TRB3 provides tonic inhibition of insulin-stimulated S6K1 activity in hepatocytes. To investigate the effect of TRB3 on insulin stimulation of S6K1 in vivo, we infected adult male C57BL/6 mice with adenoviruses encoding TRB3 or GFP as control. TRB3-infected mice were treated with or without insulin (0.75 units/kg body weight) for 10 min, and the hepatic S6K1 activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 3A, adenoviral overexpression of TRB3 completely suppressed the insulin-induced hepatic S6K1 activation in mice. TRB3 also suppressed the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate S6 protein (Fig. 3B). To determine the physiological effects of exogenous TRB3 overexpression, we examined body weight, food intake, and metabolic parameters in these animals. Control GFP-infected mice and TRB3-infected mice had similar increases in body weight over 7 days, although food consumption did not change (Table 1). TRB3 expression had no effect on either insulin or blood glucose level in the fasted state. Plasma insulin concentrations in the fed state were modestly increased in TRB3-infected mice (2.3 ng/ml) versus GFP-infected mice (1.6 ng/ml) on day 7 following viral infection. Blood glucose levels were also increased in the fed state (155 versus 114 mg/dl, n = 6). As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, overexpression of TRB3 elevated the blood glucose excursion during a glucose tolerance test and impaired the glucose lowering effect of insulin during an insulin tolerance test as has been published previously (21Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Given the results from both in vitro and in vivo studies, we conclude that TRB3 inhibits insulin signaling via the Akt/TSC2/mTOR/S6K1 pathway in the liver and creates a state of insulin resistance.TABLE 1Metabolic parameters in adenoviral infected miceVirusWeightFood intakeInsulinGlucoseFedFastedFedFastedGFPTRB3GFPTRB3GFPTRB3GFPTRB3GFPTRB3GFPTRB3gg/dayng/mlmg/mlDay 117.8 ± 0.5617.4 ± 0.842.56 ± 0.232.68 ± 0.261.6 ± 0.451.6 ± 0.230.4 ± 0.150.6 ± 0.23108 ± 12.2110 ± 10.871 ± 9.274 ± 9.8Day 318.0 ± 0.6718.6 ± 0.652.68 ± 0.422.77 ± 0.381.5 ± 0.291.8 ± 0.430.5 ± 0.190.5 ± 0.23110 ± 10.6133 ± 11.4*74 ± 9.775 ± 7.8Day 518.8 ± 0.4518.9 ± 0.712.79 ± 0.242.59 ± 0.431.4 ± 0.322.1 ± 0.51*0.4 ± 0.130.6 ± 0.22105 ± 11.8150 ± 12.6*78 ± 7.282 ± 7.3Day 719.5 ± 0.8619.7 ± 0.992.76 ± 0.382.69 ± 0.561.6 ± 0.212.3 ± 0.43*0.5 ± 0.130.6 ± 0.24114 ± 10.4155 ± 13.3*81 ± 7.585 ± 8.3 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Effect of TRB3 overexpression on intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test in vivo.

Therefore, we investigated whether overexpression of TRB3 affects nutrient-induced activation of S6K1. HepG2 cells infected with or without the TRB3-expressing adenovirus were stimulated with either the amino acid mixture (two times the normal culture levels) or DMEM culture medium. Both the amino acid mixture and the DMEM stimulated S6K1 activity 1.5-fold (p < 0.01; Fig. 5A). The addition of insulin together with the nutrients showed an additive effect (2.3-fold, p < 0.01). Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, strongly inhibited both the insulin and nutrient-stimulated S6K1 activity (Fig. 5A), confirming a central role for mTOR in the regulation of S6K1 activation. Wortmannin also inhibited the insulin-stimulated S6K1 activity, consistent with signaling through the class I PI 3-kinases but had no effect on nutrient-stimulated S6K1 (Fig. 5A). TRB3 overexpression blocked insulin-stimulated S6K1 as shown in vivo earlier but did not have a significant effect on the nutrient stimulation of S6K1. To determine whether the upstream kinase mTOR was activated normally, we measured the phosphorylation state of two mTOR targets S6K1 and 4E-BP1. In these experiments, we transfected HepG2 cells with tagged S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to show the effect of nutrient stimulation more clearly. The nutrient-induced phosphorylation of the exogenously expressed S6K1 and 4E-BP1 was weakly, but significantly, inhibited by overexpression of TRB3 (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr-389 was inhibited 28 ± 6.6%, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation on Thr-65 was inhibited 15 ± 4.5%. We also examined the effect of RNAi knockdown of TRB3 on nutrient-stimulated activation of S6K1 in HepG2 cells. Although knockdown of TRB3 enhanced basal S6K1 activity, there was no enhancement in the nutrient stimulation (Fig. 6A). This was further verified by measuring the phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate S6. Knockdown of TRB3 had no effect on the nutrient-stimulated phosphorylation of S6 (Fig. 6, B and C). There was no effect on the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 either indicating that mTOR activation was unaffected (Fig. 6D). These results suggest that nutrient stimulation of S6K1 is mediated by mTOR but"

In addition to joining the subunits together at the initiation of protein synthesis, a variety of other roles have been proposed for these bridges. These roles include transmission of signals between the functional centers of the two subunits, modulation of tRNA-ribosome and factor-ribosome interactions, and mediation of the relative movement of large and small ribosomal subunits during translocation. The majority of the bridges involve RNA-RNA interactions, and to gain insight into their function, we constructed mutations in the 23 S rRNA regions involved in forming 7 of the 12 intersubunit bridges in the Escherichia coli ribosome. The majority of the mutants were viable in strains expressing mutant rRNA exclusively but had distinct growth phenotypes, particularly at 30 °C, and the mutant ribosomes promoted a variety of miscoding errors. Analysis of subunit association activities both in vitro and in vivo indicated that, with the exception of the bridge B5 mutants, at least one mutation at each bridge site affected 70 S ribosome formation. These results confirm the structural data linking bridges with subunit-subunit interactions and, together with the effects on decoding fidelity, indicate that intersubunit bridges function at multiple stages of protein synthesis.

The majority of the bridges involve RNA-RNA interactions, and to gain insight into their function, we constructed mutations in the 23 S rRNA regions involved in forming 7 of the 12 intersubunit bridges in the Escherichia coli ribosome. The majority of the mutants were viable in strains expressing mutant rRNA exclusively but had distinct growth phenotypes, particularly at 30 °C, and the mutant ribosomes promoted a variety of miscoding errors. Analysis of subunit association activities both in vitro and in vivo indicated that, with the exception of the bridge B5 mutants, at least one mutation at each bridge site affected 70 S ribosome formation. These results confirm the structural data linking bridges with subunit-subunit interactions and, together with the effects on decoding fidelity, indicate that intersubunit bridges function at multiple stages of protein synthesis. A fundamental feature of translation systems is the existence of two unequally sized ribosomal subunits that are joined together during the initiation phase of protein synthesis to form the functional ribosome, which in turn is resolved into the component subunits in a post-termination step (1Hirokawa G. Nijman R.M. Raj V.S. Kaji H. Igarashi K. Kaji A. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 8: 1317-1328Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Analysis of bacterial 70 S ribosomes by cryoelectron microscopy showed that the 50 S and 30 S subunits are connected by a series of bridges (see Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1) (2Frank J. Zhu J.

Subsequent analyses demonstrated the existence of the same bridges in yeast cytoplasmic ribosomes (4Spahn C.M. Beckmann R. Eswar N. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Blobel G. Frank J.

Cell. 2003; 115: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), suggesting that intersubunit bridges are conserved elements of ribosome structure. Besides fulfilling the obvious role of joining and holding the small and large ribosomal subunits together in an appropriate orientation during translation, structural analyses of ribosomes in different states of the translation cycle have shown that at least some of the intersubunit bridges are dynamic in nature and move during the translocation step (6Tama F. Valle M. Frank J. Brooks C.L. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9319-9323Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, analyses of the interactions of initiation factor IF3 and ribosome recycling factor with the ribosome indicate that these factors may alter the orientation of several bridges, accounting for their effects on ribosome dissociation (7Allen G.S.

Of the 12 intersubunit bridges, only a single bridge, B1b, involves a protein-protein interaction, whereas the majority involve wholly RNA-RNA interactions or a mixture of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions (Fig. 1 and Table 1). To investigate the potential roles of intersubunit bridges in the different steps of protein synthesis, we constructed mutations of the 23 S rRNA residues involved in the formation of bridges B1a, B2b, B2c, B3, B4, B5, and B7a and examined the mutants for their effects on viability, the accuracy of translation, and subunit association. The effects of mutations in bridges B2a and B6 have been examined separately. 2M. O'Connor, unplublished observations. The majority of the mutants were viable in strains of E. coli expressing only mutant rRNA and had, at most, moderate effects on the levels of 70 S ribosomes in vivo. However, when 70 S ribosome formation was analyzed in vitro by mixing mutant 50 S subunits with wild-type 30 S subunits in the absence of any other ligands, the mutants exhibited a wide range of effects on subunit association. These results confirm the importance of bridge contacts in subunit association and suggest that the effects of rRNA mutations on 70 S ribosome formation may be masked in vivo by the binding of tRNAs, translation factors, and other ligands that help establish and maintain intersubunit contacts. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The rRNA mutations were initially constructed in plasmid pLK35, in which the rrnB operon is transcribed from the λPL promoter (13Douthwaite S. Prince J.B. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8330-8334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Strain pop2136 carries the temperature-sensitive λcI repressor, and in this strain, transcription of plasmid-encoded rRNA is repressed at 30 °C but can be induced by a temperature shift to 42 °C (14Gregory S.T. Brunelli C.A. Lodmell J.S. O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 271-281PubMed Google Scholar). This strategy allowed the construction of potentially lethal mutations. Mutant rRNAs were subsequently expressed from the P1P2 promoters in plasmid pMO12 (15O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMO12 is derived from pSC101 and is compatible with both the pACYC184-derived tRNA plasmid ptRNA67 and the lacZ and β-lactamase reporter plasmids used to monitor decoding fidelity. The Δlac ΔrecA Δ7 prrn strain (16Asai T. Zaporojets D. Squires C. Squires C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 17Cochella L. Green R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3786-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) MC315, carrying deletions of all seven chromosomal rrn operons, was used to generate strains expressing only mutant rRNA. Mutagenesis of 23 S rRNA and Selection of Mutants—Single- and multiple-base mutations in 23 S rRNA were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using the extension overlap technique (18Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). To facilitate subcloning, a KasI site was introduced into the region of the rrnB operon corresponding to h63 (see the legend to Table 1 for an explanation of the abbreviations used in this study) of 23 S rRNA. This variable region differs even between the seven rrn operons in E. coli (19Blattner F.R. Burland V. Plunkett G. II I Sofia H.J. Daniels D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The nucleotide changes that create the KasI site (T1725C and C1726G) were combined with two additional base substitutions (G1734C and A1735G) designed to maintain base pairing in this stem loop, and no differences in growth, subunit association, or miscoding were detected between this KasI mutant and wild-type rRNA. All PCR-generated fragments were initially cloned into a pLK35 derivative carrying the KasI site in h63, and the nucleotide sequences of the in vitro generated fragments were determined to ensure that no unanticipated mutations were present. Generation of strains expressing only mutant rRNA involves replacement of a plasmid carrying a wild-type rrn operon with a plasmid encoding mutant rRNA. In strain MC315, the rrnC operon is carried on a kanamycin-resistant, pSC101-derived plasmid, pCsacB7 (20Asai T. Condon C. Voulgaris J. Zaporojets D. Shen B. Al-Omar M. Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3803-3809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid also carries the counters-electable sacB gene, rendering MC315 sensitive to sucrose. Upon transformation of MC315 with pLK35-derived plasmids, the resident pCsacB7 plasmid was eliminated by growth on sucrose-containing medium (20Asai T. Condon C. Voulgaris J. Zaporojets D. Shen B. Al-Omar M. Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3803-3809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This step was usually unnecessary for pMO12 transformants because the chloramphenicol-resistant pMO12 and kanamycin-resistant pCsacB7 plasmids are both derived from pSC101 and cannot be stably maintained together in the same cell. The growth rates of strain MC315 carrying pMO12 or its mutant derivatives were determined by diluting overnight cultures into fresh 2× YT medium (10 g/liter yeast extract, 16 g/liter Tryptone, and 5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with chloramphenicol (50 mg/liter), incubating cultures with vigorous shaking at 37 °C, and monitoring subsequent growth with a Klett-Summerson colorimeter. The growth of mutant MC315 strains on solid medium was monitored at 30 and 37 °C by streaking cells on LB-agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubating for 24 and 72 h at 37 and 30 °C, respectively. Sucrose Gradient Analysis of Ribosomes—MC315 strains expressing mutant rRNA were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (50 mg/liter). Ribosomes were isolated from exponentially growing cells at A600 = 0.8–1.0. Bacteria were collected by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 16% (w/v) sucrose in 6 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl, 60 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After addition of lysozyme (final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml) and DNase I (final concentration of 50 units/ml), the suspension was lysed by five freeze-thaw cycles, and an S 30 lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The volume of the lysate was increased 2-fold with TKNM-10 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 60 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 10–40% sucrose gradient in TKNM-10 buffer, followed by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 18 h in a Beckman SW 28 rotor. Gradient fractions were collected by displacement with 60% glycerol, and the absorbance of the fractions at 260 nm was monitored with an ISCO gradient fractionator. Distribution of Mutant rRNA in 50 S Subunits, 70 S Ribosomes, and Polysomes—The rRNA mutants that were unable to support growth in the Δ7 prrn strain in the absence of wild-type rRNA were analyzed in strain DH1. This strain carries all seven intact chromosomal rrn operons and, when transformed with rrn plasmids, expresses a mixture of plasmid-encoded and chromosomally encoded rRNAs. Free 50 S and 30 S subunits, 70 S ribosomes, and polysomes were isolated by centrifugation of detergent lysates through 10–40% sucrose gradients (21Godson G.N Sinsheimer R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 149: 476-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The distribution of mutant plasmid-encoded rRNAs in these fractions was analyzed by primer extensions as described (22Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Borden A. Morgan E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and the extension products were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Preparation of 50 S and 30 S Subunits—50 S and 30 S ribosomal subunits were dissociated from tight-couple 70 S ribosomes prepared as described above by sucrose gradient centrifugation under buffer conditions that promote dissociation (1 mm MgSO4). First, cell lysates were diluted 2-fold with TKNM-10 buffer (10 mm MgSO4) and loaded onto a 15–40% sucrose gradient in TKNM-10 buffer and centrifuged at ω2t = 3.5 × 1011 in a Beckman SW 28 rotor. The 70 S fraction from the gradients was collected, followed by concentration and buffer exchange using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Mr 100,000 cutoff). The Mg2+ concentration of the TKNM-10 buffer was lowered to 1 mm (TKNM-1), and concentrated and dissociated 70 S ribosomes were loaded onto a 10–25% sucrose gradient in TKNM-1 buffer and centrifuged at ω2t = 2.7 × 1011 in a Beckman SW 28 rotor. Fractions containing 50 S and 30 S ribosomal subunits were collected and concentrated, and the buffer was changed from TKNM-1 to TKNM-10. In Vitro Reassociation Analysis of Ribosomes—70 S ribosomes were reassociated in TKNM buffer by adding 3 A260 units of purified 30 S subunits to 3 A260 units of purified 50 S subunits in a final volume of 1 ml. Parallel assays were performed for each mutant at six different MgSO4 concentrations (TKNM buffer with 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 20 mm MgSO4). Reassociation reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. 70 S ribosomes and 50 S and 30 S ribosomal subunits were fractionated by centrifugation through 10–25% sucrose gradients in TKNM buffer containing the same MgSO4 concentration as was used for the reassociation reaction. Stop Codon Readthrough and Frameshift Assays—The lacZ plasmids p400, p415, and pdnaXFSs carry UAG, UGA, and –1 frameshift mutations, respectively, in the 5′-end of the lacZ gene (23Thompson J. O'Connor M. Mills J.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Larsen B. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6842-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Δlac ΔrecA Δ7 prrn strain MC315 was used as a host for the ampicillin-resistant lacZ and pMO12-derived rRNA plasmids. β-Galactosidase activity was determined from logarithmic phase cells grown in minimal medium containing glucose (0.2%), thiamin, casamino acids, and ampicillin at 37 °C as described previously (15O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities (calculated in Miller units) supported by the mutant ribosomes were expressed relative to the levels of activity obtained with wild-type ribosomes. Missense Decoding Assays—Missense reading by the 23 S rRNA bridge mutants was analyzed using a β-lactamase missense mutant. In plasmid pKTS70G, a GGC glycine codon replaces the wild-type AGC serine codon at residue 70 of the β-lactamase gene (25O'Connor M. Gregory S.T. Dahlberg A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5750-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because a serine at position 70 is essential for β-lactamase activity, misreading of the GGC glycine codon by a serine tRNA is required to produce active enzyme. The influence of ribosomal mutants on miscoding in the β-lactamase mRNA was measured indirectly by assessing growth of ribosomal mutants carrying pKTS70G on increasing concentrations of ampicillin and determining the minimal inhibitory concentration of ampicillin for each rRNA mutant. For these experiments, cell growth was carried out in 96-well microtiter dishes using a 2-fold dilution series of ampicillin (25O'Connor M. Gregory S.T. Dahlberg A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5750-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Construction, Viability, and Growth of 23 S rRNA Bridge Mutants—The 30 S and 50 S rRNA and protein constituents of the intersubunit bridges are listed in Table 1. Mutations at 23 S rRNA positions involved in intersubunit bridges were generated by PCR mutagenesis using oligonucleotides designed to change the wild-type base to all three mutant bases. Many of the bridge connections involve pairs of adjacent nucleotides, and in most of these instances, both positions were randomized in the mutagenic oligonucleotide. Bridge B4 involves interactions between the loop end of h34 in 23 S rRNA (nucleotides 713 and 717–718) and both h20 in 16 S rRNA and ribosomal protein S15. All four bases of the h34 loop (UAAC) were randomized in this case. pLK35 plasmids carrying the rRNA mutations were maintained at 30 °C in strain pop2136 to ensure that dominant deleterious mutations were not expressed during plasmid construction. Individual plasmids were sequenced to identify the nucleotide alterations at the site of mutagenesis. Sequenced mutants were then tested for their effects on growth and viability in strain MC315, which carries deletions of all seven chromosomal rrn operons. Construction of MC315-derived strains expressing mutant rRNA exclusively involved replacement of plasmid pCsacB7 with pLK35 derivatives carrying the selected mutations. The generation of ampicillin-resistant, kanamycin-sensitive isolates among the MC315 transformants was taken as evidence that the respective mutant 23 S rRNA retained sufficient function to support protein synthesis. Conversely, the inability to displace pCsacB7 with a mutant pLK35 plasmid indicated that the mutation had disrupted critical ribosomal functions to the extent that the mutant rRNA could no longer support protein synthesis. Lethal Bridge Mutants—Upon transformation of MC315 with the mutant pLK35-derived plasmids, none appeared to have a dominant lethal effect on cell viability, and only a few mutants had recessive lethal phenotypes as judged by the inability of the mutant plasmids to displace pCsacB7. Derivatives of pLK35 in which the wild-type C1832–C1833 dinucleotide (bridge B2c) was changed to AA, AU, GA or UA were unable to eliminate pCsacB7 from MC315; only the GU and UU combinations were viable in this strain. In addition, whereas the C1836U and C1836A base changes (bridge B2b) were viable in MC315 when expressed from pLK35, the C1836G mutant was inviable. This result is consistent with the base pairing of C1836 to G1904. Only mutants supporting growth in Δ7 prrn strains were selected for further study. Two lethal mutants at C1832–C1833 (bridge B2c) and the C1836A and C1836G (bridge B2b) mutants were subsequently analyzed in strain DH1, which carries intact chromosomal rrn operons and, when transformed with rrn plasmids, expresses a mixture of mutant and wild-type rRNAs. The assembly and subunit association properties of these lethal rRNA mutants were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation of lysates from the DH1 strains, and the distribution of the mutant RNAs among 50 S subunit, 70 S ribosome, and polysome fractions was subsequently determined by primer extension analysis (22Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Borden A. Morgan E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). When analyzed by this approach, the rRNAs of functional mutants that do not affect subunit association are evenly distributed among all fractions and account for ∼50% of the rRNA (15O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ribosome profiles of the C1832A/C1833A mutant (B2c) resembled those shown in Fig. 3C, where the amount of free subunits was greatly increased, and the peak height of the 50 S fraction approached that of the 70 S fraction. Primer extensions showed that the mutant rRNA accounted for 67% of the rRNA in the 50 S fraction, whereas only 12 and 6% mutant rRNA were present in the 70 S and polysome fractions, respectively. The ribosome profiles of the C1832A/C1833U mutant differed only slightly from those of the wild type, showing only slightly elevated amounts of free subunits. However, the mutant rRNAs were again selectively excluded from the 70 S and polysome fractions, and the mutant rRNAs accounted for 44, 10, and 3% of the rRNAs in the 50 S, 70 S, and polysome pools, respectively. Thus, in both lethal C1832/C1833 bridge B2c mutants analyzed, the mutant rRNA is selectively excluded from the functional 70 S and polysome pools, consistent with a defect in subunit joining. The lack of substantial enrichment of the mutant rRNAs in the 50 S pools and the absence of a greatly increased 50 S peak in the C1832A/C1833U mutant relative to the C1832A/C1833A mutant suggest that there may be additional defects in processing or assembly associated with this bridge B2c mutant. The ribosome profiles of the C1836G mutant (B2b) resembled those in Fig. 3C, where the amount of free subunits was substantially elevated. Less severe effects were exhibited by the viable C1836A mutant; in this case, the amount of free 50 S subunits was only mildly increased. The mutant rRNA accounted for 51% of the rRNA in the 50 S fraction from the lethal C1836G mutant, whereas only 13 and 3% mutant rRNA were present in the 70 S and polysome pools, respectively. In the viable C1836A mutant, the mutant rRNA accounted for 42% of the 50 S fraction, whereas 13 and 14% were found in the 70 S and polysome pools, respectively. Although the mutant rRNA is excluded from the 70 S and polysome pools in both C1836 mutants in bridge B2b, consistent with an effect of the mutation on subunit association, the effect is more severe in the inviable mutant. To facilitate subsequent analyses with lacZ and β-lactamase reporter gene constructs, the 23 S rRNA mutants supporting growth in strain MC315 were also constructed in the low copy number, chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid pMO12, which carries the rrnB operon under the control of the native P1P2 promoters. MC315 strains expressing only mutant 23 S rRNAs were generated by transforming MC315 with the pMO12 plasmids and isolating kanamycin-sensitive, chloramphenicol-resistant derivatives. Most of mutants that were viable when the rRNA was expressed from pLK35 were also viable when it was expressed from pMO12 plasmids. However, kanamycin-sensitive MC315 strains expressing the C1836A (B2b) and C1832G/C1833U (B2c) mutant rRNAs from pMO12 plasmids were unstable during subculture, exhibited very slow erratic growth (∼2-h doubling time), and were excluded from further analysis. It should be noted that these mutants did not exhibit remarkably slow growth in strain MC315 when expressed in plasmid pLK35. This discrepancy can perhaps be explained by the higher copy number of plasmid pLK35, which may allow increased expression of the mutant rRNAs to compensate for the suboptimal function of mutant ribosomes. A similar compensation of suboptimal function by increased ribosome concentration has been observed with mutations in ribosomal proteins S4 and S12 (26Mikkola R. Kurland C.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Viable Bridge Mutants—The doubling time of MC315 carrying the wild-type rrnB plasmid pMO12 was 48 min in rich liquid medium, and the doubling times of viable mutants varied between 50 and 71 min (Table 2). The most prominent effects on generation times were caused by the bridge B3 mutants C1947A, C1947U, and A1960G (doubling times of 64, 63, and 71 min, respectively); the bridge B2b mutant A1932U (doubling time of 65 min); the bridge B7a mutants G1849U and G1896U (doubling times of 63 and 65 min, respectively); and the bridge B2c mutant C1832U/C1833U (doubling time 65 min) (Table 2). Thus, mutations at each of the bridges had detectable effects on cell growth, indicating the importance of each of these regions for ribosome function.TABLE 2Effects of 23 S rRNA mutations on doubling time and growth on solid medium23 S rRNA positionDoubling timeGrowth on solid medium37 °C30 °CminWild-type48 ± 1++++++Bridge B1aΔ883-885/891-89353 ± 1++++Bridge B2bC1836ANDNDNDC1836U57 ± 6+++-A1932U65 ± 1+++-Bridge B2cC1832G/C1833UNDNDNDC1832U/C1833U65 ± 1+++-C1832G/C1833U/G1972A/G1973C54 ± 2+++++C1832U/C1833U/G1972A/G1973A59 ± 5++++++Bridge B3C1947A64 ± 3+++-C1947G58 ± 3++++C1947U63 ± 2+++-A1960C49 ± 1++++A1960G71 ± 1+++++A1960U55 ± 1++++++C1947A/G1959U75 ± 2++++A1960G/U1946CNDNDNDBridge B4UAAC(loop 715)AUCU55 ± 1++++UAAC(loop 715)CCUC57 ± 2+++++UAAC(loop 715)UUGU54 ± 2+++++UAAC(loop 715)GCAC58 ± 1+++++Bridge B5C1768U/U1769G50 ± 1++++++G1989A51 ± 3++++++G1989U62 ± 3++++++Bridge B7aA1848C48 ± 2+++++A1848G51 ± 2+++-A1848U59 ± 1+++-G1849U63 ± 2+++-G1896C50 ± 3++++++G1896U65 ± 3+++++ Open table in a new tab Growth of the mutants was also analyzed on solid medium at both 30 and 37 °C (Table 2). Although all of the mutants had grown after overnight incubation at 37 °C, most mutants exhibited substantial growth defects at 30 °C. In general, mutants that had increased generation times in liquid medium at 37 °C grew poorly on solid medium at 30 °C. However, some rare mutants, including A1960C (B3) and A1848G (B7a), which had doubling times close to that of the wild type at 37 °C, failed to grow at the lower temperature. Conversely, the A1960G mutant (B3), which had one of the longest generation times at 37 °C in liquid medium, showed only modestly retarded growth at 30 °C. Incubation at 30 °C affected the growth of three of the four bridge B4 mutants only slightly, and no cold sensitivity was detected in any of the bridge B5 mutants. It should b"

Here we present calculations that show how past high-eccentricity orbits can account for the moment differences, represented by the low-order lunar gravity field and libration parameters. One of our solutions is that the Moon may have once been in a 3:2 resonance of orbit period to spin period, similar to Mercury's present state. The possibility of past high-eccentricity orbits suggests a rich dynamical history and may influence our understanding of the early thermal evolution of the Moon."
https://openalex.org/W2111130857,"Parkinson disease is characterized by the selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra. Long term epidemiological studies have implicated exposure to agricultural pesticides as a significant risk factor. Systemic administration of rotenone, a widely used pesticide, causes selective degeneration of nigral DA neurons and Parkinson disease-like symptoms in rats. Our previous study has shown that the microtubule depolymerizing activity of rotenone plays a critical role in its selective toxicity on DA neurons. Rotenone toxicity is mimicked by the microtubule-depolymerizing drug colchicine and attenuated by the microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol. Here we show that nerve growth factor (NGF) significantly reduced rotenone toxicity on TH+ neurons in midbrain neuronal cultures. The protective effect of NGF was completely abolished by inhibiting the microtubule-associated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and partially reversed by blocking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In addition, NGF decreased colchicine toxicity on TH+ neurons in a manner dependent on MEK but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The protective effect of NGF against rotenone toxicity was occluded by the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol. In a MEK-dependent manner, NGF significantly attenuated rotenone- or colchicine-induced microtubule depolymerization and ensuing accumulation of vesicles in the soma and elevation in protein carbonyls. Moreover, other neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor also reduced rotenone- or colchicine-induced microtubule depolymerization and death of TH+ through a MEK-dependent mechanism. Thus, our results suggest that neurotrophic factors activate the microtubule-associated protein kinase pathway to stabilize microtubules, and this action significantly attenuates rotenone toxicity on dopaminergic neurons.

Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). The most prevalent form of PD occurs sporadically, with no obvious inheritance pattern. A large number of epidemiological studies (2Langston J.W. Neurotoxicology. 2002; 23: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), especially those performed on twins (3Tanner C.M. Ottman R. Goldman S.M. Ellenberg J. Chan P. Mayeux R. Langston J.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 281: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), have demonstrated strong association of environmental factors to PD. The concordance rates are virtually identical in monozygotic and dizygotic twins with age at onset older than 50. However, in PD twin pairs with age at onset younger than 50, the concordance rate in monozygotic twins (100%) is significantly higher than that in dizygotic twins (17%) (3Tanner C.M. Ottman R. Goldman S.M. Ellenberg J. Chan P. Mayeux R. Langston J.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 281: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The study provides very clear evidence that the common, sporadic forms of late onset PD are highly influenced by environmental factors, whereas the early onset forms of Parkinson disease have a strong genetic influence. Among the environmental factors studied, exposure to pesticides and herbicides has been found to be a significant risk factor for PD (4Di Monte D.A. Lancet Neurol. 2003; 2: 531-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that, rotenone, a wildly used natural pesticide, induces PD-like symptoms and selective neurodegeneration in animals (5Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G.

Williams G.R. Hollunger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 418-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rotenone is also a strong microtubule-depolymerizing agent (8Marshall L.E. Himes R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 543: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It depolymerizes purified microtubules in vitro, as well as microtubules in the cell (8Marshall L.E. Himes R.H.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our previous study has shown that TH+ neurons in midbrain neuronal cultures are much more vulnerable than TH- neurons to the toxicity of microtubule-depolymerizing agents such as rotenone, colchicine, and nocodazole (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Microtubule depolymerization abolishes vesicle transport and results in vesicle accumulation in the soma. Leakage of dopamine from the vesicles significantly increases dopamine oxidation in the cytosol, which appears to trigger the selective death of dopaminergic neurons (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, the microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol significantly attenuates the selective toxicity of rotenone on TH+ neurons (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, microtubule stabilization appears to be a promising strategy to protect DA neurons from environmental PD toxins such as rotenone. Neurotrophic factors include neurotrophins, glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands and neurokines (11Markus A. Patel T.D. Snider W.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Sariola H. Saarma M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The neurotrophin family, which consists of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5, exert their diverse actions in the nervous system through interaction with the common neurotrophin receptor p75 and the ligand-specific Trk family receptor tyrosine kinases (13Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The GDNF family ligands include GDNF, artemin, neurturin, and persephin. They share the receptor tyrosine kinase RET as their common signaling receptor and utilize different ligand-binding subunits (GFRα1 through GFRα4) that are selective for each GDNF family ligand (12Sariola H. Saarma M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Neurotrophic factors such as NGF, BDNF, and GDNF, as well as their receptors have been localized by immunocytochemistry studies in dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra (14Nishio T. Furukawa S. Akiguchi I. Sunohara N. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2847-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Chauhan N.B. Siegel G.J. Lee J.M. J. Chem.

Brain Res. 1998; 792: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting both autocrine and paracrine functions for these neurotrophic factors. A variety of studies in cell cultures and animal models have shown that these neurotrophic factors effectively protect against the degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons induced by PD toxins such as MPTP or 6-hydroxydopamine (17Siegel G.J. Chauhan N.B. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 18Kirik D. Georgievska B. Bjorklund A. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that neurotrophic factors such as NGF, BDNF, and GDNF attenuated the selective toxicity of rotenone against cultured midbrain TH+ neurons. The ability of these neurotrophic factors to activate the MAP kinase pathway appears to be critical for microtubule stabilization and attenuation of rotenone toxicity on DA neurons. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ERK1/2 and Thr202/Tyr204 phosphorylated ERK1/2 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The neutralizing antibody against p75NTR (192-IgG) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-TH was from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Mouse anti-NeuN was from Chemicon (Temecula. CA). Mouse anti-HA was from Roche Applied Science. Mouse antibodies against α-tubulin and synaptophysin were from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Invitrogen. Preparation of Midbrain Cultures—Midbrain neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 17 fetuses of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) as previously described (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, ventral mesencephalons were meticulously dissected and free of meninges in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Midbrain cells were dissociated by digestion in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequent addition of DNaseI (Roche Applied Science) to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The cells were then incubated at room temperature for another 5 min, followed by the addition of seeding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) and gentle trituration. After the cells were pelleted at 200 g for 5 min, they were resuspended in seeding medium and placed onto poly-d-lysine-coated (Sigma) wells or coverslips in multi-well plates at a density of 0.5-2 × 105 cells/cm2. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and maintained in neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 and 0.5 mm glutamine. Cytosine arabinoside (2.5 μm) was added to culture medium from the fourth day to inhibit glia growth, and the medium was half-changed every 4-5 days. Drug Treatments and Transfection of Plasmid DNA—Rotenone was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human β-NGF (NGF) was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). 2′-Amino-3′-methoxyflavone (PD98059), 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio] butadiene (U0126), wortmannin, 2-[4-morpholinyl]-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), myristoylated protein kinase A inhibitor 14-22 Amide (myr-PKI), and cpt-cAMP were purchased from EMD Biosciences Inc. (San Diego, CA). 1-[6-[((17β)-3-Methoxyestra-1,3,5 (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)-trien-17-yl)amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122) and K252a were from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). All of the drugs were made as 1000× stocks in water, except for rotenone, PD98059, U0126, wortmannin, K252a, and U73122, which were made as 1000× stocks in Me2SO (Sigma). All of the 1000× stocks were diluted to 10× stocks with culture medium immediately before addition to the neuronal cultures maintained in vitro for 14 days. All of the inhibitors were added 30 min before the primary treatment and were present for the whole duration of the primary treatment. Plasmid constructs for HA-tagged wild type MEK1 (wt-MEK) and dominant-negative MEK1 (K97M mutant) (dn-MEK) were described before (19Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). At 10-12 days in vitro, midbrain neuronal cultures were transfected with 1.6 μg of plasmid DNA/well in 12-well plates, using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequent treatments were performed 48 h after transfection. Quantification of Cell Death and Microtubules Depolymerization—Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously described (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For quantification of cell death, at least five coverslips from independent experiments were examined for each condition. All of the TH+ neurons on a coverslip (100-200) were counted, together with a random selection of 120-250 TH- neurons. For quantification of microtubules depolymerization, the midbrain neurons were cultured at low density (50,000 cells/cm2) to allow clear visualization of microtubules in TH+ neurons. At least 10 coverslips from independent experiments were examined for each condition. All of the TH+ neurons (20-30 neurons) were counted for each coverslip. The fluorescence images were acquired on a confocal microscope from Bio-Rad. Monochrome images (512 × 512 pixels) were pseudocolored and merged with the software NIH Image J. All of the error bars represented standard errors, and Student's t tests were used for statistical analysis. Determination of ERK Activation—At 14 days in vitro, midbrain cultures initially seeded at 2 × 105/cm2 in 3.5-cm dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with cold-buffer T (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) for 20 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-ERK and antiphospho-ERK antibodies, respectively. Quantification of Synaptophysin Intensity—Immunocytochemistry and quantification was performed as previously described using NIH Image J (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The contour of the soma was drawn manually. The degree of synaptophysin accumulation in the cell body was calculated by dividing the intensity of background-subtracted signal within the border by its area. At least 10 randomly selected TH+ neurons were analyzed from each coverslip, which contained ∼20-30 TH+ neurons. At least three coverslips were used for each treatment. Measurement of Free or Polymerized Tubulin in the Cell—Free or polymerized tubulin from midbrain neuronal cultures was extracted as described previously (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, midbrain neuronal cultures maintained in 3.5-cm dishes in vitro for 14 days were washed twice at 37 °C with 1 ml of Buffer A containing 0.1 m MES (pH 6.75), 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 4 m glycerol. After the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 600 μl of free tubulin extraction buffer (Buffer A plus 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors), the extracts were centrifuged at 37 °C for 2 min at 16000 × g. The supernatant fractions contained free tubulin extracted from the cytosol. The pellet fraction and lysed cells in the culture dish were dissolved in 600 μl of 25 mm Tris (pH 6.8) plus 0.5% SDS and contained tubulin originally in microtubules. Equal amounts of total proteins from free or polymerized tubulin fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-α-tubulin antibody. The intensity of tubulin bands was quantified from three different experiments with the software NIH Image. Measurement of Protein Carbonyls—After treatments, midbrain neuronal cultures were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold lysis buffer (0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40, 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m EDTA, and 0.1 m Na3VO4). Protein carbonyls were measured with the Oxyblot protein oxidation detection kit (Chemicon) as described before (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Intensities of the dots were quantified with NIH Image J by measuring signals in a preset circle of the same size. NGF Attenuates the Selective Toxicity of Rotenone on TH+ Neurons in Midbrain Neuronal Cultures—Our previous study has shown that rotenone exhibited much greater toxicity on TH+ neurons than TH- neurons in midbrain neuronal cultures (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To identify neuroprotective agents against this environmental PD toxin, we treated rat embryonic midbrain neuronal cultures maintained in vitro for 14 days with rotenone (100 nm for 12 h) and NGF (100 ng/ml for 12.5 h, added 0.5 h before rotenone). Fixed cultures were co-stained for TH (green), the neuronal nuclear marker NeuN (blue), and TUNEL (red, for detection of apoptosis). Rotenone-induced selective death of TH+ neurons (Fig. 1, B versus A) was markedly reduced by co-application of NGF (Fig. 1C). The protective effect of NGF was observed for various concentrations of rotenone (Fig. 1D). In addition, NGF attenuated rotenone toxicity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). Because the protective effect of NGF against rotenone (100 nm) reached a plateau at ∼100 ng/ml, we used this condition for subsequent experiments. To investigate which NGF receptor is involved in the protective effect, we used the selective TrkA inhibitor K252a (400 nm) and the p75NTR neutralizing antibody 192-IgG (1:500). As shown in Fig. 1F, the protective effect of NGF was completely reversed by K252a (p > 0.70 versus rotenone alone, n = 3) but was not significantly altered by the antibody against p75NTR (p > 0.50, versus rotenone plus NGF, n = 3). Neither K252a nor p75NTR antibody per se had any significant toxicity on TH+ neurons. The Protective Effect of NGF against Rotenone Toxicity Is Dependent on MEK and Partially on PI 3-Kinase—To study the mechanism by which NGF protects against rotenone toxicity on TH+ neurons, we examined the involvement of the MAP kinase pathway, which is potently activated by neurotrophic factors such as NGF (11Markus A. Patel T.D. Snider W.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Sariola H. Saarma M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Midbrain neuronal cultures were treated with rotenone (100 nm for 12 h), NGF (100 ng/ml for 12.5 h, added 0.5 h before rotenone), and PD98059 (20 μm for 13 h, added 1 h before rotenone). The selective MEK inhibitor PD98059 completely abolished the protective effect of NGF (Fig. 2, A and E). Another specific MEK inhibitor, U0126 (20 μm for 13 h), also totally eliminated the protective effect of NGF (Fig. 2E). To substantiate the dependence of MEK in the protective effect of NGF against rotenone, we transfected midbrain neuronal cultures with HA-tagged wild type MEK1 or a dominant-negative MEK1 mutant (K97M), which blocks the activation of endogenous MEK1 (19Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the cultures were treated with rotenone and NGF in the same manner. Overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant (Fig. 2D), but not the wild type MEK1 (Fig. 2C), completely abrogated the protective effect of NGF (Fig. 2, C-E). Thus, inhibition of MEK by pharmacological blockers or dominant-negative protein had the same consequence, which suggests that the protective effect of NGF is dependent on the activation of MEK. We also examined the involvement of other signaling pathways activated by NGF, such as PI 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), or protein kinase A (PKA). As shown Fig. 2E, PI 3-kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin (0.5 μm) and LY294002 (20 μm) partially reversed the protective effect of NGF, whereas PLCγ inhibitor U73122 (1 μm), PKA activator cpt-cAMP (50 μm), or PKA inhibitor myr-PKI (1 μm) did not significantly change the effect of NGF. These results suggest that in addition to the MAP kinase pathway, activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway by NGF also contributes partially to its protective effect against rotenone toxicity. None of the above inhibitors or MEK expression constructs had any significant toxicity on TH+ neurons (p > 0.50 versus vehicle, n = 5), nor did they significantly change the toxicity of rotenone (p > 0.10 versus rotenone alone, n = 6). To show that NGF indeed induced MAP kinase activation, we treated midbrain neuronal cultures with NGF (100 ng/ml) for various durations and analyzed the total cell lysates by Western blotting with anti-phospho-ERK, which recognizes activated ERK1/2 or anti-ERK, which recognize total ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 2F, NGF induced rapid and transient activation of ERK1/2. This effect was almost completely blocked by MEK inhibitors such as PD98059 or U0126 (Fig. 2G). When applied alone, both MEK inhibitors lowered the basal level of ERK activation (Fig. 2G). Our previous study has shown that the selective toxicity of rotenone on TH+ neurons is contributed by both complex I inhibition and microtubule depolymerization (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To assess whether NGF attenuates toxicity caused by complex I inhibition, we used amytal, a pure complex inhibitor without any significant effect on microtubules (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2H, NGF significantly reduced amytal toxicity on TH+ neurons. The protective effect of NGF was almost completely reversed by PI 3-kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002 but not significantly affected by MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. Thus, the protective effect of NGF against complex I inhibition by amytal or rotenone may be mediated by activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway, whereas toxicity induced by the microtubule depolymerizing activity of rotenone may be mitigated by activation of the MAP kinase cascade. NGF Attenuates the Selective Toxicity of Colchicine on TH+ Neurons in a MEK-dependent Manner—Our previous study has shown that, like rotenone, the microtubule-depolymerizing agent colchicine also selectively kills TH+ neurons in midbrain neuronal cultures (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To examine whether NGF attenuates the selective toxicity of colchicine, we treated midbrain neuronal cultures with colchicine (10 μm for 12 h) in the absence or presence of NGF (100 ng/ml for 12.5 h, added 0.5 h before colchicine). Co-application of NGF markedly reduced the selective toxicity of colchicine on TH+ neurons (Fig. 3, C versus B). This effect was completely blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 or U0126 (both at 20 μm for 13 h, added 1 h before colchicine) (Fig. 3, D and G). To confirm these results, we transfected midbrain neuronal cultures with HA-tagged wild type or dominant-negative MEK1 and treated the cultures with colchicine and NGF in the same manner. Overexpression of the dominant-negative MEK1, but not the wild type, completely reversed the protective effect of NGF (Fig. 3, E-G). Furthermore, the protective effect of NGF against colchicine was not significantly affected by PI 3-kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002, PLCγ inhibitor U73122, PKA activator cpt-cAMP, or PKA inhibitor myr-PKA (Fig. 3G). None of these inhibitors or MEK constructs significantly changed the toxicity of colchicine on TH+ neurons (p > 0.80, n = 6). Together, these results indicate that NGF attenuates the selective toxicity of colchicine on TH+ neurons, and the effect is dependent on MEK. The Protective Effect of NGF against Rotenone Toxicity Is Occluded by the Microtubule-stabilizing Drug Taxol—The ability of NGF to protect against the selective toxicity of both rotenone and colchicine suggests that it is acting on microtubules, which play a critical role in the survival of dopaminergic neurons (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol significantly attenuates the selective toxicity of rotenone and completely eliminated the selective toxicity of colchicine (10Ren Y. Liu W. Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34105-34112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we compared the protective effects of NGF, taxol, and their combination against rotenone-induced death of TH+ neurons. Midbrain neuronal cultures were treated for 12 h with rotenone (100 nm), rotenone plus NGF (100 ng/ml, added 0.5 h before rotenone), rotenone plus taxol (10 μm, added 0.5 h before rotenone), and rotenone and NGF plus taxol (both added 0.5 h before rotenone). The protective effect of NGF (27.8 ± 1.2%) was significantly better than that of taxol (36.8 ± 1.7%, p < 0.05, n = 6; Fig. 4F), suggesting that other mechanisms in addition to microtubule stabilization (e.g. PI 3-kinase) are involved in the protective effect of NGF against rotenone toxicity. On the other hand, the protective effect of NGF (27.8 ± 1.2%) was not significantly enhanced by the addition of taxol (24.4 ± 1.6%, p > 0.05, n = 6). The occlusive effects of NGF and taxol suggest that they are acting on the same target in the cell. NGF Attenuates Rotenone- or Colchicine-induced Microtubule Depolymerization in a MEK-dependent Manner—The ability of NGF to protect against the selective toxicity of rotenone or colchicine, as well as the occlusion of the protective effects of NGF and taxol, suggests that NGF is"

The alternatively spliced C termini (CT) of mGluRs1&5are known to be critical for regulating receptor activity and to terminate in motifs suggestive of potential interactions with PDZ domains. We therefore screened the CTs of both mGluR1a and mGluR5 against a PDZ domain proteomic array. Out of 96 PDZ domains examined, the domain that bound most strongly to mGluR5-CT was the second PDZ domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF-2). This interaction was confirmed by reverse overlay, and a single point mutation to the mGluR5-CT was found to completely disrupt the interaction. Full-length mGluR5 robustly associated with full-length NHERF-2 in cells, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy experiments. In contrast, mGluR1a was found to bind NHERF-2 in vitro with a weaker affinity than mGluR5, and furthermore mGluR1a did not detectably associate with NHERF-2 in a cellular context. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that NHERF-2 and mGluR5 exhibit overlapping patterns of expression in mouse brain, being found most abundantly in astrocytic processes and postsynaptic neuronal elements. In functional experiments, the interaction of NHERF-2 with mGluR5 in cells was found to prolong mGluR5-mediated calcium mobilization and to also potentiate mGluR5-mediated cell death, whereas coexpression of mGluR1a with NHERF-2 had no evident effects on mGluR1a functional activity.

Many of the physiological effects of l-glutamate as a neurotransmitter are mediated via stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), 2The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; PDZ, PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology; NHERF, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-phosphate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CT, C terminus; WT, wild-type; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NHERF, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2. 2The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; PDZ, PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology; NHERF, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-phosphate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CT, C terminus; WT, wild-type; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NHERF, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2. which are considered to be important therapeutic targets in the potential treatment of a number of different diseases (1Bear M.F. Huber K.M. Warren S.T. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 370-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 2Kew J.N. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 104: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Moghaddam B. Psychopharmacology (Berl). 2004; 174: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The mGluRs are G protein-coupled receptors that regulate the physiology of neurons and glia through activation of various secondary messenger systems (4Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2705) Google Scholar). Eight subtypes of mGluRs have been identified and classified into three groups (I, II, III) based on sequence homology, signaling pathways and pharmacological selectivity. The various mGluR subtypes are known to display differential regional and cellular distributions throughout the mammalian brain (4Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2705) Google Scholar).Activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) leads to signal transduction primarily through coupling to Gq and phospholipase C, which then hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to form the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-phosphate (IP3). IP3 binding to its receptor in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum causes release of free Ca2+ in the cytosol, which generates a signaling cascade. Group I mGluRs can also couple to other signaling pathways in a cell type-specific manner (5Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 465-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Despite many similarities in their signaling pathways, mGluR1 and mGluR5 expressed in the same neuronal populations sometimes exert quite distinct physiological effects (6Valenti O. Conn P.J. Marino M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These two receptors possess 60% sequence identity and differ mainly in their long intracellular C termini (CT). Functional differences between mGluR1 and mGluR5 might be explained by specific interactions of their CTs with cytoplasmic binding partners. For example, mGluR1 and mGluR5 splice variants, which differ only in their CT regions, display different constitutive activities: in contrast to the short forms (mGluR1b, -1c, and -1d), the long forms of group I mGluRs (mGluR1a, -5a, and -5b) display significant constitutive activity in the absence of agonist (7Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This constitutive activity can be reduced by interaction of the CTs with members of the Homer family of proteins (8Ango F. Prezeau L. Muller T. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Worley P.F. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Fagni L. Nature. 2001; 411: 962-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Homer proteins have also been shown to play a role in the targeting and trafficking of group I mGluRs (9Fagni L. Ango F. Perroy J. Bockaert J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).A role in the regulation of the trafficking of group I mGluRs has also been proposed for several proteins possessing PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/ZO-1 homology) domains. PDZ domains are modular protein interaction domains that bind to short CT peptides in a sequence-specific manner. Based on the sequences of their preferred binding motifs, PDZ domains are divided into three broad classes (10Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The long forms of group I mGluRs possess motifs appropriate for interaction with Class I PDZ domains. PDZ proteins are often involved in the assembly of supramolecular complexes that perform localized signaling functions at particular subcellular locations (11Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Formation of such molecular complexes might conceivably contribute to the importance of the mGluR1 and mGluR5 C termini in regulating receptor activity. To date, two PDZ proteins, tamalin/GRASP and Shank3, have been reported to interact with group I mGluRs, but these proteins do not distinguish between mGluR1 and mGluR5, and moreover no effects of these interactions on receptor signaling have been definitively established (12Tu J.C. Xiao B. Naisbitt S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Brakeman P. Doan A. Aakalu V.K. Lanahan A.A. Sheng M. Worley P.F.

Using a proteomic approach screening 96 known or putative Class I PDZ domains, we identified a novel interaction between mGluR5 and the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF-2). In contrast to the robust association observed with mGluR5, NHERF-2 was found to bind only weakly to mGluR1 in vitro and did not detectably associate with mGluR1 in cells. The NHERF-2 interaction with mGluR5 was found to prolong mGluR5-mediated calcium signaling and enhance mGluR5-induced cell death, revealing functionally important consequences for this interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of Fusion ProteinsWild type (WT) and mutant GST-tagged mGluR-CT constructs were created by PCR using mutant sequence oligonucleotides (mGluR1a: 5′oligo, 5′-AGACACGAATTCGTCCTCTGCACCCCTCCAAATGTA-3′, 3′ oligo, 5′-AGACACCTCGAGCTACAGGGTGGAAGAGCTTTGCTT-3′; mGluR5: 5′oligo for all constructs, 5′-GAATTCGCCCTCTGCATCCCATCCTCTCCC-3′, 3′ oligo for SSSL (WT), 5′-AGACACCTCGAGTCACAACGATGAAGAACTCTGCGT-3′, 3′ oligo for SSSA, 5′-AGACACCTCGAGTCACGCCGATGAAGAACTCTGCGT-3′, 3′ oligo for SSAL, 5′-AGACACCTCGAGTCACAACGCTGAAGAACTCTGCGT-3′, 3′ oligo for SASL, 5′-AGACACCTCGAGTCACAACGACGCAGAACTCTGCGT-3′, and 3′oligo for ASSL, 5′-AGACACCTCGAGTCACAACGATGACGCACTCTGCGT-3′) and inserting the PCR products digested with EcoR1 and XhoI into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs were confirmed by ABI sequencing.His6- and S-tagged fusion proteins were obtained by bacterial expression of constructs in the pET-30A vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), while GST-tagged fusion proteins were created via bacterial expression of constructs in the vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). His-tagged fusion proteins were purified using ProBond nickel resin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and GST-tagged fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Fusion proteins were eluted from the resin according to the manufacturer's instructions and the protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein assay.Screening of the PDZ Domain Proteomic ArrayTo identify novel PDZ domains interacting with group I mGluRs, we screened the type I PDZ domain array as previously described (14Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F. Smith Y. Yun C.C. Hall R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15He J.

Briefly, the purified His- and S-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins were spotted at 1 μg per bin onto Nytran SuperCharge 96-grid nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell BioScience, Keene, NH). The membranes were allowed to dry overnight and then blocked in “blot buffer” (2% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween-20, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The mGluR1a or mGluR5-CT fusion proteins, corresponding to the last 25 amino acids of the receptors (100 nm in blot buffer), were then overlaid onto the membranes containing the array of PDZ domains. Side-by-side control experiments were always performed overlaying GST alone to assess the nonspecific background binding. After incubation with the GST fusion proteins for 1 h, the membranes were washed five times with 10 ml of blot buffer, and then incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences). After a 1-h incubation, the membranes were washed five times with blot buffer, and the binding of the GST fusion proteins was visualized via enzyme-linked chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Culture and TransfectionHEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PenStrep) in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. C6 glioma cells were maintained DMEM supplemented with 10% non-heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% PenStrep. Cells were split every 3-4 days. For HEK-293 cell transfections, cells were split onto 100-mm plates, grown to 80-90% confluency and transfected with the appropriate cDNA using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). C6 cells were nucleofected following the manufacturer's recommendations (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). For each transfection, 2 μg of plasmid cDNA for each construct was used. The cDNAs used were rat Flag-mGluR1a in pcDNA1 (kindly provided by Stephen Ferguson, University of Western Ontario), rat mGluR5a (kindly provided by Jean-Philippe Pin, Institut de Genomique Fonctionnelle), Flag-mGluR5a, L1171A mutant mGluR5a, Flag-L1171A, and Myc-Homer3 (kindly provided by Paul Worley, Johns Hopkins) in pRK5, human FLAG-NHERF-2 and HA-NHERF2 in pBK, human GFP-NHERF-2 in pGFP, empty pBK and pRK5 vectors. L1171A constructs were designed and created by using the QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) instructions with the following primers: 5′ oligo, CAGAGTTCTTCATCGGCGTGAGCCACTGGAAA-3′ and 3′ oligo, 5′-TTTCCAGTGGCTCACGCCGATGAAGAACTCTG-3′ and verified by ABI sequencing.Blot Overlay Assays, Immunoprecipitation, and Western BlottingBlot overlay assays, immunoprecipitation experiments, and Western blotting were performed as previously described (16Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For overlay experiments, 1 μg of purified protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and overlaid with His-NHERF-2. Affinity estimates were generated in saturation binding assays utilizing increasing concentrations of overlaid NHERF-2 and quantification of binding at each concentration by densitometric scanning of immunoreactive bands. The amount of protein loading in all experiments was assessed by Coomassie staining. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed without cross-linking and using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or anti-HA.11 affinity matrix (Covance, Princeton, NJ) for studies on transfected cells. For immunoprecipitation experiments utilizing mouse brain tissue, 1 μg of anti-NHERF-2 antibody (17Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) or rabbit normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used per sample in conjunction with protein A/G-agarose (Calbiochem). Mouse brain tissue was solubilized with a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.2% sodium deoxycholate. To detect endogenous and/or transfected mGluR1a, mGluR5, Myc-Homer3, and NHERF-2 on Western blots, the antibodies used were polyclonal rabbit anti-mGluR1a (1:2,500, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), polyclonal rabbit anti-mGluR5 (1:4,000, Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA), monoclonal anti-Myc (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-NHERF-2 (1:7,000) (17Yun C.H.

After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were washed with D-PBS/Ca2+ (Invitrogen), blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH), and permeablized for 30 min with 0.3% Triton X-100 (TX, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH). Then, the cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (mouse M2 anti-FLAG (1:400, Sigma) and rabbit anti-NHERF-2 (1:3,500)) in 0.3%TX/2% bovine serum albumin/D-PBS/Ca2+. Following washes with 0.3%TX/2% bovine serum albumin/D-PBS/Ca2+, the cells were incubated with donkey rhodamine anti-mouse and FITC antirabbit (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). As controls, primary antibodies were omitted in parallel incubations. After washes with D-PBS/Ca2+, the cells were dehydrated with 70% ethanol, and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and coverslips. Microscopy slides were sealed with nail polish and stored in the dark at 4 °C until examination with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with 515-540 nm and 575-640 nm bandpass emission filters for FITC and rhodamine, respectively. The micrographs were taken with a ×63 objective.Electron Microscopy—To visualize immunostaining for mGluR5 and NHERF-2 in native brain tissue, C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by perfusion with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Brain sections were then prepared and processed for pre-embedding immunoperoxidase labeling as previously described (18Paquet M. Kuwajima M. Yun C.C. Smith Y. Hall R.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 494: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60-μm thick sections were incubated with rabbit anti-mGluR5 (1:2,000) or rabbit anti-NHERF-2 (1:7,000) followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit (1:200, Vector Laboratories Burlingame, CA), rinsed and then incubated with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (1:200, Vector Laboratories). The antibody complex was visualized following incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) and hydrogen peroxide. The sections were then processed for electron microscopy by osmification, dehydration and embedding into epoxy resin. Samples of cerebral cortex were taken, cut into 60-nm ultrathin sections, collected on copper grids, counterstained and examined with a Zeiss EM-10C electron microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.) The micrographs were acquired with a CCD camera (DualView 300W; Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) controlled by DigitalMicrograph software (version 3.8.1; Gatan, Inc.). Micrographs were adjusted only for brightness and contrast, with the image resolution kept constant, with Photoshop software (version 7.0; Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA) to optimize the quality of the images.Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Release AssayCell death following HEK-293 cell transfection was measured using a CytoTox96 Non-reactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Briefly, HEK-293 cells were plated and grown onto 12-well plates until 80-90% confluency was reached. Four wells were transfected with the same cDNA:lipid mix of Lipofectamine reagent in DMEM in the presence or absence of the antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP, Tocris Cookson, Ballwin, MO). After 4 h, DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and PenStrep was added to the transfected cells. Forty-four hours later, samples of media were collected from the first three wells, and after briefly washing the cells with D-PBS, the cells were harvested with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer to verify protein expression by Western blotting. The cells in the last well were lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle, and a sample from the media was collected to assess maximum LDH activity. Samples were centrifuged at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and 50-μl aliquots in triplicate were transferred to a 96-well plate. Triplicate aliquots of culture media were also plated to correct for phenol red and endogenous LDH activity in the serum used. Then, the aliquots of samples were incubated with reconstituted substrate mix (INT, a tetrazolium salt) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 1 m acetic acid, and the red formazan product because of the conversion of the substrate by LDH enzyme was quantified by measuring absorbance at 490 nm. After subtraction of the background values of the culture media, the percentage of total LDH release was calculated as 100 × (mean experimental A490/mean maximum A490) for each triplicate of individual well samples. Paired measurements from at least three independent experiments were analyzed with an one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Bonferroni tests.[3H]Inositol Phosphate ProductionTransfected HEK-293 cells in 12-well plates were serum-starved overnight in DMEM containing 4 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). Cells were placed in media supplemented with 10 mm LiCl in the presence or absence of antagonist for 30 min at 37 °C/5% CO2 and the reactions were stopped by adding ice-cold formic acid (20 mm). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After addition of 0.7 m NH4OH and solubilization, [3H]inositol phosphates were isolated by Dowex ion exchange chromatography. Eluted samples were added to 10 ml of scintillation liquid (ScintiSafe, Fisher Scientific) and analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry with an LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).Calcium ImagingThe Ca2+-sensitive fluorophore fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for ratiometric Ca2+ imaging in HEK-293 and C6 glioma cells. All fluorescence measurements were made from subconfluent areas of the dishes so that individual cells could be readily identified. Following transfection in 100-mm plates, cells were split onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips immersed in 1 ml of media in 24-well plates and grown for 1-2 days. Prior to imaging, coverslips were incubated at room temperature for 30-60 min in extracellular recording solution (ECS) composed of: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and 325 mOsm. ECS was supplemented with pluronic acid (0.001%) and fura-2 AM (2 μm). Subsequently, coverslips were thoroughly rinsed with extracellular solution lacking fura-2 AM and mounted onto the microscope stage for imaging. Intensity images of 510-nm emission wavelengths were taken at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths, and the two resulting images were taken from individual cells for ratio calculations. Axon Imaging Workbench version 2.2.1 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) was used for acquisition of intensity images and conversion to ratios. Bath applications of the group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG, Tocris Cookson, Ballwin, MO) were performed for 20 s.RESULTSScreening of a PDZ Domain Proteomic Array with mGluR1-CT and mGluR5-CT—The last 25 amino acids of mGluR1a and mGluR5 were prepared as GST fusion proteins. The mGluR1a and mGluR5 C termini possess similar PDZ binding motifs that differ only by the residue at the -1 position. Metabotropic GluR1a ends with SSTL, whereas mGluR5 terminates with the motif SSSL. The binding of mGluR1a-CT and mGluR5-CT to a proteomic array of 96 known or putative class I PDZ domains was assessed in overlay experiments (Fig. 1). In contrast to GST alone (Fig. 1A), the CTs of the group I mGluRs interacted with several of the PDZ domains on the array. Both mGluR1a-CT (Fig. 1B) and mGluR5-CT (Fig. 1C) bound most robustly to the second PDZ domain of NHERF-2 (bin B6). The binding of mGluR5-CT to NHERF-2 PDZ2 was consistently stronger than the binding of mGluR1a-CT. The mGluR5-CT also bound well to NHERF-1 PDZ1 (bind B3) but did not detectably bind to any other PDZ domains on the array. In contrast, mGluR1-CT bound detectably to NHERF-1 PDZ2 (bin B4), NHERF-2 PDZ1 (bin B5), the single PDZ domain of CAL (bin B10), and the first PDZ domain of MAGI-3 PDZ1 (bin A10).NHERF-2 Possesses Higher Affinity for mGluR5-CT than mGluR1a-CT—To confirm the direct interaction of NHERF-2 with group I mGluRs, we overlaid equal amounts of GST fusion proteins of mGluR1a-CT and mGluR5-CT tails with full-length His-tagged NHERF-2 (Fig. 2A) as well as with the individual NHERF-2 PDZ domains (not shown). In all cases, much stronger binding was observed to mGluR5, suggesting a higher affinity of NHERF-2 for this receptor. This difference in affinity was further investigated by overlaying increasing concentrations of NHERF-2 PDZ2 fusion protein onto the group I mGluR-CT fusion proteins and performing saturation binding analyses. The estimated affinity constant (KD) for mGluR5-CT was 349 nm, while the estimated affinity of mGluR1a-CT was more than 4-fold lower (1530 nm; Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2In vitro interaction of group I mGluRs with NHERF-2 shows a higher affinity for mGluR5-CT. A, interaction of group I mGluR-CTs with full-length NHERF-2 was confirmed via blot overlay using 100 nm His-tagged NHERF-2. Equal protein loading was verified by Coomassie staining (lower panel). Substantially stronger binding was observed to mGluR5-CT than mGluR1a-CT. B, estimation of the affinity constants for NHERF-2 PDZ2 binding to mGluR1a-CT (solid squares, solid line; KD = 1530 nm) versus mGluR5-CT (open circles, dashed line; KD = 349 nm) confirmed that NHERF-2 PDZ2 binds to mGluR5-CT with much higher affinity. Points and error bars represent means + S.E. (n = 3). C, point-mutated versions of mGluR5-CT with the last four amino acids (SSSL) sequentially mutated to alanine were expressed as GST fusion proteins. These fusion proteins were loaded equally (1 μg) onto SDS/PAGE gels (lower panel), transferred to nitrocellulose, and overlaid with 100 nm full-length His-NHERF-2 fusion protein (upper panel). The NHERF-2/mGluR5-CT interaction was completely abolished by a single mutation to the last amino acid. These data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutations to the SSSL Motif of mGluR5-CT Disrupt the mGluR/NHERF-2 Interaction—To elucidate the structural determinants of the interaction between mGluR5 and NHERF-2, we generated a series of mutant mGluR5-CT fusion proteins with sequential alanine substitutions of the various residues of the SSSL motif. Overlaid His-tagged NHERF-2 fusion protein associated strongly with the WT mGluR5-CT (Fig. 2C). However, this association was completely abolished by mutation of the terminal leucine residue to alanine. Mutation of mGluR5-CT at the -2 and -3 positions also resulted in significantly reduced binding of NHERF-2. Interestingly, replacement of the serine at the -1 position had little effect on the binding of NHERF-2 to the mGluR5-CT, suggesting that the difference between mGluR1 and mGluR5 at this position does not account for the difference in NHERF-2 binding observed between the two receptors. It is likely that residues outside of the last four amino acids of the receptors play a role in determining the affinity of NHERF-2 binding. However, the data shown in this panel clearly reveal the importance of the SSSL motif for mGluR5 association with NHERF-2, with the terminal leucine residue being an especially critical determinant of the interaction.Full-length mGluR5a, but Not mGluR1a, Associates with NHERF-2 in Cells—To determine if NHERF-2 selectively interacts with mGluR5 in a cellular context, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the two full-length proteins in transfected HEK-293 cells. Metabotropic GluR5a was strongly co-immunoprecipitated with HA- or FLAG-NHERF-2 (Fig. 3A). The higher molecular mass mGluR5a species (>300 kDa), which presumably correspond to receptor homodimers unresolved by SDS-PAGE, were preferentially co-immunoprecipitated with NHERF-2 relative to mGluR5 monomers (∼160 kDa). In accord with the fusion protein studies, a mutant version of mGluR5a with the terminal leucine residue changed to alanine (L1171A) did not co-immunoprecipitate with FLAGNHERF-2, showing the specificity of the interaction (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, HA-NHERF-2 did not co-immunoprecipitate FLAG-mGluR1a (Fig. 3B). The reverse experiment, immunoprecipitation of FLAG-mGluR1a and blotting for NHERF-2, was also unsuccessful (not shown), confirming the low affinity of NHERF-2/mGluR1a interaction and the lack of cellular association between these two proteins. Additional co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed using whole brain lysates. NHERF-2 was immunoprecipitated from solubilized mouse brain, and Western blots of the immunoprecipitates revealed the presence of mGluR5 but not mGluR1 (Fig. 3C). These findings provide evidence that endogenous NHERF-2 interacts with mGluR5 in native brain tissue.FIGURE 3Cellular interaction of NHERF-2 with mGluR5 but not mGluR1a. A, homodimers of mGluR5a co-immunoprecipitated (upper right panel) with FLAG-tagged NHERF-2 (lower right panel) from transfected HEK-293 cells (left panels). This co-immunoprecipitation was disrupted by point mutation of the last amino acid of mGluR5a (L1171A) (upper right panel). The amount loaded f"

Previous studies have identified the precise signaling components and promoter elements required for TGFβ induction of TGFβ1 expression in epithelial cells (Yue, J., and Mulder, K. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 30765–30773). To determine how regulation of TGFβ3 expression differs from that of TGFβ1, we identified the precise signaling pathways and transcription factor-binding sites that are required for TGFβ3 gene expression. By using mutational analysis in electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we demonstrated that the c-AMP-responsive element (CRE) site in the TGFβ3 promoter was required for TGFβ-inducible TGFβ3 expression. Electrophoresis mobility supershift assays indicated that CRE-binding protein 1 (CREB1) and Smad3 were the major components present in this TGFβ-inducible complex. Furthermore, by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that CREB-1, ATF-2, and c-Jun bound constitutively at the TGFβ3 promoter (–100 to +1), whereas Smad3 bound at this site only after TGFβ stimulation. In addition, inhibition of JNK and p38 suppressed TGFβ induction of TGFβ3 transactivation, whereas inhibition of ERK and protein kinase A had no effect. Small interfering RNA-CREB1 and small interfering RNA-Smad3 significantly inhibited TGFβ stimulation of TGFβ3 promoter reporter activity and TGFβ3 production. Our results indicate that TGFβ activation of the TGFβ3 promoter CRE site, which leads to TGFβ3 production, is required for TGFβRII, JNK, p38, and Smad3 but was independent of protein kinase A, ERK, and Smad4.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). TGFβ suppresses the proliferation of normal cells. However, in malignant cells TGFβ production often enhances tumor progression, especially once the cells have lost the negative growth control signals imparted by TGFβ. Therefore, identification of critical points that can be targeted to block TGFβ production in cancer cells is important (2Parada D. Arciniegas E. Moreira O. Trujillo E. Arch. Esp. Urol. 2004; 57: 93-99PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lammerts E. Roswall P. Sundberg C. Gotwals P.J. Koteliansky V.E. Reed R.K. Heldin N.E. Rubin K. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 102: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying TGFβ auto-regulated secretion will assist in the identification of these critical branch points. The TGFβ family has the following three homologous forms: TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3. Although the three TGFβs share 60–80% identity, they are encoded by distinct genes, and their expression is controlled by a different regulatory sequence or promoter (4Kim S.J. Glick A. Sporn M.B.

Biol. 2002; 9: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). Because the expression of TGFβ is controlled by an auto-feedback loop (18Tang B. Bottinger E.P. Jakowlew S.B. Bagnall K.M. Mariano J. Anver M.R. Letterio J.J. Wakefield L.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), TGFβ is an important mechanism for amplifying its own expression and production. Because of the critical role that TGFβ plays in regulating a broad range of physiological and pathological effects, such as proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasiveness in cells and tissues, any changes in the signaling pathways mediating TGFβ3 autoregulation may lead to severe abnormalities. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms underlying TGFβ autoregulation, as well as the signal transduction pathways mediating TGFβ-induced TGFβ3 expression. The autoregulation of TGFβ appears to be mediated through specific sites in the promoter regions of the distinct isoforms (19Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although these sites have been examined for the TGFβ1 promoter (19Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), little is known about the relevant regions in the TGFβ3 promoter. The promoter area of the TGFβ3 gene has little structural or functional similarity to the TGFβ1 promoter. Similarly, transcriptional regulation of this gene has significantly diverged from that of the other TGFβs (6Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Kim S.J. Jakowlew S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19128-19136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that a region proximal to the TATA box in the 5′-flanking region of the TGFβ3 gene might be important in regulating TGFβ3 expression (6Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Kim S.J. Jakowlew S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19128-19136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no conclusive studies have defined the critical sites required for TGFβ induction of TGFβ3 expression. Here we have determined that the TGFβ-inducible region of the TGFβ3 promoter contains three transcription factor binding consensus sites: a CRE at –45 to –39 (GACGTCA), an SBE at –49 to –46 (CAGA), and an activator protein-2 (AP-2) site at –57 to –50 (CCCCAGGC). We have investigated the transcriptional regulation of each of these TGFβ3 gene promoter regions in response to TGFβ exposure, and we have demonstrated that the CRE site is the critical site. We have also defined the signal transduction pathways mediating TGFβ induction of TGFβ3 secretion, and we demonstrate that Smad3 and CREB-1 are the critical transcription factors involved. Although we have shown previously that JNKs and ERKs were the critical mediators of TGFβ1 production in untransformed epithelial cells (19Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), here we show that JNKs and p38, but not PKA and ERKs, are the critical upstream mediators of TGFβ3 production. Our studies provide new insights into the TGFβ auto-feedback regulatory mechanisms that are required for one of the key biological responses to TGFβ, namely stimulation of its own secretion. In this case, however, the results are specific for production of TGFβ3. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that blocking these critical points reduces TGFβ3 production, and as such, our findings suggest important intervention strategies for controlling tumor growth mediated by excessive tumor cell-secreted TGFβ3 in the tumor microenvironment. Cell Culture—The untransformed rat intestinal epithelial cell line 4-1 (IEC4-1, TGFβ-sensitive) was isolated as described previously (20Mulder K.M. Segarini P.R. Morris S.L. Ziman J.M. Choi H.G. J.

Cells were routinely maintained in SMIGS medium, consisting of McCoy's 5A (Invitrogen), supplemented with amino acids, pyruvate, antibiotics (streptomycin, penicillin), insulin (4 μg/ml), glucose (4.5 mg/ml), and 5% fetal bovine serum. IEC4-1 cells, stably transfected with dominant-negative TGFβRII (DN RII) and empty vector, were prepared as described previously (22Yue J. Sun B. Liu G. Mulder K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The transfectants were maintained in SMIGS medium in the presence of 5 μg/ml blasticidin, as a selection marker. CCL64-L20 and CCL64-Smad3C mink lung epithelial cells and human HaCaT cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (19Yue J.

Ryan C.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7510-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from either IEC4-1 or CCL64 cells by a method described previously (24Liu G. Chen N. Kaji A. Bode A.M. Ryan C.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7510-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes and treated with TGFβ3 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. The cells were then disrupted in 500 μl of lysis buffer A (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 1-min centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C), the pellet containing the nuclei was washed once with 500 μl of buffer B (buffer A without Nonidet P-40), resuspended in 120 μl of extraction buffer (buffer B but with 500 mm KCl and 10% glycerol), and incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. The nuclear extracts were stored at –70 °C until analysis. The DNA binding reaction (for EMSA) was carried out at room temperature for 30 min in a mixture containing 4 μg of nuclear protein, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 15,000 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. The samples were fractionated through a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for further analysis. The oligonucleotides used for probe labeling were as follows: Tβ3-P61/35, –61CCCACCCCAGGCCAGAGACGTCATGGG–35; mutated AP-2 in Tβ3-P61/35, –61CCCACCCtcaGCCAGAGACGTCATGGG–35; mutated SBE in Tβ3-P61/35, –61CCCACCCCAGGCCgtAGACGTCATGGG–35; mutated CRE in Tβ3-P61/35, –61CCCACCCCAGGCCAGAGACactATGGG–35; TGFβ 2/E-Box promoter –59 to –35 motif, –59GAAGGCAGACACGTGGTTCAGAGAG–35; SBE consensus binding motif GTCTAGAC. The SBE consensus oligonucleotide was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All other oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays were performed by preincubating 4 μg of nuclear protein with 4 μg of the relevant specific antibody against CREB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Smad3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or Smad4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or control normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 2 h and then processing the samples as described above. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Densitometry analyses were performed for all EMSAs to confirm the significance of the differences indicated. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays (25Mora-Garcia P. Cheng J. Crans-Vargas H.N. Countouriotis A. Shankar D. Sakamoto K.M.

Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were performed using the ChIP assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). In brief, HaCaT cells were incubated in the absence or presence of TGFβ3 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. The cells were then cross-linked with formaldehyde. Nuclear extracts were sonicated to obtain ∼250-bp fragments of DNA. The resulting DNA was immunoprecipitated overnight with antibodies to CREB-1, CREB-2, ATF-2, c-Jun, JunD, Smad3, or Smad4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and salmon sperm/agarose beads (catalog number 16-157; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The resulting DNA sample incubated with IgG or with no antibody was used as a negative control. The supernatant from a sample was used as total DNA input. The DNA was dissolved in 30μl of water, and 2μl was employed for PCR analysis using the primers for the TGFβ3 promoter region containing AP-2, SBE, and CRE sites (5′-GTGCAGCAAAAGAGGCTGCGTGCG-3′ and 5′-TCTATTTCTCTCTGCTGAAAT-3′). The products were resolved in a 3% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. siRNA Transfections—siRNA-CREB-1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. siRNA-Smad3 was purchased from Cellogenetics, Inc. (Baltimore). The siRNA products were annealed duplexes of RNA. Transfection of siRNAs into cells was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A nontargeting siRNA was used as a control for nonsequence-specific effects of the transfected siRNAs (Dharmacon, Inc., Dallas). Construction of TGFβ3 Promoter Luciferase Reporter Plasmid—The Tβ3-P221/110-Luc encodes a TGFβ3 promoter region from –221 to +110. The nucleotide sequence was PCR-amplified. The primers used were as follows: sense, 5′-actcgaACGCGTtgtggcaggagtgattccaaga-3′ (the capital letters indicate an MluI restrict enzyme digestion site), and antisense, 5′-gcacgcAGATCTcttggacttgactctctgctcc-3′ (the capital letters indicate a BglII restrict enzyme digestion site). The PCR products and the basic pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) were digested using MluI and BglII, and the products were gel-purified and inserted into the vector using Quick Ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The sequence of the resulting Tβ3-P221/110-Luc luciferase reporter plasmid was confirmed by sequencing in both directions. The CRE-mutated Tβ3-P221/110-Luc luciferase reporter plasmid (Mut-Tβ3-P221/110-Luc) was constructed using QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used were as follows: sense, 5′-CCACCCCAGGCCAGAGACactATGGGAGGGAGGTATA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TATACCTCCCTCCCATagtGTCTCTGGCCTGGGGTGG-3′ (the lowercase letters indicate mutated CRE site). Luciferase Reporter Assays—IEC4-1 and CCL64 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and grown to 70–80% confluence. Cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of Tβ3-P221/110-Luc, siRNA plasmids at the indicated concentrations, and 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase control reporter (pRL-SV40) per well, using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen), as described in the user manual. TGFβ3 (10 ng/ml) was added 24 h after transfections, and luciferase activities were measured at 24 h after TGFβ3 treatment. Transfection efficiencies were determined by co-transfecting with Renilla luciferase. IEC4-1 cells were also co-transfected with Tβ3-P221/110-Luc and a dominant-negative Smad4 plasmid (19Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) at the concentrations indicated. Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—RNA was isolated from HaCaT cells and their siRNA-CREB-1 and siRNA-Smad3 transfectants as described above using TRIzol reagent by Invitrogen. Total cDNA was prepared by RT-PCR using random hexamer primers purchased from Invitrogen and the isolated RNA as the template. Real time RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green I agent from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA), with the cDNA prepared above as the template. 18 S rRNA was used as an internal control. The TGFβ3 primers used were as follows: sense, 5′-TGTGTGCGCCCCCTCTA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGTTCATGGACCCACTTCCA-3′. Quantitation of TGFβ3—The quantitative determination of TGFβ3 was performed. IEC4-1 cells, and their siRNA-CREB-1 or siRNA-Smad3 transfectants, were seeded in 12-well plates and grown in the absence or presence of TGFβ1 for 72 h. Conditioned medium (CM) was then collected for quantitative determination of TGFβ3 using an ELISA kit (DuoSet ELISA Development System, R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The system specifically detects TGFβ3 with no cross-reactivity or interference with TGFβ1. The cells were trypsinized and counted. “Total” TGFβ3 was quantitated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the samples were acid-activated using 1 n HCl to activate latent TGFβ3 and then neutralized by addition of 1.2 n NaOH, 0.5 m HEPES solution to convert all TGFβ3 to the form detectable using the antibody in the ELISA kit. Western Blotting—IEC4-1 cells were transfected with the siRNA plasmids indicated, and the cells were lysed and prepared 36 h after transfection. Western blotting for CREB-1, Smad3, and phosphorylated CREB-1 proteins was carried out using specific antibodies, according to the supplier's recommendations. Anti-CREB-1 antibody (9192) and anti-phospho-CREB-1 antibody (9191) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-Smad3 antibody (51-1500) was Zymed Laboratories Inc. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed and statistically significant differences determined using the Student's t test. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The CRE Consensus Site in Tβ3-P61/35 Is Critical for TGFβ3 Responsiveness—It has been reported that a sequence from –490 to +100 in the 5′-flanking region of the TGFβ3 gene might be important in regulating TGFβ3 expression (6Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Kim S.J. Jakowlew S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19128-19136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region contains two ubiquitously expressed Sp-1 transcription factor DNA-binding sites (–420 to –415 and –363 to –358), an AP-2 site (–57 to –50), and a CRE site (–45 to –39). The CRE site has been shown to be involved in TGFβ3 transcription, although its TGFβ-inducible expression was not examined (6Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Kim S.J. Jakowlew S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19128-19136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the AP-2 and CRE sites, we also identified an SBE site (–49 to –46), between the AP-2 and CRE sites, which can also be induced by TGFβ (27Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We presumed that the SBE and/or CRE sites, but not the Sp-1 sites, in the TGFβ3 promoter region might be important for TGFβ induction of TGFβ3 gene expression because Sp-1 has relatively little effect on the activation of the promoter (6Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Kim S.J. Jakowlew S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19128-19136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address this issue, we constructed a Tβ3-P221/110-Luc luciferase reporter plasmid using the DNA sequence from the TGFβ3 5′-flanking region (–221 to +110) of the promoter. This sequence contains the AP-2, SBE, and CRE sites. We treated IEC4-1 cells with TGFβ to stimulate the auto-induction loop, and we measured Tβ3-P221/110-Luc reporter activity. Here we show that TGFβ affected a time-dependent increase in Tβ3-P221/110-Luc activity. The TGFβ stimulation of Tβ3-P221/110-Luc activity reached a peak 24 h after TGFβ3 treatment (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that Tβ3-P221/110 is important in TGFβ auto-induction of TGFβ3 gene transcription. The IEC4-1 cells were used for these studies because they represent a good model for TGFβ regulation in untransformed epithelial cells because of their high level of TGFβ sensitivity and their well characterized TGFβ pathways (21Mulder K.M. Morris S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5029-5031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yue J. Sun B. Liu G. Mulder K.M. J. Cell.

In addition, these cells have been shown to produce high levels of endogenous TGFβ (20Mulder K.M. Segarini P.R. Morris S.L. Ziman J.M. Choi H.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether the AP-2 (–57 to –50), SBE (–49 to –46), and/or CRE (–45 to –39) sites within the –221 to +110 region of the TGFβ3 promoter were involved in TGFβ induction of TGFβ3 gene transcription, we examined the DNA binding activity of a sequence containing these three sites (Tβ3-P61/35) in response to TGFβ3. As shown in Fig. 1B, TGFβ significantly increased complex formation at Tβ3-P61/35 in a time-dependent manner, with peak levels occurring 1 h after TGFβ treatment. Thus, our results indicate that a TGFβ-inducible complex formed at Tβ3-P61/35 in response to TGFβ treatment. During the TGFβ signaling process, TGFβ binds to RII, which then recruits RI into the active complex (30Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the TGFβ receptors were required for auto-regulation of TGFβ3 expression, we performed EMSAs with Tβ3-P61/35 after expression of a dominant-negative TGFβ receptor II (DN RII) (22Yue J. Sun B. Liu G. Mulder K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the Tβ3-P61/35 DNA binding activity stimulated by either TGFβ1 or TGFβ3 was significantly suppressed in the DN RII-expressing IEC4-1 cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7 versus lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, DN RII had no effect in the PMA-induced cells (Fig. 2A, lane 8 versus lane 4). These results indicate that RII is required for TGFβ3 auto-loop regulation. To determine which DNA-binding sites are required for TGFβ3 production, we performed site-directed mutagenesis at the relevant sites, and we then repeated the EMSAs using labeled versions of these as probes. As shown in Fig. 2B, mutation of the CRE site completely abolished DNA binding activity at Tβ3-P61/35 (lanes 10–12), whereas mutation of the AP-2 (lanes 4–6) or SBE (lanes 7–9) sites had no effect. The TGFβ-inducible complex formed at the wild-type Tβ3-P61/35 is shown for comparison (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that DNA binding activity at the CRE site is critical for mediating the TGFβ3 auto-induction loop. As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 1, 4, 8, and 10), a 10-fold excess of unlabeled probe completely competed for DNA binding of the radioisotope-labeled probe, indicating that the bands observed represented specific binding to Tβ3-P61/35. To further confirm that the CRE site in the TGFβ3 promoter is indeed required for the TGFβ3 gene transcription, we constructed Mut-Tβ3-P221/110-Luc, a CRE site-mutated Tβ3-P221/110-Luc luciferase reporter plasmid. We transfected IEC4-1 cells with Mut-Tβ3-P221/110-Luc, followed by treatment of the IEC4-1 transfectants with TGFβ. As shown in Fig. 2C, CRE mutation completely abolished the luciferase activity induced by TGFβ. This result confirms that this CRE site in the TGFβ3 promoter region is critical for TGFβ3 gene transcription. CREB-1 and Smad3, but Not Smad4, Are Bound at the Tβ3-P61/35—It is known that CREB-1 can recognize and bind to CRE consensus sites in various gene promoters. As we have demonstrated that the CRE site in Tβ3-P61/35 is critical for TGFβ auto-induction of TGFβ3, we examined whether the CREB-1 protein was a component in the transcription factor complex bound at this Tβ3-P61/35. As shown in Fig. 3A by EMSAs, TGFβ-inducible complex formation (lanes 1 and 2) was reduced when the CREB-1 antibody was present (lane 4) but not when rabbit IgG was present (lane 3). A supershift was also observed using the CREB-1 antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Thus, CREB-1 was in the transcription factor complex bound to the Tβ3-P61/35 region. We further explored whether Smad3 and Smad4 might be present in the complex at Tβ3-P61/35, because Smads are known to play important roles in TGFβ3 signaling and because an SBE site is present in Tβ3-P61/35. As shown in Fig. 3A, lane 5, the anti-Smad3 antibody reduced the TGFβ-inducible DNA binding, indicating that Smad3 was present in the transcription factor complex bound to Tβ3-P61/35. This did not occur when phorbol myristate acetate was used as the inducer (data not shown). Because activated Smad2 or Smad3 can form a dimer with Smad4 prior to stimulation of transcriptional activation of target genes through SBE sites, it was of interest to determine whether Smad4 was also in this complex bound to Tβ3-P61/35. As shown in Fig. 3A, lane 6, the anti-Smad4 antibody had no effect on DNA binding of Tβ3-P61/35, suggesting that Smad4 may not be involved in the transcription factor complex bound to Tβ3-P61/35. To verify the specificity of the anti-Smad3 and anti-Smad4 antibodies used, a full palindromic SBE sequence was used in the supershift EMSAs. As shown in Fig. 3B, a 10-fold excess of unlabeled cold probe completely competed for TGFβ induction of the DNA binding of the radioisotope-labeled probe, indicating that the band observed was specific for the consensus palindromic SBE site (lane 1). Both Smad3 and Smad4 were present in the transcription factor complex bound to the consensus SBE site (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). The results in Fig. 3A, lane 2, indicate that in the absence of TGFβ, there was no binding to the consensus palindromic SBE site in IEC4-1 cells, whereas TGFβ could induce DNA binding at this site, as shown in lane 3 (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3B (lane 4), addition of rabbit IgG in the EMSAs had"

We report that splicing of the bacterial group II intron RmInt1 in vivo leads to the formation of both intron lariat and intron RNA circles. We determined that besides being required for the intron splicing reaction, the maturase domain of the intron-encoded protein also controls the balance between lariat and RNA intron circle production. Furthermore, comparison with in vitro self-splicing products indicates that in vivo, the intron-encoded protein appears to promote the use of a correct EBS1/IBS1 intron-exon interaction as well as cleavage at, or next to, the expected 3′ splice site. These findings provide new insights on the mechanism of excision of group II introns as circles. Excision of group II introns as circles has been described only for a few eukaryotic introns and little is known about the mechanisms involved, the relevance or consequences of the process.

These findings provide new insights on the mechanism of excision of group II introns as circles. Group II introns are large catalytic RNAs with a conserved secondary structure consisting of six domains, one of which (dIV) may incorporate the coding sequence of a reverse transcriptase (RT) 3The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; IEP, intron-encoded protein; RNP, RNA-protein; IBS, intron-binding sites; EBS, exon-binding sites; nt, nucleotide. 3The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; IEP, intron-encoded protein; RNP, RNA-protein; IBS, intron-binding sites; EBS, exon-binding sites; nt, nucleotide. (1Michel F. Ferat J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Although some group II introns self-splice in vitro, this reaction requires nonphysiological conditions, and in vivo, proteins are required to fold the intron RNA into a catalytically active structure. Group II intron-encoded proteins (IEPs) promote both splicing and mobility of the intron RNA through formation of a specific RNA-protein (RNP) complex (2Lambowitz A.M. Belfort M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 3Lambowitz A.M. Caprara M.G. Zimmerly S. Perlman P.S. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. 2nd Ed. The RNA World.

The IEPs have two conserved domains, an N-terminal RT domain and domain X, a putative RNA-binding domain associated with maturase (RNA splicing) activity. In some cases the IEP also includes a C-terminal DNA-binding and a DNA-endonuclease domain (5San Filippo J. Lambowitz A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 933-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Group II introns splice typically by the same two sequential transesterification reactions used in nuclear mRNA splicing (1Michel F. Ferat J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In a first step, the 2′-OH group of a branch point nucleotide residue, usually a bulged adenosine in dVI, attacks the 5′ splice junction resulting in cleavage of the 5′ exon and the formation of an intron-3′ exon-branched lariat intermediate. The released 5′ exon remains associated to the intron via base pairing of the intron-binding sites (IBS1 and IBS2) to the exon-binding sites (EBS1 and EBS2) located in domain dI. In the second step, the free 3′-OH of the 5′ exon attacks the 3′ splice junction leading to the release of the intron lariat and the ligation of the 5′ and 3′ exons. There also exists an alternate pathway, in which the first splicing step is initiated by a nucleophilic attack of water or an OH– ion, resulting in the formation of a linear intron-3′ exon intermediate that subsequently participates in a normal second step reaction. This hydrolytic pathway is observable in vitro and has been shown to be used in vivo by yeast mitochondrial introns carrying branch-site mutations (6Podar M. Chu V.T. Pyle A.M. Perlman P.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, even though most of the plant chloroplast group II introns follow the typical lariat-generating pathway, hydrolytic splicing has been reported for intron trnV, which lacks the conserved bulged A in dVI, whereas both the hydrolytic and branching pathways seem to coexist in the case of the barley trnK intron (7Vogel J. Börner T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3794-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Circular DNA versions of group II introns are known to exist in Podospora anserina where they are somehow associated with cellular senescence (8Osiewacz H.D. Esser K. Curr. Genet. 1984; 8: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt W.M. Schweyen R.J. Wolf K. Mueller M.W. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4093-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this particular case a model was proposed, by which the circular DNA molecules would be generated via transposition of the intron in front of itself, followed by excision of one of the tandem copies by homologous recombination (11Sellem C.H. Lecellier G. Belcour L. Nature. 1993; 366: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Müeller M.W. Allmaier M. Eskes R. Schweyen R.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Sainsard-Chanet A. Begel O. Belcour L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 630-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). More recent data indicate that yeast intron aI5γ can be also excised as a true circular form in vitro (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The circle seems to result from formation of a 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond between the last and first residues of the intron and it has been proposed that this reaction requires the 3′ exon to have been released first from precursor molecules by a trans-splicing reaction triggered by 5′ exon molecules previously generated by the so-called SER (spliced-exon reopening) reaction. For the yeast intron aI2, both RNA and DNA circles have been detected in vivo and it is thought that circular aI2 RNAs are copied into DNA, presumably by reverse transcription (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of circular forms of excised intron molecules in plant mitochondria has been recently reported (15Li-Pook-Than J. Bonen L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, circular intron molecules have not been described so far for bacterial group II introns. RmInt1 is a bacterial group II intron identified in Sinorhizobium meliloti, the nitrogen-fixing symbiont of alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The RmInt1 IEP is required for intron splicing in vivo (16Muñoz-Adelantado E. San Filippo J. Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Lambowitz A.M. Toro N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but like those of many other bacterial group II introns, it lacks C-terminal DNA endonuclease and DNA-binding domains (5San Filippo J. Lambowitz A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 933-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Toro N. Mol.

RmInt1 is nevertheless an efficient mobile element that has two retrohoming pathways for mobility, with predominant use of the nascent lagging strand at DNA replication forks for priming (21Martínez-Abarca F. Barrientos-Durán A. Fernández-López M. Toro N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2880-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that RmInt1 self-splices in vitro in the absence of the IEP, but the in vitro activity of the intron is atypical in that the second step of splicing is unusually inefficient and several unconventional products are generated alongside the expected excised intron and ligated exons (22Costa M. Michel F. Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the excision of the S. meliloti RmInt1 intron in vivo. Our data indicate that the RmInt1 group II intron is excised in vivo both as intron lariat and intron circles and that the IEP seems to determine the balance between these two excision products. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The strain used in this work was S. meliloti RMO17. This strain was cultured at 28 °C on TY medium for RNA extraction and RNP particle isolation. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for the cloning and maintenance of plasmid constructs. For plasmid maintenance the antibiotic kanamycin was added at 200 μg/ml–1 for rhizobia and 50 μg/ml–1 for E. coli. RmInt1 and Mutant Derivatives—The pKG2.5, pKG2.5-YAHH, and pKG2.5D5-CGA constructs have been previously reported (16Muñoz-Adelantado E. San Filippo J. Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and their main features are specified under “Results.” The RmInt1 IEP maturase mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. For the construction of the YY → AA mutant, two pairs of primers were designed to amplify the 5′ and 3′ sections of the IEP, respectively. A 5′ end primer mut UP (5′-GTCAGCGGTGCTGGAAGTATG-3′) and a 3′ end primer YY-AA/DN (5′-CTGTACCGTCCCGCGGCGGCAATCCATCCCCGAAGG-3′) were used to generate the upstream fragment containing 690 bp; a 5′ end primer YY-AA/UP (5′-GATGGATTGCCGCCGCGGGACGGTACAGTCGTTCGG-3′) and a 3′ end primer mut DN (5′-GCGCGCGTAATACGACTCAC-3′) were used to generate the downstream 829-bp fragment. The mutagenic primers contain an overlapping region of 28 bp and promote the replacement of two conserved tyrosines (YY) at IEP positions 354–355 by two alanines (AA) through changing TACTAT to GCCGCG in these positions. The final 1492-bp amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment in pKG2.5, which generated plasmid pKG2.5-A354A355. The K381A maturase mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis pAlter-1 System (Promega). In pAL2.5-A381, which was derived from pAL2.5 (16Muñoz-Adelantado E. San Filippo J. Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Lambowitz A.M. Toro N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), RmInt1 nucleotides AAG located at positions 1687 to 1689 are replaced by GCG, so that the conserved IEP residue Lys381 is changed to Ala381. The final construct, pKG2.5-A381, was generated by cloning the RmInt1-containing fragment resulting from BamHI/SpeI digestion of pAL2.5-A381 into pKG0 (17Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Toro N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Primer Extension Assays—These assays were carried out on both total RNA and RNP particle preparations. Primer extension reactions were essentially as described previously (16Muñoz-Adelantado E. San Filippo J. Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Lambowitz A.M. Toro N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. RNA Isolation—RNA was extracted from free-living cultures of S. meliloti strain RMO17 containing plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant RmInt1 grown in 10 ml of TY medium supplemented with kanamycin until they reached an A600 of 0.6 units. The cells were pelleted, resuspended, and incubated for 10 min at 65 °C in 300 μl of a lysis solution (1.4% SDS, 4 mm EDTA). Proteins were removed by adding 150 μl of NaCl (5 m) at 4 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the nucleic acids present in the supernatant were precipitated by adding 1 ml of ethanol (100%). The pellet was resuspended in 85 μl of nucleasefree water and digested with 50 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche). The RNA was extracted with 1 volume of a 25:24:1 mixture of phenol (pH 4.5)/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and then extracted with 1 volume of a 24:1 mixture of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Finally the RNA was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol (100%) and 75 mm NaOAc (pH 5.2). The RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 20 μl of nuclease-free water. For the RT-PCR assays shown in Fig. 5B, RNA preparations were set up with a few modifications. Proteinase K (25 μl of a solution of 5 mg/ml) was added to the lysis solution followed by the procedure described above, or after DNase I digestion the sample was treated with 25 μlof5 m guanidine thiocyanate, 2.5 μlof3 m NaOAc (pH 4.8), 93 μlof phenol (pH 4.5), and 30 μl of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1) for 15 min on ice and then extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Preparation of RNP Particles—RNP isolation was carried out essentially as described previously (16Muñoz-Adelantado E. San Filippo J. Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Lambowitz A.M.

The clarified lysate (5 ml) was layered on a 5 ml of 1.85 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged for 20 h in a Beckman Ti50 rotor at 50,000 × g. A supernatant with two different fractions according to its density (S1, light and S2, dense) and a pellet (P) containing the RNPs was obtained. For the RT-PCR assays shown in Fig. 5A, the two fractions of the supernatant (∼5 ml each) were collected and precipitated. The S2 fraction was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol (100%) and 0.8 m LiCl. The resulting pellet was resuspended in water and precipitated again with 3 volumes of ethanol and 0.25 m NaOAc (pH 5.2). The S1 fraction was mixed with 1.5 volumes of a solution containing 0.8 m guanidine thiocyanate, 50 mm NaOAc (pH 4.8), and phenol (pH 4.5), chloroform, isoamyl alcohol (150:49:1). The mixture was kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) followed by precipitation with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The resulting pellet was resuspended in water and digested with 100 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche) followed by phenol (pH 4.5)/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. RT-PCR and cRT-PCR Assays—First strand cDNA synthesis was started by annealing 6.5 μg of total cellular RNA or an equivalent quantity of RNPs (0.1625 A260 units) and 25 pmol of Ect1 primer complementary to a sequence 188 nt from the 5′ end of RmInt1 in the presence of 12.5 nm dNTPs equimolar mixture. The mixture was first heated at 90 °C for 2 min, then slowly cooled for 15 min prior to being put on ice for 15 min. cDNA synthesis was triggered by addition of 5× first strand reverse transcriptase buffer (Invitrogen), 0.2 mol of dithiothreitol, 30 units of RNAguard™ RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences), and 400 units of SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 120 min. After heat inactivation of the enzyme (at 70 °C for 15 min), RNase H digestion was carried out for 20 min at 37 °C. One-fifteenth of that reaction was used as a template in the PCR with 30 pmol of LL primer (5′-GAGGTTCACGCACCGTTCTG; designed complementary to a sequence 59–40 nt from the 3′ end of RmInt1), 30 pmol of 5′-radiolabeled P primer (around 200,000 cpm), 12.5 mmol of dNTPs mixture, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 2 units of Taq polymerase in 50 μlasa final volume. After the preincubation step at 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles was performed: 45 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. One μl of RT-PCR product was separated on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. Subsequent cloning in pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products was carried out by isolation of the corresponding bands from agarose gels. The cRT-PCR experiments were carried out as the RT-PCR assays, but using previously ligated RNA samples to circularize any linear intron molecules that contain a 5′ monophosphate. Twenty-five μg of total RNA or 0.625 A260 units of RNP particle preparations from wild-type intron pKG2.5 cells were added to a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 50 units of T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in a final volume of 20 μl and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, T4 RNA ligase was inactivated by boiling for 2 min and the reaction underwent phenol and chloroform extractions followed by ethanol precipitation for 1 h at –80 °C. Finally, samples were resuspended in 5 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate/water and 2.5 μl were used for reverse transcription. RT Assays—Exogenous RT activity in RNP particles was measured as previously described (16Muñoz-Adelantado E. San Filippo J. Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Lambowitz A.M. Toro N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RmInt1 Excised Products in Vivo as Determined by Primer Extension—Because the RmInt1 ribozyme has a bulged A located seven nucleotides upstream of the 3′ splice site, we expected the intron to splice primarily as a lariat in vivo. Initially, we characterized the RmInt1 splicing reaction by primer extension using a primer P (Fig. 1) complementary to a sequence located 80–97 nt from the 5′ end of the intron (16Muñoz-Adelantado E. San Filippo J. Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Lambowitz A.M. Toro N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, primer extension assays using RNA and RNP particles from S. meliloti cells expressing wild-type intron pKG2.5 revealed two extension products (along with larger bands) that differ by one nucleotide (97–98 nt; Fig. 1) relative to the position expected for the 5′ end of the intron. Note that the shorter 97-nt extension product is clearly a major product in both RNA and RNP particle preparations. None of these two extension products were detected with RNA or RNPs isolated from cells harboring the splicing-defective intron pKG2.5D5-CGA, which has a mutation (GUU → GCA) in the AGC-GUU critical conserved pairing of ribozyme domain dV (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4). Therefore, we conclude that the 97- and 98-nt extension products were derived from excised intron RNA molecules. Whereas primer extension data do not by themselves make it possible to clarify the nature of the excised intron RNA, it is interesting to note that primer extension performed on a circular intron has been reported to result in two extension products that differ by 1 nucleotide, the longer product being the major one (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase is known to pause after reading through the 2′-5′ linkage in a nonlariat RNA (23Lorsch J.R. Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2811-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas with lariat RNA, the pause occurs before reading through the 2′-5′ linkage (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, one possible interpretation of our data were that in addition to intron lariat, RmInt1 might be excised in vivo as intron circles. Detection of Two Different RmInt1 Excision Products in Vivo by Reverse Transcription and PCR—To further investigate the nature of RmInt1 excision products, RNA and RNP particle preparations were analyzed by reverse transcription with primer Ect1 (Fig. 2A), located downstream of the 5′ splice site, followed by PCR with primers P and LL, the latter located 5′ of the branch site (Fig. 2A). The PCR products were radiolabeled using a 5′ end-labeled P primer and the products were separated on a denaturing, 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2B). When RNA samples were used (Fig. 2B), two major products of 265 and 156 nt were observed in cells expressing the wild-type intron pKG2.5 (lane 2) or the defective homing mutant pKG2.5-YAHH (lane 4), which has a YADD to YAHH mutation in the RT domain and therefore cannot generate duplicated linear introns joined head-to-tail. The 265-nt product was also present in the splicing-defective mutant pKG2.5D5-CGA (lane 6), indicating that it was not derived from the spliced intron; as shown later, this product derives from the RNA precursor. Strikingly, the 156-nt product, whose size is that expected from a circular RNA substrate in which the first G residue of the intron is linked to the last C residue, was absent when RNA from the splicing-defective mutant pKG2.5-D5-CGA was used (lanes 6) or when reverse transcription was omitted (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 3, and 5). These results indicate that the RT-PCR product of 156 nt obtained using RNA samples is primarily derived from an excised intron RNA product. The 156-nt RT-PCR products were also detected when preparations of RNP particles from cells expressing the wild-type intron pKG2.5 were used (Fig. 2B, lane 8). Consistent with the data reported above, the 156-nt product was not seen when mutant pKG2.5-D5-CGA RNP particles were used (lane 12). This product was clearly reduced in RNP particles from the RT mutant pKG2.5-YAHH (lane 10) that has ∼60% of the wild-type splicing activity (not shown). Interestingly, in the absence of reverse transcription and the primer Ect1, a PCR product of 156 nt was still clearly detected in wild-type intron pKG2.5 RNP particles (lane 7), but was not observed in the splicing defective mutant pKG2.5-D5-CGA (lane 11). These results appear to indicate the existence of DNA molecules generated from spliced intron circles. In addition to the aforementioned products, in the RNP particles, but not in the RNA samples (Fig. 2B), we detected another major RT-PCR product of 150 nt, whose size is that expected from a substrate consisting of an intron lariat in which the branching point is the bulged A in dVI. This product was observed in both wild-type intron pKG2.5 (lane 8) and the RT mutant pKG2.5-YAHH (lane 10), but was absent in the splicing-defective mutant pKG2.5D5-CGA (lane 12) or when reverse transcription was omitted (lanes 7, 9, and 11). These results imply that the RT-PCR product of 150 nt is generated from the amplification of a second intron RNA excision product. RmInt1 Excision in Vivo Produces Both Lariat and Intron Circles—The amplified RT-PCR products from both RNA and RNP particle preparations were gel-extracted, cloned, and sequenced. All 19 clones generated by the 265-nt RT-PCR product from wild-type intron pKG2.5 and RT mutant pKG2.5-YAHH, and either RNA or RNP particles, showed 168 nucleotides of the 5′ exon joined to 97 nucleotides of the 5′-end of the intron. A similar result was obtained by sequencing nine clones from a 265-nt PCR product obtained in the absence of reverse transcription using RNP particle preparations from RT mutant pKG2.5-YAHH. Therefore, we conclude that as stated above, this amplification product is generated from intron RNA precursor and/or contaminant DNA. The RT-PCR products of 156 nt generated from RmInt1-excised intron using RNA samples (Fig. 2B) were also cloned and sequenced. Ten of 11 clones from the RT mutant pKG2.5-YAHH were derived indeed from intron RNA circles and displayed the expected point of circular ligation between the first and last residues of the intron (Fig. 2C), whereas the remaining clone (157 nt) corresponded to a molecule with an extra cytosine at the site of circularization. Similar results were obtained when the same RT-PCR product was sequenced from wild-type intron pKG2.5. Five of 9 clones corresponded to the 156-nt intron circle product, whereas the remaining four displayed an additional cytosine (157 nt). Together, these findings are consistent with the production of intron RNA circles in vivo. The PCR product of 156 nt obtained in the absence of reverse transcription and primer Ect1 when wild-type intron pKG2.5 RNP particles were used (Fig. 2B, lane 7) was also cloned and sequenced. All six clones analyzed had the same sequence as the RT-PCR product of 156 nt generated from the RNA samples. We interpret the latter molecules as evidence that in addition to RmInt1 intronic circular RNA, there exist intronic DNA circles. In agarose gels, the coexisting RT-PCR products of 150 and 156 nt (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 10) generated by amplification of RNP particle samples from either wild-type intron pKG2.5 or RT mutant pKG2.5-YAHH cannot be resolved (data not shown). Therefore, the amplified products were isolated together, cloned, and sequenced. Eleven of 13 clones from wild-type intron pKG2.5 showed the expected linkage between the bulged A of dVI and the first residue of the intron (Fig. 2C), indicating that they arose from a lariat intron, whereas the remaining two correspond to intron circles. Note that in the products amplified from lariat intron (Fig. 2C), there was misincorporation of adenosine instead of thymidine as reverse transcriptase encountered the branched nucleotide (7Vogel J. Börner T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3794-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Vogel J. Hess W.R. Börner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2030-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent with the higher proportion of the 150-nt RT-PCR product in the RT mutant pKG2.5-YAHH (Fig. 2B, lane 10), all 10 derivative clones had the sequence expected from a lariat intron. Together, these findings imply that excision of RmInt1 in vivo produces intron lariat as well as intronic RNA and DNA circles. RmInt1 RNA Molecules Detected by cRT-PCR—It has been suggested that intron circle formation by intron aI5γ could result from the previous release of the 3′ exon by free 5′ exon molecules arising from the exon reopening reaction (splicedexon reopening) (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RmInt1 circles might also be originated by ligation of the ends of a previously linear intron molecule produced by the hydrolytic pathway in which the first splicing step results in the formation of a linear intron-3′ exon intermediate. To test for the possible presence of such intermediates in the RNA population, the RNA was circularized using T4 RNA ligase prior to reverse transcription with primer Ect1 and PCR with primers P and LL (cRT-PCR) (7Vogel J. Börner T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3794-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because the resulting products from both total RNA and RNP particles form a smear in polyacrylamide gels (not shown), they were cloned directly from the PCR. As shown in Fig. 3, sequence analysis of pKG2.5 samples (8 clones from total RNA and 8 clones from RNP particles) revealed a predominance of molecules in which the 5′ exon was ligated either to the exact 3′ end of the intron (C-1884) or to one of the nucleotides neighboring the 3′ splice site (9 of 16 clones). Moreover, the 5′ end of the RNA precursor seems to be primarily processed around nucleotide –30. Five other clones contained the intron flanked by 5′ and 3′ exon sequences, presumably representing intron RNA precursor molecules, whereas the remaining two clones likely corresponded to molecules degraded either at the 5′ or 3′ end. These results are consistent with the suggestion that the release of the 3′ exon might be the first step for RmInt1 circle formation. The Maturase Domain Is Required for RmInt1 Splicing and Intron Circle Formation—In group II IEPs, the RT domain is followed by a region denoted domain X, affecting the maturase (RNA splicing) activity. To assess the involvement of the maturase domain of RmInt1 in the splicing reaction in vivo and intron circle formation, we created the mutant YY → AA, which has two alanine residues instead of the conserved Tyr354 and Tyr355 residues, and the mutant K381A, in which the conserved Lys381 residue is replaced by an alanine residue (Fig. 4A). Primer extension analysis and RT-PCR assays using both RNA and RNP particle preparations indicate that the YY → AA mutant shows no detectable splicing (Fig. 4, B and D). Moreover, the RNP particles from cells expressing pKG2.5-A354A355 had strongly decreased RT activity similar to that of the RT YAHH mutant (Fig. 4C), consistent with the inability of these mutants to form active RNP particles. As expected from these data, mobility is abolished in the YY → AA mutant (data not shown). These findings indicate that as expected the RmInt1 maturase X domain is required for the splicing reaction in vivo, and also for RNA intron circle formation. As shown in Fig. 4B, the single point mutation K381A inhibits, but does not abolish splicing (∼30% wild-type). Also, the RNP particles of cells expressing pKG2.5-A381 have strongly decreased RT activity (Fig. 4C) and the K381A mutant has no detectable mobility (data not shown). Interestingly, RT-PCR assays using RNP particle preparations from this mutant (Fig. 4D) showed an apparent bias to intron circle formation (compare the levels of products derived from the lariat and intron circles between the mutant, lane 10, and the wild type, lane 12). Moreover, the RT-PCR product of the K381A mutant corresponding to intron circles appears to be primarily one nucleotide longer than that obtained from the wild-type intron. This was confirmed by sequencing the cloned RT-PCR product, which showed an extra C residue at the circle ligation point. The apparent shift from lariat to intron circles might only reflect a decreased affinity of the mutant RT-maturase for the lariat product leading to a reduction of lariat intron in the RNP particles. To assess this possibility the RNA from supernatant fractions S1 and S2 after the RNPs (P) pelleting step were also analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 5A). In the case of the wild-type intron (pKG2.5), the RT-PCR product derived from the lariat was the prominent product in both the RNPs (P) and the dense fraction of the supernatant (S2), whereas in the light fraction of the supernatant (S1) similar levels of RT-PCR products derived from lariat and intron circles was observed. Interestingly, in the last fraction (S1) intronic DNA circles were detected (reverse transcription and primer Ect1 omitted, lane 1). On the contrary, in the K381A mutant the major RT-PCR product in the RNPs (P) and in both supernatant fractions (S1 and S2) was derived from intron circles. These findings are consistent with a genuine shift from lariat to intron circle production in the K381A mutant. Nevertheless, this conclusion was still hampered by the fact that in the total RNA preparations we had only detected intron circles by RT-PCR, hence we could not differentiate the mutant from the wild-type intron. A possible explanation is that the lariat RNA could be degraded or the RNP particles eliminated in some way during the RNA isolation. To assess this possibility we also obtained total RNA using methods that included specific steps of denaturation or removal of proteins. As shown in Fig. 5B either the use or guanidine thiocyanate or proteinase K in the RNA isolation procedure allowed us to detect both lariat and intronic circles in the RNA samples. As expected the RT-PCR product derived from lariat molecules is the predominant product in the wild-type intron pKG2.5, but again the RT-PCR product derived from intron circles was the major product in the K381A mutant. Thus, taken together these findings indicate that the maturase domain X of the IEP controls the balance between lariat and RNA intron circle production. We show here that S. meliloti group II intron RmInt1 is excised in vivo both as intron lariat and intron circles and that the maturase domain of the IEP is not only required for intron RNA splicing, but plays a role in the mechanism chosen for intron excision. RmInt1 Is Excised as a Lariat but Also as Intron Circles in Vivo—By RT-PCR and sequencing, we found that excision of the RmInt1 wild-type intron from its RNA precursor produces both lariat and RNA circular molecules. RNA intron circles are also produced by a mutant in the RT active site (YAHH) and by the maturase mutant K381A. Because these mutant introns are not mobile and therefore, cannot generate intron dimers arranged head-to-tail, we believe that PCR products in which the intron 5′ and 3′ ends are joined together were not generated by transcription of intron duplications, but rather reflect the presence of genuine RNA circles resulting from intron excision. It should be added that RmInt1 also generates RNA circles in a RecA– background (data not shown), which adds further support to the above conclusion. Our data also suggest that not only RNA circles, but DNA circular molecules are produced as well by the wild-type RmInt1 intron; whether the latter molecules are generated through reverse transcription of the RNA circles by the IEP remains to be determined. The circle produced in vitro by the yeast intron a5γ seems to result from formation a 2′-5′ bond and this may also be the case for RmInt1 RNA circles. Although the absolute ratio of intron circle over lariat cannot be estimated from these assays because RT-PCR is bound to be influenced by the differing ability of reverse transcriptase to read through 2′-5′ linkages depending on whether these are part of branched (lariat) or unbranched (intron circle) structures (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Lorsch J.R. Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2811-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the RT-PCR assays suggest that the lariat is the predominant excision product of wild-type intron RmInt1. The detection of lariat intron molecules in the RNA preparations, but not the circular forms depends on the use of specific steps of denaturation or removal of proteins during the RNA isolation. In addition, the RT-PCR analysis of the supernatant fractions and the pellet after the RNPs pelleting step suggests that the lariat associated with the IEP (RNPs) and the intronic circles have different hydrodynamic properties. These properties may be influenced by both the type of folding of the different excised intron molecules and a distinctive interaction of these forms with the IEP. The Role of the RmInt1 IEP in Splicing and Intron Excision as Circles in Vivo—A mutation in which the conserved Tyr354– Tyr355 residues of the RmInt1 IEP maturase domain were replaced by two alanine residues abolished formation of both RNA circles and intron lariat, thus implying that the maturase domain X is required for the two excision mechanisms in vivo. The mutation Y354A, Y355A may inhibit RNA splicing directly by altering some of the contacts of the IEP with the intron RNA or by decreasing the stability of the IEP. In the maturase mutant K381A splicing was reduced to 30% of the wild-type and there was a marked decrease of intron lariat molecules. This mutation may also alter the IEP interaction with the intron RNA, which in turn may affect the intron excision mechanism. Our results suggest that the maturase domain X controls in some way the balance of intron excision as lariat or intron circles. Moreover, we found that some of the amplified products presumably derived from RmInt1 RNA circles contain an extra cytosine at the circle ligation point. Noticeably, those products predominate among molecules amplified from the maturase mutant K381A. The addition of non-encoded nucleotides at the circle ligation point was observed for in vitro-generated circular aI5γ RNA (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the inserted residues were hypothesized to having been incorporated by the reverse transcriptase used in the assays when it encounters the putative 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond. However, a cytosine residue (IBS3) is also present at position +1 of the RmInt1 3′ exon. Thus, the extra C residue in the RmInt1 RNA circular molecules might arise from cleavage at position +1 (IBS3) in the 3′ exon, rather than being an artifact of the reverse transcription reaction. This plausible interpretation of our results implies that the maturase would help to determine the precise site of excision at the 3′ splice junction during intron circle formation. The Mechanism of RmInt1 Excision as Circles in Vivo—Whereas RmInt1 is also able to form RNA intron circles in the absence of protein by using a pseudo-IBS1 (IBS1*) sequence located close to the correct 3′ splice site in the 3′ exon (22Costa M. Michel F. Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the IEP seems to promote the correct EBS1-IBS1 interaction in vivo. Analysis of intron-containing RNA using T4 RNA ligase assays revealed a predominance of intermediates with a site of 3′ exon cleavage located at or next to the 3′ splice site. Thus, in vivo the presence of the IEP seems to ensure that cleavage occurs either at the correct 3′ splice site or at position +1 of the 3′ exon before intron RNA circle formation, rather than at position +10 or +11 as occurs in vitro (22Costa M. Michel F. Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After the release of the 3′ exon, which may result from a trans-splicing reaction as suggested for intron aI5γ (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the 2′-OH of the terminal cytosine will attack the 5′ splice site, releasing the 5′ exon and an intron circle. Excision of group II introns as circles had been shown to occur in vivo for yeast introns like aI2 (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but is reported for the first time in this work for a mobile bacterial group II intron. It is now apparent that this peculiar mode of excision is more widespread in nature than it seemed and we regard it as likely that it will be found to have a biological role, perhaps with respect to intron spread and dissemination.

Sulfur oxides released into the atmosphere by combustion of fossil fuel cause serious air pollution, which leads to acid rain and destroys forests and soils.

Catal. 1980; 61: 523-527Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar), but it is difficult to remove polycyclic aromatic sulfur compounds such as benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene (DBT) 2The abbreviations used are: DBT, dibenzothiophene; HBP, 2-hydroxybiphenyl; HBPS, 2′-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinic acid; BPS, biphenyl-2-sulfinic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

In particular, DBT is considered as a model compound of polycyclic organic sulfur compounds in fossil fuels, and degradation of DBT by microbial activities has been studied with a keen interest in biodesulfurization (4Monticello D.J. Finnerty W.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 39: 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Van Hamme J.D. Singh A. Ward O.P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 503-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Sulfur-specific DBT degradation pathway, which is capable of transforming DBT to sulfite and 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP), was identified in the soil bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis (6Gallagher J.R. Olson E.S. Stanley D.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 107: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Izumi Y. Ohshiro T. Ogino H. Hine Y. Shimao M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 223-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found to be catalyzed by the following three enzymes: DszA, DszB, and DszC (8Denome S.A. Oldfield C. Nash L.J. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6707-6716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Piddington C.S. Kovacevich B.R. Rambosek J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 468-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DszA and DszC are flavin-dependent monooxygenases and responsible for oxidation of DBT to 2′-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinic acid (HBPS). A 39-kDa protein DszB (EC 3.13.1.3) participates in the last desulfurization step and hydrolyzes the sulfinate group of HBPS (Scheme 1). The reaction catalyzed by DszB is the slowest in the pathway and thus was proposed as the rate-limiting step in desulfurization (10Gray K.A. Pogrebinsky O.S. Mrachko G.T. Xi L. Monticello D.J. Squires C.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1705-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). DszB is inhibited by the reaction product of HBP but not by biphenyl, which indicates that the hydroxyl group is required for the inhibition. However, DszB can accept biphenyl-2-sulfinic acid (BPS) as a substrate, and the hydroxyl group of HBPS does not seem to be essential for the activity (11Nakayama N. Matsubara T. Ohshiro T. Moroto Y. Kawata Y. Koizumi K. Hirakawa Y. Suzuki M. Maruhashi K. Izumi Y. Kurane R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 122-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DszB is also strongly inhibited by cysteine-modifying reagents, and mutation of the unique cysteine residue, Cys27, into serine abolished the activity (11Nakayama N. Matsubara T. Ohshiro T. Moroto Y. Kawata Y. Koizumi K. Hirakawa Y. Suzuki M. Maruhashi K. Izumi Y. Kurane R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 122-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides biodesulfurization, knowledge of sulfur metabolism by soil bacteria is particularly interesting because of their competition for sulfur nutrient with plants. Although biochemical studies have shown that DszB is a unique desulfinase, its detailed molecular reaction mechanism remains largely unknown. In an attempt to expand our understanding of bacterial desulfurization in molecular detail, we determined crystal structures of DszB in complex with substrates HBPS and BPS. Materials—BPS was synthesized as reported previously (12Hanson G. Kemp D.S. J. Org. Chem. 1981; 46: 5441-5443Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sodium salt of HBPS was a gift from Petroleum Energy Center, Shimizu, Japan. Reagents for crystallization buffer were purchased from Hampton Research. Other chemicals used were of the finest grade commercially available. Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection—Protein purification and crystallization were performed as described previously (11Nakayama N. Matsubara T. Ohshiro T. Moroto Y. Kawata Y. Koizumi K.

For phasing, native crystals of DszB were soaked in 10 mm KAu(CN)2 for 2 days before the diffraction data collection. Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set was collected on beamline BL-6A at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan), at the wavelength of 0.978 Å. Diffraction images were integrated and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA programs from the CCP4 program suite (14Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1995; 50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Native data sets of DszB and substrate complexes were collected on beamlines BL-18B and BL-6A at the Photon Factory, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Selected crystallographic data and statisticsDszBGold derivativeDszB-HBPSDszB-BPSData collectionSpace groupP212121P212121C2C2Wavelength, Å1.0000.9780.9780.978Resolution, Å28.8-1.834.9-2.054.2-1.631.0-1.8No. of measured reflections139,971189,431353,812236,875No. of unique reflections39,99129,35995,47565,706Completeness, % (last shell)99.4 (98.6)98.8 (94.1)100 (99.8)99.4 (96.3)I/σ (last shell)6.8 (3.2)11.3 (6.4)7.1 (3.7)9.2 (4.8)Rmerge (last shell)aRmerge = ∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl) - 〈I(hkl)) 〉|/∑hkl∑i(hkl), where Ii(hkl) is the i-th intensity measurement of reflection hkl, including symmetry-related reflections, and 〈I(hkl) 〉 is its average.0.072 (0.214)0.042 (0.106)0.058 (0.199)0.054 (0.138)SAD phasingResolution, Å34.9-2.2RcullisbRcullis is as defined in CNS.0.847Phasing powercPhasing power is as defined in CNS.0.962Figure of merit0.216RefinementResolution28.8-1.854.2-1.631.0-1.8R-factor (Rfree)0.188 (0.201)0.180 (0.196)0.169 (0.198)Average B-factor, protein, Å216.53513.46313.452Average B-factor, water, Å231.50723.57226.770Average B-factor, ligands,dAverage B-factors of a glycerol molecule, HBPS, and BPS are bound to the active site, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—The x-ray crystal structure of DszB was determined by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method (Table 1). The single gold site was located, and the program CNS was used to refine the heavy atom parameters (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

After phase improvement by density modification, the single wavelength data produced an interpretable electron density map. The programs ARP/wARP and XtalView were used to build the model (16Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar, 17McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The structures of DszB-HBPS and DszB-BPS were solved by the molecular replacement method using the program MolRep (18Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). Topology files of ligands were prepared using PRODRG server, and models were refined by the program CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors of DszB, DszB-HBPS, and DszB-BPS structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as 2DE2, 2DE3, and 2DE4, respectively. Secondary structures were designated with the program DSSP (21Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar). Structure figures were prepared with the programs Molscript and Raster3D (22Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar, 23Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis study was conducted as described previously (11Nakayama N. Matsubara T. Ohshiro T. Moroto Y. Kawata Y. Koizumi K. Hirakawa Y. Suzuki M. Maruhashi K. Izumi Y. Kurane R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 122-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pKK223-3 expression vectors (Amersham Biosciences) coding for wild-type DszB or mutants were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 strain harboring pKY206 plasmid (BL21/pKY206), which contains E. coli chaperone genes (24Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured cells were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (10% glycerol (v/v) and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed by sonication (Branson Instruments). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and relative protein concentration was verified by SDS-PAGE. Thus prepared soluble fractions of cell crude extracts were used for activity assay. Activity of DszB and its mutants was assayed at 28 °C by measuring the amount of HBP produced from HBPS with high pressure liquid chromatography system. 1 unit of activity was defined as the amount of DszB necessary to produce 1 nmol of 2-HBP or sulfite per min. Sequence Alignment—Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences was carried out using ClustalX program (25Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 was prepared using ESPript program (26Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar). The Overall Structure of DszB—The crystals of DszB are in space group P212121 with a = 36.7, b = 82.6, and c = 139.6 Å. The asymmetric unit consists of a single molecule of DszB. In addition to 330 water molecules, 7 glycerol molecules and 1 acetate ion were modeled and included in the structure. The structure of DszB is monomeric and oval-shaped with approximate dimensions of 60 × 50 × 40 Å (Fig. 1A). In the final model of DszB, more than 91% of residues are located in the most favored regions in the Ramachandran plot, and only Leu226 is located in generously allowed regions. However, this residue is well defined in its electron density. The 18 N-terminal residues were not observed in the electron density map. We deleted these residues to find out whether they have relevance to function, and we found no difference in activity or stability (data not shown). DszB is composed of two α/β domains, with highly curved 5-stranded β-sheets being located between α-helix bundles. We designate the two domains as domain A (residues 19-97 and 251-365) and domain B (residues 98-250) (Fig. 1, A and B). We searched for proteins with similar structures using the DALI server (27Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and found matches, including ovotransferrin (PDB code 1NNT, Z score = 8.7, root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) = 4.3 Å) and substrate-binding component from a bacterial ABC transporter of sulfate (PDB code 1SBP, Z score = 7.3, r.m.s.d. = 3.8 Å) (Fig. 1C). These results show that DszB belongs to the phosphate-binding protein family as defined in the SCOP protein fold data base (28Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5610) Google Scholar). Two enzymes, porphobilinogen deaminase (29Louie G.V. Brownlie P.D. Lambert R. Cooper J.B. Blundell T.L. Wood S.P. Warren M.J. Woodcock S.C. Jordan P.M. Nature. 1992; 359: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and thiaminase-I (30Campobasso N. Costello C.A. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15981-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), also belong to this family. Additionally, amino acid homology search on the NCBI protein sequence data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) showed that DszB has significant amino acid sequence similarity to the putative substrate-binding proteins. Specifically, the C-terminal half of DszB shares a 26% amino acid identity with AtsR, the substrate-binding protein component for the sulfate ester transport system of Pseudomonas putida S-313 (31Kahnert A. Kertesz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31661-31667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Based on three-dimensional structure similarity and amino acid homology, we propose that DszB has been evolved from substrate-binding proteins. The active site of DszB, in which the critical residue Cys27 is located, is in the cavity between the two domains and includes a glycerol molecule (Fig. 1D). Adding glycerol in the buffers (10% (w/v)) during the purification steps was essential in stabilizing the protein (11Nakayama N. Matsubara T. Ohshiro T. Moroto Y. Kawata Y. Koizumi K. Hirakawa Y. Suzuki M. Maruhashi K. Izumi Y. Kurane R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 122-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of a glycerol molecule in the active site may be responsible for stabilizing the protein. The domain B part of the cavity is mainly hydrophobic, whereas that of domain A contains Cys27, whose sulfhydryl group is free of interactions with nearby residues. In the course of searching for a potential general base, we found the carboxylate group of Glu192 to be adjacent to the residue, separated by about 4 Å (Fig. 1D), and we mutated it to Gln to examine its function. However, the mutation had no effect on the desulfination activity (data not shown). Structures of DszB in Complex with Substrates—To investigate the substrate-binding mode of DszB, an inactive mutant (DszB-C27S) was crystallized in complex with substrates HBPS and BPS, as attempts to soak substrates into crystals were unsuccessful (13Lee W.C. Ohshiro T. Matsubara T. Izumi Y. Tanokura M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1636-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Complex crystals could be obtained by incubating the protein (∼10 mg/ml) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm HBPS or BPS prior to the crystallization setup. The structures of HBPS and BPS complexes were determined at resolutions of 1.6 and 1.8 Å, respectively, by the molecular replacement method. Crystals are in space group C2 with a = 154.7, b = 46.2, c = 114.0 Å, and β = 115.8° for DszB-HBPS and a = 153.4, b = 45.9, c = 112.9 Å, and β = 115.9° for DszB-BPS. Crystals contain two similar DszB molecules in the asymmetric unit, and each DszB molecule binds one acetate ion. One magnesium ion added in the crystallization buffer was included in each of the models. Electron densities belonging to HBPS and BPS were found in the cavity at the center of DszB. In the electron densities, the dihedral angle between the biphenyl rings is about 90°, and tetrahedral geometry of the sulfinate group could be recognized easily (Fig. 2A). The overall structure is similar to that of the native protein, and we can superimpose the structure of DszB with that of DszB-HBPS or DszB-BPS with an approximate r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å (Fig. 2B) except for residues 55-62 and 187-204, which confer the most notable change as a result of substrate binding (Fig. 2C). These residues, which were loops in the native structure, form α-helices to accommodate the biphenyl rings of substrates (Fig. 2C). The structural change introduces His60 into the active site, whose side chain interacts with Ser25 and HBPS, and the conformation of loop β1-αA changes to accommodate this residue, exposing Ser27, which is Cys in the native protein, to the sulfinate group of substrates (Fig. 2D). The glycerol molecule in the active site of the native structure is replaced by phenyl sulfinate moieties of substrates in the complex structures. In the active site, Pro28, Phe61, Leu152, Trp155, Gly183, Phe203, and Leu226 mainly form hydrophobic interactions with substrates (Fig. 3A). Except for the additional hydroxyl group of HBPS, which is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule in the active site, HBPS and BPS bind the active site in a similar manner. A sulfinate oxygen interacts with O-γ of Ser27, N-ϵ of His60, and N-η2ofArg70, all at distances of 2.6-2.7 Å. As a result, the sulfinate group, Cys27, His60, and Arg70, forms a tetrahedral hydrogen bond network, with the guanidine moiety of Arg70 forming additional hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly73 (Fig. 3B). O-γ of Ser27 also lies adjacent to the main chain nitrogen of Gly73 at a distance of ∼3.0 Å. The configuration of Gly73 is reminiscent of the oxyanion hole in serine proteases, which is usually observed in various hydrolases and is known to stabilize the negative charge of the reaction intermediate (32Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that a water molecule interacts with the other sulfinate oxygen at a distance of 2.8 Å (Fig. 3B). Site-directed Mutagenesis—A site-directed mutagenesis study to address the role of each residue in the active site triad demonstrates that each residue is crucial to the activity of DszB. We found that the H60Q mutation caused an ∼17-fold reduction in the specific activity (Table 2). The structural integrity of DszB may have been affected by the R70I or R70K mutations as those expressed mutants mostly existed in the insoluble fraction of cell extracts (data not shown). The highly conserved 70RXGG motif forms the structural core of domain A, and thus Arg70 may be essential in maintaining the structure of domain A. We could not detect desulfination activity from the crude cell extracts of Arg70 mutants (Table 2).TABLE 2Activity chart of DszB mutants in crude extracts of E. coli BL21 harboring pKY206 (BL21/pKY206)DszB nativeDszB H60QDszB R70IDszB R70KControl (BL21/pKY206)Protein concentration (mg/ml)39.746.326.324.136.8Activity (units/ml)99369.4NDaND, not detected.NDNDSpecific activity (units/mg)251.50NDNDNDa ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab To our knowledge, the only desulfinase documented so far is aspartate β-decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.12), which can accept structurally similar cysteine sulfinates (33Soda K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Strop P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31203-31208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Aspartate β-decarboxylase is a member of the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferase family, and β-elimination of aspartate or cysteine sulfinate is considered to occur by the formation of a Schiff's base with the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, thus stabilizing the transition state (35Eliot A.C. Kirsch J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). However, DszB does not require any form of cofactor for desulfurization (11Nakayama N. Matsubara T. Ohshiro T. Moroto Y. Kawata Y. Koizumi K. Hirakawa Y. Suzuki M. Maruhashi K. Izumi Y. Kurane R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 122-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and seems to have adopted a distinct mechanism of desulfination (36Gray K.A. Mrachko G.T. Squires C.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Proposed Reaction Mechanism of DszB—In the active site of DszB-C27S in complex with substrates, Ser27 (Cys in the native protein) is positioned for nucleophilic attack on the sulfinate sulfur (Fig. 3B), and thus the thiolate ion of Cys27 and the sulfinate sulfur form a thiolsulfonate-like intermediate as a plausible first step of the reaction. It has been proposed that the Cys-His dyad in cysteine proteases forms a thiolate-imidazolium pair to activate the catalytic cysteine residue (37Polgar L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 47: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and we find Ser27 and His60 with a similar configuration in the complex structures. However, the ion pair formation mechanism for DszB is not reasonable because S-γ of Cys27 and N-ϵ of His60 are separated by a distance of ∼17 Å in the absence of a substrate (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the H60Q mutant retains desulfination activity, which suggests His60 does not function as a general base and may be required for the proper orientation of the sulfinate group. We could not find any other base in the vicinity of Cys27 except for the sulfinate group from the substrate. Hence, we propose the sulfinate group to be the general base. Sulfinic acids are stronger acids than carboxylic acids and consequently poor bases (38Fujihara H. Furukawa N. Patai S The Chemistry of Sulfinic Acids, Esters and Their Derivatives. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 275-295Google Scholar). Nonetheless, optimal positioning and orientation of the catalytic base can increase its basicity by about several orders of magnitude (39Gandour R.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1981; 10: 169-176Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the case of the sulfinate group, because of the lone pair electron of the sulfur atom, the syn orbital of the sulfinate oxygen and the S-C bond are predicted to be on the same side of the SO2 plane (40Basch H. Patai S The Chemistry of Sulfinic Acids, Esters and Their Derivatives. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 9-34Google Scholar). Consequently, we find the sulfinate group of bound substrates in a configuration that directs its syn orbital to the hydroxyl hydrogen of Ser27 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, protonation of the sulfinate group can reduce the negative charge building on the reaction intermediate. Similar substrate-assisted catalysis has been proposed for GTPases such as p21Ras and type II restriction endonucleases (41Dall'Acqua W. Carter P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Arg70 and the main chain nitrogen of Gly73 seem to be required for the stabilization of the negatively charged reaction intermediate. A water molecule coordinated to the sulfinate oxygen could be added in a similar fashion to release a sulfite molecule in the final steps of desulfination. The proposed reaction mechanism of DszB is illustrated in Fig. 4. DszB Belongs to a New Family of Desulfinases—The structure of DszB defines a new group of hydrolases in which conserved Cys, His, and Arg participate in hydrolysis of the C-S bond in organic sulfinic acids. Based on this definition, homologs of DszB were searched for in NCBI protein sequence data base. Homologs of DszB could be found primarily in genome sequences of soil bacteria, and all include Cys, His, and Arg in their N-terminal regions (Fig. 5). A multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences also shows apparent homology (data not shown), and thus these homologs appear to have similar folds. Interestingly, some of these putative proteins are from protein clusters whose genomic contexts are different from that of dsz operon. As organic sulfur compounds of various structures exist in soil, these uncharacterized DszB homologs might function as desulfinase components of sulfur metabolic pathways yet to be discovered. We thank the beamline staff at Photon Factory for help with data collection (Proposal 2001G352) and Dr. Michael E. P. Murphy for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2154508277,"Vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase pumps consist of two domains, V(1) and V(o). Subunit d is a component of V(o) located in a central stalk that rotates during catalysis. By generating mutations, we showed that subunit d couples ATP hydrolysis and proton transport. The mutation F94A strongly uncoupled the enzyme, preventing proton transport but not ATPase activity. C-terminal mutations changed coupling as well; ATPase activity was decreased by 59-72%, whereas proton transport was not measurable (E328A) or was moderately reduced (E317A and C329A). Except for W325A, which had low levels of V(1)V(o), mutations allowed wild-type assembly regardless of the fact that subunits E and d were reduced at the membrane. N- and C-terminal deletions of various lengths were inhibitory and gradually destabilized subunit d, limiting V(1)V(o) formation. Both N and C terminus were required for V(o) assembly. The N-terminal truncation 2-19Delta prevented V(1)V(o) formation, although subunit d was available. The C terminus was required for retention of subunits E and d at the membrane. In addition, the C terminus of its bacterial homolog (subunit C from T. thermophilus) stabilized the yeast subunit d mutant 310-345Delta and allowed assembly of the rotor structure with subunits A and B. Structural features conserved between bacterial and eukaryotic subunit d and the significance of domain 3 for vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase function are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2008765876,"The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated in human cancers. Upon activation it can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. ASPP2 can specifically stimulate the apoptotic function of p53 but not cell cycle arrest, but the mechanism of enhancing the activation of pro-apoptotic genes over cell cycle arrest genes remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the binding of 53BP2 (p53-binding protein 2, the C-terminal domain of ASPP2) to p53 core domain and various mutants using biophysical techniques. We found that several p53 core domain mutations (R181E, G245S, R249S, R273H) have different effects on the binding of DNA response elements and 53BP2. Further, we investigated the existence of a ternary complex consisting of 53BP2, p53, and DNA response elements to gain insight into the specific pro-apoptotic activation of p53. We found that binding of 53BP2 and DNA to p53 is mutually exclusive in the case of GADD45, p21, Bax, and PIG3. Both pro-apoptotic and non-apoptotic response elements were competed off p53 by 53BP2 with no indication of a ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1966600110,"SNARE proteins mediate the fusion of lipid bilayers by the directed assembly of coiled-coil domains arising from apposing membranes. We have utilized inverted cone-shaped lipids, antagonists of the necessary membrane deformation during fusion to characterize the extent and range of SNARE assembly up to the moment of stalk formation between bilayers. The inverted cone-shaped lipid family of acyl-CoAs specifically inhibits the completion of fusion in an acyl-chain length-dependent manner. Removal of acyl-CoA from the membrane relieves the inhibition and initiates a burst of membrane fusion with rates exceeding any point in the control curves lacking acyl-CoA. This burst indicates the accumulation of semi-assembled fusion complexes. These preformed complexes are resistant to cleavage by botulinum toxin B and thus appear to have progressed beyond the “loosely zippered” state of docked synaptic vesicles. Surprisingly, application of the soluble domain of VAMP2, which blocks SNARE assembly by competing for binding on the available t-SNAREs, blocks recovery from the acyl-CoA inhibition. Thus, complexes formed in the presence of a lipidic antagonist to fusion are incompletely assembled, suggesting that the formation of tightly assembled SNARE pairs requires progression all the way through to membrane fusion.

Each membrane fusion event culminates in an organized assault on membrane integrity, rupturing two apposed bilayer surfaces in the process of fusing their lipid leaflets and mixing their respective contents. Not surprisingly, such an event is thermodynamically unfavorable, with the size of the energy barrier being in part a function of the intermediate structures sampled by the two membranes during the fusion event. The most successful model of these intermediate structures is the “stalk” model of membrane fusion (1Kozlov M.M. Markin V.S. Biofizika. 1983; 28: 242-247PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gingell D. Ginsberg L.

Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A), which predicts interaction of the apposed bilayers, followed by a transient hemi-fused state (the stalk), where the outer monolayers have merged, whereas the inner monolayers remain separated. Rupture of the stalk allows the formation of a pore (possibly with a “prepore” intermediate) that subsequently expands to complete the fusion of the bilayers. In the course of stalk formation, interacting membranes must pass through transient intermediates that are highly curved. In a curved membrane the surface area to volume demands of the lipids on either side of the membrane are different. Manipulation of the lipidic composition of one leaflet of the membrane(s) can enhance or prevent certain types of curvature. Cone and inverted cone-shaped lipids have been used in a large number of pure lipid and viral-mediated fusion studies to introduce specific blocks or bursts to membrane bending and to allow an examination of the early stages of membrane fusion (4Gunther-Ausborn S.

The major proteins involved in overcoming the energetic barriers of membrane fusion are known for a wide variety of biological processes, most notably for enveloped viruses and intracellular trafficking. However, the molecular mechanisms employed to manipulate the lipid surfaces, the intermediate states sampled by both proteins and lipids, and the precise molecular organization of the fusion machinery remain largely unknown. SNARE 3The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; IC-lipid, inverted cone-shaped lipid; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; OA, oleic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PC, phosphatidylcholine. proteins are uniquely suited to biophysical characterization of the fusion event. They have a relatively simple architecture consisting of a transmembrane region, a SNARE domain, and at most one other presumably regulatory domain. This simplicity coupled with available in vitro fusion assays (6Fix M. Melia T.J. Jaiswal J.K. Rappoport J.Z. You D. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Simon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, the machinery necessary for fusion is segregated into two membranes, which allows for the individual manipulation of the fusion components. The binding and zippering of coiled-coil domains derived from SNAREs on apposing membranes, SNAREpin assembly, provides the energy necessary to drive membrane fusion. This assembly process also includes at least one partially assembled intermediate in which the most membrane distal portions of the coiled-coil interact but zippering is incomplete (9Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Hua S.Y. Charlton M.P.

Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The extent of assembly and the degree of reversibility for this, or these, intermediates remains unknown. We have previously used peptides derived from the SNAREs to isolate and describe an intermediate assembly stage during the neuronal SNARE-mediated fusion of reconstituted liposomes (9Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Here we combine the use of SNARE-targeted fusion inhibitors and a battery of cone and inverted cone-shaped lipids to characterize the extent of complex formation in the SNAREpin when lipid membrane curvature becomes limiting. Materials—Acyl-CoAs and oleic acid were purchased as powder from Sigma. Myristoyl-CoA displayed lot-dependent activities, including one preparation that activated fusion (lot number 22K70301); therefore only the several lots that inhibited fusion were used in this manuscript. Phospholipids were purchased in CHCl3 from Avanti. Peptides derived from the membrane-proximal portion of the SNARE domain on VAMP2 were synthesized by the Microchemistry Core Facility of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The VAMP2-specific antibody 69.1 was purchased from synaptic systems. Protein and Liposome Preparation—An N-terminally deleted syntaxin 1A, in which the first 150 amino acids were removed (comprising the whole of the N-terminal regulatory domain) was co-expressed with His6-SNAP-25 and purified as described (6Fix M. Melia T.J. Jaiswal J.K. Rappoport J.Z. You D. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Simon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7311-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). t-SNARE complex containing His6-SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1A lacking the transmembrane domain (Tsol), VAMP2-His6, and His6-VAMP2 lacking the transmembrane domain (Vsol) were each expressed and purified as described (9Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins of SNAREs with N-terminal fluorescent protein tags were generated as follows. ECFP-VAMP2 was cloned into the NcoI-XhoI sites on pET28a to form pYDQ1, which codes for a protein with a C-terminal His6 tag. The coding sequence begins with the first methionine of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and contains the entire sequence of ECFP, followed by an 11-amino acid linker (SGGSGGSGGEF), and the mVAMP2 sequence beginning with the first serine. EYFP-SNAP25 was cloned into the XhoI site of pET14b to form pYDQ3 and code for a protein with an N-terminal His6 tag. The coding sequence includes all of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) followed by an 11-amino acid linker (SGGSGGSGGEF) and the mSNAP-25 sequence beginning with the first alanine. The EYFP also contains a Q69M mutation, generating the more photostable variant known as citrine (12Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). For protein expression of the fluorescent t-SNARE complex, a plasmid encoding full-length syntaxin 1A (pTW20) was co-transfected with pYDQ3 and purified via the His6 tag on EYFP-SNAP25. Small unilamellar proteoliposomes were prepared essentially as described (8Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar), except that the liposomes contain a lower protein/lipid ratio. The syntaxin 1A/SNAP-25 liposomes were prepared at ∼1 t-SNARE/800 lipids, closer to surface densities that give rise to fusogenic supported bilayers (6Fix M. Melia T.J. Jaiswal J.K. Rappoport J.Z. You D. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Simon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7311-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the VAMP2 liposomes were prepared at 1 protein/100 lipids. An alternative expression of protein reconstitution is protein per liposome. We typically avoid this metric because it assumes a vesicle population having a homogeneous size. In our experience, detergent-dilution/dialysis liposomes are heterogeneous in size, with an average diameter of ∼35–40 nm (Ref. 13Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Liu S. Weber T. Melia T.J. McNew J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 274-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and data not shown) but can include some liposomes greater than 100 nm in diameter. Furthermore, surface density rather than protein per liposome is likely the more relevant metric for considering physiological t-SNARE function, in which the protein is localized to target membranes rather than vesicles and is perhaps concentrated into rafts. However, to simplify comparisons across the literature, we have calculated an approximate protein/liposome; assuming each lipid headgroup occupies ∼65 Å2, a typical 35-nm liposome will have ∼9000 lipids and ∼11 t-SNAREs or ∼90 v-SNAREs. Botulinum B and tetanus toxin light chains were bacterially expressed from plasmids pBN13 and pOG-7, respectively, and purified via C-terminal His6 tags. Lipid Mixing Fusion Assay—The lipid mixing assay is a measure of fluorescence dequenching from NBD (nitrobenzoxadiazole)/rhodamine lipid pairs concentrated in the “donor” liposome population and diluted after fusion with “target” liposomes. The assay was run on a Spectramax plate reader essentially as described (9Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). t-SNARE liposomes were preincubated with buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol), Vsol, peptides, and/or lipidic molecules including the acyl-CoAs and lysolipids for 7 min at 37 °C prior to addition of the v-liposomes and initiation of the assay. Acyl-CoAs and oleic acid (OA) were prepared as aqueous suspensions in buffer A and added as <10% of the assay volume. Lyso-lipids were prepared as an emulsion in ethanol by bath sonication and added as <5% of the assay volume. Fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) was prepared in buffer A immediately before use. The addition of material during an assay (buffer A, BSA, Vsol) sometimes caused a temporary decrease in the fusion rate caused by temperature fluctuations in the plate reader. In addition, when BSA was added to samples containing inhibitory lipidic molecules, an immediate, moderate decrease in fluorescence was routinely observed resulting from the sudden removal of the lipidic antagonists and consequent concentration (and requenching) of the fluorescently labeled lipids. Because the bulk of the volume in the assay derives from t-SNARE liposomes (45 μl versus 5 μl of v-SNARE and 5–10 μl of other compounds), we typically diluted the acyl-CoA into the t-liposome fraction. However, we also conducted numerous experiments in which the acyl-CoA was premixed with both the v- and the t-liposomes and observed identical results. Acyl-CoAs inhibit fusion by wild-type syntaxin 1A (data not shown) just as effectively as fusion by syntaxin 1A lacking the auto-inhibitory N-terminal domain (14Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We have used the N-terminal deletion variant throughout this manuscript, except where otherwise noted. The results are presented as percentages of detergent signal, which is a normalization of the fusion-dependent fluorescence to the maximal fluorescent signal elicited with 0.4% dodecylmaltoside (Roche Applied Science) (8Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Fusion rates were calculated from the maximal slope of the assay rather than the initial slopes to avoid effects from the occasional temperature-dependent lag. Inhibitory and stimulated rates were normalized to control samples (samples without any added activating or inhibiting substances) after first subtracting the background drift observed in Vsol-inhibited samples to give: (experimental rate – background rate)/(control rate – background rate) × 100. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Assay—Liposome assays were performed as described for the lipid mixing assay above, except that the liposomes contained no fluorescent lipids. Instead, the proteins were directly modified with ECFP (VAMP2) or EYFP (SNAP-25). In both cases, the fluorescent proteins were added at the N termini of the SNARE proteins. When either of these proteins was tested in a lipid mixing assay, we could still observe an increase in fluorescence over time, suggesting that the N-terminal tags did not prevent fusion. The quantitative analysis of the fusion extent in these cases, however, was limited because of the high background fluorescence imposed by the fluorescent protein tags. The samples were excited with 433-nm light at 37 °C in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer (LS50B). Full emission spectra were recorded (for example, see Fig. 6A) after a 2-h incubation, from which the peak values of ECFP and EYFP emission were determined. Liposomes mixed in the presence of Vsol (to inhibit SNARE complex formation) elicit a spectrum that is identical to liposomes that are solubilized and proteolyzed (to liberate the fluorescent tag and thus eliminate any chance of FRET), indicating that the Vsol control is an accurate indicator of the No FRET base-line condition. FRET signal was measured as the change in the ratio of emission at 525 nm versus 480 nm upon protein complex formation. For time-dependent changes in FRET, the fluorescence intensity at these two wavelengths was recorded every minute in a Spectramax plate reader. The absolute intensity values differed somewhat between the Spectramax and PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorimeters, such that the 525/480 ratio in any given experiment can only be compared with other experiments on the same machine. Acyl-CoA-mediated Inhibition of SNARE Fusion—Inverted cone-shaped lipids (IC-lipids) are amphiphilic molecules having a large hydrophilic head group area as compared with the cross-sectional area of their hydrophobic tails. When applied to the outer leaflet of fusing membranes, they inhibit the type of hourglass curvature thought to be reminiscent of the stalk and fusion pore structure (Fig. 1, A and B). As such, they provide an avenue for blocking membrane fusion at or just before the formation of the stalk. To investigate intermediates in SNARE-mediated fusion, we screened a variety of IC-lipids for their ability to inhibit fusion in our reconstituted liposome assay. All of the compounds that elicited some degree of inhibition are listed in Table 1. Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE) molecules having acyl-chains of either 14 or 16 carbons resulted in only a moderate level of inhibition. We could also consistently observe some inhibition by both lyso-PC and lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS); however, we avoided further experimentation with these molecules because of their greater propensity toward liposome solubilization at high concentration (15Chen X. Arac D. Wang T.M. Gilpin C.J. Zimmerberg J. Rizo J. Biophys. J. 2005; 90: 2062-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In a similar study, Chen et al. (15Chen X. Arac D. Wang T.M. Gilpin C.J. Zimmerberg J. Rizo J. Biophys. J. 2005; 90: 2062-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) recently showed that lyso-PC could elicit ∼50% reduction in the rate of lipid mixing at concentrations between 100 and 330 μm. At higher concentrations, they observed an increase in fluorescence dequenching, signifying solubilization. We observed similar phenomena, with some compounds (like lyso-PC) exhibiting a plateau in inhibitory concentration. Indeed, a significant difficulty in characterizing IC-lipid behavior with our system is that the total lipid concentration is very high (∼1.5 mm), requiring high concentrations of inhibitor. Not surprisingly, detergent molecules like Tween 20 were also unusable. One class of molecules that worked well and did not result in liposome lysis is the family of fatty acyl-CoAs (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1Inverted cone-shaped lipidMaximal inhibition of fusionIC50%μmLauryl-CoA (C12)14 ± 3167Myristoyl-CoA (C14)79 ± 11137 ± 34Palmitoyl-CoA (C16)99 ± 5151 ± 17Stearoyl-CoA (C18)101 ± 6129 ± 11Lyso-PC (egg yolk)36 ± 2167Lyso-PE (C14-PE)30 ± 1990Lyso-PE (C16-PE)28 ± 2465 Open table in a new tab Acyl-CoAs are the single hydrocarbon chain substrates used in fatty acid synthesis and protein acylation. Within the cell, the free acyl-CoA population is very low (0.1–200 nm) (16Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and their known effects on trafficking or fusion are limited to their direct manipulation of the acylation state of various proteins (17Pfanner N. Orci L. Glick B.S. Amherdt M. Arden S.R. Malhotra V. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 95-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Pfanner N. Glick B.S. Arden S.R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Structurally, however, the acyl-CoAs resemble other IC-lipids, and their reduced propensity to lyse liposomes makes them an especially attractive tool for our in vitro analysis. To test their effects on fusion, acyl-CoAs were preincubated with t-SNARE liposomes for 7 min prior to the addition of v-SNARE liposomes (Fig. 2). Acyl-CoAs reduced the rate and extent of fusion in a hydrocarbon length-dependent manner. At roughly 10 mol % lipid, lauryl-CoA (C12) elicited only a 10% (±10%) reduction in the final extent of fusion, whereas at the same concentration palmitoyl-CoA (C16) inhibition was significant (76% ± 5%). At higher concentrations C16 and C18 (stearoyl-CoA) could completely inhibit. The length dependence correlates nicely with the bilayer partition coefficients of the varying acyl-CoAs (19Powell G.L. Grothusen J.R. Zimmerman J.K. Evans C.A. Fish W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12740-12747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reminiscent of the bilayer partition coefficient dependence of lyso-PC-mediated inhibition of viral membrane fusion (20Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Frolov V. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Residual fusion in the presence of acyl-CoAs was completely blocked if t-SNARE liposomes were preincubated with the soluble domain of VAMP2 (Vsol), a competitive inhibitor for SNARE-mediated fusion. The apparent IC50 of inhibition is approximately the same for all three chain lengths and similar even for two lengths of lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE) (Table 1). Interestingly, previous studies focusing on lyso-PC demonstrated an inhibitory effect when the lipid antagonist was present at >10 mol % total lipid. In comparison then, an apparent IC50 of ∼150 μm would be predicted in our 1.5 mm total lipid liposome assay, very similar to the measured values. A hallmark of IC-lipid-mediated inhibition is reversibility by removal of the IC-lipids. BSA has as many as five independent sites for binding free fatty acids or fatty acyl moieties (21Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 22Gelamo E.L. Silva C.H. Imasato H. Tabak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 84-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar); therefore we tested whether adding BSA during a fusion reaction could overcome the inhibition. The addition of BSA to a C16-inhibited fusion reaction caused an increase in the rate of fusion within 3 min of BSA application (Fig. 3A). After BSA addition, the rate of fusion in the inhibitor-containing sample was greater than at any point during the inhibitor-free control assay, suggesting that liposomes bound through partially assembled trans-SNARE complexes had accumulated in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 3). BSA had no effect on control (inhibitor-free) assays. Importantly, the acyl-CoAs are not activating an additional subpopulation of liposomes. The final level of fluorescence dequenching is the same in samples with and without IC-lipids, suggesting that the same numbers of liposomes proceed through fusion. For convenience, most of our experiments were conducted by adding acyl-CoA to liposomes immediately before running the fusion assay. To establish that acyl-CoA was working within the plane of the membrane (rather than from an excess in solution), we preincubated liposomes with acyl-CoA and then refloated those liposomes over a nycodenz gradient to remove free IC-lipid. These treated liposomes were much less fusogenic than untreated and rapidly fused after BSA treatment, indicating that the acyl-CoA is absorbed into and active upon the membrane surface (data not shown). The recovery rate is dependent upon the incubation time of the inhibitor lipid prior to BSA addition. For stearoyl-CoA-inhibited reactions, this rate of recovery continued to increase up to 45 min, indicating that new complexes continue to form over that time period (data not shown). The concentration of BSA needed to elicit 80% of the maximal recovery from 200 μm C16 was 72 μm (Fig. 3B, inset); therefore each fatty acid-free BSA was likely binding two or three molecules of acyl-CoA. The burst of fusion following BSA addition lasted only ∼10 min, after which the rate of fusion matched the control sample. Thus, all accumulated trans-SNARE-bound liposomes likely completed fusion within 10 min. From these collected results, we can conclude that a rate-limiting step for SNARE-mediated fusion of liposomes involves formation of the initial trans-SNARE complex, possibly including the organization of a higher order structure, prior to the development of a highly curved membrane surface. Accumulated trans-SNARE Complexes Are Only Partially Assembled—trans-SNARE complexes form when the coiled-coil domains from SNAREs anchored in separate membranes come together. The precise organization of these complexes and the intermediate states sampled during their assembly are largely unknown. A popular hypothesis posits directed zippering of the coiled-coil domains of v- and t-SNAREs from their membrane distal N termini to their membrane proximal C termini to pull the membranes together. A variety of in vivo and in vitro results have been interpreted to support this model (9Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J.

Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), but it remains controversial. For example, from single-molecule FRET experiments, a one-step assembly was proposed (23Zhang F. Chen Y. Su Z. Shin Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38668-38672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two similar electrophysiological studies of exocytosis from SNARE coiled-coil domain mutants also failed to produce a consensus model, with one group supporting the zippering hypothesis (24Nagy G.

Chen X. Khant H.A. Ubach J. Ludtke S.J. Kikkawa M. Johnson A.E. Chiu W. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, the trans-SNARE state might be expected to have any of a number of SNARE surfaces exposed in our trapped intermediate. We next explored whether the lipid-inhibited complexes exhibited a degree of incomplete assembly (or partial disassembly) by utilizing a number of probes of SNARE-mediated fusion described previously. There is only one other example of a stable fusion intermediate for reconstituted SNARE liposomes. When liposomes are incubated together at 4 °C, SNAREpin formation is kinetically trapped (Ref. 8Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar and Fig. 4A). Warming to 37 °C results in a burst of fusion as the preformed trans-SNARE complexes proceed through to fusion. These preformed complexes are largely resistant to subsequent addition of Vsol, indicating that they have assembled past the point of reversibility (because Vsol will occupy the same space as liposome-embedded VAMP2). When acyl-CoA-inhibited reactions are challenged with Vsol early in the assay, subsequent recovery by BSA is completely abolished (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, Vsol is equally effective even when added just minutes before BSA (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that the preassembled complexes accumulated over the previous hour are fully susceptible to Vsol inhibition. This suggests that these complexes are loosely zippered/assembled and that the t-SNARE is still accessible to the competing soluble VAMP2. Likewise, the assembled complexes remain sensitive to Tsol, demonstrating similar accessibility of the loosely zippered VAMP2 (data not shown). Thus, although both 4 °C and acyl-CoA stabilized intermediates appear to have progressed beyond the rate-limiting step of the assay, the 4 °C blocked complex is closer to completion. In vivo, synaptic vesicles that respond on a subsecond time scale to calcium influxes make up the readily releasable pool. The existence of a preformed SNARE complex has been inferred from the observation that this pool is resistant to neurotox"
https://openalex.org/W2038340969,"Glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD-Ib) is caused by a deficiency in the ubiquitously expressed glucose 6-phosphate transporter (Glc-6-PT). Glc-6-PT activity has been shown to be critical in the liver and kidney where a deficiency disrupts glucose homeostasis. GSD-Ib patients also have defects in the neutrophil respiratory burst, chemotaxis, and calcium flux. They also manifest neutropenia, but whether Glc-6-PT deficiency in the bone marrow underlies myeloid dysfunctions in GSD-Ib remains controversial. To address this, we transferred bone marrow from Glc-6-PT-deficient (Glc-6-PT–/–) mice to wild-type mice to generate chimeric mice (BM-Glc-6-PT–/–). As a control, we also transferred bone marrow between wild-type mice (BM-Glc-6-PT+/+). While BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ mice have normal myeloid functions, BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice manifest myeloid abnormalities characteristic of Glc-6-PT–/– mice. Both have impairments in their neutrophil respiratory burst, chemotaxis response, and calcium flux activities and exhibit neutropenia. In the bone marrow of BM-Glc-6-PT–/– and Glc-6-PT–/– mice, the numbers of myeloid progenitor cells are increased, while in the serum there is an increase in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and chemokine KC levels. Moreover, in an experimental model of peritoneal inflammation, local production of KC and the related chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-2 is decreased in both BM-Glc-6-PT–/– and Glc-6-PT–/– mice along with depressed peritoneal neutrophil accumulation. The neutrophil recruitment defect was less severe in BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice than in Glc-6-PT–/– mice. These findings demonstrate that Glc-6-PT expression in bone marrow and neutrophils is required for normal myeloid functions and that non-marrow Glc-6-PT activity also influences some myeloid functions.

While this combined therapy improves the metabolic abnormalities and myeloid functions of the patient, the underlying pathological process remains untreated, and long term liver and kidney complications as well as inflammatory bowl disease still develop in adult patients.

While the transplanted GSD-Ib patients do show improved metabolic profiles, the consequence on the myeloid dysfunction remains controversial. In two transplant patients, neutropenia was resolved, at least for the first 3 and 4 years after transplantation (12Martinez-Olmos M.A. Lopez-Sanroman A. Martin-Vaquero P. Molina-Perez E. Barcena R.

Since the primary function of the liver is to maintain glucose homeostasis, it is not immediately obvious how orthotopic liver transplantation could resolve myeloid dysfunctions. Since myeloid cells mature within the bone marrow in mammals (14Sieff C.A. Nathan D.G. Clark S.C. Nathon D.G. Orkin S.H. 5th Ed. Hematology of Infancy and Childhood. 1. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1998: 161-236Google Scholar), it is more likely that bone marrow transplantation would be able to resolve the myeloid dysfunctions. To this end we have performed myeloid transplantation experiments between wild-type and Glc-6-PT-deficient (Glc-6-PT–/–) mice to determine whether Glc-6-PT expression in the bone marrow is linked to myeloid functions.We have generated Glc-6-PT–/– mice that manifest both the metabolic and myeloid dysfunctions of the human disorder (15Chen L.-Y.

The Glc-6-PT-deficient mice exhibit neutropenia along with defects in neutrophil respiratory burst, chemotaxis, and calcium flux, in response to the bacterial peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). We have also shown that Glc-6-PT–/– neutrophils derived from these mice are defective in chemotaxis and in calcium flux, induced by the chemokines KC and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) (15Chen L.-Y. Shieh J.-J. Lin B. Pan C.-J. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. Roe T.F. Moses S. Ward J.M. Westphal H. Lee E.J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, local production of these chemokines, and the resultant neutrophil trafficking in vivo, are depressed in Glc-6-PT–/– ascites during an inflammatory response. The bone marrows of Glc-6-PT–/– mice have an elevated number of myeloid progenitor cells and a corresponding increase in serum G-CSF and KC levels (15Chen L.-Y. Shieh J.-J. Lin B. Pan C.-J. Gao J.-L.

In this study, we show that wild-type mice receiving Glc-6-PT–/– bone marrow manifest the myeloid dysfunctions characteristic of GSD-Ib, which establishes that Glc-6-PT plays a functional role in bone marrow cells and is required for normal myeloid functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTransplantation of Glc-6-PT+/+ or Glc-6-PT+/– Mice with Glc-6-PT–/– Bone Marrows—All animal studies were conducted under an animal protocol approved by the NICHD Animal Care and Use Committee.

Since the phenotypes of Glc-6-PT+/+ and Glc-6-PT+/– mice are identical, both exhibiting normal development, metabolic functions, and myeloid functions (15Chen L.-Y. Shieh J.-J. Lin B. Pan C.-J.

For 2 weeks following irradiation, the mice were housed in specific pathogen free conditions and provided with water treated with trimethoprim (0.16 mg/ml) and sulfadiazine (0.8 mg/ml) to prevent intestinal bacteria invading surrounding tissues of the immune compromised mice.Donor bone marrow cells were harvested from 3- or 5-week-old Glc-6-PT–/– mice by flushing the femurs and tibias with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells in the resulting lavage were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS at 4 to 8 × 107 cells/ml. For controls, donor cells were also collected from 3- or 5-week-old Glc-6-PT+/+ mice.Within 1–5 h of irradiation, the Glc-6-PT+/+ recipients received 8 × 106 to 1.5 × 107 Glc-6-PT–/– or Glc-6-PT+/+ bone marrow cells per mouse in 0.2 ml of PBS by tail vein injection. Eight to 10 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, the transplanted animals were euthanized and their myeloid functions assessed. The myeloid function in the transplanted mice was compared with the functions in age-matched Glc-6-PT+/+ mice and in 6–15-week-old Glc-6-PT–/– mice.Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from the bone marrows using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). The Glc-6-PT transcripts were quantified by real-time RT-PCR, in triplicate, in an Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using predesigned, gene-specific TaqMan® gene expression assays and then normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA. The Glc-6-PT probe (Applied Biosystems Assay ID Mm00484574_m1) will generate an amplicon of 56 bases containing sequences in the exons 1–2 boundary of the mouse Glc-6-PT transcript. Data were analyzed using the SDS v1.3 software (Applied Biosystems) and expression levels normalized by the level of Glc-6-PT transcript in the Glc-6-PT–/– bone marrow.Hematological and Serum Analyses—Blood samples were collected from the tail vein using EDTA-containing CAPIJECT tubes (TerumoMedical Co., Elkton, MD) for the differential leukocyte counts. Manual 200-cell leukocyte differential counts of peripheral blood cells were performed on Hema 3 (Fisher Scientific)-stained smears. Bone marrow cells from femoral and tibia bones were harvested by flushing with 3 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum.Serum glucose, total cholesterol, and uric acid were analyzed using kits obtained from Thermo Electron (Louisville, CO), triglycerides were from Sigma Diagnostics (St. Louis, MO), and lactate was from Trinity Biotech (St. Louis, MO).Isolation of Mouse Neutrophils and Cytokine Assays—Mice were injected in the peritoneum with 3% thioglycollate (1 ml/25 g of body weight) 4 h prior to peritoneal lavage with 2 ml PBS. The lavage was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min to pellet cells and the supernatant used for cytokine analysis. The cytokines, G-CSF, KC, and MIP-2 were quantified using Quantikine ELISA kits (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN).Respiratory Burst, Chemotaxis, and [Ca2+]i Measurements—The respiratory burst of neutrophils was monitored by luminal amplified chemiluminescence using the LumiMax superoxide anion detection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Victor Light 1420 Luminoscence counter (PerkinElmer Life & Analytical Sciences, Inc, Wellesley, MA). The assay mixture (0.2 ml) contained 200 μm luminol, 250 μm enhancer, and 2 × 105 neutrophils in HBSS. Neutrophils were activated with 200 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) in HBSS or HBSS as a control.Chemotaxis was performed in 48-well chambers (Neuro-Probe, Gaithersburg, MD) using polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes with 3-μm pores as described previously (16Gao J.L. Lee E.J. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Lower chambers contained chemoattractant dissolved in HEPES-buffered RPMI medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (RPMI-BSA). Upper chambers contained 5 × 104 neutrophils in 50 μl of RPMI-BSA. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the membrane was removed, rinsed with PBS, fixed, and stained with Hema 3. Cells were counted in six randomly selected fields at 400-fold magnification and reported as the mean average.For intracellular calcium ion concentration measurements ([Ca2+]i), cells were loaded with FLIPER calcium 3 assay kit component A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol. Cells were first washed in HEPES-HBSS buffer (1× HBSS containing 10 mm HEPES) and resuspended at 107 cells/ml of buffer. One hundred μl of cell suspension was pipetted into each well of a poly-l-lysine (Sigma) coated 96-well plate (Greiner, Longwood, FL), followed by 100 μl of FLIPER calcium 3 assay kit component A dissolved in HEPES-HBSS Buffer. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The plate was loaded into the reading chamber of a Flexstation fluorimeter (Molecular Devices) set at 37 °C. The appropriate ligands, fMLP (Sigma) and MIP-2 or KC (PeproTech Inc., Rochy Hill, NJ), were diluted in HEPES-HBSS containing 1% BSA and added to the plate robotically. Cells were excited at 485 nm and the fluorescence intensities detected at 515 nm.Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Assays—Progenitor cells were assayed in semisolid agar cultures by plating 2 × 104 bone marrow mononuclear cells in 1 ml of methylcellulose media (MethoCult M3231, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with the indicated cytokines. The number of colonies larger than 50 cells was counted on days 7–9. Recombinant murine cytokines (R&D Systems) used were: G-CSF (10 ng/ml), granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) (10 ng/ml), or macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) (2.5 ng/ml).Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis using the unpaired t test was performed with The GraphPad Prism Program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Values were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSReconstitution of Glc-6-PT+/+ Mice with Glc-6-PT–/– Bone Marrows—We used bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to examine if the loss of Glc-6-PT expression in bone marrow is associated with the myeloid dysfunctions observed in GSD-Ib. Three- or five-week-old, irradiated Glc-6-PT+/+ mice were reconstituted with bone marrows from Glc-6-PT–/– donors, to create BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice. As controls, irradiated Glc-6-PT+/+ mice were reconstituted with bone marrows from Glc-6-PT+/+ donors, to create BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ mice. Myeloid functions of the transplanted mice were assessed between 8 and 10 weeks after BMT. Approximately 80% of BM-Glc-6-PT–/– and BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ mice survived BMT but none of the 76 irradiated Glc-6-PT+/+ mice receiving no BMT survived, demonstrating that the irradiated Glc-6-PT+/+ mice lacked the ability to reconstitute their own marrow and transplant recipients were being reconstituted from the donor cells.Real-time PCR was used to measure the level of expression of the Glc-6-PT gene in RNA isolated from bone marrows of the BM-Glc-6-PT–/– and BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ mice as well as the control Glc-6-PT+/+ and Glc-6-PT–/– mice. Since the probe used in the assay (Assay ID Mm00484574_m1) flanks more than just the deleted sequences in the mouse Glc-6-PT mRNA, a low level of signal is detected in the Glc-6-PT–/– mice, as a result of a linear amplification of the non-deleted region (Fig. 1). Eight to 10 weeks after transplantation, the BM-Glc-6-PT–/– bone marrows express similar levels of Glc-6-PT transcript as the Glc-6-PT–/– bone marrows and likewise the BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ bone marrows express similar levels of Glc-6-PT transcript as the Glc-6-PT+/+ bone marrows (Fig. 1). Therefore the irradiated Glc-6-PT+/+ mice were successfully reconstituted with either Glc-6-PT–/– or Glc-6-PT+/+ marrows, and little, if any, residual Glc-6-PT+/+ bone marrow remained in the BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice.The BM-Glc-6-PT–/– Mice Do Not Manifest Metabolic Abnormalities Characteristics of GSD-Ib—The BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice exhibit none of the metabolic deficiencies typical of GSD-Ib. The body weights of BM-Glc-6-PT–/– animals were comparable with that of age-matched Glc-6-PT+/+ mice, the liver and kidneys of the BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice were a normal size, and there was no abnormal glycogen accumulation in either organ (data not shown). While the Glc-6-PT–/– control mice manifested hypoglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, and lactic acidemia (Fig. 2), the BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice exhibited blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid, and lactate profiles comparable with the Glc-6-PT+/+ control mice (Fig. 2). As expected, the BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ mice exhibited the same metabolic functions as the wild-type mice (data not shown). Therefore a Glc-6-PT deficiency in bone-marrow does not disrupt glucose homeostasis.FIGURE 2The plasma concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid, and lactate in wild-type, BM-Glc-6-PT–/–, and Glc-6-PT–/– and mice.

The BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice also manifest mild neutropenia and have only 65% of the wild-type neutrophil counts (Fig. 3A). As expected, neutrophil counts in the BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ are similar to those of wild-type mice.FIGURE 3Myeloid function in wild-type, Glc-6-PT–/–, and bone marrow transplanted mice.

Twelve Glc-6-PT+/+, six BM-Glc-6-PT+/+, nine BM-Glc-6-PT–/–, and eight Glc-6-PT–/– mice were used, and values plotted represent the mean ± S.E. The unpaired t test was used to evaluate the statistical difference between Glc-6-PT+/+ and BM-Glc-6-PT–/–, Glc-6-PT–/–, or BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ mice. p < 0.05 for blood neutrophils between Glc-6-PT+/+ and BM-Glc-6-PT–/– or Glc-6-PT–/– mice; p < 0.01 for total recruited peritoneal cell counts between Glc-6-PT+/+ and BM-Glc-6-PT–/– or Glc-6-PT–/– mice.

Results are the mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations using peritoneal neutrophils from Glc-6-PT+/+ (○), BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ (•), BM-Glc-6-PT–/– (▾), or Glc-6-PT–/– (▿) mice in the presence of PMA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate leads to the recruitment of neutrophils into the peritoneal space and is an effective method of neutrophil isolation in mice (17Baron E.J. Proctor R.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 49: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of thioglycollate on the absolute cell counts in peritoneal exudates. Within the peritoneum, large numbers of neutrophils accumulate in Glc-6-PT+/+ as well as in BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ mice (Fig. 3B). In contrast, accumulation in the Glc-6-PT–/– peritoneum is decreased to 36% of controls (Fig. 3B). For BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice, peritoneal neutrophil recruitment is reduced to 72.5% of that in the Glc-6-PT+/+ mice (Fig. 3B). This is a less severe reduction than seen with the Glc-6-PT–/– control mice, suggesting that neutrophil recruitment is only partially impaired by a deficiency of Glc-6-PT in the bone marrow and that Glc-6-PT expression in other tissues must contribute to neutrophil recruitment also.Neutrophils in GSD-Ib patients (7Gitzelmann R.

In Glc-6-PT+/+ mice, superoxide production in thioglycollate-recruited peritoneal neutrophils is markedly increased by exposure to PMA, and the activity remains elevated for more than 25 min (Fig. 3C). In BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ neutrophils an activity similar to wild type is seen. However, for both the Glc-6-PT–/– and BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice, PMA-stimulated superoxide production is reduced in neutrophils (Fig. 3C), implying Glc-6-PT expression in bone marrow is important for the respiratory burst.Neutrophils from GSD-Ib patients are impaired in chemotaxis toward the bacterial peptide fMLP (7Gitzelmann R.

Similarly, neutrophils from Glc-6-PT–/– mice are impaired in chemotaxis toward fMLP as well as the chemokines, KC, and MIP-2 (15Chen L.-Y. Shieh J.-J. Lin B. Pan C.-J. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. Roe T.F.

Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal neutrophils from Glc-6-PT+/+ mice exhibited a greater dose-dependent chemotactic response to fMLP, KC, and MIP-2 than neutrophils from Glc-6-PT–/– mice (Fig. 4A). The BM-Glc-6-PT–/– mice had a similarly impaired chemotaxis toward fMLP, KC, and MIP-2 (Fig. 4A). However, neutrophils from BM-Glc-6-PT+/+ mice exhibited a dose-dependent chemotactic responses indistinguishable from that of Glc-6-PT+/+ mice.FIGURE 4Chemotaxis and calcium flux responses in neutrophils of wild-type, Glc-6-PT–/–, and bone marro"
https://openalex.org/W1989784728,"Rybp (DEDAF) is a member of the Rybp/Yaf2 protein family and has been shown to encode pro-apoptotic functions and to be essential for mouse embryogenesis. The related Yaf2 protein has not been studied extensively at the cellular or organismal levels. Here we describe zebrafish yaf2 (zyaf2) and show that it is widely expressed during early embryogenesis, with subsequent enrichment of transcripts in the anterior head region. Depletion of zYaf2 during embryogenesis using specific morpholinos activates a wide-spread program of apoptosis and causes developmental arrest before the one somite stage. Partial depletion of Yaf2, achieved by injecting lower dosages of morpholino, circumvents the early arrest but leads to CNS degeneration associated with excessive apoptosis. These phenotypes can be rescued by co-injection of human YAF2 mRNA with the morpholinos or by treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor or a caspase 8-specific inhibitor. Finally, the observed activation of caspase 8 in the morphants is in accord with the ability of Yaf2 to inhibit caspase 8-mediated apoptosis in cultured cells. Our findings implicate Yaf2 as a survival factor during early zebrafish development and organogenesis. This may suggest that Yaf2 and Rybp can encode opposing functions in the regulation of apoptosis.

Programmed cell death affects many different aspects of development including sculpting structures, controlling cell number, and eliminating abnormal, misplaced, or harmful cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Jacobson M.D. Weil M.

It has been suggested that the default for developing cells is cell death, and that trophic factors (e.g. NGF, GDNF) and morphogens (e.g. Shh and Wnt) are needed to keep cells alive by inhibiting apoptotic pathways and activating cell survival pathways (reviewed in Ref. 4Mehlen P. Mille F. Thibert C. J. Neurobiol. 2005; 64: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the adult organism, apoptotic pathways are essential to eliminate cells at risk for neoplastic transformation (reviewed in Refs. 5Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar and 6Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Because of the important role that apoptotic pathways play in normal and neoplastic development, relevant protein components are expressed constitutively, and their activity is maintained by many regulatory proteins (reviewed in Refs. 3Twomey C. McCarthy J.V. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and 7Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Well-known regulatory proteins include the Bcl2 protein family, the IAPs, SMAC/DIABLO, and the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (reviewed in Refs. 7Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar and 8Ni T. Li W. Zou F. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A recently characterized, putative regulator of apoptosis is Rybp (also known as DEDAF), a zinc finger-containing protein that belongs to a family of proteins that also includes Yaf2 (9Garcia E. Marcos-Gutierrez C. del Mar Lorente M. Moreno J.C. Vidal M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3404-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Kalenik J.L. Chen D. Bradley M.E. Chen S.J. Lee T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Rybp has been shown to interact with death effector domain (DED) 2The abbreviations used are: DED, death effector domain; AO, acridine orange; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; CNS, central nervous system; hpf, hours post-fertilization; MO, morpholino; PcG, Polycomb Group; SS, splice site; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling; zIETD-fmk, benzylozycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; zLETD-aminoluciferin, benzylozycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-Thr-Asp-aminoluciferin; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; PFA, paraformaldehyde. -containing proteins including FADD, caspase 8, caspase 10, and DEDD (11Zheng L. Schickling O. Peter M.E. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31945-31952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The first three of these interacting proteins are components of the extrinsic or death receptor apoptotic pathway, while DEDD is a nucleolar protein that promotes apoptosis in the nucleolus as well as in the cytosol after its translocation (reviewed in Ref. 12Tibbetts M.D. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar; also see Ref. 13Lee J.C. Wang G.X. Schickling O. Peter M.E. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and references therein). A pro-apoptotic role for Rybp was suggested because, it could promote formation of the DISC (death-inducing signaling complex comprising Fas, FADD, and pro-caspase 8) in 293T cells, and enhance Fas- and caspase 10 DED-mediated apoptosis in lymphoma cell lines (11Zheng L. Schickling O. Peter M.E. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31945-31952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In a separate study, Rybp was shown to interact with the viral protein Apoptin, and to enhance apoptosis in transformed cells but not primary cells (14Danen-Van Oorschot A.A. Voskamp P. Seelen M.C. Van Miltenburg M.H. Bolk M.W. Tait S.W. Boesen-De Cock J.G. Rohn J.L. Borst J. Noteborn M.H. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, Rybp has been shown to be up-regulated (with a corresponding decrease in a miRNA that may target it) in breast cancer cells that have been treated with a pro-apoptotic dose of the HDAC inhibitor LAQ824 (15Scott G.K. Mattie M.D. Berger C.E. Benz S.C. Benz C.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous null for Rybp died around the time of implantation, and exhibited embryonic and extraembryonic defects (16Pirity M.K. Locker J. Schreiber-Agus N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7193-7202Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Of note, rybp–/– embryos were unable to trigger full decidualization in vivo, as evidenced by the lack of a normal apoptotic response following the initiation of implantation. Beyond this phenotype, a subset of the Rybp heterozygous null mice exhibited an exencephalic phenotype because of disrupted neural tube closure. This mouse model demonstrated that the effects of Rybp loss are dose-dependent, and that Rybp has a role in early development as well as in brain organogenesis. Moreover, even though Yaf2 is structurally and functionally related to Rybp, it cannot fully compensate for Rybp loss (16Pirity M.K. Locker J. Schreiber-Agus N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7193-7202Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To date, Yaf2 has not been studied in the context of a developing organism, and a link between Yaf2 and apoptosis has not been described. In this study, we characterized the zebrafish ortholog of yaf2 and employed antisense morpholino oligomers to knock-down Yaf2 expression during zebrafish embryogenesis. Yaf2 morphant embryos exhibited a dramatic increase in the level of caspase-dependent cell death that was causal to a developmental arrest prior to the one somite stage. With decreased dosage of the morpholinos, the morphological defects became less severe and an essential role for Yaf2 in maintaining the anterior central nervous system (CNS) was revealed. Once again, the disruptions in the CNS resulted at least in part from excessive apoptosis. These findings implicate Yaf2 as a survival factor during early development and organogenesis. This function of Yaf2 may relate in part to its newly recognized ability to inhibit caspase 8-mediated apoptosis. Zebrafish embryos were maintained at 28.5 °C and staged as described (17Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995: 1.1-3.26Google Scholar). The wild-type fish strain used was an AB/TUB hybrid; both the AB and Tübingen fish were acquired from the Zebrafish International Research Center (Eugene, OR). All of the injections and embryo observations were performed on a Nikon SM1500 dissecting microscope. The bright field, in situ hybridization, and TUNEL microscopy/photography were performed on a Nikon SM1500 fluorescent microscope with a Diagnostic Instruments Insight Firewire 2 digital camera; the pictures were captured with SPOT advanced software. The one somite arrest morphants were scored based on the (i) lack of somite development and (ii) darkened, rounded up cells around the yolk. Moreover, the Yaf2 morphant embryos remained in this arrested state, until dying by 30 hpf. The hypomorphic embryos were first scored at the 10 somite stage where a dark band of dying cells could be seen beneath the eyes. In later stages, the hypomorphic phenotype was easily scored by the progressive anterior brain degeneration.

Sequences corresponding to the purchased IMAGE clone (7222218) for zyaf2 can be accessed through the NCBI Nucleotide Database under GenBank™ accession no. CN016939. was obtained from Open Biosystems. The full-length ORF of zyaf2 was amplified with the following primers: forward primer 5′-GGGGATCCGGAGGAATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGGAGACAAGAGGAGTCCGACGAGG-3′ (introduced a BamHI site and an in-frame N-terminal FLAG tag) and reverse primer 5′-CCGAATTCCTAGTGAGATTCCCCGTTGAG-3′ (introduced an EcoRI site). The FLAG-tagged zebrafish yaf2 insert was then subcloned into the pCS2+ and pcDNA3.1 expression vectors. Human YAF2 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Te-Cheung Lee, a C-terminal FLAG tag was introduced by PCR, and the PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1. For the rescue experiments, mutations in the wobble position were made in amino acids 2–4 of the hYAF2 coding region by PCR mutagenesis on an hYAF2-FLAG template using the following primer, which also introduced a BamHI site: 5′-CGGGATCCCCAAGCCATGGGCGATAAAAAGAGCCCCACCAGG-3′ (the changed nucleotides are in bold). The 3′ primer was directed to the pCDNA3.1 vector (5′-CAGATGGCTGGCAACTAG-3′). The hYAF2-FLAG PCR product was then subcloned into pCS2+. Mouse rybp was cloned with a C-terminal FLAG tag by RT-PCR with 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCCCGTCCATGACCATGGGCGACAAG-3′ (introduced an EcoRI site) and 3′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCATCATTCACTGCTGACATGTCG-3′ (introduced an EcoRI site), and the PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 that carried a FLAG tag. Human caspase 8 DED was cloned into the pCDNA 3.1 vector using primers that added an N-terminal HA tag with the forward primer, 5′-GGCAAGCTTGCCATGGTTGGATACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGACTTCAGCAGAAATCCTTATG-3′ (introduced a HindIII site) and reverse primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCCGGTCATTTGCTTTTCATTTGGTAAAC-3′ (introduced a BamHI site and added a stop codon after amino acid 216). Human caspase 8 was cloned into pIRES2 EGFP (Clontech) by PCR with forward primer, 5′-ACGCGTCGACATGGACTTCAGCAGAAATCTTTATG-3′ (introduced a SalI site) and reverse primer, 5′-CGGGGATCCGTCAATCAGAAGGGAAGACAAG (introduced a BamHI site). Zebrafish caspase 8 was cloned by RT-PCR from embryonic zebrafish mRNA using the forward primer, 5′-CGGAATTCGCCATGGTTGGATACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGATCCTCAGATCTTTCACGAG-3′ (introduced an EcoR1 site) and reverse primer, 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGTCTATGGGCAGCACTAGTTTCTTGG-3′ (introduced an EcoR1 site); the PCR product was subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1 expression vector. Additional details regarding construct generation are available upon request. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma) in PBS overnight and then dechorionated and stored in 100% methanol. Embryos older than 24 hpf were treated with 0.003% phenylthiourea (Sigma) to prevent pigmentation. Before probing, embryos were rehydrated and, if older than 24 hpf, treated with proteinase K (10 μg/ml) at room temperature for 5–45 min depending upon stage. The embryos were then refixed in 4% PFA for 1 h, and prehybridized in a 57% formamide hybridization buffer for 1 h at 70 °C. The buffer was replaced with 57% formamide hybridization buffer containing 1 ng/μl of the digoxigenin-labeled probe, and hybridization was performed at 70 °C overnight. Embryos were exposed to sheep anti-digoxigenin Fab antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at room temperature. The signal was detected using alkaline phosphatase NBT/BCIP staining, and the embryos were then cleared in a BB:BA 2:1 solution. To generate the probes, the expression constructs were linearized and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. Antisense RNA was generated using an in vitro transcription kit (Promega) and labeled with a digoxigenin NTP mix (Roche Applied Science). The probes were purified over G-50 Sephadex RNA columns (Roche Applied Science) and the concentration determined by spectrophotometry. The zyaf2 probe comprised the full open reading frame subcloned into pCS2+. The zCaspase 8 probe in pCS2+ contained its open reading frame from amino acid 131 to the end (amino acid 476). SK-zopl1 was provided by Dr. Hazel Sive, pCS2+ zotx2 was provided by Dr. Shuo Lin, KS+ zkrox20 was provided by Dr. Yu Chen, and pSPORT1 zpax2.1 was obtained from the ZFIN zebrafish data base (ID: ZDB-EST-021126-10). Two phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers were generated (by Open Biosystems and GeneTools) against the Yaf2 sequence. The ATG morpholino (ATG MO) (5′-CGTCGGACTCCTCTTGTCTCCCATG-3′) is complementary to –1 thru +24 relative to the zYaf2 translation initiation codon. The splice site morpholino (SS MO) (5′-ATTGCAGCTTCACCTCATTTTCTTG-3′) is targeted to the splice donor in the long intron following the penultimate exon in the zebrafish yaf2 genomic locus.3 BLAST searches predicted that the morpholinos were specific for yaf2. The three zyaf2 mRNA isoforms that have been identified3 would all be targeted by the splice site morpholino, which gives the same phenotype as the ATG morpholino that would only affect the predominant isoform that is the focus of this report. A morpholino (5′-ATATCCATCACACTGGCGGC-3′), based on the pBluescript vector (Stratagene), was used as a control in the injections. Morpholinos were injected into fertilized eggs at the 1–2 cell stage in a total volume of 2.3 nl. RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. First-strand cDNA was generated using the Superscript First-strand PCR kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers, and then amplified by PCR using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen). The primers used to amplify yaf2 were the same primers used for the subcloning into pCS2+. The same first strand cDNA samples were amplified with primers for the housekeeping gene β-actin: forward primer, 5′-AAGCAGGAGTACGATGAGTCTG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GGTAAACGCTTCTGGAATGAC-3′. TUNEL Assay—Injected embryos were staged and fixed overnight in 4% PFA. After washing with PBST, they were dechorionated and dehydrated into 100% methanol. Prior to staining, the embryos were rehydrated into PBST, post-fixed for 1 h in 4% PFA, blocked for 1 h in 1 × TdT buffer, and incubated with a mixture of the TdT enzyme (150 units/ml; Invitrogen) and digoxigenin-labeled dUTP (0.5 μm; Roche Applied Science) overnight at room temperature. The embryos were then washed first in PBST/1 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 2 h and then in PBST/bovine serum albumin. Embryos were exposed to anti-digoxigenin Fab antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C. The signal was detected using alkaline phosphatase NBT/BCIP staining and the embryos were then cleared in a BB:BA 2:1 solution. zVAD-fmk and zIETD-fmk Treatment—Four hours after injection with the morpholinos, a hole was made in the chorions using watchmaker's forceps, and the embryos were transferred to a 60-mm glass Petri dish of E3 containing 200 nm zVAD-fmk per Ref. 18Sanders L.H. Whitlock K.E. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar or 200 nm zIETD-fmk. They were then either staged and fixed for the TUNEL assay or monitored for developmental defects by microscopy. Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide—HEK293T cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish and transfected with 3 μg of each expression construct using calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were harvested after 24 h by trypsinization (Invitrogen), resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and then a 50-μl aliquot was removed and labeled in a double blind manner. The aliquots were stained by adding 4 μl of an acridine orange (100 μg/ml)/ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml) solution. 10 μl of each sample was dotted on a glass slide, covered with a coverslip, and counted using ×180 magnification on a Nikon SM1500 fluorescent microscope per Ref. 19Ribble D. Goldstein N.B. Norris D.A. Shellman Y.G. BMC Biotechnol. 2005; 5: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar. A minimum of 200 cells were counted per point, and grouped into four categories based on nuclear morphology and stain: viable (green with intact nuclei), necrotic (orange with intact nuclei), early apoptotic with intact membrane (green with fragmented nuclei), and late apoptotic with damaged membrane (orange with fragmented nuclei). Whole cell lysates were made from the remaining cells to ensure expression of the introduced proteins. Caspase 8-Glo Assay—At the appropriate stage, 20 injected embryos were dechorionated and quick frozen in liquid nitrogen for at least 24 h. The embryos were then thawed, suspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 250 mm saccharose, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and passed through a 26.5-gauge needle. The embryo lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (as described in Ref. 20Yabu T. Kishi S. Okazaki T. Yamashita M. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 100 μl of the caspase 8-glo luciferase reagent (Promega) was added in a 1:1 ratio with 10 μl of the supernatant diluted with 90 μl of room temperature lysis buffer, and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. The assay was carried out in a Turner TD-20e luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Capped hYAF2 mRNA was made by linearizing the pCS2+ hYaf2 FLAG construct with NotI and transcribing with Sp6 using the mMessage Sp6 kit (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm the integrity of the capped mRNA, in vitro translations were performed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and resolved by SDS/PAGE followed by Western blotting. The membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:1000 FLAG antibody (Sigma, M2)) at 4 °C and probed with a 1:3000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Titration of hYAF2 mRNA injected into embryos revealed that injection of up to 200 pg did not cause any phenotypic changes. For rescue, a mixture of 5 ng of ATG MO, 200 pg of hYAF2 mRNA, and 100 mm KCl or 2.5 ng of ATG MO, 200 pg of hYAF2 mRNA, and 100 mm KCl was injected into fertilized eggs at the one cell stage, and the injected embryos were observed for appearance of the morphant phenotypes. HEK293T cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish and transfected with 5 μg of each expression construct using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in PG buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was then precleared by rotating for 20 min with a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). An 80-μl aliquot was removed, and the rest of the sample was added to a 50% protein A-Sepharose bead slurry that had been preincubated for 20 min with anti-HA antibody (12CA5; kind gift from Dr. Matthew Scharff; 50 μl per point). Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 °C, and then the immunocomplexes were washed five times in PG buffer with protease inhibitors at 4 °C. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG HRP (M2, Sigma) 1:5000. Bound antibody was detected using the Super Signal West Pico Luminol enhancer (Pierce) per the manufacturer's instructions. zyaf2 Is Highly Conserved and Its Expression Becomes Localized to the Brain during Somitogenesis—Searching the zebrafish genome for orthologs of the mammalian Yaf2 proteins revealed a BAC clone3, 4The amino acid sequences of the human, mouse, and zebrafish Yaf2 proteins can be accessed through the NCBI Protein Database under NCBI accession no.

The amino acid sequence for human and mouse Rybp can be accessed through the NCBI Protein Database under NCBI accession no. NP_036366 and NCBI accession no. NP_062717, respectively. capable of encoding a 182-amino acid protein that displayed marked homology (76% amino acid identity and 86% similarity) to mouse Yaf2 (Fig. 1, A and B). The putative zebrafish Yaf2 protein is more similar to its mammalian Yaf2 orthologs than to the mammalian Rybp proteins (Fig. 1B), and bears an N-terminal zinc finger motif characteristic of members of the Rybp/Yaf2 family (bracketed and labeled ZnF in Fig. 1A). An IMAGE clone capable of encoding this full-length putative zebrafish Yaf2 (zYaf2) protein was subcloned to include a FLAG epitope tag and expressed in HEK293T cells. Western blotting of the lysates confirmed that this clone encodes a protein of the expected size of 26 kDa (see Fig. 8 below).FIGURE 8Yaf2 interacts with caspase 8 and inhibits caspase 8-mediated apoptosis. A, HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the HA antibody, and Western-blotted with the FLAG antibody. hYaf2, zYaf2, and mRybp were recovered in caspase 8 DEDHA immunoprecipitates. Controls that were negative for the interaction included empty pCDNA vector and FLAG-tagged mMxi1-SRα (a member of the Myc/Max/Mad network that should not associate with caspase 8). Lysates probed with the FLAG and HA antibodies are shown below the IP blot. Molecular mass is shown in kDa on the left. B, HEK293T cells were transfected with human caspase 8 (hC8) alone or with either mRybp, hYaf2, or zYaf2 (left graph) or with zebrafish caspase 8 (zC8) alone or with either mRybp, hYaf2, or zYaf2 (right graph). Apoptosis was determined by nuclear morphology using an acridine orange/ethidium bromide assay. The amount of apoptosis (early+late) is graphed relative to that obtained with caspase 8 only, which is taken to be 100%. At least 200 cells per sample were counted, and the studies were performed in a double blind fashion.

As shown in Fig. 2, high levels of maternally expressed zyaf2 can be seen at the 64 cell and early epiboly stages (Fig. 2, panels a and b). Zygotic yaf2 expression is first clearly observable at the 80% epiboly stage (data not shown), and the signal intensifies from the tailbud to one somite stages (Fig. 2, panels c and d). Ubiquitous expression is observed until the 10 somite stage, at which point the signal becomes concentrated in anterior regions of the embryo (Fig. 2, panel e). By 24 and 50 h post-fertilization (hpf), the transcripts are enriched in the forebrain and midbrain (Fig. 2, panels f–i). Embryos Blocked for Yaf2 Expression Undergo an Early Developmental Arrest—To determine the physiological role of Yaf2 in vivo, we designed a translation interference antisense morpholino and injected it into embryos at the 1–2 cell stage. Seventy percent of embryos derived from fertilized eggs injected with 5 ng of this morpholino arrested development before somitogenesis (∼16 hpf) (Fig. 3A, ATG MO). These embryos developed normally through gastrulation, but failed to progress to the one somite stage (for staging see Ref. 21Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8862) Google Scholar). The developmental arrest was preceded by the appearance of “dark regions” within the embryo (Fig. 3B) that have been shown previously to indicate the presence of dying cells (22Kane D.A. Maischein H.M. Brand M. van Eeden F.J. Furutani-Seiki M. Granato M. Haffter P. Hammerschmidt M. Heisenberg C.P. Jiang Y.J. Kelsh R.N. Mullins M.C. Odenthal J. Warga R.M. Nusslein-Volhard C. Development. 1996; 123: 57-66PubMed Google Scholar). Of the morphant embryos that did not arrest, many displayed a less severe phenotype similar to that seen consistently with injection of lower doses of morpholino (described below). Injection of control morpholinos did not cause any abnormal phenotypes (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm the specificity of this phenotype, and to control for the possibility that the ATG MO might unexpectedly target another transcript, a second morpholino was designed against a zyaf2 splice junction (the splice site morpholino, or SS MO) and used similarly for injection into fertilized eggs. Injection of the SS MO resulted in a phenotype identical to that seen with the ATG MO (Fig. 3, A and B, SS MO), albeit that higher concentrations of the SS MO were required to cause the developmental arrest (20 ng of SS MO in comparison to 5 ng of ATG MO). To ensure that the SS MO was indeed effective in preventing production of a mature zyaf2 message, RT-PCR assays were performed using primers that amplify the entire yaf2 coding region and flank the splice junction to which the SS MO is targeted. These assays showed the absence of the normal yaf2 message (Fig. 3C, compare lane 6 to lane 5), a result that was confirmed by in situ hybridization assays on morphant embryos that had been injected with the SS MO (Fig. 3D). The fact that two morpholinos of entirely distinct sequences, and that function by distinct mechanisms, generate identical phenotypes indicates that the specific loss of Yaf2 is incompatible with normal embryonic development. The Early Arrest of Yaf2 Morphant Embryos Is Associated with Increased Apoptosis—To elucidate the cellular basis of the developmental arrest observed in the Yaf2 morphant embryos, we analyzed whether there was a reduction in cell proliferation or an increase in cell death. From 80% epiboly through the one somite stage, we did not find a significant change in the morphant embryos in the levels of cell proliferation, as assessed by immunofluorescence using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated histone H3 (data not shown). In contrast, loss of Yaf2 did lead to increased levels of cell death, as determined by TUNEL assays on embryos derived from fertilized eggs injected with the Yaf2-specific morpholino"
https://openalex.org/W2065681704,"The membrane mucin Muc4 has been shown to alter cellular behavior through both anti-adhesive effects on cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions and its ability to act as an intramembrane ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2. The ERK pathway is regulated by both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. An analysis of the effects of Muc4 expression on ERK phosphorylation in mammary tumor and epithelial cells, which exhibit both adhesion-dependent growth and contact inhibition of growth, showed that the effects are density dependent, with opposing effects on proliferating cells and contact-inhibited cells. In these cells, cell-matrix interactions through integrins are required for activation of the ERK mitogenesis pathway. However, cell-cell interactions via cadherins inhibit the ERK pathway. Expression of Muc4 reverses both of these effects. In contact-inhibited cells, Muc4 appears to activate the ERK pathway at the level of Raf-1; this activation does not depend on Ras activation. The increase in ERK activity correlates with an increase in cyclin D1 expression in these cells. This abrogation of contact inhibition is dependent on the number of mucin repeats in the mucin subunit of Muc4, indicative of an anti-adhesive effect. The mechanism by which Muc4 disrupts contact inhibition involves a Muc4-induced relocalization of E-cadherin from adherens junctions at the lateral membrane of the cells to the apical membrane. Muc4-induced abrogation of contact inhibition may be an important mechanism by which tumors progress from an early, more benign state to invasiveness.

Muc4-induced abrogation of contact inhibition may be an important mechanism by which tumors progress from an early, more benign state to invasiveness. Contact inhibition is the process by which epithelial cell proliferation is arrested at high cell densities (1Li S. Gerrard E. Balkovetz D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Contact inhibition of cell division occurs in culture when non-transformed cells, unlike cancerous cells, stop dividing after contacting neighboring cells on all sides (2Balkovetz D. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In adult tissues, contact inhibition is typically thought to be continuously active, and loss of contact inhibition is usually associated with abnormal growth states such as neoplastic transformation (3Fagotto F. Gumbiner B.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).

Intercellular adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin are involved in the process of contact inhibition in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Cell-cell contact mediated by E-cadherin homophilic interactions and associated catenins provides a possible mechanism by which cell growth is regulated by cell-cell contact (1Li S. Gerrard E.

Cell adhesion molecules mediate intercellular and cell-matrix interactions and modulate signal transduction. In many cells, E-cadherin acts as an adhesion-activated cell signaling receptor. Conversely, signaling pathways can directly affect the function of adhesion molecules, leading to changes in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (8Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 18-32Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Contact inhibition can be blocked by disruption of cell-cell interactions (1Li S. Gerrard E. Balkovetz D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4St. Croix B. Sheehan C. Rak J.W. Florenes V.A. Slingerland J.M. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 557-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Many of the characterized disruptors of cell-cell interactions in the contact-inhibited state are receptor tyrosine kinases activated by growth and mobility factors. A well documented disruptor of the contact-inhibited state is the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor. HGF activation of the c-Met receptor in contact-inhibited Madin-Darby canine kidney cells results in loss of contact inhibition characterized by an increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2, cyclin D1, proliferation, and scattering of these cells (1Li S. Gerrard E. Balkovetz D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Balkovetz D.

Commun. 1992; 31: 960-965Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This loss of contact inhibition correlates with an increase in apically accessible E-cadherin by a mechanism that involves relocalization of E-cadherin to the membrane domain in contact with the apical compartment, loss of tight junction integrity, and a decrease in polarization of previously well polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. HGF abrogation of contact inhibition also correlates with modulation of the association of E-cadherin with β-catenin and modulation of E-cadherin and β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation (10Balkovetz D.

Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). HGF is a potent inducer of the epidermal-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in many epithelial systems, including mammary epithelium. In normal mammary epithelial cells, HGF expression is low; however, overexpression of HGF and its receptor c-Met occurs in many types of invasive breast carcinomas. A high level of HGF expression and sustained activation of Met in breast carcinoma can promote increased EMT, invasion, and metastasis (13Elliott B.E. Hung W.L. Boag A.H. Tuck A.B. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 80: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because disruption of adherens junctions between cells has been shown to be responsible for loss of contact inhibition and because membrane mucins can disrupt cell-cell interactions, the question is raised whether the anti-adhesive properties of the membrane mucin Muc4 can disrupt contact inhibition by altering cell-cell interactions. In normal epithelial tissues, membrane mucins are expressed only on the apical surface of the cells. Rat Muc4 has been found to be expressed apically in the most accessible and vulnerable epithelia, where it has a protective function (14Carraway K.L. Perez A. Idris N. Jepson S. Arango M. Komatsu M. Haq B. Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhang J. Carothers Carraway C.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 149-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, in tumor cells, mucins are often overexpressed and localized over the whole cell surface, altering the adhesion properties of these cells and facilitating tumor progression and metastasis. Muc4 overexpression has been observed in many carcinomas of the breast, lung, pancreas, and colon (15Nagy P. Friedlander E. Tanner M. Kapanen A.I. Carraway K.L. Isola J. Jovin T.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 473-482PubMed Google Scholar, 16Moniaux N. Andrianifahanana M. Brand R.E. Batra S.K. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Rat Muc4 is a heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of a mucin subunit (asialoglycoprotein (ASGP)-1) attached to the membrane via a transmembrane subunit (ASGP2). The complex is synthesized as a 300-kDa polypeptide precursor that is cleaved into the two subunits early in its transit to the cell surface (17Sheng Z.Q. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hull S.R. Sheng Z. Vanderpuye O. David C. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ASGP2 consists of an 80-kDa polypeptide with ∼17 N-linked oligosaccharides and two epidermal growth factor-like domains, both of which have the conserved amino acid residues of active growth factors in the epidermal growth factor family (19Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Muc4 is a novel intramembrane, intracrine modulator of ErbB2 signaling. Its transmembrane subunit (ASGP2) interacts as an intramembrane ligand with the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 to modulate its localization, phosphorylation, and signaling (20Ramsauer V.P.

Cell. 2006; 7: 2931-2941Crossref Google Scholar). Muc4 is proposed to influence cell differentiation and apoptosis via its effects on the ErbB2 receptor. Upon complex formation, specific phosphorylation sites are activated in ErbB2, and phosphorylation of the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex is potentiated when the cells are stimulated with the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin (21Carraway K.L.

The mucin subunit of Muc4 (ASGP1) consists of a highly O-glycosylated 220-kDa polypeptide of 12 imperfect tandem repeats of 117-124 amino acids each. The length of this subunit has been estimated to be ∼500 nm (24Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed at the cell surface, ASGP1 provides an anti-recognition and anti-adhesive mechanism that prevents cell recognition by immune system components and that disrupts cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (25Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Komatsu M. Tatum L. Altman N.H.

The anti-adhesive effect is dependent on the number of mucin repeats in the ASGP1 subunit and on the level of Muc4 expression. Muc4 blocks cell-cell adhesion and integrin-dependent cell-extracellular matrix interaction by a nonspecific steric effect (25Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, Muc4 has two potential mechanisms by which it might block contact inhibition, an anti-adhesive effect and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2. In this study, we show that Muc4 can activate phosphorylation of ERK in cells that are contact-inhibited. No change in ErbB2 phosphorylation was observed upon Muc4 expression. Instead, the increased ERK phosphorylation correlates with the size of the mucin subunit of Muc4, indicating that the increase in signaling through the mitogenic pathway is a result of the anti-adhesive activity of Muc4. This study provides the first evidence that membrane mucin anti-adhesive effects alter cell signaling in ways that might influence tumor progression. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The establishment of the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line transfected with recombinant cDNAs for Muc4 analogs (MCF7 mh1) has been described previously (25Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF7 cells were stably transfected with a Muc4 construct containing five mucin repeats in the ASGP1 subunit and the complete ASGP2 subunit. Muc4 expression in this construct is under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (Tet-Off system). ∼30% of the cell population expresses Muc4 when induced. These cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 150 μg/ml G418, and 40 μg/ml hygromycin. Muc4 expression was repressed by culturing in medium containing 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Muc4 expression was induced in these cells by removing tetracycline for 48 h. The non-tumorigenic MCF10 mammary epithelial cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in serum-free mammary epithelial growth medium (Cambrex Corp., North Brunswick, NJ) supplemented with 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem). The metastatic SK-BR-3 mammary epithelial cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in McCoy's 5A medium with 1.5 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used at low passage numbers. MCF10A and SK-BR-3 cells were used between passages 2 and 10, and MCF7 cells between passages 9 and 15. For low density conditions, cells had reached 10% confluence at the time Muc4 was expressed. For contact-inhibited conditions, MCF7 and MCF10A cells had been cultured for 48 h after reaching confluence at the time Muc4 was expressed. Cells expressing Muc4 and control cells were starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h before being collected. Experiments done without starving the cells yielded similar results. Transient Transfections—Recombinant cDNAs for Muc4 analogs containing the complete ASGP2 subunit but varying in the number of mucin repeats in the ASGP1 subunit (containing one, three, or five mucin repeats) have been described previously (25Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MCF10A and SK-BR-3 cells were transiently transfected with these cDNAs using ExGen 500 (Fermentas Inc., Hanover, MD). Cell Lysate Preparation and Immunoblotting—Cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the plate with RIPA (radioimmune precipitation assay) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then scraped from the culture dishes to generate total cell lysates, which were then sedimented at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The protein concentration of each cell lysate was determined using the Advanced protein assay reagent (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO). 2× Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad) was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of proteins in cell lysates were loaded and separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE at 120 V for 1 h. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) for 1 h at 100 V or overnight at 15 V. Immunoblot procedures were done according to the protocol for each antibody. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies against phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 p44/p42 MAPK, p44/p42 MAPK, phospho-Ser217/Ser221 MEK1/2, MEK1/2, phospho-Thr180/Tyr182 p38, p38, phospho-Thr183/Tyr185 JNK1/2, and JNK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA); cyclin D1, p27, c-Raf, β-catenin, and E-cadherin (BD Biosciences); β-actin (Sigma); phospho-Tyr1248 ErbB2 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY); phospho-Tyr1139 ErbB2 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA); human c-ErbB2 (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA); and PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The secondary antibodies used were affinity-purified goat anti-mouse (Pierce) and anti-rabbit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) immunoglobulins coupled to peroxidase. Membranes were developed using the Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and exposed on x-ray film. The intensity of the bands was quantified by digitizing the image (Scion Image, Scion Corp.) from x-ray film. c-Raf Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Treatments—MCF7 cells were transfected with 100 nm c-Raf or control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA using Dharma-FECT 1 siRNA transfection reagent (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO) 48 h before Muc4 expression was induced. Where indicated, Muc4 expression was induced for 48 h by removal of tetracycline. Immunoprecipitations—Contact-inhibited MCF7 cells induced to express Muc4 for 48 h or not induced to express Muc4 were lysed with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitation was done using the Catch and Release v2.0 immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate) according to the manufacture's protocol with antibody against E-cadherin or β-catenin. Immunoblotting with antibody against phosphorylated tyrosine (PY99) allowed us to determine the amount of phosphorylated β-catenin and E-cadherin. Membranes were stripped and reblotted with antibody against E-cadherin or β-catenin to determine the total amount immunoprecipitated and used for normalization. p21ras Activation Assay—This assay was performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate). The method is based on the ability of the Raf-1 Ras-binding domain to act as a specific trap to selectively precipitate p21ras in its active GTP-bound state. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—MCF7 cells were grown to confluence on 6-mm Transwell clear filters (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). Contact-inhibited MCF7 cells were processed for immunofluorescence 48 h after induction of Muc4 expression. Cells were washed three times with 1× cold phosphate-buffered saline with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, followed by quenching with 50 mm NH4Cl. The cells were incubated with primary antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 p44/p42, anti-Muc4 polyclonal (rat Muc4 C-peptide), mouse anti-Muc4 monoclonal (4F12), and anti-E-cadherin antibodies were used as primary antibodies for immunofluorescence. Hoechst stain was used to visualize the cell nuclei. Cells were then rinsed and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h in the dark. Alexa Fluor® 488- and Texas Red®-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) were used as specified by the manufacturers. Cells were then mounted in 10% polyvinyl alcohol, 30% glycerol, 1% n-propyl gallate, and SlowFade™ (Molecular Probes). The preparations were first observed under a Leica DM RB microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Leica Orthomat E microphotography system using a ×63 (1.4 numerical aperture) infinity-corrected objective. Laser confocal microscopy was performed with an LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) in the Imaging Core of the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine, equipped with two laser sources and an option of up to three channels. Cell monolayers were analyzed using a ×63 oil immersion objective. The images were collected using the LSM 510 software. The micrographs were selected to show cells expressing Muc4 among a population of cells that do not express Muc4 to highlight the differences among these cells. Cell Surface-selective Biotinylation—MCF7 cells were grown to confluence on Transwell clear filters. Contact-inhibited MCF7 control cells or cells expressing Muc4 were biotinylated on the apical or basolateral surface 48 h after induction of Muc4 expression. Proteins on the apical surface of the cell were exposed to the biotinylation reagent for 15 min, whereas proteins on the basolateral surface were exposed to the reagent for 45 min. The biotinylation procedure, isolation of labeled proteins, and protein elution were carried out using the Pinpoint cell surface isolation kit (Pierce)according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody recognizing E-cadherin. Effect of Muc4 Overexpression on ERK Phosphorylation in MCF7 Cells Grown at Different Densities—The effect of Muc4 on signaling through the ERK pathway was examined in MCF7 mh1 cells, which have been stably transfected with Muc4 under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. Despite being carcinoma cells, MCF7 cells are characterized by a high degree of polarity, which is a stable differentiated feature of these cells (29Van Deurs B. Zou Z.Z. Briand P. Balslev Y. Petersen O.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 5: 461-469Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When plated at low densities, MCF7 mh1 cells proliferate until they reach confluence and then exhibit contact inhibition of proliferation. Immunoblot analysis indicated that, in low density proliferating MCF7 mh1 cells, the level of active ERK1/2 (p44/p42 phosphorylated at Tyr202 and Thr204) was high, whereas in contact-inhibited MCF7 mh1 cells, this level was very low, which correlates with the low proliferative activity of these cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The total level of ERK1/2 was similar in low density proliferating cells and contact-inhibited cells. By removing tetracycline, Muc4 was expressed for 48 h in MCF7 mh1 cells plated at different densities. Muc4 overexpression in contact-inhibited cells led to a large induction of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at Tyr202 and Thr204, whereas the total levels of ERK1/2 remained unchanged (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, Muc4 overexpression in low density proliferating cells led to significant inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK1/2, whereas the total levels of ERK1/2 remained unchanged (Fig. 1, A and B). In proliferating cells at 50% confluency, overexpression of Muc4 did not have a pronounced effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation or total ERK levels (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm that Muc4 overexpression in contact-inhibited MCF7 cells leads to an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we further analyzed low density proliferating and contact-inhibited MCF7 mh1 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Fig. 1C (first and second panels) shows that proliferating cells exhibited high levels of active ERK, whereas contact-inhibited cells showed no active ERK. This contact inhibition of ERK1/2 activation was abrogated only in cells overexpressing Muc4 as shown by co-localization of Muc4 and phospho-ERK (Fig. 1C, third panel). Fig. 1C (fourth panel) shows that active ERK in cells overexpressing Muc4 partially localized to the nucleus. Effect of Muc4 Expression on p38 and JNK MAPK Phosphorylation in Contact-inhibited MCF7 Cells—The effect of Muc4 expression on the activation of the other two MAPKs, p38 and JNK, was also determined. Changes in MCF7 cell density did not have a dramatic effect on the activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs, as they did on the activation of ERK-MAPK (Fig. 2), suggesting that p38 and JNK MAPKs do not have a role in contact inhibition of proliferation in these cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated that expression of Muc4 in contact-inhibited MCF7 cells had no effect on the phosphorylated or total levels of these kinases. Densitometry analysis of the immunoblots confirmed these results (data not shown). Effect of Muc4 Expression on ERK Phosphorylation in MCF10A and SK-BR-3 Cells—To ensure that the Muc4-induced activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway in contact-inhibited MCF7 cells is a result of disrupting the contact-inhibited state, the effect of Muc4 overexpression on ERK activation was determined in two other mammary epithelial cell lines, MCF10A and SK-BR-3. MCF10A cells are non-transformed, well polarized mammary epithelial cells that display contact inhibition of proliferation at high culture densities. SK-BR-3 cells are malignant and have lost their ability to implement cell-cell contact-dependent inhibition of cell growth and proliferation and therefore form multilayer cultures at high culture densities. MCF10A and SK-BR-3 cells were transiently transfected with an empty plasmid or with a recombinant cDNA for a Muc4 analog containing five mucin repeats in the ASGP1 subunit. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), contact-inhibited MCF10A cells had no active ERK, and Muc4 expression in these cells significantly increased ERK phosphorylation. In high density SK-BR-3 cells, ERK was significantly overphosphorylated in the absence of Muc4. Muc4 expression was unable to further increase ERK activation in high density SK-BR-3 cells, even though the levels of Muc4 expression in these cells were higher than those in contact-inhibited MCF10A cells. Thus, Muc4 is able to override the effect of contact inhibition on ERK phosphorylation, but has no effect on cells that are not contact-inhibited. Muc4-induced Increase in ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in Contact-inhibited MCF7 Cells Correlates with Increase in Cyclin D1 Levels with No Change in the Cyclin-dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27—Contact-inhibited cells arrest at the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle; therefore, we analyzed two important regulators of the G0/G1-S cell cycle transition, cyclin D1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. The levels of these regulators have been shown to be affected by contact inhibition (1Li S. Gerrard E. Balkovetz D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4St. Croix B. Sheehan C. Rak J.W. Florenes V.A. Slingerland J.M. Kerbel R.S. J.

Cyclin D1 levels are regulated by changes in E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell interactions in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (1Li S. Gerrard E. Balkovetz D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C432-C439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and EMT/6 cells (4St. Croix B. Sheehan C. Rak J.W. Florenes V.A. Slingerland J.M. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 557-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Changes in p27 levels correlating with changes in E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions have been documented in E-cadherin-expressing EMT/6 cells grown in three-dimensional cultures and in colon, lung, and breast cell lines grown in three-dimensional cultures (4St. Croix B.

SgcC4, a novel aminomutase requiring no added co-factor that catalyzes the formation of the first intermediate (S)-β-tyrosine and subsequently SgcC1 homologous to adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, was identified as specific for the SgcC4 product and did not recognize any α-amino acids. To definitively establish the substrate for SgcC1, a full kinetic characterization of the enzyme was performed using amino acid-dependent ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assay to monitor amino acid activation and electrospray ionization-Fourier transform mass spectroscopy to follow the loading of the activated β-amino acid substrate to the peptidyl carrier protein SgcC2. The data establish (S)-β-tyrosine as the preferred substrate, although SgcC1 shows promiscuous activity toward aromatic β-amino acids such as β-phenylalanine, 3-chloro-β-tyrosine, and 3-hydroxy-β-tyrosine, but all were <50-fold efficient. A putative active site mutant P571A adjacent to the invariant aspartic acid residue of all α-amino acid-specific adenylation domains known to date was prepared as a preliminary attempt to probe the substrate specificity of SgcC1; however the mutation resulted in a loss of activity with all substrates except (S)-β-tyrosine, which was 142-fold less efficient relative to the wild-type enzyme. In total, SgcC1 is now confirmed to catalyze the second step in the biosynthesis of the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine moiety of C-1027, presenting downstream enzymes with an (S)-β-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 thioester substrate, and represents the first β-amino acid-specific adenylation enzyme characterized biochemically.

C-1027 is an enediyne antitumor antibiotic isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces globisporus (1Hu J. Xue Y.C. Xie M.Y. Zhang R. Otani T. Minami Y. Yamada Y. Marunaka T. J. Antibiot.

(Tokyo). 1988; 41: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is produced as a chromoprotein complex consisting of a binding protein (annotated as CagA) and the reactive C-1027 chromophore containing a conjugated enediyne harbored within a nine-membered cyclic ring (see Fig. 1). Upon release from CagA, the enediyne core of the C-1027 chromophore readily undergoes a Bergman cycloaromatization to yield a transient biradical species capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from DNA, which in the presence of molecular oxygen can ultimately lead to single- and double-stranded DNA breaks (3Sugimoto Y. Otani T. Oie S. Wierzba K. Yamada Y. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1990; 43: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). C-1027 and the entire enediyne family share this mode of action, and as a family, their potent cytotoxicity rivals that of any previously discovered natural product (4Wang X. Xie H. Drugs Future. 1999; 24: 847-852Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic gene cluster for C-1027 was previously cloned and sequenced, and analysis of the open reading frames (ORFs) 4The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; NRPS, nonribosomal peptide synthetase; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; ESI-FTMS, electrospray ionization-Fourier transform mass spectrometry; PheA, the excised l-Phe-specific adenylation domain of GrsA; ACES, 2-[(2-amino-2-oxoethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. provided genetic evidence to adequately propose a mechanism of biosynthesis, transport, resistance, and regulation of C-1027 (5Liu W. Chrisenson S.D. Standage S. Shen B. Science. 2002; 297: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Comparison of the gene cluster to other members of the enediyne family, including calicheamicin (6Ahlert J. Shepard E. Lomovskaya N. Zazopoulos E. Staffa A. Bachmann B.O. Huang K. Fonstein L. Czisny A. Whitwam R.E. Farnet C.M. Thorson J.S. Science. 2002; 297: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and neocarzinostatin (7Liu W. Nonaka K. Nie L. Zhang J. Christenson S.D.

Biol. 2005; 12: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), revealed a unified biosynthetic approach among the enediynes and supported a convergent biosynthesis of C-1027 from four components, a deoxy aminosugar, benzoxazolinate, β-amino acid, and enediyne core starting from glucose-1-phosphate, chorismic acid, l-α-tyrosine, and acyl-CoAs, respectively (Fig. 1). The pathway to generating the C-1027 deoxy aminosugar was initially targeted for biochemical analysis, and the first reaction catalyzed by SgcA1 has been characterized as a α-d-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (8Murrell J.M. Liu W. Shen B. J. Nat. Prod. 2004; 67: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Of the remaining moieties, only the initial step for the β-amino acid moiety (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine has been identified, a novel aminomutase reaction catalyzed by SgcC4 converting l-α-tyrosine to (S)-β-tyrosine (9Christenson S.D. Wu W. Spies M.A. Shen B. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12708-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among the 56 ORFs identified within the boundaries of the C-1027 biosynthetic gene cluster, three ORFs exhibit high homology to nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains. NRPSs are typically large modular proteins that catalyze the synthesis of a wide range of biologically active peptides (10Schwarzer D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). A minimal NRPS module consists of three domains, an adenylation domain that sequentially selects, activates, and loads an amino acid (or carboxylic acid) to the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain and a condensation domain that catalyzes the formation of an amide bond. In most examples, a single NRPS protein contains multiple modules, and the primary sequence of the resulting peptide product is correlated to the linear architecture of the modules (hence the so-called “thiotemplate co-linearity” rule). Extra domains embedded in the multimodular NRPS proteins, such as epimerization, methyltransferase, or oxidation domains, can be present to afford final peptides with enriched chemistry. As opposed to large multimodular proteins, singular domains or didomains of NRPS as individual ORFs have also been recently characterized, and this phenomenon has facilitated research toward understanding domain-domain recognition and interaction in NRPS and the molecular mechanism of NRPS-catalyzed nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis. Within the C-1027 biosynthetic gene cluster, two ORFs upstream and in opposite orientation to sgcC4 were found to encode proteins with sequence similarities to condensation (SgcC5) and PCP (SgcC2) domains (Fig. 2A). An ORF located adjacent to and downstream of sgcC4 was also identified and encodes an 881-amino-acid protein, SgcC1, having sequence homology to adenylation domains. Although SgcC1 has closest homology to adenylation domains that activate l-α-tyrosine, preliminary characterization has revealed that SgcC1 recognizes (S)-β-tyrosine as opposed to any of the standard α-amino acids, including either isomer of α-tyrosine or α-phenylalanine or analogs (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although these results support the findings that SgcC4 is the initial enzyme in the pathway (catalyzing the stereospecific formation of (S)-β-tyrosine from l-α-tyrosine) and SgcC1 catalyzes the subsequent step (Fig. 2B), they contradicted the prediction on the basis of the so-called “nonribosomal codes” (12Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 13Challis G.L. Ravel J. Townsend C.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 211-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) that SgcC1 would be an α-amino acid-specific adenylation domain (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a follow-up to the initial characterization of SgcC1, we now provide definitive experimental data to assign the substrate specificity for SgcC1. Using amino acid-dependent ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assays and electrospray ionization-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (ESI-FTMS), chlorinated and hydroxylated tyrosine or phenylalanine analogs were tested revealing that (S)-β-tyrosine is the preferred substrate for SgcC1. The results unambiguously establish that SgcC1, following the SgcC4 aminomutase reaction, catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine moiety from l-α-tyrosine by forming the (S)-β-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 intermediate. Subsequent steps involve halogenation (SgcC3), hydroxylation (SgcC), and incorporation of the fully modified β-amino acid unit into the enediyne core (SgcC5), although the precise timing of the last steps awaits further validation (Fig. 2B). SgcC1 as a naturally occurring, discrete protein could therefore provide a relatively simple platform to address the inherent amino acid specificity-conferring elements of adenylation domains to β-amino acids, of which the current nonribosomal codes were based solely on a single structure of the excised, l-α-phenylalanine-specific adenylation domain of GrsA (PheA) (12Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 13Challis G.L. Ravel J. Townsend C.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 211-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). As an initial attempt to determine the structural elements of SgcC1 necessary for proper β-amino acid selection, truncated protein and a single point mutation of SgcC1 were generated and the results reported. Chemicals and Instrumentation—If not mentioned, chemicals and instruments used were identical to that previously reported (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L.

Cinnamic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 3-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid (β-phenylalanine) were from Fisher-Acros (Pittsburgh, PA). (R)-3-Amino-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionic acid ((R)-β-tyrosine) was from PepTech Corporation (Burlington, MA). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Invitrogen, and expression vectors were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Unless explicitly stated, the compounds used were racemic mixtures.

Synthesis of Racemic 3-Chloro-β-tyrosine—Synthesis of 3-chloro-β-tyrosine was achieved by following the method reported by Weaver and co-worker (14Tan C.Y.K. Weaver D.F. Tetrahedron. 2002; 58: 7449-7461Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 3-Chloro-benzaldehyde (76 mg) was refluxed with 1 equivalent of malonic acid (51 mg) and 2 equivalents of ammonium acetate (76 mg) in ethanol (5 ml) for 2 days. The reaction mixture was adjusted to an approximate pH of 4 with 1 n HCl and separated by a strong acid cation exchange column (Dowex® 50WX8). The product, 3-chloro-β-tyrosine, was eluted with 1% ammonium hydroxide. The residue was dissolved in distilled water after the solvent was removed through evaporation under reduced pressure and further purified on C-18 reverse phase column (Alltima 10 × 250 mm, 5μm; Grace Davison Discovery Sciences). 1H NMR assignments in D2O containing CF3CO2D at 400 MHz are as follows (where d means doublet, dd means doublet of doublets, m means multiplet, and t means triplet): δ 7.08 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 1H), 6.87 (dd, J = 8.8, 2.4 Hz, 1H), 6.65 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H), 4.30 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, Hβ, 1H), 2.77 (dd, J = 17.2, 7.6 Hz, Hα, 1H), and 2.66 (dd, J = 17.2, 6.4 Hz, Hα, 1H). 13C NMR assignments in D2O at 100 MHz are as follows: δ 173.1 (C=O), 152.8 (ArC), 129.2 (ArC), 128.0 (ArC), 127.1 (ArC), 120.7 (ArC), 117.6 (ArC), 50.7 (Cβ), and 37.5 (Cα).

After confirmation of the DNA sequence fidelity, the NdeI/HindIII fragment was isolated and cloned into pET28a to yield pBS1038. Although the former construct produces SgcC1 as a C-terminal His6-tagged protein, the latter construct produces SgcC1 as a C- and N-terminal His6-tagged protein, both of which have the 338 amino acids at the N terminus of SgcC1 deleted. A P571A point mutation of SgcC1 was generated by PCR amplification of the template pBS1033 (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using the Expand long template PCR system (Roche Applied Science). Reactions were performed using the manufacturer's provided Buffer 2 with 5% Me2SO, primers of 5′-GTCTCCCCGGAGCACGACGCGGCGCTGGCCGAGGTC-3′ and the reverse complement (with the Ala codon underlined), and a PCR program consisting of an initial hold at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 7 min. The template DNA was digested with 10 units of DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C followed by heating to 90 °C for 5 min and cooling at room temperature before transformation. The introduction of the correct point mutation and the fidelity of the entire gene including 250 bp upstream and downstream were confirmed by DNA sequencing to yield pBS1039. Amino Acid-dependent ATP-[32P]PPi Exchange Assays—Assessment of the SgcC1 adenylation enzyme substrate specificity was performed as described previously (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A pH profile for SgcC1 was generated using a three-buffer system of 52/52/100 mm Tris-ACES-ethanolamine as described previously (16Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Assays were run at 30 °C in 1× buffer with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm ATP, 0.9 μm [32P]PPi, 1 mm (S)-β-tyrosine, and 10 nm SgcC1 under initial velocity conditions (<10% isotopic conversion into ATP). Each data point represents a minimum of four duplicate end-point assays. Because the pH profile was utilized only for determining the conditions for optimal activity, the data were fitted to a smooth curve in contrast to a specific rate equation, which would warrant further kinetic analysis at varied pH. The steady-state kinetic parameters for SgcC1 were determined with activity assays carried out at 30 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm ATP, 1.0 μm [32P]PPi, and varied co-substrate as follows: 25–1600 μm for 3-chloro-β-tyrosine, 3-hydroxy-β-tyrosine, and β-phenylalanine, 5–370 μm for (R)-β-tyrosine, and 0.5–200 μm for (S)-β-tyrosine. Enzyme concentration for each substrate ranged from 25 to 70 nm to maintain initial velocity conditions. Single time points were analyzed between 1 and 5 min; each data point represents a minimum of four duplicates with a S.D. of <10%. Kinetic constants were extracted by nonlinear regression analysis using Kaleidagraph software (Adelbeck Software, Reading, PA). Activity of SgcC1 with SgcC2—Preparation of recombinant SgcC1 and SgcC2 proteins, including overproduction in Escherichia coli, purification, and in vitro 4′-phosphopantetheinylation of apoSgcC2, were as described previously (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Acylation with (S)-β-tyrosine was analyzed as described previously (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, a quenched sample was loaded onto a Jupiter C4 column (Phenomenex, La Jolla, CA) to purify and desalt SgcC2 species. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed with a custom 8.5-T ESI-FTMS spectrometer equipped with a front-end quadrupole. The sample was introduced using a Nanomate 100 for automated nanospray (Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY) and typically 500 ms of ion accumulation/scan was used. The instrument was externally calibrated using ubiquitin (Sigma). Organization of NRPS within C-1027 Biosynthetic Gene Cluster—The gene cluster for C-1027 biosynthesis contains three ORFs with sequence homology to condensation (SgcC5), adenylation (SgcC1), and PCP (SgcC2) domains found in modular NRPSs. The ORFs are located in close proximity, interrupted only by sgcC4, of which the gene product has already been characterized and was identified to catalyze the initial step in the biosynthesis of the β-amino acid moiety of C-1027 by forming (S)-β-tyrosine (Fig. 2A). Therefore, these three ORFs, which constitute a minimal NRPS module, were hypothesized to process the SgcC4 product to maturation and its subsequent incorporation into the C-1027 chromophore (Fig. 2B). Substrate Specificity of SgcC1 Using Amino Acid-dependent ATP-PPi Exchange Assay—SgcC1 consists of 881 amino acids, of which ∼550 residues of the C terminus are similar to AMP-forming adenylation domains of NRPS. SgcC1 contains the 10 core regions that are conserved in all NRPS adenylation domains (10Schwarzer D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and overall has closest homology to TycC3 (38/55% identity/similarity from BL2SEQ analysis), NovH (35/46), and SimH (33/43), all l-α-tyrosine-activating enzymes in tyrocidine, novobiocin, and simocyclinone biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 3) (17Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6843-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen H. Walsh C.T. Chem.

Microbiol. 2002; 178: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, SgcC1 was previously shown to activate (S)-β-tyrosine but not α-amino acids (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, tyrosine analogs that could be potentially formed during the biosynthesis of the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine moiety were tested to ascertain the timing of the enzymatic step as well as to analyze the general substrate specificity of SgcC1. The data clearly establish that only β-phenylalanine or β-tyrosine analogs are recognized by SgcC1 (Fig. 4). Among the possible substrates that had little or no activity were cinnamic acid and p-hydroxycinnamic acid, products of ammonia lyase chemistry of the corresponding α-amino acids (20Poppe L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 4: 902-911Google Scholar), and 3-chloro-α-tyrosine or 3-hydroxy-α-tyrosine, possible intermediates assuming halogenation or hydroxylation, respectively, were the initial steps in biosynthesis of the β-amino acid moiety. The highest activity was observed with (S)-β-tyrosine followed closely by the R enantiomer (95% relative to (S)-β-tyrosine). Other substrates that were recognized include β-phenylalanine (75%), 3-hydroxy-β-tyrosine (62%), 3-chloro-β-tyrosine (51%), and 3-chloro-5-hydroxy-β-tyrosine (9%). pH Profile of SgcC1—The optimal pH for SgcC1 activity was analyzed using amino acid-dependent ATP-PPi exchange assay and (S)-β-tyrosine as the substrate. A three-buffer system was employed to maintain a constant ionic strength (16Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). SgcC1 was active between pH 5 and 11, and the pH profile exhibited two maxima at pH values 7.5 and 9.0 (Fig. 5). When 100 mm Tris-HCl was substituted, no change in activity was observed (data not shown). Because SgcC4 had a pH optimum of ∼9.0, further experiments were performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl at pH 9.0. Single-substrate Kinetics of SgcC1— Kinetic parameters were determined using the five substrates that had significant activity when tested with SgcC1. All of the substrates displayed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the presence of saturating ATP, as exemplified by (S)- or (R)-β-tyrosine (Fig. 6). The best substrate, (S)-β-tyrosine, had a kcat of 2.2 ± 0.5 s–1 and Km of 3.2 ± 0.6 μm, whereas the other substrates had a similar but slightly lower kcat and significantly increased Km (Table 1). Overall, SgcC1 catalysis was >50-fold more efficient with (S)-β-tyrosine than any substrate analog tested, excluding the R-enantiomer, which had a 25-fold lower efficiency.TABLE 1Michaelis-Menten constants for SgcC1 as an adenylation enzyme toward selected β-amino acidsSubstrateKmkcatkcat/KmRelative efficiencyμms-1μm-1s-1(S)-β-Tyr3.2 ± 0.62.2 ± 0.50.691(R)-β-Tyr53 ± 121.5 ± 0.30.0280.043-OH-β-Tyr81 ± 161.2 ± 0.10.0150.02β-Phe1.9 × 102 ± 401.4 ± 0.40.00750.013-Cl-β-Tyr3.0 × 102 ± 501.6 ± 0.30.00530.008 Open table in a new tab SgcC1-catalyzed Loading of SgcC2—The second half-reaction of SgcC1 was monitored by ESI-FTMS following the mass shift observed upon loading the activated β-tyrosine onto holo-SgcC2 PCP to generate a β-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 thioester. With either (S)- or (R)-β-tyrosine as the substrate, the appropriate mass shift of +162.6 was observed (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Time course analysis with (S)-β-tyrosine resulted in a rate constant of 2.1 s–1 and with a (R)-β-tyrosine rate constant of 1.9 s–1, both of which are nearly identical to the kcat calculated from the first half-reaction as determined by the ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assays (Table 1). SgcC1 Mutation Analysis—Adenylation domains have been proposed to extend ∼550 amino acids within an NRPS module (10Schwarzer D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Therefore, the wild-type SgcC1 protein (881-amino-acid residues) was truncated by deleting 338 amino acids from its N terminus to encompass only the putative AMP-forming domain (C terminus). Of the constructs prepared, only the dual His6-tagged version was slightly soluble, but no activity was observed with this construct. A P571A mutant of SgcC1 was prepared to examine possible changes in substrate specificity and/or catalysis. This residue neighbors the invariant aspartate residue Asp-570, the carboxylate side chain of which interacts with the α-amino group to lock the orientation of the l-α-amino acid into the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 3). The mutation abolished activity with all substrates except (S)-β-tyrosine. Kinetic analysis for SgcC1(P571A) yielded a Km of 13 ± 4 μm and a kcat of 0.07 ± 0.02 s–1, a 142-fold loss in catalytic efficiency when compared with the wild-type SgcC1 (Table 2).TABLE 2Michaelis-Menten constants for SgcC1(P571A) as an adenylation enzyme toward (S)-β-tyrosine and comparison with that of the wild-type SgcC1 enzymeEnzymeKmkcatkcat/KmRelative efficiencyμms-1μm-1s-1SgcCl (wild-type)3.2 ± 0.62.2 ± 0.50.691SgcCl (P576A)13 ± 47.0 × 10-2 ± 0.020.00540.007 Open table in a new tab Adenylation domains of NRPS catalyze the activation, at the expense of ATP, and subsequent loading of the activated amino acids or carboxylic acids to a PCP domain to form an aminoacyl-S-PCP thioester. SgcC1 has significant sequence homology to numerous adenylation domains of NRPS, and as a result, has been hypothesized to be involved in the formation, activation, and incorporation of the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine moiety into C-1027, although the precise timing of the steps cannot be predicted a priori (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis predicted l-α-tyrosine as the probable substrate for SgcC1, as deduced from its closest sequence identity to domains that activate l-α-tyrosine, such as TycC3, NovH, and SimH, and comparisons to the nonribosomal codes of NRPS suggested that l-α-tyrosine was the most likely substrate for SgcC1 (Fig. 3) (12Stachelhaus T.

However, our previous results with SgcC4 preferring l-α-tyrosine were inconsistent with this proposal (11Van Lanen S.G. Dorrestein P.C. Christenson S.D. Liu W. Ju J. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11594-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and therefore, a full biochemical characterization of SgcC1 was undertaken. As previously reported, when l-α-tyrosine was tested as a substrate, SgcC1 was only active in the presence of SgcC4, which converts l-α-tyrosine t"
https://openalex.org/W1972908665,"The fluorescence of a fluorophore depends on its environment, and if attached to a protein it may report on conformational changes. We have combined two-electrode voltage clamp with simultaneous fluorescence measurements to detect conformational changes in a type IIb Na+/Pi cotransporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Four novel Cys, labeled with a fluorescent probe, yielded voltage- and substrate-dependent changes in fluorescence (F). Neither Cys substitution nor labeling significantly altered the mutant electrogenic properties. Different F responses to voltage and substrate were recorded at the four sites. S155C, located in an intracellular re-entrant loop in the first half of the protein, and E451C, located in an extracellular re-entrant loop in the second half of the protein, both showed Na+, Li+, and Pi-dependent F signals. S226C and Q319C, located at opposite ends of a large extracellular loop in the middle of the protein, mainly responded to changes in Na+ and Li+. Hyperpolarization increased F for S155C and S226C but decreased F for Q319C and E451C. The labeling and F response of S155C, confirmed that the intracellular loop containing Ser-155 is re-entrant as it is accessible from the extracellular milieu. The behavior of S155C and E451C indicates a strong involvement of the two re-entrant loops in conformational changes during the transport cycle. Moreover, the data for S226C and Q319C suggest that also the large extracellular loop is associated with transport function. Finally, the reciprocal voltage dependences of the S155C-E451C and S226C-Q319C pairs suggest reciprocal conformational changes during the transport cycle for their respective local environments."

The short chain-specific oxidase has little resemblance to other peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases but has an ∼30% sequence identity to mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Two biochemical features have been linked to structural properties by comparing the structures of short chain-specific Arabidopsis thaliana ACX4 with and without a substrate analogue bound in the active site to known acyl-CoA oxidases and dehydrogenase structures: (i) a solvent-accessible acyl binding pocket is not required for oxygen reactivity, and (ii) the oligomeric state plays a role in substrate pocket architecture but is not linked to oxygen reactivity. The structures indicate that the acyl-CoA oxidases may encapsulate the electrons for transfer to molecular oxygen by blocking the dehydrogenase substrate interaction site with structural extensions. A small binding pocket observed adjoining the flavin adenine dinucleotide N5 and C4a atoms could increase the number of productive encounters between flavin adenine dinucleotide and O2.

The central pathway for fatty acid breakdown in higher plants is via peroxisomal β-oxidation. Fatty acids enter the cycle in the form of acyl-CoA thioesters, and during one round of β-oxidation, the acyl chain is shortened by a two-carbon unit and one acetyl-CoA molecule is produced. The first step in the peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle is the introduction of a double bond into the acyl-CoA substrate, resulting in the formation of 2-trans-enoyl-CoA. This reaction is a two-step reaction catalyzed by the family of acyl-CoA oxidases (ACXs) 2The abbreviations used are: ACX, acyl-CoA oxidase; ACX1, long chain-specific acyl-CoA oxidase; ACX4, short chain-specific acyl-CoA oxidase; CoA, coenzyme A; AcAcCoA, acetoacetyl-CoA; ACD, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; GCD, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase; MCAD, medium chain-specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; SCAD, short chain-specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; VLCAD, very long chain-specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; TLS, translation/libration/screw; e, elementary charge. requiring flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor. The cofactor gets reduced to FADH- in the first half-reaction concomitant with acyl-CoA oxidation. FADH- is reoxidized by molecular oxygen in the second step, thereby generating H2O2, an intracellular signaling molecule. Unlike plants, two parallel and distinct β-oxidation pathways exist in mammals, the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway and a mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway. In mitochondrial β-oxidation, the first step is catalyzed by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family (ACD) (1Ghisla S. Thorpe C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), which is related to ACXs. The FADH- in ACDs is not, however, reoxidized by molecular oxygen but rather by another flavoprotein, the electron transfer flavoprotein, which transfers electrons to the electron transport chain. As a result, the oxidation of fatty acids/amino acids and the generation of ATP molecules are linked in mitochondrial β-oxidation (2Hoard-Fruchey H.M. Goetzman E. Benson L. Naylor S. Vockley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13786-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is puzzling that natural selection has not forced plants to utilize the mitochondrial electron transport chain for general lipid oxidation despite the apparent ATP advantage of this pathway. This might reflect less stress on the ATP requirement and a higher demand for lipid turnover and excess oxygen management in plants. Six genes for ACX isozymes have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Five encode for proteins of ∼75 kDa (3Eastmond P.J. Hooks M. Graham I.A. Biochem. Soc.

The majority of the characterized enzymes in the ACX family form dimers in solution and have an extra C-terminal domain (3Eastmond P.J. Hooks M. Graham I.A. Biochem. Soc.

Biol. 2005; 345: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that is not found in short, medium, and long chain-specific ACDs. The extra C-terminal domain resembles the C-terminal domain observed in very long chain-specific ACDs, which also form dimers (11Souri M. Aoyama T. Cox G.F. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4227-4231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Souri M. Aoyama T. Hoganson G. Hashimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The last A. thaliana ACX gene encodes for a short chain-specific enzyme (ACX4). It is a 50-kDa enzyme with little sequence identity to the other ACXs, yet it still catalyzes the same reoxidation step with the transfer of electrons from FADH- to molecular oxygen (13Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In mammals, the peroxisomal β-oxidation does not go to completion. Instead short chain fatty acids are transferred to the mitochondrial β-oxidation cycle. The peroxisomal short chain-specific ACX is unique to plants (14De Bellis L. Gonzali S. Alpi A. Hayashi H. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and seems to be an evolutionary link between the two alternative β-oxidation systems. The very long chain-specific ACD could have evolved in a similar way to the very long chain-specific ACD. Short chainspecific ACX shares the functional, homotetrameric state of short, medium, and long chain-specific ACDs (15Fu Z. Wang M. Paschke R. Rao K.S. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9674-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and has a higher sequence identity to mitochondrial dehydrogenases (∼30%) than to other peroxisomal oxidases (∼15%). Of the nine known members of the ACD family, plant short chain ACXs have the highest sequence identity to glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenases (GCD) (15Fu Z. Wang M. Paschke R. Rao K.S. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9674-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bacterial GCDs, which have not been structurally characterized, are the GCDs with highest sequence identity to plant short chain ACXs (∼45%). We have determined the first structure of a peroxisomal short chain-specific ACX, A. thaliana ACX4, with and without a substrate analogue bound in the active site. The structure of ACX4, together with the previously determined structure of A. thaliana long chain-specific ACX, sheds new light on the role of the oligomerization state for substrate pocket architecture and the role of acyl binding pocket solvent accessibility. A mechanism is proposed by which the ACX enzymes encapsulate electrons for transfer to molecular oxygen. ACX4 Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The A. thaliana gene encoding non-His-tagged ACX4 was amplified by PCR using a cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession No. T46525) obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center as a template. The primers used were 5′-CTATCGCCATATGGCGGTGCTTTCATCT-3′ and 5′-GTCATCTCGAGTCAGAGACGGCTACGTGTACGCGGT-3′. The amplified DNA was inserted into the pET24 vector (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced at an A600 of 0.6-0.8 by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation 3 h after induction. The harvested cells were resuspended in 10 ml of BugBuster (Novagen) per liter of cell culture, with the addition of 0.5 ml of lysozyme (25 mg/ml; Sigma) per 10 ml of BugBuster. After cell lysis, benzonase (Sigma) was added at 1 μl/10 ml of BugBuster. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 60 min. The protein solution was dialyzed against 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 to reduce the volume to ∼8 ml. The concentrated sample was applied onto a size exclusion column (Superdex75, GE Healthcare) using 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 μm FAD as a running buffer. Fractions containing enzyme were pooled and applied directly onto an anion exchange column (MonoQ; Pharmacia Corporation) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 μm FAD. Highly purified ACX4 (95%) was collected in the flow through. The protein was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, and 10 μm FAD and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a Centriprep YM-10 filter unit (Millipore). After flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, the protein was stored at -20 °C. Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique mixing equal volumes (2 μl) of ACX4 (10 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, 10 μm FAD) and precipitating solution (10-14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5) with the addition of 0.5 μl of 20% (v/v) benzamidine-HCl and 0.5 μl of 10mm AcAcCoA and equilibrating against precipitating solution (1000 μl) at 22 °C. The crystals developed over 4 days. Cryoprotection was achieved by transfer of the crystals to 25% (v/v) glycerol by gradually increasing the concentration by 5%. Crystallization conditions for His-tagged ACX4 without AcAcCoA have been reported previously (16Pedersen L. Henriksen A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The use of the non-His-tagged construct and inclusion of AcAcCoA in the crystallization conditions dramatically improved the reproducibility and quality of the ACX4 crystals. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data from the ACX4·AcAcCoA complex were collected at the I711 beam line, MAX-lab, Lund University, Sweden. The crystal form was non-isomorphous with the crystal form observed with the His-tagged enzyme (16Pedersen L. Henriksen A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). ACX4·AcAcCoA crystals belong to space group P3221, a = b = 144.7 Å, c = 149.2 Å, contain four molecules/asymmetric unit and have a Matthew's coefficient of 2.4 Å3/Da and a solvent content of 47%. The best ACX4·AcAcCoA crystals diffracted to 2.7 Å, whereas the previously characterized crystals of His-tagged ACX4 diffracted to 3.9 Å. Diffraction data were indexed and integrated with MOS-FLM (17Leslie A. MOSFLM, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. 1999; (Cambrigde, England)Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (18Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar).

The structure of the His-tagged ACX4 was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (22Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) using one subunit of the refined ACX4·AcAcCoA structure as model. The crystal had six molecules in the asymmetric unit. The ACX4·AcAcCoA structure was refined using iterative cycles of crystallography NMR software-simulated annealing refinement against the maximum likelihood target (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) or REFMAC5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) refinement alternating with manual rebuilding of the molecular structure using the O graphics software (25Jones A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). After resetting Biso values to 20, a last round of REFMAC5 refinement, including translation/libration/screw (TLS) refinement, was applied. This was followed by restrained positional refinement and supplemental Biso refinement (26Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Each of the four subunits defined a TLS group. Of the 439 residues in each subunit in the ACX4·AcAcCoA structure, all were comprised in the model, except 16 residues in the N terminus and 8 residues in the C terminus (including the PTS1 signal sequence). The occupancy of the AcAcCoA ligand was refined. Because of the low resolution of the His-tagged ACX4 data, only one round of crystallography NMR software-simulated annealing refinement was conducted, applying strict NCS between the six subunits in the asymmetric unit and not refining the B-factors nor including solvent molecules. The simulated annealing was followed by 10 cycles of TLS refinement in REFMAC5, first setting Biso = 20 for all protein atoms and applying one TLS group for each protein chain. Tight NCS restraints were used in the subsequent restrained positional refinement followed by refinement of the residual Biso. This procedure resulted in a drop in Rfree from 28 to 25%. In His-tagged ACX4, the His tag and N- and C-terminal residues were disordered. The final Rcryst and Rfree values of the ACX4·AcAcCoA structure were 19 and 23%, respectively, whereas the values for His-tagged ACX4 were 25 and 25%. The relatively low R-factor for His-tagged ACX4 at 3.9 Å resolution is probably a consequence of the use of the higher resolution ACX4·AcAcCoA structure as a starting point for the refinement. Refinement statistics are found in Table 1. Ramachandran plots of both structures have 92% of the residues in the most favored regions and one residue, Leu-393, in the γ-turn region. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession numbers 2IX5 and 2IX6, respectively. Structural Analysis—Structural classification of the ACX4 structure took advantage of the SCOP data base (27Andreeva A. Howorth D. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D226-D229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The search for structural similarity to the N-terminal ACX4 extension was performed using the Macromolecular Structure data base secondary structure-matching facility against structures deposited in the PDB (28Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). Protein superposition was achieved with Lsqman (29Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.A. Arnold E International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Google Scholar), and protein-protein interactions were analyzed via the protein-protein interaction server (30Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Helanal (31Bansal M. Kumar S. Velavan R. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2000; 17: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a program for characterization of helix geometry, was applied to analyze helix curvature, whereas secondary structure prediction for very long chain-specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) was done using Jpred (32Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The program Surfnet was used for binding pocket analysis (33Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). In this analysis, a CoA molecule was left in the pocket to block the entrance, and the volume of the remaining cavity was calculated. Electrostatic potentials were calculated using the fullcharge force field and the program Delphi (Accelrys), setting the ionic strength of the solvent to 0.1 m and keeping default values for the other parameters. A similar result was obtained by calculating the electrostatic potentials using the Amber94 force field in the program MOE (Chemical Computing Group). Three-dimensional Structure—ACX4 was co-crystallized with the FAD cofactor and a substrate analogue, acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAcCoA). The ACX4 subunit adopted the canonical dehydrogenase fold with an N-terminal α-helical domain (residue 57-167), followed by a middle β-strand domain (residue 168-276) and a C-terminal four-helix bundle (residue 277-431) (Fig. 1A). The β-strand domain belongs to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase NM domain-like superfamily and the C-terminal α-helical domain to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase C-terminal domain-like superfamily. His-tagged and non-His-tagged A. thaliana ACX4, purified to homogeneity from E. coli (16Pedersen L. Henriksen A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), are both active as tetramers in solution (13Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Pedersen L. Structural Studies of Plant Acyl-CoA Oxidases, Ph.D. thesis. University of Copenhagen, Denmark2004Google Scholar). ACX4 also crystallizes as a tetramer with extensive intermolecular interactions between the subunits (Fig. 1C). The arrangement of the four molecules in the tetramer can be characterized as a dimer of dimers, where the dimer interface is formed mainly by interactions between the C-terminal α-domain of one subunit and the middle β-domain of the second subunit. Two FAD molecules are buried in each dimer interface (Fig. 1B). The four-helical bundle constituting the C-terminal α-helical domain forms the tetramer interface (Fig. 1C). The combined four-helix bundles of the dimer give the interface an almost flat shape. The extensive intermolecular interactions between the subunits in the crystal resemble the subunit arrangements characterized in mitochondrial dehydrogenase crystal structures (15Fu Z. Wang M. Paschke R. Rao K.S. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9674-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Battaile K.P. Molin-Case J. Paschke R. Wang M. Bennett D. Vockley J. Kim J.J.

A pair of cysteine residues is located on the dimer interface with a Cα-Cα distance of 8 Å (Fig. 1B). The cysteines do not form a disulfide bond in the crystal structure but could potentially do so in vivo. However, neither expression of ACX4 in the thioredoxin-deficient E. coli Origami2 strain (Novagen) nor the treatment of the reduced ACX4 with H2O2 results in disulfide bond formation judged by non-reduced SDS-PAGE analysis (results not shown). An N-terminal extension consisting of 56 amino acids is present in A. thaliana ACX4. The last 40 amino acid residues in the extension are well ordered and have been included in the model (Fig. 1, A and B). The well ordered part of the ACX4 N terminus extends toward the adjacent subunit, embracing the dimer (Fig. 1B). Also the C-terminal part of ACX4 is somewhat extended. The N- and C-terminal loops add to the stability of the ACX4 tetramer by expanding the intermolecular interactions. The ACX4 dimer interface buries 3493 Å2, whereas the short chainspecific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) interface is only 1751 Å2. The extensions account for 87% of this expansion of interface. Preventing Electrons from Going Astray—The N-terminal extension of ACX4 caps the region, which has been shown to be the site for electron transfer to the electron transfer flavoprotein in ACDs (40Toogood H.S. van Thiel A. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32904-32912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Removal of the tail opens a solvent-accessible channel to the FAD molecule analogous to the channel found in ACDs (Fig. 2). When superposing ACX1 and ACX4, the C terminus of ACX1 was found, surprisingly, to shield the corresponding area in the long chain-specificacyl-CoA oxidase (Fig.3). It is striking that, although ACX1 and ACX4 share only 17% sequence identity and 74% superposable Cα-atoms, the N-terminal extension of ACX4 superimposes almost perfectly on the C-terminal extension of ACX1. This strongly indicates that the N-terminal extension could have a potential role in electron transfer.FIGURE 3Superposition of A. thaliana ACX1 (green and gray) and ACX4 (beige and black) dimer. The N-terminal extension of ACX4 (red) covering the electron transfer flavoproteins docking area of ACDs is superposable on the C terminus of ACX1 (orange).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extended C terminus of ACX4 also contributes to the shielding of the FAD cofactor. It bends back over the αG-αH loop of the C-terminal four-helix bundle to cover the adenine moiety of the FAD molecule (Fig. 2). The combined action of the two extensions completely buries the cofactor in ACX4. Blocking the access of substrate for the FAD cofactor reoxidation has been observed to be a feature used by other FAD-containing enzymes to favor oxidase activity over dehydrogenase activity. One example is the xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (41Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). N-terminal extensions of various lengths are also present in putative short chain acyl-CoA oxidase sequences from other plants, such as rice (UniProt Q5ZEL4), corn (Unigene Zm.8995), barley (Unigene Hv.567), soybean (Unigene Gma.6433), tomato (Unigene Les.2824), and potato (Unigene Stu.11425). Searching the PDB using the Macromolecular Structure data base secondary structure-matching facility (28Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar) to identify and align similar proteins reveals that the N-terminal extension is not found in the structures of characterized ACDs. An N-terminal extension of 20-50 amino acids is present in the sequence of the mitochondrial ACDs, targeting the protein to the mitochondria; this peptide is, however, cleaved off upon import (42Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). The human GCD (PDB accession code 1SIR) (15Fu Z. Wang M. Paschke R. Rao K.S. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9674-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) has a high sequence identity to ACX4 (33%) as well as a high structural resemblance (root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å over 98% of the Cα atoms). Human GCD has a cleavable 44-amino-acidlong N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence with no significant homology to the N-terminal sequence of ACX4 (43Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 227-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension is found only in a few of the bacterial GCDs that share high sequence identity with ACX4. The Substrate Binding Pocket—The substrate analogue AcAcCoA is bound with the thioester bond sandwiched between the catalytic base and the FAD isoalloxazine ring in a cavity between the β-strand domain and the C-terminal four-helix bundle (Fig. 4). The ACX4·AcAcCoA c"
https://openalex.org/W2070026367,"CD226 is one of the main activating receptors on natural killer cells, and it can induce cytotoxicity to target cells through interaction with its ligands CD155 or CD112. CD226 is also involved in T cell differentiation, activation, and cytotoxicity. The expression of CD226 on natural killer cells and T cells can be regulated by cytokines and chemical stimuli; however, the mechanism of the regulation of the <i>CD226</i> gene is still unknown. In this study, we have identified two promoters in the human <i>CD226</i> gene named P1 and P2, which are located at –810 to –287 bp and +33 to +213 bp, respectively, and a negative regulation element between P1 and P2. Both P1 and P2 can be regulated by phorbol ester (12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and calcium ionophore (A23187). Bioinformatics analysis shows that, within this <i>CD226</i> gene region, there are putative binding sites for transcription factors AP-1, Sp1, PEA3, and Ets-1. We have found that transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP-1) can up-regulate <i>CD226</i> promoters P1 and P2 in human hepatocarcinoma cells, a hepatocarcinoma cell line with low expression of endogenous AP-1 and Ets-1. Interestingly, the transcription factor Ets-1 promotes AP-1-induced P2 activity but inhibits AP-1-induced P1 activity for which a 10-bp AP-1/Ets-1 composite site (CCTTCCTTCC) in P1 may be responsible."
