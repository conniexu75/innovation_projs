https://openalex.org/W2033208469,"Growth hormone release-inhibiting hormone (somatostatin), a hypothalamic peptide that inhibits the release of growth hormone and also the secretion of insulin glucagon, and gastrin, was found in the rat stomach and pancreas in a concentration similar to that in the hypothalamus, as measured by radioimmunoassay. Somatostatin was also found in the duodenum and jejunum, but in a smaller concentration. Gel filtration of the extracts of the pancreas and stomach on Sephadex G-25 yielded two immunoreactive peaks, one corresponding in each case to the somatostatin tetradecapeptide. The hormone was not detected in other viscera or the ovaries. The results imply that somatostatin may be synthesized in the pancreas and the stomach in addition to the brain, and may be involved in local regulatory mechanisms for pancreatic and gastric secretion as well as secretion of growth hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1978827590,"Full-length, single-stranded rabbit globin cDNA, synthesized by AMV reverse transcriptase, apparently contains a small double-stranded sequence (hairpin) at the 3′ terminus. This cDNA can serve as template-primer for E. coli DNA polymerase I, which synthesizes a strand complementary to the cDNA and covalently bound to it. The loop connecting the two strands can be cut by S1 nuclease. Reassociation, hybridization, and restriction endonuclease studies, as well as electrophoretic analyses, indicate that the sequential actions of reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase I, and S1 nuclease generate full-length, double-stranded synthetic globin genes."

This technique may be used in combination with the intracellular injection of Procion yellow to demonstrate by light microscopy connections between physiologically typed vertebrate neurons."

The cocaine persisted in the plasma for 4 to 6 hours and reached peak concentrations of 120 to 474 nanograms per milliliter at 15 to 60 minutes. In that residual cocaine was detectable on the nasal mucosa for 3 hours, continuous absorption secondary to its vasoconstrictive action might explain its persistence in the plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1589426731,"The basic protein of bovine central nervous system myelin contains a single polypeptide chain of 170 amino acids. Multiple components of basic protein have been observed on disc gel electrophoresis and ion exchange chromatography at alkaline pH, but the basis of the microheterogeneity has not been established. In the present study myelin basic protein from bovine spinal cord was chromatographed on carboxymethylcellulose at pH 10.4 in glycine buffer/2 M urea. Three major peaks were obtained, identified as components 4, 5, and 6 in the oder of their elution from the column by a linear salt gradient. The amino acid compositions of tryptic peptides from components 4 and 6 were identical and the COOH-terminal sequence, Ala-Arg-Arg, was intact for all three components. Component 4 was found to differ from component 6 by partial phosphorylation of threonine 98 and serine 165. This modification was estimated to account for 50% of component 4. Component 5 differed from component 6 by partial deamidation of glutamine residues 103 and 147, which accounted for 80% of this component. These modified glutamine residues were also present in component 4 and constituted another 15% of this component. It was considered that component 6 was the native, unmodified species of basic protein and that component 4 differed by a net negative charge of 2, and component 5 by a net negative charge of.1 as a result of these modifications. The nonrandom nature of the modifications suggested the involvement of specific enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1488060793,"Experiments were performed to investigate whether proteins other than fibrin are substrates for activated fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSF, blood coagulation Factor XIII, plasma transglutaminase) in clotting whole plasma. Three fluorescently labeled polypeptides were identified in serum prepared by clotting normal, but not FSF-deficient, plasma in the presence of the fluorescent amine, N-(5-aminopentyl)-5-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonamide (dansylcadaverine). The major labeled polypeptide had a Mr (estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate) of 1.6 times 10(5) and was found in the protein fraction precipitated by 33 to 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The second had a Mr of 2.0 times 10(5), was found in the protein fraction insoluble in 33% saturated ammonium sulfate, and was precipitated by gamma-globulin directed against cold-insoluble globulin. The third had a Mr of 1.1 times 10(5) and was precipitated by 33 to 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. All three polypeptides were found in the first protein peak when labeled serum was chromatographed on Sephadex G-200. The immunoprecipitin arc containing alpha2-macroglobulin was fluorescent when labeled serum was analyzed by immunoelectrophoresis. These results indicate that alpha2-macroglubulin, cold-insoluble globulin, and an unidentified third protein with a subunit of Mr = 1.1 times 10(5) are transamidated by FSF in clotting plasma. The concentration of cold-insoluble globulin was decreased in serum formed at 37 degrees from normal, but not from FSF-deficient, plasma. The depletion of cold-insoluble globulin in normal serum was partially blocked by clotting in the presence of dansylcadaverine and completely blocked by clotting in the absence of calcium ions. Sera formed at 2 degrees from both normal and FSF-deficient plasma contained less cold-insoluble globulin than plasma. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate of clots formed at 2 degrees demonstrated cross-linking of cold-insoluble globulin to fibrin in the normal, but not the FSF-deficient, sample. The serum concentration of alpha2-macroglobulin was the same as the plasma concentration irrespective of the conditions of clotting. Thus, the experiments suggest that FSF catalyzes the cross-linking of cold-insoluble globulin (but not alpha2-macroglobulin) to fibrin in clotting plasma."

https://openalex.org/W1984349011,"DNA synthesis and mitosis have been induced in vitro in fully differentiated neurons from the central nervous system by depolarization with a variety of agents that produce a sustained rise in the intracellular sodium ion concentration and a decrease in the potassium ion concentration. Depolarization was followed in less than 1 hour by an increase in RNA synthesis and in 3 hours by initiation of DNA synthesis. Apparently normal nuclear mitosis ensued, but cytokinesis was not completed in most cells; this resulted in the formation of binucleate neurons. The daughter nuclei each contained the same amount of DNA as the diploid preinduction parental neurons; this implies that true mitogenic replication was induced."
https://openalex.org/W2068946325,"I have discussed the observations and experiments that led to the formulation and establishment of the provirus hypothesis and the DNA provirus hypothesis, which includes RNA-directed DNA synthesis for the formation of the provirus. I have also discussed some aspects of the present status of our knowledge of the mechanism of formation of the DNA provirus both to point out the work remaining to be done and to illustrate hypotheses for the origins of ribodeoxyviruses and the origins of other animal enveloped RNA viruses and of animal small DNA viruses. Finally, I have indicated that I do not believe that infectious viruses cause most human cancers, but I do believe that viruses provide models of the processes involved in the etiology of human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2016897864,"Highly purified steady state heterogeneous nuclear RNA from HeLa cells has been prepared by a new procedure. Detergent-washed nuclei are disrupted in 0.4 M ammonium sulfate, which also disociated contamination polysomes. The hnRNA remains bound to chromatin, which can be pelleted by gentle centrifugation. Ribonuclease inhibitors permit the preparation of very high molecular weight nuclear RNA. The hnRNA was cleaved with alkali. The poly(A)-containing fragments were separated from those containing oligo(A), and a cDNA copy was prepared. Hybridization of this nuclear cDNA to cytoplasmic mRNA showed that the scarce (complex) message sequences make up a larger proportion of nuclear RNA than of cytoplasmic RNA. In addition, at least 30% of the poly(A)-adjacent sequences in nuclear RNA have no apparent counterparts in the cytoplasm. cDNA prepared from hnRNA sedimenting faster than 45S under denaturing conditions gives similar results, showing the presence of both message and non-message sequences in very large transcripts. cDNA complementary to mRNA was separated into the abundant and scarce sequences, and hybridized separately to the poly(A)-adjacent sequences in nuclear RNA. The hybridization of the abundant sequence cDNA was used to set an upper limit on possible cytoplasmic contamination. Hybridization of the scarce cytoplasmic sequences are represented in nuclear RNA approximately once per cell."
https://openalex.org/W1967901145,"Evidence is presented that cobra venom factor, the anticomplementary protein in Naja naja venom, is modified cobra C3 (the third component of complement). Antiserum to the cobra venom factor cross reacts with human C3. A protein in cobra serum reacts strongly with antiserum to the venom factor and the former protein, like human C3, is converted by incubation of cobra serum with endotoxin, hydrazine, or simple storage at 37°C. Incubation of cobra venom factor with cobra serum destroys the C3 cleaving activity of the venom factor in human serum, whereas human C3b inactivator is ineffective. Thus, the cobra venom factor appears to be a form of C3 (perhaps C3b); its potent action in human serum probably derives from its lack of sensitivity to human C3b inactivator."
https://openalex.org/W2023772049,"THE northern pike (Esox lucius) is a highly prized freshwater fish, both as a game fish and as a commerical species. Epizootics of lymphosarcoma occur widely in North American pike1 and in the Old World2,3. The tumour in pike has been found with an overall frequency of 20.9%, which is the highest frequency of a malignant neoplasm in any known free living vertebrate1. All pike with the tumour have cutaneous lesions, and epizootiological evidence suggests that the disease is transmitted horizontally by contact during spawning1. The tumour is transplantable and evidence of cell-free transmission has been found1,4. In an attempt to resolve the aetiology of the disease, we have investigated the presence of oncornavirus in pike lymphoma. Since all known RNA tumour viruses possess the enzyme reverse transcriptase, we have sought the activity of this enzyme in post-mitochondrial particulate fractions prepared from pike lymphoma tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1545979795,"Rabbit anti-hapten antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography and characterized immunochemical for in vivo studies of their blood clearance rate and organ distribution after treatment with various glycosidases. Following sequential removal of sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine with the appropriate cellulose-immobilized exoglycosidases, the antibody populations were recharacterized, radiolabeled, and introduced intravenously into the original animals. Using double radioiodine lables it was possible to demonstrate alterations in purified antibody survival times in the circulation and altered organ distribution after glycolytic cleavage. Removal of terminal sialic acid resulted in rapid blood clearance and enhanced localization of asialoantibody in the liver. Subsequent removal of penultimate galactose residues returned both antibody survival time in the circulation and organ distribution to near normal. Removal of subpenultimate N-acetylglucosamine moieties resulted in aglycosylantibody survival values which were intermediate between asialo- and asialoagalactoantibodies. Removal of the three saccharide also increased kidney localization. The results are evaluated based on current concepts of the biological roles of protein-linked carbohydrate and plasma glycoprotein survival time in the circulation."

https://openalex.org/W2168425804,"An inactive collagenase was harvested from both serum-free and serum-supplemented fibroblast monolayer cultures in periods of active collagen synthesis. The latent collagenase did not hydrolyze collagen and did not bind the potent collagenase inhibitor alpha2-macroglobulin. Activation with trypsin imparted to the enzyme the ability to hydrolyze collagen at neutral pH in a typical manner and to form an inhibited complex with alpha2-macroglobulin. The molecular weights, determined by calibrated gel filtration, were 78,000 and 60,000 for the latent and active enzymes, respectively. The data indicate that collagenase is released from the cells in inactive form, as a zymogen."

https://openalex.org/W1554784125,"Homogeneous DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) from avian myeoblastosis virus was assayed for exodeoxyribonuclease activity. The substrates were defined template-initiator complexes in which different radioactive nucleotides were present at the 3'-OH termini of the initiator. Even when the number of molecules of enzyme was equal to the number of initiator termini there was no significant release of radioactivity with any of the template-initiator combinations tested. Under similar conditions, the nuclease activity associated with either Escherichia coli or T4DNA polymerases rendered more than 90% of the initiator termini acid-soluble. The ratio of exodeoxyribonuclease activity to protein with avian myeoblastosis DNA polymerase is less than 0.003% of that obtained with E. coli DNA polymerase I. Furthermore, avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase failed to excise mispaired terminal nucleotides in both the presence and absence of polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1507016641,"Alpha 2u Globulin is a protein synthesized in the liver, secreted into the serum, and excreted in the urine of mature male rats. The effects of androgens and estrogens on the level of the messenger RNA coding for the male rat hepatic protein have been investigated. Castrated male rats have reduced levels of alpha 2u globulin in serum and liver cytosol, as measured by a radial immunodiffusion assay. The livers from these castrated males were found to contain similarly reduced levels of the mRNA coding for alpha 2u globulin, as measured in an mRNA-dependent wheat germ cell-free translational system. Administration of dihydrotestosterone to castrated males resulted in increased levels of alpha 2u globulin in liver and serum and this increase in the level of the protein following androgen administration was accompanied by a parallel increase in the functional level of alpha 2u globulin mRNA. Administration of estradiol-17 beta to intact male rats gradually diminishes the levels of alpha 2u globulin in liver and serum. The livers from these estrogen-treated males were found to contain alpha 2u globulin mRNA at similarly reduced levels. The time course of the disappearance of the alpha 2u globulin mRNA following estrogen treatment parallels the disappearance of the protein in liver cytosol and serum. These results indicate that sex steroids affect the synthesis of the hepatic protein alpha 2u globulin by acting pretranslationally, possibly at the level of transcription. Although the liver had not been considered a primary target tissue for sex hormones, these results indicate that sex steroids can affect certain hepatic functions in a manner consistent with the accepted model for the action of steroid hormones on their target tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1547342568,There are two isozymes of beta-glucosidase in developing cells of Dictyostelium discoideum. A procedure for screening large numbers of clones for beta-glucosidase activity was utilized to obtain mutations which directly affect the activity. We recovered seven strains which lack both isozymes and four strains with residual activity in which enzymatic and physical properties of both isozymes are altered. Beta-Glucosidase appears to act as a block to selfing in macrocyst formation as shown by the fact that ssite mating type to form macrocyst-like structures. Immunological evidence utilizing antisera prepared against purified beta-glucosidase-1 demonstrates that most of the glycosidases in Dictyostelium discoideum share a common antigenic determinant which appears to be added post-translationally. The two isozymes of beta-glucosidase share common protein subunits but the antigenic determinant is either lacking or masked in beta-glucosidase-2. This may account for some of the enzymatic and physical differences between the two isozymes.

https://openalex.org/W1548565276,"Subcellular membrane and granule fractions derived from human platelets contain immunologically identifiable alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antitrypsin. These platelet-derived inhibitors show a reaction of immunologic identity when compared to alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antitrypsin purified from human plasma. Further, the platelet protease inhibitors possessed a similar subunit polypeptide chain structure to their plasma counterparts as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis. Studies of the binding of radiolabeled trypsin to the various solubilized platelet subcellular fractions suggest that the granule-associated alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antitrypsin, as well as membrane-associated alpha2-macroglobulin were functionally active. Quantitatively, circulating platelets contain relatively small concentrations of these inhibitors as compared to platelet-associated fibrinogen and factor VIIIAGN. Platelet protease inhibitors may modulate the protease-mediated events involved in the formation of hemostatic plugs and thrombi."

https://openalex.org/W1575847461,"The fragmentation of native bovine serum albumin by trypsin has been studied in aqueous solution under various conditions with regard to the yield and size of the fragments obtained. From a partial tryptic hydrolysate at pH 8.2 (40 degrees, 1 hour), a homogeneous fragment was isolated in high yield by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The molecular weight of the fragment by gel filtration on calibrated Sephadex G-100 columns and by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis was 22,500. After reduction of the disulfide bonds followed by alkylation of the resultant thiol groups with iodoacetamide, the fragment retained homogeneity by disc electrophoresis and its molecular weight remained unchanged, indicating that it was composed of a single polypeptide chain. From its amino acid composition, sequence of the first 20 residues, and actions of carboxypeptidases A or B, it was unequivocally assigned to positions 377-571 in albumin. The inhibitory activity of the fragment was 90 to 93% towards the immune reaction of the protein with the IgG fraction of the antisera. The IgGfraction accounted for 96% of the total antibody activity in the antisera. An immunoabsorbent of fragment 377-571 removed 89 to 95% of the antibody to albumin. A fluorescent derivative of the fragment, which retained full immunochemical activity, was found to bind 2 mol of antibody/mol of peptide. The disulfides in peptide 377-571 were essential for its immunochemical reaction because the latter was entirely abolished upon reduction and S-alkylation of the disulfides. Since this fragment comprised only a third of the albumin molecule, but accounted for 90 to 95% of its antigenic reactivity, the results indicated that native albumin carries identical repeating antigenic reactive sites."

https://openalex.org/W2055036219,"The production of virus and the synthesis of virus-specific RNA has been studied in Fv-1n/n (NIH/3T3, SIM) and Fv-1b/b (BALB/3T3, SIM-R) cell lines after infection with N- or B-tropic MuLV. It was found that virus production, measured by reverse transcriptase activity in the medium, was 70-100 fold lower in cells resistant at the Fv-1 locus than in permissive cells. The virus-specific RNA, detected by hybridization. In RNA excess with complementary DNA, was reduced by approximately 70-100 fold in cytoplasm of resistant cells compared to permissive cells. A reduction of the same magnitude was observed in the levels of virus-specific RNA extracted from nuclei of resistant cells. Our data therefore show that virus-specific RNA levels are reduced in cells nonpermissive at the Fv-1 locus, suggesting that restriction of the Fv-1 gene product occurs at the level of transcription of the viral genome or at a pre-integration step, or, alternatively, that the RNA transcripts are rapidly degraded after their synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W145743152,"DNA polymerase from RNA tumor viruses (reverse transcriptase) has been analyzed for activities which have been associated with other DNA polymerases. Homogeneous DNA polymerase from avian myeoblastosis virus catalyzes pyrophosphate exchange and pyrophosphorolysis. Pyrophosphate exchange is dependent on a template and is base-specific. With avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase, ribonucleotide templates are more efficient for synthesis while deoxyribonucleotide templates are more effective for pyrophosphate exchange. Synthesis, pyrophosphate exchange, and pyrophosphorolysis were inhibited by the chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting that enzyme-bound zinc is required for each of these reactions. The pyrophosphate exchange reaction was also demonstrated with the DNA polymerase from a mutant of Rous sarcoma virus that possesses a temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase. The pyrophosphate exchange reaction with the mutant polymerase is temperature-sensitive which demonstrates that pyrophosphate exchange is indeed catalyzed by the viral DNA polymerase and that the same mutation effects both DNA polymerase and pyrophosphatase activity. Unlike Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, the DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus fails to degrade polydeoxyribonucleotides or to convert deoxynucleoside triphosphates into monophosphates. This lack of hydrolytic activities in avian myeoblastosis DNA polymerase should facilitate kinetic studies on the mechanism of DNA synthesis by this enzyme."
