https://openalex.org/W2092355100,"Conducting filaments of polyaniline have been prepared in the 3-nanometer-wide hexagonal channel system of the aluminosilicate MCM-41. Adsorption of aniline vapor into the dehydrated host, followed by reaction with peroxydisulfate, leads to encapsulated polyaniline filaments. Spectroscopic data show that the filaments are in the protonated emeraldine salt form, and chromatography indicates chain lengths of several hundred aniline rings. The filaments have significant conductivity while encapsulated in the channels, as measured by microwave absorption at 2.6 gigahertz. This demonstration of conjugated polymers with mobile charge carriers in nanometer channels represents a step toward the design of nanometer electronic devices."

Temperature, magnetic field, and linewidth measurements establish that these centers arise from excitons laterally localized at interface fluctuations. For sufficiently narrow wells, virtually all emission originates from such centers. Near-field microscopy/spectroscopy provides a means to access energies and homogeneous line widths for the individual eigenstates of these centers, and thus opens a rich area of physics involving quantum resolved systems."

Salination power as a resource is comparable with hydroelectric power in magnitude; U.S. freshwater runoff could yield over 10(10) watts. The energy flux available for natural salination is equivalent to each river in the world ending at its mouth in a waterfall 225 meters high. An osmotic salination converter could possibly operate at 25 percent efficiency. This energy source is renewable and nonpolluting. Although its full utilization would destroy estuarine environments, it might be practical for specialized purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2035954150,"Convective updrafts in thunderstorms prolong the lifetime of ozone (O(3)) and its anthropogenic precursor NOx [nitric oxide (NO) + nitrogen dioxide (NO(2))] by carrying these gases rapidly upward from the boundary layer into a regime where the O(3) production efficiency is higher, chemical destruction is slower, and surface deposition is absent. On the other hand, the upper troposphere is relatively rich in O(3) and NOx from natural sources such as downward transport from the stratosphere and lightning; convective overturning conveys the O(3) and NOx toward the Earth's surface where these components are more efficiently removed from the atmosphere. Simulations with a three-dimensional global model suggest that the net result of these counteractive processes is a 20 percent overall reduction in total tropospheric O(3). However, the net atmospheric oxidation efficiency is enhanced by 10 to 20 percent."

https://openalex.org/W1989750203,"The Redfield ratio [carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P)] of particle flux to the deep ocean is a key factor in marine biogeochemical cycling. Changes in oceanic carbon sequestration have been linked to variations in the Redfield ratio on geological time scales, but this ratio generally is assumed to be constant with time in the modern ocean. However, deep-water Redfield ratios in the northern hemisphere show evidence for temporal trends over the past five decades. The North Atlantic Ocean exhibits a rising N:P ratio, which may be related to increased deposition of atmospheric nitrous oxides from anthropogenic N emissions. In the North Pacific Ocean, increasing C:N and C:P ratios are accompanied by rising remineralization rates, which suggests intensified export production. Stronger export of carbon in this region may be due to enhanced bioavailability of aeolian iron. These findings imply that the biological part of the marine carbon cycle currently is not in steady state."

Individual electronic absorption features are identified in the asteroids' spectra. The energies, relative strengths, and shapes of these features are interpreted by using laboratory and theoretical studies. Analysis of the initial 14 asteroid reflectance spectra indicates the presence of the following types of surface materials: six carbonaceous chondrite-like; two stony-iron-like (metal/silicate ∼ 1); one iron meteorite-like; one basaltic achondrite-like; and four silicate-metal assemblages (metal/silicate ∼ 0.25). These results support the conclusion that the asteroid belt is a source of at least some meteoritic material, and they show a relation between certain asteroids and certain classes of meteorites."
https://openalex.org/W1542778122,"An ambitious $14 billion plan known as Coast 2050 attempts to protect more than 10,000 square kilometers of Louisiana's wetlands, which are disappearing at a rate of up to 90 square kilometers per year, one of the highest rates of land loss in the world. But a number of unanswered scientific questions swirl around the plan. And it could run afoul of powerful interests in the shipping, petroleum, and fishing industries."
https://openalex.org/W2069733391,"Nuclei in a fluid subjected to a continuous wave circularly polarized light beam are predicted to experience a static magnetic field proportional to E(+/-) x E(+/-), where E(+/-) is the electric vector of the right or left circularly polarized wave and the dot denotes a time derivative. The field strongly depends on the local electronic structure and is present in all atoms. For an intensity of 10 watts per square centimeter propagating in the direction of the field of a magnetic resonance spectrometer, the general theory presented here predicts shifts of +/- 4 x 10(-8) hertz for protons and +/- 10(-5) hertz for fluorine-19. Larger shifts are predicted if the laser frequency is near an optical absorption."
https://openalex.org/W1980922741,"A procedure is described that uses two spectroscopic techniques, absorption and infrared degenerate four-wave mixing, in tandem (multiplex) to measure the transition dipole moments and absolute concentrations of molecular species in situ. The method is demonstrated by the measurement of the relative transition moments and concentrations of two dissimilar sample gas components, hydrogen chloride and nitrogen dioxide, but is applicable to a wide variety of molecules and, thus, can provide new information for transient molecular species. Further, difficulties in obtaining quantitative information through techniques such as laser-induced fluorescence, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, and degenerate four-wave mixing spectroscopies can be overcome when a multiplex approach is used."
https://openalex.org/W2032773623,"Geomagnetic variations recorded in sediments deposited in Tito Bustillo Cave, Asturias, Spain, have been correlated with part of the geomagnetic record established for Lake Windermere, England. An age of between 11,200 and 11,600 years is suggested for a frieze of animals discovered in the cave, so that these polychrome paintings may be attributed to late Ice Age hunters (Magdalenian V-VI)."
https://openalex.org/W2126548396,"Since the Apollo missions, we have emphasized the following points, which are based on theoretical calculations and on laboratory studies of the properties of evaporated silicate deposits and of lunar samples. The mass of vapor generated by impacts on the lunar surface is comparable in magnitude to the mass of impact melt glasses; the physics of impact into a porous regolith requires that much of this vapor be retained in the soil rather than lost to space (as is widely believed); experimental coatings made from vaporized or sputtered lunar basalt contain abundant inclusions of submicroscopic, super paramagnetic metallic Fe; and this Fe may explain the magnetic signature, low albedo, reddened spectrum, and subdued absorption bands of lunar regolith. Our conclusions have been generally rejected by the lunar geochemical community for two reasons: there seemed to be no direct evidence for vapor deposits in Apollo samples, and it seemed that the lunar optical properties could be explained by the presence of impact melt glasses alone. However, advances in our understanding of the optical properties of glasses and of light scattering by planetary regoliths, and now the direct detection of vapor deposits, show that these objections are not valid. Vapor phase transport is a major process on the lunar surface, and unless its effects are taken into account, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of the regolith cannot be understood."

https://openalex.org/W2088605463,A worldwide increase in radar mleteor echo rates in 1963 correlates with the injection of massive quantities of volcanic dust into the upper atmosphere by the explosion of Mount Agung in Bali in March 1963. The consequent change in atmospheric radiative heating most probably produced the increase by changing the air density gradient.

https://openalex.org/W1525648073,"Scientists studying the latest high-resolution photos of the martian south polar ice cap think they may have found additional clues to its ebb and flow. These hints of the planet's bizarre atmosphere come from a new class of dramatic-looking terrain features whose dark, multilimbed, vaguely radial designs have earned them the moniker ""black spiders,"" and another group of dusky, spreading features called ""dark fans."" At a recent gathering here of Mars researchers, a planetary scientist proposed that the spiders might be subsurface gas channels, visible through an unusually transparent section of the martian ice."
https://openalex.org/W1533477814,"The rhythmic stretching of Earth's orbit seems to drive glacial cycles, but how this feeble ""orbital variation"" could cascade through the climate system of air, land, water, and ice to produce the monstrous climate shifts of the ice ages has remained a mystery. On page 1897 of this issue of Science, a paleoceanographer finds a likely strongman to transmit and enforce the orbital variations' demands: carbon dioxide. Comparing records preserved in deep-sea muds with those in antarctic ice, he finds that orbital variations may muster carbon dioxide into and out of the atmosphere, and the resulting waxing and waning of greenhouse warming may drive the glacial cycle."

This week, a committee of the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering and the Institute of Medicine validated many of their complaints and lent its considerable weight to efforts to provide greater institutional support for postdocs. At the same time, however, the panel sidestepped two burning issues by explicitly declining to recommend a boost in postdoc salaries or take a position on whether to curtail the size of the postdoc workforce, which has more than doubled in the past 20 years to an estimated 52,000."
