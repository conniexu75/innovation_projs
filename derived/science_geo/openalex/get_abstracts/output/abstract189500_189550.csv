https://openalex.org/W2035794494,"The conductance of a single molecule connected to two gold electrodes was determined by repeatedly forming thousands of gold-molecule-gold junctions. Conductance histograms revealed well-defined peaks at integer multiples of a fundamental conductance value, which was used to identify the conductance of a single molecule. The resistances near zero bias were 10.5 +/- 0.5, 51 +/- 5, 630 +/- 50, and 1.3 +/- 0.1 megohms for hexanedithiol, octanedithiol, decanedithiol, and 4,4' bipyridine, respectively. The tunneling decay constant (betaN) for N-alkanedithiols was 1.0 +/- 0.1 per carbon atom and was weakly dependent on the applied bias. The resistance and betaN values are consistent with first-principles calculations."

https://openalex.org/W2035222904,"Neural progenitors of the vertebrate CNS are defined by generic cellular characteristics, including their pseudoepithelial morphology and their ability to divide and differentiate. SOXB1 transcription factors, including the three closely related genes Sox1, Sox2, and Sox3, universally mark neural progenitor and stem cells throughout the vertebrate CNS. We show here that constitutive expression of SOX2 inhibits neuronal differentiation and results in the maintenance of progenitor characteristics. Conversely, inhibition of SOX2 signaling results in the delamination of neural progenitor cells from the ventricular zone and exit from cell cycle, which is associated with a loss of progenitor markers and the onset of early neuronal differentiation markers. The phenotype elicited by inhibition of SOX2 signaling can be rescued by coexpression of SOX1, providing evidence for redundant SOXB1 function in CNS progenitors. Taken together, these data indicate that SOXB1 signaling is both necessary and sufficient to maintain panneural properties of neural progenitor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2073918293,"In Drosophila, maternally supplied Nanos functions in the migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) into the gonad; in mice, zygotic genes are involved instead. We report the cloning and the functional analyses of nanos2 and nanos3 in mice. These genes are differentially expressed in mouse PGCs. nanos2 is predominantly expressed in male germ cells, and the elimination of this gene results in a complete loss of spermatogonia. However, nanos3 is found in migrating PGCs, and the elimination of this factor results in the complete loss of germ cells in both sexes. Hence, although mice and flies differ in their mechanisms for germ cell specification, there seems to be conserved function for nanos proteins among invertebrates and vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2026405777,"Plant disease-resistance (R) proteins are thought to function as receptors for ligands produced directly or indirectly by pathogen avirulence (Avr) proteins. The biochemical functions of most Avr proteins are unknown, and the mechanisms by which they activate R proteins have not been determined. In Arabidopsis , resistance to Pseudomonas syringae strains expressing AvrPphB requires RPS5, a member of the class of R proteins that have a predicted nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeats, and PBS1, a protein kinase. AvrPphB was found to proteolytically cleave PBS1, and this cleavage was required for RPS5-mediated resistance, which indicates that AvrPphB is detected indirectly via its enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2048044581,"One of the principal means of understanding upper mantle dynamics involves inferring mantle flow directions from seismic anisotropy under the assumption that the seismic fast direction (olivine a axis) parallels the regional flow direction. We demonstrate that (i) the presence of melt weakens the alignment of a axes and (ii) when melt segregates and forms networks of weak shear zones, strain partitions between weak and strong zones, resulting in an alignment of a axes 90° from the shear direction in three-dimensional deformation. This orientation of a axes provides a new means of interpreting mantle flow from seismic anisotropy in partially molten deforming regions of Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2064458964,"Damage induced in the DNA after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation activates checkpoint pathways that inhibit progression of cells through the G1 and G2 phases and induce a transient delay in the progression through S phase. Checkpoints together with repair and apoptosis are integrated in a circuitry that determines the ultimate response of a cell to DNA damage. Checkpoint activation typically requires sensors and mediators of DNA damage, signal transducers and effectors. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding mechanisms of checkpoint activation and proteins involved in the different steps of the process. Emphasis is placed on the role of ATM and ATR, as well on CHK1 and CHK2 kinases in checkpoint response. The roles of downstream effectors, such as P53 and the CDC25 family of proteins, are also described, and connections between repair and checkpoint activation are attempted. The role of checkpoints in genomic stability and the potential of improving the treatment of cancer by DNA damage inducing agents through checkpoint abrogation are also briefly outlined."
https://openalex.org/W1990956863,"Certain goal-directed behaviors depend critically upon interactions between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (ABL). Here we describe direct neurophysiological evidence of this cooperative function. We recorded from OFC in intact and ABL-lesioned rats learning odor discrimination problems. As rats learned these problems, we found that lesioned rats exhibited marked changes in the information represented in OFC during odor cue sampling. Lesioned rats had fewer cue-selective neurons in OFC after learning; the cue-selective population in lesioned rats did not include neurons that were also responsive in anticipation of the predicted outcome; and the cue-activated representations that remained in lesioned rats were less associative and more often bound to cue identity. The results provide a neural substrate for representing acquired value and features of the predicted outcome during cue sampling, disruption of which could account for deficits in goal-directed behavior after damage to this system."

https://openalex.org/W2134566626,"We report the humanization of the glycosylation pathway in the yeast Pichia pastoris to secrete a human glycoprotein with uniform complex N-glycosylation. The process involved eliminating endogenous yeast glycosylation pathways, while properly localizing five active eukaryotic proteins, including mannosidases I and II, N -acetylglucosaminyl transferases I and II, and uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP)- N -acetylglucosamine transporter. Targeted localization of the enzymes enabled the generation of a synthetic in vivo glycosylation pathway, which produced the complex human N -glycan N -acetylglucosamine 2 -mannose 3 - N -acetylglucosamine 2 (GlcNAc 2 Man 3 GlcNAc 2 ). The ability to generate human glycoproteins with homogeneous N -glycan structures in a fungal host is a step toward producing therapeutic glycoproteins and could become a tool for elucidating the structure-function relation of glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2131448623,"We used a multiplexed approach based on flow-stretched DNA to monitor the enzymatic digestion of λ-phage DNA by individual bacteriophage λ exonuclease molecules. Statistical analyses of multiple single-molecule trajectories observed simultaneously reveal that the catalytic rate is dependent on the local base content of the substrate DNA. By relating single-molecule kinetics to the free energies of hydrogen bonding and base stacking, we establish that the melting of a base from the DNA is the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle. The catalytic rate also exhibits large fluctuations independent of the sequence, which we attribute to conformational changes of the enzyme-DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W2119080469,"Fragile X syndrome carriers have FMR1 alleles, called premutations, with an intermediate number of 5' untranslated CGG repeats between patients (>200 repeats) and normal individuals (<60 repeats). A novel neurodegenerative disease has recently been appreciated in some premutation carriers. As no neurodegeneration is seen in fragile X patients, who do not express FMR1, we hypothesize that lengthened rCGG repeats of the premutation transcript may lead to neurodegeneration. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster, we show that 90 rCGG repeats alone are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. This phenotype is neuron specific and rCGG repeat dosage sensitive. Although devoid of mutant protein, this neurodegeneration exhibits neuronal inclusion bodies that are Hsp70 and ubiquitin positive. Overexpression of Hsp70 could suppress the neurodegeneration. These results demonstrate that neurodegenerative phenotype associated with fragile X premutation is indeed caused by the lengthened rCGG repeats and provide the first in vivo experimental demonstration of RNA-mediated neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1993428183,"Functional γ-secretase inhibitors (FGSIs) can block the cleavage of several transmembrane proteins including amyloid precursor protein (APP), and the cell fate regulator Notch-1. FGSIs, by inhibiting APP processing, block the generation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and may slow the development of Alzheimer's disease. FGSIs used to inhibit APP processing may disrupt Notch processing, thus interfering with cell fate determination. Described herein is a FGSI-mediated gastrointestinal toxicity characterized by cell population changes in the ileum of rats, which are indicative of Notch signaling disruption. Microarray analysis of ileum from FGSI-treated rats revealed differential expression responses in a number of genes indicative of Notch signaling perturbation, including the serine protease adipsin. We were able to show that FGSI-treated rats had elevated levels of adipsin protein in gastrointestinal contents and feces, and by immunohistochemistry demonstrated that adipsin containing ileum crypt cells were increased in FGSI-treated rats. The mouse Adipsin proximal promoter contains a putative binding site for the Notch-induced transcriptional regulator Hes-1, which we demonstrate is able to bind Hes-1. Additional studies in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes demonstrate that this FGSI inhibits Hes-1 expression while up-regulating adipsin expression. Overexpression of Hes-1 was able to down-regulate adipsin expression and block pre-adipocyte differentiation. We propose that adipsin is a Hes-1-regulated gene that is de-repressed during FGSI-mediated disruption of Notch/Hes-1 signaling. Additionally, the aberrant expression of adipsin, and its presence in feces may serve as a noninvasive biomarker of gastrointestinal toxicity associated with perturbed Notch signaling.

The process by which dividing intestinal epithelial stem cells in the crypt produce differentiated progeny requires the transcriptional regulation of genes necessary for cell fate determination.

Hes-1 transactivation is mediated by Notch processing and disruption of this processing by inhibitors of Notch-1 intramembrane cleavage (18Doerfler P. Shearman M.S. Perlmutter R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Given that the potential patient population for treatment of Alzheimer's disease is elderly, the profound affects of Notch disruption seen in embryonic and fetal development may not be of concern. However, it is now known that Notch signaling plays an important role in the ongoing differentiation processes of the immune system and the gastrointestinal tract (17Jensen J. Pedersen E.E.

As a result, it may be necessary to separate γ-secretase activity on APP from Notch processing activity to achieve an adequate safety margin for clinical development of a FGSI therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease. Achieving such a margin may be possible, as processing of these two proteins may require similar, yet independent proteolytic activities (24Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P.

Through gene expression analysis, we have shown that the presumed adipocyte-specific protein, adipsin, had similarly elevated mRNA levels and is a potential marker for Notch/Hes-1 signaling disruption effects in the gastrointestinal tract of rats. Levels of this secreted protein were found to be dramatically up-regulated in the intestinal contents and feces of FGSI-treated rats, and could be monitored non-invasively. Immunohistochemical labeling revealed that adipsin was produced by cells present in the crypt region of the intestinal epithelium and that adipsin labeling was greater in FGSI-treated rats. We also provide mechanistic evidence for adipsin gastrointestinal expression by showing that adipsin expression can be repressed by Hes-1, and reduction of Hes-1 levels by an experimental γ-secretase inhibitor released Hes-1 repression of adipsin, thus allowing for its transcriptional up-regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vivo Rat Studies—The experimental functional γ-secretase inhibitor Compound X (Fig. 1A) was synthesized as described (42Wu, J., Tung, J. S., Thorsett, E. D., Pleiss, M. A., Nissen, J. S., Neitz, J., Latimer, L. H., John, V., Freedman, S., Britton, T., Audia, J. E., Reel, J. K., Mabry, T. E., Dressman, B. A., Cwi, C. L., Droste, J.

Two temporal studies were conducted in Fisher 344 rats given vehicle alone (1% carboxylmethylcellulose, 0.25% polysorbate 80) or Compound X daily by oral gavage. All dose groups contained three rats per group. In the first study, doses of 10 mg/kg Compound X were administered daily for 4 days, 2 days, and 1 day with necropsy occurring 24 h post-last dose with additional groups terminated after 4 and 2 h of treatment. In a second study, for analysis of adipsin levels in plasma and feces, rats were treated daily with 20 mg/kg Compound X for 3 or 4 days, respectively. At necropsy, sections of ileum from treated and control rats were removed for gross morphological examination, histological analysis, and RNA isolation. The doses of 10 and 20 mg/ml Compound X were sufficient to produce severe gastrointestinal toxicities in rats after four daily doses and significantly exceeded the levels needed for pharmacological activity in vivo, which is defined as a statistically significant reduction in brain Aβ peptide levels in young PDAPP mice. This pharmacological activity was observed within 3 h of oral administration of 1-3 mg/kg of Compound X (data not shown).Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from ∼100 mg of rat ileum tissue, which had previously been collected and stored in RNAlater™ (Ambion) by homogenization using guanidium isothiocyanate-phenol (RNA-Stat 60™, Tel-Test). RNA was furthered purified using RNeasy™ columns (Qiagen). Equal amounts of RNA from each animal within treatment groups were pooled and samples were prepared for GeneChip™ analysis as per the Affymetrix eukaryotic expression sample protocol (rev1). Samples were then hybridized to rat genome RGU34A oligonucleotide arrays. Data analysis and mining were performed using Affymetrix Microarray suite (MAS4.0) and data mining tool (DMT 2.0) software.RT-PCR and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Oligonucleotide primers and probes were designed using PrimerExpress™ (ABS) primer design software using GenBank™ sequences of full-length mRNAs of the corresponding gene. Oligonucleotide sequences are shown in Table I. Total RNA was isolated as described above, and treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. DNase I was inactivated (DNAfree™, Ambion) and RNA was either used directly in RT-PCR (One-Step TaqMan™, ABS) or used to generate first strand cDNA (Omniscript™ cDNA, Qiagen) for use in quantitative (TaqMan™, SybrGreen™) or semi-quantitative gel PCR analysis. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the ABS 7700 sequence detector. Each sample was assayed in duplicate or triplicate and relative quantitation was performed using the ΔΔCt method (ABS user bulletin number 2) using 18 S RNA (Eukaryotic 18 S controls, ABS) as the normalization gene. Rat adipsin and Hes-1 primer/probe sets were determined to have the same amplification efficiencies as the 18 S control set (data not shown). Semiquantitative gel-based PCR was performed in duplex PCR reactions containing Hes-1 or adipsin primers along with titrated universal 18 S rRNA primers (Ambion). Primer concentrations and cycle number were optimized to ensure that reactions were analyzed in the linear phase of amplification.Table IOligonucleotides used in experiments described in this manuscriptGeneForward/sense primerReverse/antisense primerTaqMan™ probeRat adipsinCCGATGTCCTGCAGCAACTGTCCCTGCGGTTGCTCTCTCAGTGTCAATCATGGACCGGAACACCRat Hes 1TACCCCAGCCAGTGTCAACATCCATGATAGGCTTTGATGACTTTCCCGGACAAACCAAAGACAGCCTCTGARat cholecystokininCCGCCTGCCCTCAACTTAGCACGCCGCACTTCATATCTTCRat glucagon/GLP-2 aThe primer pair for glucagon also detects GLP-2, as both transcripts are derived from the same gene.GCAGCAAAGGAATTCATTGCTCATGTCTGCGCCCAAGTTCRat secretinGCAGCATTTATCACACCCAGAACACGTCCCGTCCGAGTGTCTRat somatostatinTGAGCCCAACCAGACAGAGAACTGCAGCTCCAGCCTCATCTMouse adipsinGCTATCCCAGAATGCCTCGTTCCACTTCTTTGTCCTCGTATTGCCCCCACGTGAGACCCCTACCCTTGMouse Hes-1TACCCCAGCCAGTGTCAACACCATGATAGGCTTTGATGACTTTCTCCGGACAAACCAAAGACGGCCTCTMouse Notch-1CCAGATGGCTTCACACCCCTGCGGTCTGTCTGGTTGTGCAMouse presenilin-1TCCTGCTCGCCATTTTCAAAATCCGTGGCGAAGTAGAACAMouse adipsin N-boxGGTTTTCTGCCCACCAGGCAAGGGGCAGCTGCCCCTTGCCTGGTGGGCAGAAAACCHuman adipsinGCAACAAAGTCCCGAGCAAGGCCTCCCCTTCTGCATATAGa The primer pair for glucagon also detects GLP-2, as both transcripts are derived from the same gene.

Cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. The medium for IEC-6 cells was additionally supplemented with 1.0 μm insulin. 3T3-L1 cells were passaged when no greater than 80% confluent. To induce adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cultures, cells were grown to confluence and maintained for 24 h, followed by a 24-h incubation with a mixture containing 500 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), 500 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), and 1.7 μm bovine insulin (Invitrogen). Media was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1.7 μm bovine insulin. Cells were maintained in this media with media replacement every 48 h for up to 10 days. The FGSI Compound X was prepared as a ×1000 stock in Me2SO and diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum prior to addition to cells.Antipeptide Antibody Generation and Immunoblotting—The protein sequences of rat, mouse, human, and pig adipsin were compared using multiple alignment software tools (Clustal W) and surface probability and antigenicity programs (LaserGene™). Regions having appropriate antigenicity profiles and corresponding to rat-specific, human-specific, and cross-species conserved epitopes were used to design peptides for the production of anti-peptide antibodies in rabbit. Resulting antisera were titered and affinity purified. Specificity analysis was performed by reacting the rabbit anti-adipsin antisera against Western blots containing rat, human, and dog plasma as well as a rat adipsin-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli. For Western blot analysis of adipsin levels in plasma, gastrointestinal contents, and feces, equal amounts of protein were loaded on 10-16% precast PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Gels were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked, and treated sequentially with affinity purified primary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody-conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Vector Labs), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. After 20 min of substrate development, blots were washed with water and photographed.Immunohistochemistry—Five-micron sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ileum were deparaffinized and rehydrated using standard methods. The rehydrated sections were immersed in Dako Target Retrieval solution (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) (diluted 1:10 in distilled water) at 95 °C for 10 min for antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and nonspecific labeling was blocked by incubation in 10% normal horse serum. Adipsin protein was immunolabeled with an affinity purified rabbit anti-adipsin conserved epitope antibody overnight at 4 °C. Duplicate negative control sections were incubated with 1% horse serum without addition of anti-adipsin antibody (Dako) followed by a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dako) and chromogenic development with diaminobenzidine (Dako). Labeled slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and mounted.Cloning and Plasmid Construction—Mouse full-length Hes-1 cDNA was prepared by RT-PCR from 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells and cloned directly into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His™ (Invitrogen). The construct, which we named, pHes-1, was verified by DNA sequencing and gel analysis of the resulting product of a [35S]methionine, rabbit reticulocyte coupled-transcription-translation reaction (TnT Quick™, Promega) using pHes-1 as a template. The β-galactosidase producing plasmid pcDNA3.1D/V5-His™/LacZ (pLacZ, Invitrogen) was used for analyzing transfection efficiency and as an experimental control.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—A 32P-end-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide (100,000 cpm), corresponding to the N-box binding site in the proximal promoter of the mouse adipsin gene (Table I and Fig. 7), was incubated with either a pHes-1 reticulocyte lysate from a coupled transcription/translation reaction or a nuclear extract isolated from 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Specificity of binding was determined by including unlabeled mouse adipsin N-box oligo (specific) or unlabeled SP1 (Promega) consensus binding site oligo (nonspecific) in the incubation. Incubation was carried out in a total volume of 10 μl for 30 min in a buffer consisting of 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 5 μg of protein. Binding reactions were run on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) until the dye front migrated 75% of the length of the gel. The dried gel was exposed to a phosphoscreen for 4-16 h and the image was acquired using a Storm™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Fig. 7An electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that Hes-1 binds to the mouse adipsin proximal promoter N-box oligonucleotide.

B, gel shift using a coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate reaction of the pHes-1 full-length mouse Hes-1 plasmid construct with 50,000 cpm of end-labeled murine adipsin N-box oligonucleotide. A 20-fold molar excess of cold N-box oligonucleotide reduced the binding of labeled oligonucleotide to Hes-1, whereas a 20-fold molar excess of a heterologous SP1 binding site oligonucleotide had no effect on binding. C, gel shift reaction with nuclear extract from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and 100,000 cpm of end-labeled murine adipsin N-box oligo. Increasing concentrations (×10 to 50) of unlabeled N-box oligo were able to compete away binding to the labeled N-box oligonucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transfections—3T3-L1 cells were grown to 80% confluence. Cells were transfected with pHes-1 or pLacZ plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen), and the media was replaced after overnight incubation. Transfection efficiencies were determined by staining cells for β-galactosidase activity (β-galactosidase staining kit, Invitrogen). After an additional 24 h, cells were treated with induction media as described above and incubated for 48 h. Cells were photographed to record morphology, and RNA was isolated for quantitative PCR as previously described.RESULTSA Functional γ-Secretase Inhibitor Produces Morphological Changes in the Gastrointestinal Tract of Rats—Compound X (Fig. 1A) is an experimental FGSI synthesized for the purpose of blocking Aβ peptide formation. The compound is structurally similar to one previously described as “Compound 6, Compound E” (21Beher D. Wrigley J.D. Nadin A. Evin G. Masters C.L. Harrison T. Castro J.L. Shearman M.S. J. Biol.

Treatment of Fisher 344 rats with Compound X at 10 mg/kg, a dose that is in excess of that needed for pharmacological activity (see “Experimental Procedures”, “In Vivo Rat Studies”), for 4 days produced a gastrointestinal toxicity characterized by an increase in gastrointestinal weight, distended small and large intestines, and the presence of a gelatinous material that we termed mucoid enteropathy (Fig. 1B). Histologic examination of ileum from Compound X-treated rats revealed a profound increase in the number of goblet cells lining intestinal villi compared with vehicle-treated rats (Fig. 1, C and D). This increase in goblet cell number coincided with a reduction in the number of absorptive enterocytes in the villus epithelium.Gene Expression Results—RNA isolated from the ileum of treated rats at various times was used to generate hybridization samples that were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip™ rat genomic RGU34A microarrays. Transcripts previously shown to be up-regulated in the gastrointestinal tract of Hes-1 knockout mice (17Jensen J. Pedersen E.E. Galante P. Hald J. Heller R.S. Ishibashi M. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Serup P. Madsen O.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), including glucagon/glucagon-like peptide-2, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, and secretin, were also up-regulated in the ileum of rats treated for 2 days with Compound X (Table II). Real time quantitative PCR analysis of 2-day treated ileum RNA samples verified the transcriptional up-regulation observed with microarrays (Table II). Mining of array data identified another secreted protein whose expression pattern was similar to those above, and fit the criteria of a potential premonitory marker of gastrointestinal injury. This transcript was identified as the serine protease adipsin. Examination of adipsin expression in ileum by microarray demonstrated basal expression in untreated rats, with progressive induction beginning at 2 h and proceeding through 4 days of treatment (Fig. 2B, line). Semi-quantitative PCR (Fig. 2A) and real time quatitative PCR (Fig. 2B, bars) confirmed the array results. Although Hes-1 transcript levels in rat ileum were below the level of detection by microarray, semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated down-regulation of Hes-1 message levels after Compound X treatment (Fig. 2, C and D).Table IIFold change for selected ileum transcriptsGene productRat accession No.-Fold changeGeneChipQ-RT-PCRGlucagon/GLP-2K028135.56.1 ± 1.23SecretinM640333.82.1 ± 0.62CholecystokininX010326.37.2 ± 2.40SomatostatinM258905.910.2 ± 2.30AdipsinM9205910.48.5 ± 1.35 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Adipsin gene expression is up-regulated and Hes-1 is down-regulated in the ileum of FGSI-treated rats.

https://openalex.org/W2163641250,"Any polar-ordered material with a spatially uniform polarization field is internally frustrated: The symmetry-required local preference for polarization is to be nonuniform, i.e., to be locally bouquet-like or ""splayed."" However, it is impossible to achieve splay of a preferred sign everywhere in space unless appropriate defects are introduced into the field. Typically, in materials like ferroelectric crystals or liquid crystals, such defects are not thermally stable, so that the local preference is globally frustrated and the polarization field remains uniform. Here, we report a class of fluid polar smectic liquid crystals in which local splay prevails in the form of periodic supermolecular-scale polarization modulation stripes coupled to layer undulation waves. The polar domains are locally chiral, and organized into patterns of alternating handedness and polarity. The fluid-layer undulations enable an extraordinary menagerie of filament and planar structures that identify such phases."

In RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, LPS (10 ng/ml) increases anandamide (AEA) levels >10-fold via CD14-, NF-κB-, and p44/42-dependent, platelet-activating factor-independent activation of the AEA biosynthetic enzymes, N-acyltransferase and phospholipase D. LPS also induces the AEA-degrading enzyme fatty acid amidohydrolase (FAAH), and inhibition of FAAH activity potentiates, whereas actinomycin D or cycloheximide blocks the LPS-induced increase in AEA levels and N-acyltransferase and phospholipase D activities. In contrast, cellular levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are unaffected by LPS but increased by platelet-activating factor. LPS similarly induces AEA, but not 2-AG, in mouse peritoneal macrophages where basal AEA levels are higher, and the LPS-stimulated increase in AEA is potentiated in cells from FAAH-/- as compared with FAAH+/+ mice. Intravenous administration of 107 LPS-treated mouse macrophages to anesthetized rats elicits hypotension, which is much greater in response to FAAH-/- than FAAH+/+ cells and is susceptible to inhibition by SR141716, a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist. We conclude that AEA and 2-AG synthesis are differentially regulated in macrophages, and AEA rather than 2-AG is a major contributor to LPS-induced hypotension.

The effects of AEA at the receptor are terminated by its rapid uptake through a high affinity membrane transporter (6Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and subsequent intracellular degradation by fatty acid amidohydrolase (FAAH) (7Cravatt B.F Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Although 2-AG is also a substrate for FAAH in vitro, it is metabolized in vivo by a monoglyceride lipase (8Dinh T.P. Freund T.F. Piomelli D. Chem. Phys.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an integral part of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a major pathogenic factor in septic shock. Macrophages are the primary target of LPS, which interacts with the CD14 protein/toll-like receptor-4 complex (12Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 252: 1321-1322Crossref Google Scholar, 13Dentener M.A. Bazil V. Von Asmuth E.J. Ceska M. Buurman W.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2885-2891PubMed Google Scholar) to activate multiple signaling pathways (14Muller J.M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Bauerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), which, in turn, activate a variety of transcription factors that regulate gene expression (15Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). LPS induces the expression of the cytokines TNFα, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-8, which have been implicated in the pathomechanism of septic shock (12Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 252: 1321-1322Crossref Google Scholar). LPS also induces the production of lipid mediators in macrophages, such as prostaglandins (16Minghetti L. Levi G. J Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2690-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), leukotrienes (17Rankin J.A. Sylvester I. Smith S. Yoshimura T. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and platelet-activating factor (PAF) (18Braquet P. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Immunol. Today. 1987; 8: 345-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PAF acts at specific PAF receptors on macrophages and plays a key role as an autocrine mediator of the macrophage response to LPS stimulation (19Szabo C. Wu C.C. Mitchell J.A. Gross S.S. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Bulger E.M. Arbabi S. Garcia I. Maier R.V. Shock. 2002; 17: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PAF also stimulates the synthesis of 2-AG in mouse P388D1 macrophages without affecting AEA levels (21Berdyshev E.V. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we used the RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line as well as peritoneal macrophages from FAAH knockout mice and their wild-type littermates to define the cellular mechanisms by which LPS induces the production of endocannabinoids in macrophages and to determine the relative role of AEA and 2-AG in LPS-induced hypotension. Materials—CD14 antibodies (N and C terminus) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PD98059, JNK inhibitor, SB203580, wortmannin, MG132 were from Calbiochem. LPS (Escherichia coli, 0127:B8), actinomycin D, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, l-α-phosphatidylcholine, β-acetyl-γ-O-alkyl (PAF), N-palmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine, Streptomyces chromofuscus phospholipase D, GF109203X, cycloheximide, α-amanitin, and BTP were from Sigma. AEA and 2-AG were from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). AEA [1-3H]ethanolamine and [1-14C]1,2-phosphatidylcholine-l-α-diarachidonyl were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). SR27417A was a gift from Sanofi-Synthelabo (Montpellier, France). SR141716 was obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 2H4-labeled AEA was synthesized by the reaction of arachidonyl chloride with [2H4]ethanolamine (22Giuffrida A. Piomelli D. Laychock S.G. Rubin R.P. Lipid Second Messengers. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998: 113-133Google Scholar). [14C]N-arachidonyl phosphatidylethanolamine was synthesized as described (23Sugiura T. Kondo S. Sukagawa A. Tonegawa T. Nakane S. Yamashita A. Ishima Y. Waku K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Animals—FAAH-/- and FAAH+/+ mice were obtained from heterozygote breeding pairs (24Cravatt B.F. Demarest K. Patricelli M.P. Bracey M.H. Giang D.K. Martin B.R. Lichtman A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) anesthetized with urethane, 0.7 g/kg of intravenous plus 0.3 g/kg of intraperitoneal, were used to monitor blood pressure responses to macrophages. Drugs or cell preparations were injected via a polyethylene cannula in the femoral vein. Mean arterial pressure was monitored via a cannula in the femoral artery, connected to a pressure transducer and computerized data acquisition system (EMKA Technologies, Arlington, VA). Cell Culture and Extraction—Mouse RAW264.7 macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum under standard conditions. To obtain primary macrophages, FAAH+/+ and FAAH-/- mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4.0 ml of 2% thioglycolate, and peritoneal cells were harvested 3 days later. Macrophages isolated from four to six mice in each group were pooled, plated onto 75-cm2 plastic flasks, and preincubated in 20 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with 5% dextrose in phosphate-buffered saline. Macrophages were treated for 90 min with vehicle or a maximally effective concentration of LPS (10 ng/ml for RAW264.7 cells or 5 μg/ml for peritoneal macrophages) and washed, and aliquots of 107 cells in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were injected intravenously into urethane-anesthetized rats to test their effect on blood pressure. For measuring endocannabinoid levels, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, and the cells plus medium were harvested and extracted with 2 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1) containing 7 nmol of [2H4]AEA as internal standard. The upper layer was extracted two more times with ice-cold chloroform and deproteinated with 10 volumes of ice-cold acetone. The extract was dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 50 μl of methanol for analysis by liquid chromatography/in-line mass spectrometry, using an Agilent 1100 series LC-MSD, equipped with a thermostatted autosampler and column compartment. Endocannabinoid Levels—AEA and 2-AG in cellular extracts were quantified by LC/MS, as described (25Wang L. Liu J. Harvey-White J. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The mass-sensitive detector (model LS) was set for atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, positive polarity, and selected ion monitoring to monitor ions m/z 348 for AEA, 352 for [2H4]AEA, and 379 for 2-AG. The amounts of AEA and 2-AG were determined using inverse linear regression of standard curves, produced using synthetic AEA and 2-AG. Values are expressed as pmol/108 cells. N-Arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) Levels—NAPE in lipid extracts of cells was isolated by TLC and quantified by the amount of AEA released through its digestion with S. chromofuscus PLD, as described (25Wang L. Liu J. Harvey-White J. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). N-Acyltransferase Activity—RAW264.7 cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.32 m sucrose. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min, and aliquots of the supernatant containing 2 mg of total cellular protein were incubated with 106 dpm of 1,2-phosphatidylcholine-l-α-[1-14C]diarachidonyl in a volume of 0.5 ml containing 0.01% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the mixture was reextracted by 1 ml of methanol. Lipids were separated by TLC with chloroform/methanol/NH4OH (80:20:1) as the mobile phase. The radioactivities of the lipid spots were quantified by a phosphorimaging device (Typhoon 8600). N-Acyltransferase activity was expressed as N-[14C]arachidonoyl NAPE formed per minute per mg of protein (26Cadas H. di Tomaso E. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1226-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity of NAPE-specific PLD—Extracts of RAW264.7 cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g to remove cell debris and then at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and then centrifuged again at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of BTP buffer (pH 8.0). NAPE-PLD activity was measured as described (27Moesgaard B. Petersen G. Mortensen S.A. Hansen H.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 131: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), except that 5 mm CaCl2 was added to the reaction mixture. Enzyme activity was expressed as the amount of [14C]AEA formed per min per mg of protein. FAAH mRNA and FAAH Activity—FAAH and β-actin mRNA were quantified by reverse transcriptase-PCR (28Liu J. Gao B. Mirshahi F. Sanyal A.J. Khanolkar A.D. Makriyannis A. Kunos G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), using appropriate primers. FAAH activity was quantified by the amount of the [3H]ethanolamine released from [3H]AEA labeled on the ethanolamine moiety (29Fowler C.J. Borjesson M. Tiger G. Br. J.

LPS Induces AEA but Not 2-AG in RAW264.7 Cells—Incubation of RAW264.7 cells with LPS induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the cellular levels of AEA, with a maximal, ∼10-fold increase observed at 90 min and 10 ng/ml LPS, whereas 2-AG levels remained unaffected (Fig. 1). These conditions were therefore used in subsequent experiments. The LPS-induced increase in AEA was largely prevented in the presence of 6 μg/ml actinomycin D or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Fig. 2). Actinomycin D was similarly effective at a lower concentration of 1 μg/ml (0.44 versus 0.95 pmol AEA/108 cells without or with LPS, respectively), and another inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, α-amanitin (75 μg/ml, Ref. 30Lindell T.J. Weinberg F. Morris P.W. Roeder R.G. Rutter W.J. Science. 1970; 170: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), also inhibited the LPS-induced increase in AEA levels (0.30 versus 0.60 pmol/108 cells).Fig. 2The LPS-induced increase in AEA in RAW264.7 cells is blocked by actinomycin D (ActD) or cycloheximide (CHX) but not by the PAF receptor antagonist SR27147A. Cells were incubated with vehicle (open bars) or 10 ng/ml LPS for 90 min (hatched bars) in the presence of the indicated treatment. Columns and bars represent means ± S.E. from six to eight experiments, and * indicates significant difference (p < 0.05) from value in LPS-stimulated control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LPS Induction of AEA Involves CD14, p44/42 MAP Kinase, and NF-κB—Preincubation of RAW264.7 cells with anti-CD14 antibodies (1:100) overnight or with the combination of the p44/42 kinase inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) and NF-κB inhibitor MG132 (20 μm) for 30 min almost completely blocked the effect of LPS, whereas incubation with PD98059, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm), or MG132 alone partially reduced the increase in AEA caused by LPS. In contrast, inhibitors of protein kinase C (GF109203X, 2 μm), p38 kinase (SB203580, 1 μm), or Jun terminal kinase (JNK, 10 μm) did not affect the LPS-induced increase in AEA (Fig. 3). LPS Up-regulates FAAH Expression and FAAH Activity in RAW264.7 Cells—The LPS-induced increase in AEA levels may be due to increased synthesis, decreased degradation by FAAH, or both. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with 10 ng/ml LPS resulted in a significant increase FAAH mRNA levels (Fig. 4A). A 90-min incubation with 10 ng/ml LPS also increased the enzymatic activity of FAAH, from 0.24 ± 0.02 to 0.33 ± 0.02 nmol/min/mg of protein (p < 0.05). This rules out decreased degradation of AEA being responsible for its increased levels in LPS-treated cells. Indeed, the LPS-induced increase in AEA levels was further enhanced in the presence of the FAAH inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (200 μm, Fig. 4B). LPS Increases NAPE Levels in RAW264.7 Cells—In untreated cells, the level of NAPE, the immediate precursor of AEA, was 2.2 ± 0.2 pmol/108 cells, which corresponds to ∼8 times the cellular levels of AEA measured in the same cells (Fig. 5A). Treatment with 10 ng/ml LPS caused a ∼3-fold increase in NAPE, which was less than the ∼10-fold increase in AEA levels in the same cells, resulting in a decrease in the NAPE:AEA ratio to ∼2.7. This suggests that LPS increases both the generation of NAPE by N-acyltransferase and its subsequent metabolism through its PLD-catalyzed cleavage, yielding AEA. We therefore measured the activities of both N-acyltransferase (NAT)- and NAPE-specific PLD in homogenates of vehicle- and LPS-treated cells. LPS Increases Both N-Acyltransferase and NAPE-PLD Activities—As illustrated by a representative experiment, LPS treatment markedly increased NAT activity (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). In three replicate experiments, NAT activity was increased 3.6-fold, from 1.58 ± 0.60 to 4.02 ± 0.24 pmol-1 min-1 mg of protein-1 (p < 0.05). LPS also increased PLD activity (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2) by a mean of 2.8-fold, from 13.3 ± 2.7 to 36.6 ± 7.6 pmol min-1 mg of protein-1 in vehicle- versus LPS-treated cells, respectively (n = 4, p < 0.05). The LPS-induced increases in both NAT and PLD activity were completely blocked in the presence of either actinomycin D (lanes 3 and 4) or cycloheximide (lanes 5 and 6). These experiments were also replicated two more times with similar results. LPS-treated Macrophages Elicit Hypotension in Rats—We tested the ability of vehicle- and LPS-treated macrophages to induce hypotension in urethane-anesthetized rats. Intravenous injection of 107 RAW264.7 cells preincubated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 90 min caused long lasting (>2 h) hypotension, which could be prevented by pretreatment of the recipient rat with the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 (3 mg/kg). No hypotension was observed when rats were injected with cells preincubated with vehicle only or with LPS in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 6A). In similar experiments, the hypotensive response to the injection of mouse peritoneal macrophages correlated with their AEA content (Fig. 6B). Vehicle-treated FAAH+/+ cells elicited no significant change in blood pressure, whereas FAAH+/+ cells treated with 5 μg/ml LPS and vehicle-treated FAAH-/- cells caused a small but significant hypotensive response. A much greater decrease in blood pressure was elicited by LPS-treated FAAH-/- cells, which had the highest AEA content. 2-AG levels were similar in vehicle-treated FAAH+/+ and FAAH-/- cells (126 ± 48 versus 142 ± 38 pmol/108 cells, n = 7) and were unaffected by LPS in both groups (197 ± 84 in FAAH+/+ versus 198 ± 65 pmol/108 cells in FAAH-/- cells, n = 5). PAF Is Not Involved in the LPS Induction of AEA in RAW264.7 Cells—LPS can increase both the number of functional PAF receptors (31Weber C. Aepfelbacher M. Haag H. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Weber P.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the production of PAF in macrophages (18Braquet P. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Immunol. Today. 1987; 8: 345-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and PAF has been implicated as an autocrine mediator of the effects of LPS on macrophages (19Szabo C. Wu C.C. Mitchell J.A. Gross S.S. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Bulger E.M. Arbabi S. Garcia I. Maier R.V. Shock. 2002; 17: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of PAF and a PAF receptor antagonist on endocannabinoid production in RAW264.7 cells in the absence or presence of LPS treatment. Incubation of cells with 100 nm of SR27417A, a potent and selective PAF receptor antagonist (32Herbert J.M. Bernat A. Valette G. Gigo V. Lale A. LaPlace M.C. Lespy L. Savi P. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 44-51PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect the LPS-induced increase in AEA (Fig. 2). Incubation of cells with 30 nm PAF itself did not influence AEA levels but caused a small, statistically significant increase in 2-AG within 2 min (Fig. 7A), which was unaffected by actinomycin D (not shown) but was blocked by pretreatment with 100 nm SR27417A. The PAF-induced increase in 2-AG is consistent with the observation in anesthetized rats that the acute hypotensive response to an intravenous injection of 5 ng/kg PAF is inhibited by pretreatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 (3 mg/kg, Fig. 7B). We have demonstrated that murine macrophages are capable of generating both AEA and 2-AG and that the cellular levels of these two endocannabinoids are differentially regulated. The results indicate that LPS acts through the cell surface CD14 molecule to selectively stimulate AEA synthesis through a transcriptional mechanism independent of PAF that targets the AEA biosynthetic enzymes N-acyltransferase and NAPE-PLD. In contrast, PAF acts through PAF receptors to elicit a more rapid increase in 2-AG but not AEA levels. The results also indicate that macrophage-derived AEA, but not 2-AG, is likely to contribute to the hypotensive response to LPS, whereas 2-AG may contribute to the acute hypotensive response to PAF. The calcium and PLD-dependent synthesis of AEA by macrophages, first reported in the rat JM771 macrophage cell line (3Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Sepe N. Buono A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and later also in RAW264.7 cells (33Pestonjamasp V.K. Burman S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), is similar to the biosynthetic pathway of AEA in neurons (2Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have implicated macrophage- and platelet-derived endocannabinoids as mediators of the hypotension associated with various forms of shock (4Wagner J.A Varga K. Ellis E.F. Rzigalinski B.A. Martin B.R. Kunos G. Nature. 1997; 390: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 5Varga K. Wagner J.A. Bridgen D.T. Kunos G.

Cardiol. 2001; 38: 2048-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) as well as the hypotension and vasodilated state in advanced liver cirrhosis (34Bátkai S. Járai Z. Wagner J.A. Goparaju S.K. Varga K. Liu J. Wang L. Mirshahi F. Khanolkar A.D. Makriyannis A. Urbaschek R. Garcia Jr., N. Sanyal A.S. Kunos G. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 35Ros J. Claria J. To-Figueras J. Planaguma A. Cejudo-Martin P. Fernandez-Varo G. Martin-Ruiz R. Arroyo V. Rivera F. Rodes J. Jimenez W. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Liver cirrhosis is often associated with endotoxemia (36Lumsden A.B. Henderson J.M. Kutner M.H. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and bacterial endotoxin may be the common factor responsible for the increase in endocannabinoid production in these conditions. Indeed, in vitro incubation with LPS was shown to increase both AEA and 2-AG levels in circulating macrophages isolated from normal rat blood (5Varga K. Wagner J.A. Bridgen D.T. Kunos G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Di Marzo V. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Melck D. Orlando P. Wagner J.A. Kunos G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). PAF is an autocrine mediator of LPS-induced effects in macrophages (19Szabo C. Wu C.C. Mitchell J.A. Gross S.S. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Bulger E.M. Arbabi S. Garcia I. Maier R.V. Shock. 2002; 17: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and can increase 2-AG in P388D1 macrophages (21Berdyshev E.V. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether PAF may be an obligatory intermediate of the LPS-induced production of endocannabinoids in RAW264.7 cells. LPS caused a 10-fold increase in AEA without affecting 2-AG levels, and the LPS-induced increase in AEA was unaffected by a PAF receptor antagonist (Fig. 2). This clearly indicates that PAF is not an intermediary in LPS-induced AEA synthesis. At the same time, we confirmed that PAF rapidly stimulates 2-AG production, but not AEA production, via PAF receptors (Fig. 7A). The effect of PAF was smaller than that reported in P388D1 cells (21Berdyshev E.V. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the difference most likely being related to the uniquely high expression of PAF receptors in P388D1 cells as compared with other macrophage cell lines including RAW264.7 (38Valone F.H. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2389-2394PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, different mechanisms are involved in the regulation of the two endocannabinoids, which could suggest that they have distinct physiological functions. Monocytes isolated from LPS-treated rats elicit cannabinoid receptor-mediated hypotension when injected into normal rats (5Varga K. Wagner J.A. Bridgen D.T. Kunos G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This implicated monocyte-derived endocannabinoids, but the respective roles of AEA and 2-AG could not be established. LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells also elicited SR141716-sensitive hypotension (Fig. 6A), and coincubation of the cells with actinomycin D prevented both the LPS-induced increase in AEA synthesis (Fig. 2) and the ability of the cells to elicit hypotension in recipient rats (Fig. 6A). This strongly suggests that this latter response is mediated by AEA and not 2-AG. Further support of this is provided by the finding that LPS-treated FAAH-/- peritoneal macrophages elicited much greater hypotension than similarly treated FAAH+/+ cells or vehicle-treated FAAH-/- cells (Fig. 6B), which correlated with their AEA but not their 2-AG content. LPS is known to promote macrophage adherence to endothelial cells by actions on both types of cells (39Doherty D.E. Zagarella L. Henson P.M. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3673-3679PubMed Google Scholar) and, although the lipophilic AEA may remain largely cell-associated (2Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 3Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Sepe N. Buono A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), this mechanism would deliver it in a “juxtacrine” manner to its site of action on the endothelium. Vascular endothelial cells express CB1 receptors (28Liu J. Gao B. Mirshahi F. Sanyal A.J. Khanolkar A.D. Makriyannis A. Kunos G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 34Bátkai S. Járai Z. Wagner J.A. Goparaju S.K. Varga K. Liu J. Wang L. Mirshahi F. Khanolkar A.D. Makriyannis A. Urbaschek R.

Commun. 1998; 243: 838-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) as well as SR141716-sensitive receptors distinct from CB1 or CB2 (10Járai Z. Wagner J.A. Varga K. Lake K.D. Compton D.R. Martin B.R. Zimmer A.M. Bonner T.I. Buckley N.E. Mezey E. Razdan R.K. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2002; 282: H2046-H2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The involvement of these latter receptors is suggested by our observation 2Z. Járai, S. Bátkai, P. Pacher, J. A. Wagner, and G. Kunos, submitted for publication. that the SR141716-sensitive hypotensive response to LPS remains unchanged in CB1 knockout or CB1/CB2 double knockout mice. The potentiation of the LPS-induced increase of AEA in FAAH-/- macrophages is in good agreement with the LPS induction of FAAH in RAW264.7 cells, as both findings indicate that FAAH activity limits the ability of LPS to increase AEA levels. This is different from the situation in human lymphocytes, in which much higher concentrations of LPS (10–100 μg/ml) have been reported to decrease rather than increase FAAH expression (43Maccarrone M. De Petrocellis L. Bari M. Fezza F. Salvati S. Di Marzo V. Finazzi-Agro A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects of LPS, exposure of RAW264.7 cells to PAF caused a PAF receptor-mediated, rapid (<2 min) increase in 2-AG without affecting AEA levels, and in vivo treatment of rats with PAF elicited an acute hypotensive response that was partially inhibited by the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716. This suggests that 2-AG may contribute to the acute hypotensive response to PAF. AEA and 2-AG may therefore have complementary biological roles as mediators of gradually developing, prolonged responses versus more rapid, acute physiological effects, respectively, at least within the cardiovascular system. The effect of LPS on AEA levels peaked at 90 min and was prevented by inhibitors of RNA transcription (actinomycin D, α-amanitin) or protein synthesis (cycloheximide), suggesting the transcriptional activation of a factor or factors involved in AEA biosynthesis. The finding that the levels of NAPE, the immediate precursor of AEA, increased less than AEA itself suggests that LPS increases both the generation of NAPE via an N-acyltransferase and its further metabolism into AEA via a NAPE-specific PLD. Indeed, we could show that LPS increases both N-acyltransferase and PLD activity in RAW264.7 cells. These effects of LPS were similarly blocked by actinomycin D or cycloheximide (Fig. 5B), suggesting that LPS induces the expression of the genes for these enzymes, or of factors involved in their activation, such as protein kinases. Although the identity of the specific protein targets of LPS in the AEA biosynthetic pathway is not yet known, their transcription appears to be regulated by NF-κB and p44/42 MAP kinase, but not by protein kinase C, Jun terminal kinases, or p38 kinase (Fig. 3). Neither the N-acyltransferase nor the NAPE-PLD have yet been identified by cloning, and the ability of LPS to induce AEA synthesis in RAW264.7 cells may be exploited to determine the molecular identity of these enzymes or the proteins that regulate their activity. The transcription factor NF-κB is a key signaling intermediate for LPS-induced responses in macrophages (15Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB can occur through activation of the IκB kinase-2 (IKKβ), which promotes IκB degradation (44Swantek J.L. Christerson L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11667-11671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and also through phosphoinositide-3 kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the transactivation domain of p65 (45Sizemore N Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that either wortmannin, a phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor, or MG132, a proteasome inhibitor that blocks IκB degradation (46Ibuki Y. Mizuno S. Goto R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is able to inhibit LPS-induced AEA synthesis, which implicates NF-κB activation in this process. A recent report that AEA inhibits NF-κB activation in lung adenocarcinoma cells (47Sancho R. Calzado M.A. Di Marzo V. Appendino G. Munoz E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) could suggest the existence of a negative feedback loop between NF-κB and AEA, which could affect other NF-κB-dependent mediators, such as TNFα (48Facchinetti F. Del Giudice E. Furegato S. Passarotto M. Leon A. Glia. 2003; 41: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The relationship between AEA and TNFα is also interesting in terms of their relative role in the early (<6 h) phase of LPS-induced hypotension. Both TNFα and interleukin-1β elicit hypotension in rats, which could be prevented by pretreatment with antibodies against these cytokines (49Gardiner S.M. Kemp P.A. March J.E. Wooley J. Bennett T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The finding that similar pretreatment failed to significantly influence LPS-induced hypotension (49Gardiner S.M. Kemp P.A. March J.E. Wooley J. Bennett T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggests that these cytokines, although their production is increased by LPS (12Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 252: 1321-1322Crossref Google Scholar), do not significantly contribute to the hemodynamic response to LPS. AEA synthesis by macrophages is also induced in hemorrhagic shock (4Wagner J.A Varga K. Ellis E.F. Rzigalinski B.A. Martin B.R. Kunos G. Nature. 1997; 390: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), where the role of LPS is less clear. Oxidative stress was found to cause NF-κB activation in hemorrhagic shock (50Altavilla D. Saitta A. Guarini S. Galeano M. Squadrito G. Cucinotta D. Santamaria L.B. Mazzeo A.T. Campo G.M. Ferlito M. Minutoli L. Bazzani C. Bertolini A. Caputi A.P. Squadrito F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); thus, NF-κB may be a common link among hypotensive conditions in which a paracrine vasodilator mechanism mediated by macrophage-derived endocannabinoids is activated. The present results indicate that AEA is likely to be this mediator."

Folding can reduce the amount of hydrophobic surface exposed to solvent, but sterically unfavorable gauche interactions result. However, we found that the alkyl chains of two common surfactants in aqueous solution adopt helical conformations when bound within a synthetic receptor. The receptor recognizes the helical alkane better than the extended conformation, even though 2 to 3 kilocalories per mole of strain is introduced. The proper filling of space and burial of hydrophobic surface drive the molecular recognition between the receptor and the coiled alkane."

The effect of LTP on neuron discharge was rate and context dependent. The LTP-induced ""remapping"" occurred without affecting the global firing rate of the network. The findings support the view that learned place representation can be accomplished by LTP-like synaptic plasticity within intrahippocampal networks."

Sequence bounding may thus reflect a general mechanism for encoding biological information.
https://openalex.org/W2047545995,"Short-term synaptic plasticity is a defining feature of neuronal activity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Depression of synaptic activity might be due to limited vesicle availability, whereas facilitation is thought to result from elevated calcium levels. However, it is unclear whether the strength and direction (facilitation versus depression) of plasticity at a given synapse result from preexisting synaptic strength or whether they are regulated by separate mechanisms. Here we show, in rat hippocampal cell cultures, that increases in the calcium binding protein neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) can switch paired-pulse depression to facilitation without altering basal synaptic transmission or initial neurotransmitter release probability. Facilitation persisted during high-frequency trains of stimulation, indicating that NCS-1 can recruit 'dormant' vesicles. Our results suggest that NCS-1 acts as a calcium sensor for short-term plasticity by facilitating neurotransmitter output independent of initial release. We conclude that separate mechanisms are responsible for determining basal synaptic strength and short-term plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W1997155353,"Voltage-gated Na+ channels are major targets of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-initiated signaling cascades. These cascades act principally through protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the channel alpha subunit. Phosphorylation reduces Na+ channel availability in most instances without producing major alterations of fast channel gating. The nature of this change in availability is poorly understood. The results described here show that both GPCR- and protein kinase-dependent reductions in Na+ channel availability are mediated by a slow, voltage-dependent process with striking similarity to slow inactivation, an intrinsic gating mechanism of Na+ channels. This process is strictly associated with neuronal activity and develops over seconds, endowing neurons with a novel form of cellular plasticity shaping synaptic integration, dendritic electrogenesis, and repetitive discharge."
https://openalex.org/W2034809433,"Neurons adapt their electrophysiological properties to maintain stable levels of electrical excitability when faced with a constantly changing environment. We find that exposing freely swimming Xenopus tadpoles to 4-5 hr of persistent visual stimulation increases the intrinsic excitability of optic tectal neurons. This increase is correlated with enhanced voltage-gated Na+ currents. The same visual stimulation protocol also induces a polyamine synthesis-dependent reduction in Ca2+-permeable AMPAR-mediated synaptic drive, suggesting that the increased excitability may compensate for this reduction. Accordingly, the change in excitability was prevented by blocking polyamine synthesis during visual stimulation and was rescued when Ca2+-permeable AMPAR-mediated transmission was selectively reduced. The changes in excitability also rendered tectal cells more responsive to synaptic burst stimuli, improving visual stimulus detection. The synaptic and intrinsic adaptations function together to keep tectal neurons within a constant operating range, while making the intact visual system less responsive to background activity yet more sensitive to burst stimuli."

Here, we use this technique to investigate signal transduction events at the plant plasma membrane triggered upon perception of microbial elicitors of defense responses, using as a model elicitor flg22, a peptide corresponding to the most conserved domain of bacterial flagellin. We demonstrate that two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in conjunction with mass spectrometry is a suitable tool for the identification of intrinsic membrane proteins, and we show that among them a syntaxin, AtSyp122, is phosphorylated rapidly in response to flg22. Although incorporation of radioactive phosphate into the protein only occurs significantly after elicitation, immunoblot analysis after two-dimensional gel separation indicates that the protein is also phosphorylated prior to elicitation. These results indicate that flg22 elicits either an increase in the rate of turnover of phosphate or an additional de novo phosphorylation event. In vitro, phosphorylation of AtSyp122 is calcium-dependent. In vitro phosphorylated peptides separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography comigrate with two of the three in vivo phosphopeptides, indicating that this calcium-dependent phosphorylation is biologically relevant. These results indicate a regulatory link between elicitor-induced calcium fluxes and the rapid phosphorylation of a syntaxin. Because syntaxins are known to be important in membrane fusion and exocytosis, we hypothesize that one of the functions of the calcium signal is to stimulate exocytosis of defense-related proteins and compounds.

Plants have the capacity to perceive a wide range of “general elicitors” from microbes, i.e. molecules that are typical of entire groups of fungi or bacteria but do not occur in plants. A number of such characteristic non-self molecules have been identified based on their ability to induce rapid biochemical changes in plant cell suspension cultures (1Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). While the exact role of general elicitors in disease resistance is unclear, many of the initial cellular responses are similar to those triggered by key determinants in pathogen recognition, the race-specific elicitors, or avirulence proteins (2Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nühse T.S. Peck S.C. Hirt H. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7521-7526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These responses include induction of ion fluxes and an oxidative burst at the plasma membrane, activation of protein phosphorylation cascades, and changes in transcription profiles. Substantial evidence supports a pivotal role for protein phosphorylation in the transduction of the elicitor signal (4Romeis T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Some of the plant resistance genes discovered through genetic screens are protein kinases (5Song W.Y. Wang G.L. Chen L.L.

Boller T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation by elicitors leads to a rapid increase in the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into phosphoproteins (8Peck S.C. Nuhse T.S. Hess D. Iglesias A. Meins F. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Felix G. Grosskopf D.G. Regenass M. Boller T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8831-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A number of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (10Zhang S. Klessig D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) as well as a calcium-dependent kinase (11Romeis T. Ludwig A.A. Martin R. Jones J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) are activated in response to general and race-specific elicitors, in some cases culminating in the activation of defense-related transcription (12Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, few phosphorylated targets of these kinases are known. We have shown that in vivo labeling in combination with two-dimensional PAGE and mass spectrometry is suitable to identify newly phosphorylated proteins in elicited Arabidopsis cells (8Peck S.C. Nuhse T.S. Hess D. Iglesias A. Meins F. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The complexity of the proteome prompted us to examine cell fractionation as a means to enrich for rare proteins relevant to signal transduction, particularly those at the plasma membrane. The fact that kinase inhibitors block the earliest known plasma membrane responses, such as ion fluxes or the oxidative burst (9Felix G. Grosskopf D.G. Regenass M. Boller T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8831-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), indicates that rapid, membrane-delimited protein phosphorylation is part of elicitor signal transduction. Here, we demonstrate that two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is suited to analyze integral plant plasma membrane proteins, and we identify a phosphorylated membrane protein with a potential role in calcium-dependent responses. Suspension cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana were maintained as described previously (3Nühse T.S. Peck S.C. Hirt H. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7521-7526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Dextran T-500 and immobilized pH gradient strips were from Amersham Biosciences. Flagellin peptide was synthesized on site as described previously (13Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Sigma or Fluka. POROS™ chromatography materials (R3 and MC) were purchased from Applied Biosystems/Applera UK (Warrington, Cheshire, UK); immobilized alkaline phosphatase was from MoBiTec (Göttingen, Germany). Cell Treatment and in Vivo Labeling—Cells were treated with 100 nm flg22 peptide (13Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) for 4 (for in vivo labeling) or 8–12 min (for unlabeled bulk extract). Labeling with 32P and phosphopeptide analysis were performed as described (3Nühse T.S. Peck S.C. Hirt H. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7521-7526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), except that typically 20–40 MBq were used per sample. For homogenization of in vivo labeled cells, the homogenization buffer (see below) was supplemented with 5 μm leupeptin, 1 μm K252a, and 100 nm calyculin A. Cells were broken in a glass potter on ice, and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in a small volume of buffer R (see below) and added to a complete phase mixture with microsomes from a large nonradioactive preparation, and the phase was separation performed as described below. Cell Fractionation—Suspension-cultured cells were collected by filtration and resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 100 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 15 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone K25, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; with addition of 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium molybdate for phosphoprotein analysis) at 2 ml/g of fresh weight. The slurry was enclosed in a Parr bomb (Parr Instruments) and stirred for 45 min at 4 °C after addition of nitrogen gas to a pressure of 70 bar/1000 p.s.i. Cells were broken by release of the pressure, and the homogenate centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 × g (GSA rotor, 3500 rpm–1). The supernatant (“total protein”) was centrifuged for 30 min at 120,000 × g (Ti45 rotor, 33,000 rpm–1) to yield soluble and microsomal fractions. For plasma membrane purification, the microsomal pellets were resuspended in buffer R (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 6 mm KCl) and subjected to phase partitioning (14Larsson C. Sommarin M. Widell S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 451-469Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar) in 6.0% each of Dextran T-500 and polyethylene glycol 3350 in buffer R. The U3 phase was diluted about 5-fold with buffer R, and plasma membranes were harvested by centrifugation for 60 min at 150,000 × g. Endomembranes were obtained by 2-fold extraction of L1 with fresh upper phase. For carbonate washing, the membrane pellets were resuspended in a small volume of buffer R plus 0.05% Brij 58, diluted 10-fold in 100 mm ice-cold Na2CO3, and incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional vortexing. Washed membranes were harvested by centrifugation (30 min at 100,000 × g). Marker Assays—Enzyme assays were adapted from Ref. 15Schaller G.E. DeWitt N.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 129-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. Phosphate determination (16Widell S.L.C. Larsson C.M.I.M. The Plant Plasma Membrane. Springer Verlag, Berlin1990: 17-43Google Scholar) was scaled down to a total 1-ml volume. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Precipitation of samples, two-dimensional separation, and immunoblotting was as described in Ref. 8Peck S.C. Nuhse T.S. Hess D. Iglesias A. Meins F. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar. The two-dimensional loading buffer was changed to 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 1The abbreviations used are: CHAPS, 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-propanesulfonate; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry; PM, plasma membrane; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2% Triton X-100, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1% immobilized pH gradient buffer, and a trace of bromphenol blue. For affinity purification of the antibody, GST-AtSyp122-(1–41) was expressed and purified with standard methods and coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-AtSyp122-(1–41) was purified on the affinity column as described in Ref. 17Harlow D. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar. Immunoprecipitation—500-μl aliquots of cell suspension were labeled with 20 MBq of [32P]orthophosphate before and after 4 min elicitation with 100 nm flg-22. The medium and excess label were removed and 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (as above) with 1% Triton X-100 was added. Cells were homogenized in a glass potter, insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min at 20,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant incubated with anti-Syp122 bound to protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C on a spinning wheel. After four washes with homogenization buffer plus 1% Triton X-100 and one wash with ddH2O, the beads were incubated with two-dimensional loading buffer (see above) on a shaker, and the solubilized proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE. For enzymatic dephosphorylation of unlabeled syntaxin, microsomes were prepared from 10 g of suspension-cultured cells as described above, solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and the syntaxin was immunoprecipitated. After several washes in homogenization buffer plus Triton, the beads were incubated in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) and dephosphorylated with 40 units of alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 90 min. Generation of Fusion Proteins—A cDNA of AtSyp122 (accession number AJ245407) in pSPORT was kindly provided by Dr. Liliane Sticher, Fribourg, Switzerland. The AtSyp122-(1–289)-His6 fusion was generated by introducing the affinity tag with the 3′ primer. The 5′ primers contained an NdeI site, the 3′ primers a BamHI site for cloning into the pET9a vector. Primers were: Syx122M1NdeI (5′-GATATACATATGAACGATCTTCTCT-3′) and A289His6/BamHI (5′-GAGGATCCCTAATGATGATGATGATGATGCTTCCGTGTGTTCTTCT-3′). For the N-terminal truncated form, the 5′ primer N42NdeI (5′-GATATACATATGAACCTAGACACGTTCTT) was used with A289His6/BamHI. The N terminus 1–41 for the generation of a GST fusion protein was amplified with M1BglII (5′-GTCGAGATCTATGAACGATCTTCTCT) and N41BamHI (5′-GAGGATCCCTAGTTACCACCGTGGCAACTT). The His6-tagged fusion of AtSyp121 was amplified from Arabidopsis leaf cDNA with primers Syx121M1NdeI (5′-GGTATACATATGAACGATTTGTTTTC) and A290His6/BamHI (5′-GAGGATCCCTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGGCAATACATGTCCATTT). PCR products were blunt-end cloned into EcoRV-cut pBSK. Plasmid preparations from white colonies were digested with NdeI/BamHI to be cloned into pET9a, or with BglII/BamHI to be cloned into pGEX 2TK. Expression in the BL21(DE3) strain, induction, and protein purification were done according to standard procedures using TALON resin (Clontech). For in vitro kinase assays, His6-tagged proteins were bound to the column in the presence of 8 m urea, washed with two column volumes each of the same buffer containing 6 and 4 m urea, and on-column renatured with a 10-ml gradient (0.5 ml/min; column volume 0.5 ml) from 4 to 0 m urea. Antibodies were produced by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) from gelpurified AtSyp122-(1–289)-His6. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Five micrograms of recombinant renatured AtSyp122-(1–289) and 2 μg of crude plant cell extract (prepared as above) were mixed in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EGTA, and 5.8 to 9.75 mm CaCl2 to give the indicated free calcium concentrations, as calculated with EQCAL) in a total volume of 25 μl. Kinasing was started by addition of 200 μm/40 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP and stopped after 15 min by addition of SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. For two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis, the in vivo or in vitro phosphorylated bands/spots were digested with trypsin and separated by two-dimensional-TLC/TLE as described in Ref. 18Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar. For MALDI analysis, 10 μg of recombinant Syp122 was phosphorylated with 2 μg of crude soluble extract in kinase buffer containing 1 μm free Ca2+ and1mm ATP for 4 h at room temperature. The proteins were precipitated with 80% acetone and digested with 0.2 μg of trypsin. Peptides were adjusted to 5% formic acid and desalted on a POROS R3 microcolumn (19Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), eluted with 50% acetonitrile, 100 mm acetic acid and incubated for 5 min at room temperature with Fe3+-charged POROS MC. Washing and elution with dilute ammonia, pH 11, was done as described in Ref. 20Stensballe A. Andersen S. Jensen O.N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar. Part of the eluate was re-acidified, bound to a new R3 microcolumn, and eluted onto the MALDI target with saturated 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% acetonitrile; the other part was diluted into phosphatase buffer and dephosphorylated with immobilized alkaline phosphatase. MALDI spectra were acquired on a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Proteomics for Plasma Membrane Proteins—We have used aqueous two-phase partitioning with polyethylene glycol 3350/Dextran T500 to obtain plasma membranes of high purity from suspension-cultured cells of Arabidopsis. Typical preparations were enriched by a factor of 7 to 9 in the plasma membrane (PM) marker, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity, compared with the starting material consisting of a crude microsomal fraction (Table I). Mitochondrial and chloroplast membranes were virtually absent from the PM-enriched preparation, whereas other endomembranes (tonoplast, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum) were depleted by a factor of at least four to six.Table ISpecific activities of marker enzymes for various cellular membranes, measured in the crude microsomal fraction (M) and purified plasma membranes (PM)Membrane compartmentMarker enzymeSpecific activityEnrichment factorPMMnmol pi/(mg × min)Plasma membraneVanadate-sensitive ATPase14201509.4TonoplastNitrate-sensitive ATPase4300.14Pyrophosphatase22880.25GolgiIDPase19900.21Endoplasmic reticulumAntimycin A-insensitive NADH-cylochrome c-oxidoreductase12760.16MitochondriaCytochrome c oxidase3.21400.023ChloroplastsChlorophyll (μg/mg)0.0644.70.013 Open table in a new tab For two-dimensional PAGE analysis, plasma membranes were washed with sodium carbonate. This step removed a large proportion of peripheral proteins and was essential to recover integral membrane proteins. High concentrations of detergents (CHAPS and Triton X-100) and thiourea (21Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 758-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) during the focusing step were important to achieve a good resolution (Fig. 1a). To determine whether integral membrane proteins were being resolved on the two-dimensional gels under these conditions, 30 spots were isolated and analyzed by MALDI-MS. Of 19 identified proteins, five were predicted to be integral membrane proteins containing a single transmembrane helix (Table II), and four of these are predicted to be located in the PM (PSORT). 2psort.nibb.ac.jp. In addition, several peripheral membrane proteins were identified (Table II). The other soluble proteins were predicted to be cytoplasmic (4Romeis T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), secreted (4Romeis T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), nuclear (1Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar), or in the chloroplast (1Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, this approach was successful in resolving plasma membrane proteins with at least one transmembrane helix, but it was not possible to eliminate all contaminating proteins from other organelles and the cytoplasm.Table IIIntegral and peripheral membrane proteins identified from the plasma membrane fraction separated by two dimensional PAGEAccession numberProtein nameLocationMolecular weight, estimation/theoreticalAt3g02880LRR-TM kinasePM80 (67.7)At4g12420Putative pollen-specific proteinPM90 (65.6)At5g52240Progesterone-binding protein homologuePM33 (24.5)At5g53560Cytochrome b 5PM17 (15.1)At2g01470Sec12p homologueER43 (42.8)AT4g04910NSF ATPasePer.80 (85.4)At3g08510PLC, PI-specificPer.65 (66.1)At2G26300GαPer.43 (44.5)At4g20260Unknown (PM-associated)?35 (24.5) Open table in a new tab Analysis of PM Phosphoproteins—To analyze phosphoproteins in the PM-enriched fraction, the preparative-scale two-phase system was supplemented with microsomes from in vivo 32P-labeled cells. After partitioning, PM proteins were separated by two-dimensional PAGE as before, and the gels analyzed by PhosphorImaging. Relatively few phosphorylated protein spots were visible on pI 3–10 non-linear two-dimensional gels of in vivo labeled PM samples (Fig. 1b). Judged from the position and pattern of labeled spots, the PM-specific set was undetectable in total labeled extracts, whereas the dominant soluble phosphoproteins (8Peck S.C. Nuhse T.S. Hess D. Iglesias A. Meins F. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were absent from the PM gels (data not shown). This result demonstrates the advantage of cell fractionation for enrichment of rare proteins. Several spots showed increased phosphate incorporation in the elicited sample (see boxed region in Fig. 1b, especially the marked “doublet”), whereas one doublet was less strongly labeled after elicitation. The six spots in the marked box were the most reproducible changes in numerous experiments and, thus, were the targets of further experiments. On an expanded gradient resolving pI 5.5–6.7 (Fig. 1c), better spot separation was achieved and allowed matching of the marked 32P-labeled spots with silver-stained spots. Identification by electronanospray mass spectrometry was so far successful for the induced doublet marked with arrowheads. Virtually the same set of tryptic peptide masses was found for both spots, and sequence tags from three peptides (Fig. 1d) were identical. The peptide sequence tags (22Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar) identified both proteins as a putative syntaxin (At3g53400), named AtSyp122 according to the nomenclature of A. Sanderfoot (23Sanderfoot A.A. Assaad F.F. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1558-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Among the over 20 Arabidopsis syntaxins, AtSyp122 belongs to a group of five putative plasma membrane/phragmoplast syntaxins. 3tc.umn.edu/~sande099/atsnare.htm. The ClustalW analysis in Fig. 2 shows the high degree of sequence conservation in the H3 domain that is in contact with the other SNAREs. All three identified peptides (enlarged) are from this region, but the sequence information (in bold type) and/or masses of the peptides were sufficient to identify the phosphoproteins unambiguously as AtSyp122. The sequence of the closest paralog, AtSyp121, and the equivalent tryptic peptides with their masses are included for comparison. It should be noted that the 41/44-kDa doublet is unlikely to arise from proteolytic processing because all possible cleavages would affect the pI of the protein. The larger form may be glycosylated, as has been reported for human syntaxin 1a (24Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Akagawa K. Tashiro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Confirmation That AtSyp122 Is Phosphorylated in Response to Microbial Elicitation—To confirm that AtSyp122 is the differentially phosphorylated protein and not just a more abundant, co-migrating protein, we performed immunoblots and immunoprecipitations with an antibody raised against the recombinant, hexahistidine-tagged cytoplasmic domain of AtSyp122. Immunoblotting showed a characteristic 34/38-kDa doublet and confirmed the membrane localization and plasma membrane enrichment of AtSyp122 (Fig. 3a). To ensure specificity of the antibody against AtSyp122, we affinity purified an antibody fraction recognizing the unique N terminus of the protein (see sequence comparison in Fig. 2). Affinity purification completely abolished cross-reactivity against the most similar paralog, AtSyp121 (Fig. 3b). Using this batch of antibody, we analyzed one- and two-dimensional immunoblots of plasma membranes from control and elicitor-treated cells (Fig. 3, c–e). The characteristic 41/44-kDa double spot (Fig. 3c, marked with an arrow) appears only in the elicited sample. Strikingly, however, this induced doublet is only a very minor species relative to the three other doublets found in both control and treated membranes. The presence of signals with four different pI values indicates three phosphorylation sites, with the most basic doublet corresponding to the unphosphorylated protein. In addition to changing the pI of the protein, phosphorylation also increases the apparent molecular mass by 3 kDa. The apparent high molecular weight form appears transiently after elicitation (Fig. 3d) and is sensitive to phosphatase treatment (Fig. 3e), demonstrating transient, elicitor-induced phosphorylation of Syp122. The affinity purified antibody proved unsatisfactory for immunoprecipitation (data not shown), possibly because of steric hindrance or phosphorylation site(s) in this domain (25Dubois T. Kerai P. Learmonth M. Cronshaw A. Aitken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (see below). Fig. 3d shows a two-dimensional analysis of immunoprecipitated syntaxin from in vivo labeled cell extracts using the unpurified antibody. Although the minor spots may arise from copurifying and/or cross-reacting proteins, the major labeled doublets migrate to similar positions as the confirmed AtSyp122 spots (Fig. 3c). The most basic doublet in the immunoblots (Fig. 3c) is not labeled, confirming that it represents the unphosphorylated protein. We conclude from these results that the protein identified as AtSyp122 is phosphorylated during responses to microbial elicitation. Calcium-dependent Kinase Activity Phosphorylates AtSyp122—To characterize the kinase activity responsible for AtSyp122 phosphorylation, in vitro assays with recombinant AtSyp122-(1–289)-His6 and cell extracts as kinase source were performed. In vitro phosphorylation was strongly enhanced by low micromolar concentrations of calcium (Fig. 4a). Although calcium-dependent kinases are often associated with membranes (26Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 27Martin M.L. Busconi L. Plant J. 2000; 24: 429-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the kinase activity was more strongly associated with the soluble than the membrane fraction (data not shown). A comparison of tryptic phosphopeptides separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography/electrophoresis revealed that two of the three phosphopeptides generated in vitro by a calcium-dependent kinase activity comigrate with authentic in vivo phosphopeptides (Fig. 4b). This result indicates that the calcium-dependent kinase activity mediates the AtSyp122 phosphorylation observed after elicitation in vivo. The in vitro kinase assay allowed us to prepare sufficient phosphorylated syntaxin to characterize the phosphopeptide(s) by mass spectrometry. Using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography to enrich for phosphopeptides (IMAC) (20Stensballe A. Andersen S. Jensen O.N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), we found two peptides that showed an 80-Da mass shift upon treatment with phosphatase and hence are phosphopeptides (Fig. 4c). The 1191.49-Da peptide corresponds to the phosphorylated extreme N terminus. The smaller peptide does not match any of the predicted peptides, but because of the mass difference to the bigger peptide (131.01 Da in the phosphorylated peptides), it probably represents the same peptide after cleavage of the start methionine. Calcium-dependent phosphorylation of the N terminus was confirmed in an in vitro assay using the GST-Syp122-(1–41) fusion (data not shown). The N-terminal phosphopeptide contains two potential phosphorylation sites (Ser-6 and Ser-8), of which the latter is conserved among the Syp1 family. Comigration of both in vitro phosphorylated peptides with the in vivo peptides would suggest that the syntaxin is also partially cleaved in vivo (i.e. in Arabidopsis). Therefore, the three spots in the in vivo map may represent only two phosphorylation sites with the third arising from +/–Met heterogeneity of one peptide. The two-dimensional electrophoresis separation of the syntaxin predicts three phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3C). However, assuming ordered phosphorylation, only the second and third phosphorylation sites are strongly labeled under the experimental conditions (see Fig. 3f). Thus, these may correspond to the only peptides detected in the"

We found that perceptual alternations are slowed when inducing stimuli move within the visual field, constantly engaging fresh, unadapted neural tissue. During binocular rivalry, dominance durations were longer when rival figures moved compared to when they were stationary, yielding lower alternation rates. Rate was not reduced, however, when observers tracked the moving targets, keeping the images on approximately the same retinal area. Alternations were reliably triggered when rival targets passed through a local region of the visual field preadapted to one of the rival targets. During viewing of a kinetic globe whose direction of rotation was ambiguous, observers experienced fewer alternations in perceived direction when the globe moved around the visual field or when the globe's axis of rotation changed continuously. Evidently, local neural adaptation is a key ingredient in the instability of perception."
https://openalex.org/W2021056331,"In the cerebellar circuit, Golgi cells are thought to contribute to information processing and integration via feedback mechanisms. In these mechanisms, dynamic modulation of Golgi cell excitability is necessary because GABA from Golgi cells causes tonic inhibition on granule cells. We studied the role and synaptic mechanisms of postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 (mGluR2) at granule cell-Golgi cell synapses, using whole-cell recording of green fluorescent protein-positive Golgi cells of wild-type and mGluR2-deficient mice. Postsynaptic mGluR2 was activated by glutamate from granule cells and hyperpolarized Golgi cells via G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs). This hyperpolarization conferred long-lasting silencing of Golgi cells, the duration and extents of which were dependent on stimulus strengths. Postsynaptic mGluR2 thus senses inputs from granule cells and is most likely important for spatiotemporal modulation of mossy fiber-granule cell transmission before distributing inputs to Purkinje cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078978698,"Vinca alkaloids are used widely in the treatment of both childhood and adult cancers. Their cellular target is the β-tubulin subunit of α/β-tubulin heterodimers, and they act to inhibit cell division by disrupting microtubule dynamics. Despite the effectiveness of these agents, drug resistance is a major clinical problem. To identify the underlying mechanisms behind vinca alkaloid resistance, we have performed high resolution differential proteome analysis. Treatment of drug-sensitive human leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) with vincristine identified numerous proteins involved in the cellular response to vincristine. In addition, differential protein expression was analyzed in leukemia cell lines selected for resistance to vincristine (CEM/VCR R) and vinblastine (CEM/VLB100). This combined proteomic approach identified 10 proteins altered in both vinca alkaloid response and resistance: β-tubulin, α-tubulin, actin, heat shock protein 90β, 14-3-3τ, 14-3-3ϵ, L-plastin, lamin B1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein-F, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein-K. Several of these proteins have not previously been associated with drug resistance and are thus novel targets for elucidation of resistance mechanisms. In addition, seven of these proteins are associated with the tubulin and/or actin cytoskeletons.

Cancer is the most common cause of death from disease in children in developed countries, and the most frequent childhood malignancy is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 1The abbreviations used are: ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; DE, differential expression; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MDR, multidrug resistance; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; PMF, peptide mass fingerprinting; VCR, vincristine; VLB, vinblastine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TCTP, translationally controlled tumor protein; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein; MAP, microtubule-associated protein.1The abbreviations used are: ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; DE, differential expression; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MDR, multidrug resistance; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; PMF, peptide mass fingerprinting; VCR, vincristine; VLB, vinblastine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TCTP, translationally controlled tumor protein; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein; MAP, microtubule-associated protein. With current treatment regimes, the majority of patients will be long term survivors, however, almost one-third of ALL patients relapse and most of those die due to the development of drug resistance. Vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine (VCR) and vinblastine (VLB), are natural product drugs used extensively in the treatment of ALL (1Pui C.H. Evans W.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). These agents target the β-tubulin subunit of α/β-tubulin heterodimers, inhibiting the addition of heterodimers onto growing microtubules and, hence, resulting in depolymerization of microtubules (2Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Microtubules are dynamic structures that are constantly growing and shortening (3Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar), and microtubule dynamics play an important role in many cellular events, including signal transduction, intracellular transport, cellular organization, and cell division. As such, the tubulin/microtubule system remains an important target for anticancer therapy (4Jordan A. Hadfield J.A. Lawrence N.J. McGown A.T. Med. Res. Rev. 1998; 18: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The development of resistance to chemotherapy agents poses a major clinical problem. Many cells develop resistance not only to the selecting agent but also exhibit cross-resistance to other structurally unrelated compounds. This classic multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is often characterized by overexpression of the transmembrane efflux pump P-glycoprotein (5Roninson I.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or by expression of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (6Kavallaris M. Anticancer Drugs. 1997; 8: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Ishikawa T. Kuo M.T. Furuta K. Suzuki M. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2000; 38: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki T. Nishio K. Tanabe S. Curr. Drug. Metab. 2001; 2: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, classic MDR is not the only mechanism of resistance to vinca alkaloids. Alterations to the drug target, tubulin, and tubulin-associated proteins, have been associated with vinca alkaloid resistance (Reviewed in Ref. 9Drukman S. Kavallaris M. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 21: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has identified multiple microtubule changes in vincristine- (CEM/VCR R) and vinblastine- (CEM/VLB100) resistant leukemia cells (10Kavallaris M. Tait A.S. Walsh B.J. He L. Horwitz S.B. Norris M.D. Haber M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5803-5809PubMed Google Scholar). As tubulin is the target for vinca alkaloids, the observed changes are hypothesized to favor more stable microtubules or affect the microtubule dynamics such that vinca alkaloid effectiveness is decreased. Coordinated interaction of microtubules and other cytoskeletal proteins is crucial for many cellular processes, including cell division; thus we proposed that other cytoskeletal elements are highly likely to be altered in these cells. To identify protein changes associated with vinca alkaloid resistance, the expression of cellular proteins in the drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines was analyzed using a differential proteomic approach. In addition, to further decipher the mechanisms of resistance to VCR in ALL, we must improve our understanding of the mechanism of action and cellular response to this agent. To this aim, we have analyzed protein expression changes in leukemia cells treated with VCR. Protein expression profiling has been used successfully to identify proteins associated with cellular processes such as apoptosis and necrosis (11Thiede B. Siejak F. Dimmler C. Rudel T.

We and others have utilized isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) to identify altered tubulin proteins in antimicrotubule drug-resistant cells (23Cabral F. Abraham I. Gottesman M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4388-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Boggs B. Cabral F. Mol. Cell.

Wang F. Martello L. Burd B. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, no studies to date have analyzed global protein changes in resistance to the vinca alkaloids VCR and VLB. In the present study, changes in the expression of numerous proteins were identified in vinca alkaloid-resistant cells. Of these, 15 proteins are associated with the tubulin and/or actin cytoskeleton. These proteins are all potential targets for involvement in the resistance phenotype of tubulin-targeted anticancer agents. To highlight those proteins most likely to play a direct involvement in the resistance phenotype we have combined the analysis of drug-sensitive and -resistant cell lines, with protein expression changes in vinca alkaloid-treated cells. This novel approach has identified 10 proteins, which are involved in both drug response and drug resistance, and are hence potential targets for improved treatment of relapsed disease, and thus worthy of further characterization. Of these proteins, seven are associated with the tubulin and/or actin cytoskeletons. Cell Culture—Human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, CCRF-CEM, and drug-resistant sublines, CEM/VCR R (vincristine-selected), and CEM/VLB100 (vinblastine-selected), were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum as suspension cultures. The CEM/VCR R are 22,600-fold (27Haber M. Norris M.D. Kavallaris M. Bell D.R. Davey R.A. White L. Stewart B.W. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5281-5287PubMed Google Scholar) and CEM/VLB100 are 200- to 800-fold (28Beck W.T. Cirtain M.C. Look A.T. Ashmun R.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 778-784PubMed Google Scholar) resistant to VCR and VLB, respectively. Mid-log phase cells were harvested for protein analysis by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Vincristine Treatment of CEM Cells—CCRF-CEM cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/ml 24 h before adding drug so as to ensure cells were in mid-log phase of cell growth. Cells were treated with 0, 2, 4, or 8 nm VCR for 24 h. Cells from each treatment were counted using the trypan blue exclusion assay (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Canada1988Google Scholar), then harvested for protein analysis as described above. Two-dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (2D-PAGE)— Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 1% sulfobetaine-3–10, 1% amidosulfobetaine-14, 2 mm tributylphosphine, 65 mm dithiothreitol, 1% carrier ampholyte (pH range 3–10), 1% carrier ampholyte (pH range 4–6), 0.01% bromphenol blue) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml as determined by amino acid analysis (30Cordwell S.J. Wilkins M.R. Cerpa-Poljak A. Gooley A.A. Duncan M. Williams K.L. Humphery-Smith I. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by pulse sonication twice for 10 s on ice. Endonuclease (1 unit/μg of protein; Sigma) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Protein extracts were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 12 min, and the supernatant was collected. Narrow range immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips, pH 4.5–5.5 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), were rehydrated in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Protein (100 μg for analytical and 500 μg for preparative gels) was cup-loaded and isoelectric focused for 150,000 Vh on a Multiphor II apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, 60 μg of protein in 500 μl of lysis buffer was in-gel-rehydrated in pH 4–7 IPGs and focused for 80,000 Vh. Second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed using 8–18% T polyacrylamide gels as previously described (31Verrills N.M. Harry J.H. Walsh B.J. Hains P.G. Robinson E.S. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3810-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Analytical gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby® (Bio-Rad) or transferred to nitrocellulose (see below). Preparative gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G250. Levels of protein expression were determined on SYPRO Ruby®-stained gels using the Z3 Image Analysis program (Compugen, Israel). Expression values (q value) were obtained from at least three independent two-dimensional gels, and differences in protein expression between the control CCRF-CEM cells and VCR-treated CEM cells, the CEM/VCR R or CEM/VLB100 cell lines, were determined by dividing the q value of the test sample by the control CCRF-CEM sample. Student's t tests were used to determine statistical significance (p < 0.05). Immunoblotting—For specific protein detection analytical two-dimensional gels were transferred to nitrocellulose using standard methods. Total α-tubulin (Sigma clone DM1A) and class I β-tubulin were detected using monoclonal antibodies as previously described (10Kavallaris M. Tait A.S. Walsh B.J. He L. Horwitz S.B. Norris M.D. Haber M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5803-5809PubMed Google Scholar). The class I β-tubulin Ab was kindly provided by Dr. R. Luduena, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX. The peptide used to raise this antibody is CEEAEEEA, corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of class I β-tubulin except for the C-terminal cysteine (32Roach M.C. Boucher V.L. Walss C. Ravdin P.M. Luduena R.F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Acetylated α-tubulin was detected using a mAb (Sigma clone 6–11 B-1) at 1:1000 dilution. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Protein Identification—Spots were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained preparative gels, washed twice in 25 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile, spun dry, and in-gel trypsin-digested in 10 ng/μl trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 16 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid solution. A 1-μl aliquot was spotted onto a sample plate with 1 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 8 mg/ml in 50% v/v acetonitrile, 1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry acquisition was performed on a TofSpec 2E mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) set to reflectron mode. Known trypsin auto-cleavage peptide masses (842.51 and 2211.10 Da) were used for a two-point internal calibration for each spectrum. Monoisotopic peptide masses were searched against the theoretical peptide masses of all human proteins in the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL protein databases (www.expasy.org) using the MassLynx search program (Micromass, Manchester, UK). A minimum number of four peptides was required for a positive identification with a peptide mass tolerance of ±50 ppm and allowing for 1 missed cleavage. ESI-TOF Tandem Mass Spectrometry—For exact identification of class I β-tubulin, upon analysis of MALDI-TOF mass spectra, a peptide at 1301.7 Da was selected for amino acid sequencing by ESI-TOF MS/MS. After in-gel trypsin digestion, the peptides were purified using a porous R2 resin column (33Larsen M.R. Larsen P.M. Fey S.J. Roepstorff P. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sample was then analyzed by ESI-TOF MS/MS using a Micromass Q-TOF MS, and data were manually acquired using borosilicate capillaries for nanospray acquisition. Data was acquired over the m/z range 400–1800 Da to select peptides for MS/MS analysis. After peptides were selected, the MS was switched to MS/MS mode, and data were collected over the m/z range 50–2000 Da with variable collision energy settings. The peptide sequence was compared with the human β-tubulin sequences in the Swiss-Prot database. Cellular Response to Vincristine—VCR is an antimitotic agent that induces mitotic arrest and cell death (34Jordan M.A. Himes R.H. Wilson L. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2741-2747PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the intermediate proteins involved in the cellular response to VCR, mid-log phase CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the drug for 24 h. The percentage of viable cells before and after treatment was determined by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1). As the concentration of VCR increases, the percentage of viable cells decreases. At the highest VCR concentration (8 nm) the percentage of viable cells is reduced to 58.2%. The VCR-treated cells display chromosome condensation indicative of mitotic arrest and at the higher concentrations show membrane blebbing and cell death (data not shown). To analyze the protein expression after VCR treatment, cellular proteins were separated by 2D-PAGE using pH 4–7 and narrow range pH 4.5–5.5 IPGs in the first dimension. Protein expression changes between the control and drug-treated cells were determined using the Z3 image analysis program. Differentially expressed proteins were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained gels and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for protein identification. Proteins displaying a significant change in response to VCR treatment are listed in Table I (and Supplementary Fig. 1).Table IProtein changes in response to 24-h vincristine treatmentSpot no.aSpot numbers are shown on Supplementary Fig. 1.Acc. no.bSwiss-Prot accession number, accessible at www.expasy.org.Protein identificationProtein expressioncThe expression value is the “q” value determined by using the Z3 image analysis program and is the mean ± S.D. of three individual experiments.

Wang F. Martello L. Burd B. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Altered Tubulin Proteins—Modifications to the drug target were observed in response to VCR treatment. Expression of a class I β-tubulin protein increased as the VCR concentration increased (Fig. 2). This protein spot is a more basic isoform 2In this context, isoform refers to isoelectric variants of known proteins. (pI ∼ 5.05) than the highly expressed major class I β-tubulin (pI ∼ 4.8) in these cells, suggesting this protein has been modified. The C-terminal region of α- and β-tubulin can undergo numerous post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, polyglutamylation, polyglycylation, and detyrosination (35Rosenbaum J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R801-R803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The expected mass of the C-terminal tryptic peptide of class I β-tubulin is 6290.51 Da and contains 20 positively charged amino acids. A large peptide of this acidic nature is not amenable to the negative ion MALDI-TOF MS utilized in this study (36Rao S. Aberg F. Nieves E. Band Horwitz S. Orr G.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and indeed this peptide was not observed in the mass spectra. Although β-tubulin isotypes are characterized by their C-terminal sequences (37Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there are a number of other amino acid differences between each isotype. The class I β-tubulin proteins were all identified by the presence of peptide masses 1301.71 Da (representing amino acids 47–62 only possible in class I); 1631.9 Da (representing amino acids 63–77 with methionine oxidized, only possible in class I and IV); and 1885.99 Da (representing amino acids 363–379 with methionine oxidized, only possible in class I and IV). For further confirmation, the peptide at 1301.71 Da was sequenced by ESI-TOF MS/MS and matched to that of class I β-tubulin (data not shown). Of 23 peptides identified in each class I β-tubulin protein spot, no changes in peptide mass were observed between the major intrinsic 3In this context, intrinsic refers to protein species expressed in parental drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells. class I β-tubulin protein and the more basic isoelectric variant induced with VCR treatment. Although MS identified the induced protein as class I β-tubulin, a mAb directed toward the C terminus of this tubulin isotype did not react with the modified protein (data not shown). Thus it is likely that the modification of the basic class I β-tubulin induced in response to VCR treatment is due to a modification at the C terminus. β-Tubulin forms a heterodimer with α-tubulin prior to assembly of microtubules. Modifications to α-tubulin were also observed in response to VCR. At least two more basic isoforms of α-tubulin 1 and one more basic isoform of α-tubulin 4, were induced by VCR treatment (Fig. 3A and Table I). The identification of these protein spots as α-tubulin was obtained by MALDI-TOF MS and was confirmed by immunoblotting with a total α-tubulin antibody (Fig. 3B). The intrinsic α-tubulin 1 and 4 proteins showed no significant change in response to VCR treatment (Fig. 3A; dashed arrows). Two proteins known to associate and/or bind to tubulin were also altered in response to VCR (Table I). FKBP59 (p59) associates with mitotic microtubules, and this protein showed a dose-response decrease in expression (Fig. 4A). The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a calcium-binding protein that was recently identified as a microtubule-stabilizing protein (38Gachet Y. Tournier S. Lee M. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Poulton T. Bommer U.-A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Yarm F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6209-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of this protein are expressed in these cells, and the more acidic isoform (indicated by an arrow) increases in response to VCR (Fig. 4B). Protein Cleavage—Specific protein cleavage by caspases occurs during apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 40Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar and 41Takahashi A. Int. J. Hematol. 1999; 70: 226-232PubMed Google Scholar). At least 10 different protein spots were identified as cleaved actin polypeptides. Analysis of the peptide sequence coverage indicates that four proteins represent the N-terminal region, four others represent the C-terminal region, and two spots are the middle portion of the mature actin polypeptide. The four protein spots covering the N-terminal region of actin are shown in Fig. 5A. The tryptic peptides from these spots cover the first half of the actin protein (Fig. 5A, panel ii). Additionally, each polypeptide was analyzed by Edman sequencing (data not shown). Spots 1 and 2 were N-"
https://openalex.org/W2139997535,"Previous studies have demonstrated that signal peptides bind to the signal recognition particle (SRP) primarily via hydrophobic interactions with the 54-kDa protein subunit. The crystal structure of the conserved SRP ribonucleoprotein core, however, raised the surprising possibility that electrostatic interactions between basic amino acids in signal peptides and the phosphate backbone of SRP RNA may also play a role in signal sequence recognition. To test this possibility we examined the degree to which basic amino acids in a signal peptide influence the targeting of two Escherichia coli proteins, maltose binding protein and OmpA. Whereas both proteins are normally targeted to the inner membrane by SecB, we found that replacement of their native signal peptides with another moderately hydrophobic but unusually basic signal peptide (ΔEspP) rerouted them into the SRP pathway. Reduction in either the net positive charge or the hydrophobicity of the ΔEspP signal peptide decreased the effectiveness of SRP recognition. A high degree of hydrophobicity, however, compensated for the loss of basic residues and restored SRP binding. Taken together, the data suggest that the formation of salt bridges between SRP RNA and basic amino acids facilitates the binding of a distinct subset of signal peptides whose hydrophobicity falls slightly below a threshold level.

The signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, influenza hemagglutinin epitope HA.11; IM, inner membrane; IMP, IM protein; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MBP, maltose-binding protein; TF, trigger factor; TMS, transmembrane segment. is a ribonucleoprotein complex that targets proteins to the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as the bacterial inner membrane (IM). Although a core domain of SRP is highly conserved throughout evolution, both the size of the particle and its substrate specificity vary considerably (for review, see Ref. 1Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Mammalian SRP is a relatively large particle comprised of six polypeptides and a 300-nucleotide RNA. In the first phase of the targeting reaction, the SRP 54-kDa subunit (SRP54) binds to both N-terminal signal sequences and transmembrane segments (TMSs) of integral membrane proteins (which often lack cleaved signal peptides) as they emerge during translation (2Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 3Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Girshovich A.S. Bochkareva E.S. Bielka H.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subsequently the ribosome-nascent chain complex migrates to the ER, where an interaction between SRP54 and a membrane-bound receptor catalyzes release of the nascent chain and its insertion into a protein translocation channel (5Gilmore R. Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 6Meyer D.I. Krause E. Dobberstein B.

At the other extreme, Escherichia coli SRP consists of only a homolog of SRP54 (Ffh) and an ∼100 nucleotide RNA (4.5 S RNA) that is closely related to helix VIII of mammalian SRP RNA. Despite the difference in size, bacterial and mammalian SRPs share many biochemical properties (8Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D. Strub K. Zopf D. Wilhelm H. Walter P. Science. 1990; 250: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Miller J.D. Wilhelm H. Gierasch L. Gilmore R. Walter P. Nature. 1993; 366: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of E. coli SRP, however, is more restricted in that it targets primarily inner membrane proteins (IMPs) to the IM (10deGier, J.-W., Mansournia, P., Valent, Q. A., Phillips, G. J., Luirink, J., and von Heijne, G. (1996) FEBS Lett., 99, 307-309Google Scholar, 11Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D.

Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Most periplasmic and outer membrane proteins, which contain cleaved signal peptides, are targeted to the membrane by molecular chaperones such as SecB (13Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike SRP, chaperones do not recognize signal sequences. Instead, they bind to the mature region of presecretory proteins late during translation or post-translationally to maintain translocation competence and to ensure that signal peptides are accessible to gate open translocation channels (14Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed 20 years ago that SRP recognizes the 7-13-amino acid hydrophobic core (“H region”) that is a universal feature of signal peptides (15Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). More recently, crystallographic analysis of mammalian SRP54 and its bacterial homologs revealed the presence of a large hydrophobic groove in the “M domain” that likely represents the signal peptide binding pocket (16Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Clemons Jr., W.M. Gowda K. Black S.D. Zwieb C. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mammalian SRP appears to interact with signal peptides that vary widely in hydrophobicity. In bacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which also has multiple targeting pathways; however, SRP discriminates between different targeting signals that vary only slightly in hydrophobicity. In those organisms presecretory proteins that contain moderately hydrophobic signal peptides are bypassed by SRP and targeted by molecular chaperones by default. In E. coli, maltose binding protein (MBP) and OmpA are normally targeted to the IM by SecB, but increasing the net hydrophobicity of their signal peptides reroutes both proteins into the SRP pathway (18Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the biogenesis of M13 procoat protein, a small IMP whose insertion normally does not require any targeting factor, becomes SRP-dependent when it contains an unusually hydrophobic signal peptide (19deGier J.-W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Likewise, yeast SRP binds preferentially to signal peptides that have a high hydrophobicity index (20Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The data suggest that different SRP54 homologs are calibrated to bind to a different range of targeting signals. Indeed the observation that the putative binding pockets of evolutionarily distant M domains differ considerably in size and shape (16Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Clemons Jr., W.M. Gowda K. Black S.D. Zwieb C. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) might account at least in part for the variation in substrate specificity. The recent solution of the crystal structure of the E. coli Ffh M domain bound to a fragment of 4.5 S RNA raised the unexpected possibility that SRP RNA may also play a role in substrate recognition (21Batey R.T. Rambo R.P. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The x-ray data show that a portion of the phosphate backbone of 4.5 S RNA lies adjacent to the hydrophobic groove in the Ffh M domain and appears to create an extended signal peptide binding pocket. The structure suggests that electrostatic interactions between the phosphates and basic amino acids that often reside at the N terminus (“N region”) of signal peptides and that flank TMSs might contribute to substrate recognition. Curiously, biochemical studies have not provided any evidence that SRP interacts with basic amino acids. Mutation of basic amino acids in model signal peptides does not significantly affect recognition by mammalian SRP in cell-free assays (22Szczesna-Skorupa E. Mead D.A. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8896-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, alteration of either the charge of the N region or the distance between basic amino acids and the H region can profoundly affect signal peptide cleavage, interaction with components of the translocation machinery, and translocation into ER vesicles (22Szczesna-Skorupa E.

A screen for mutations in the MBP signal sequence that improve export in a secB- strain (and that probably reroute MBP into the SRP pathway) yielded changes that increase its hydrophobicity but not its net positive charge (28Collier D.N. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of these results, however, rules out the possibility that interactions between SRP RNA and basic amino acids play a minor role in substrate recognition or that SRP RNA interacts with only a subset of signal peptides. Indeed electrostatic interactions might be expected to make a relatively small contribution to SRP recognition since signal peptides are predominantly hydrophobic and because only about a third of the putative extended binding surface is contributed by the RNA. In this study we reexamined the role of basic amino acids in the N region of signal peptides in targeting pathway selection. Our experimental strategy was based on the observation that E. coli presecretory proteins can be rerouted into the SRP pathway by increasing the hydrophobicity of their signal sequences (18Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if electrostatic interactions between SRP RNA and basic amino acids in signal peptides promote substrate recognition, then the presence of a highly charged signal peptide might likewise alter the targeting of presecretory proteins. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that replacing the native signal peptides of MBP and OmpA with a moderately hydrophobic, but atypically basic signal peptide derived from the signal peptide of the E. coli autotransporter EspP directed both proteins into the SRP pathway. As expected, SRP recognition required the presence of multiple basic amino acids. Several lines of evidence indicated, however, that basic residues only promote the binding of SRP to a distinct subset of signal peptides that barely escape detection on the basis of hydrophobicity alone. Reagents, Media, and Bacterial Strains—Polyclonal rabbit antisera against MBP and influenza hemagglutinin epitope HA.11 (HA) were obtained from New England Biolabs and Covance, respectively, and a polyclonal antiserum against Ffh has been described (8Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D. Strub K. Zopf D. Wilhelm H. Walter P. Science. 1990; 250: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Selective media contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol as required. All bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C except where indicated. The bacterial strains used in this study were MC4100 (F-araD139 Δ(argF-lac)U169 rpsL150 relA1 thi fib5301 deoC1 ptsF25 rbsR), HDB37 (MC4100 araΔ714 (29Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol.

Plasmid Construction—Plasmids pHL36, which contains an HA-tagged version of ompA under the control of a trc promoter, and pJH28 and pJH29, which contain malE under the control of a tac promoter, have been described (18Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 29Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43527-43535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To construct plasmid pJH46, the signal peptide of EspP was first amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-GTTTCCCTTAAAAATGGAGCTCATATGAA-3′ (EspP1) and 5′-GATGTAGAAATTTGAAATATCCATATGTGACGC and E. coli strain EDL933 genomic DNA (ATCC) as a template. The amplified DNA was then cloned into the NdeI site of pJH29. To make plasmid pJH47, the downstream NdeI site was abolished by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide 5′-CTTTTGCGTCACAGATGAAAATCGAAGAAGG-3′ and its complement, and a new NdeI site was introduced in the middle of the EspP signal peptide using the oligonucleotide 5′-CATCAAGAGCAACTCATATGAAAAAACACAAACGCATACTTGC-3′ and its complement. A plasmid that lacks the N terminus of the EspP signal peptide (pJH48) was then generated by resealing NdeI-digested pJH47. To construct plasmid pJH50, the EspP signal peptide was amplified with the oligonucleotides EspP1 and 5′-TTGAAATATCCATCTCGGCCGCAAAAGAATATGAGG-3′, and the amplified DNA was cloned into the NdeI and EagI sites of pHL36. Subsequently a new NdeI site was introduced into the middle of the signal peptide, and the plasmid was resealed after NdeI digestion as described above to create pJH51. All of the mutant versions of the MBP and ΔEspP signal peptides were constructed by introducing point mutations into pJH28 and pJH48. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). DNA encoding the first 94 amino acids of MBP and ΔEspP-MBP was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-GTCCGTTTAGGTGTTTTCACGAGGAATTCACCA-3′ and either 5′-TTGAGCGGATCCACCCATGCGGTCGTGTGCCCAGAA-3′ or 5′-TTGAGCGGATCCACCCATGCGGTCGTGTGCCCAGAACATAATG-3′ and either pJH28 or pJH48 as templates. The amplified DNA was then cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEM-4Z (Promega) to generate pJH56 and pJH57. To equalize the signal in in vitro translations, two amino acids near the C terminus of the ΔEspP-MBP 94-mer were changed to methionine during the PCR amplification. Plasmid pJH58 was constructed by transferring an NheI-Hind III fragment of pJH42 (29Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43527-43535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) containing the tig gene into pBAD33. Protein Export Assays—For most experiments, cells were grown in M9 containing 0.2% glucose. Overnight cultures were washed and diluted into fresh medium at an optical density (OD550) of 0.025. For analysis of OmpA export in SKP1101/SKP1102 and in cells that overproduced TF, M9 supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and all the l-amino acids except methionine and cysteine was used. For Ffh depletion studies, cells were grown overnight in M9 containing 0.2% fructose and 0.2% arabinose, washed in medium lacking arabinose, and then added at OD550 = 0.005 to medium containing fructose and either arabinose or glucose (0.2%). In general, synthesis of plasmid-borne presecretory proteins was induced by the addition of 50 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at OD550 = 0.2. For trigger factor (TF) overproduction studies, cultures were divided in half at OD550 = 0.2, arabinose (0.2%) was added to one portion, and incubation was continued for 30 min before IPTG addition. To analyze protein export at low temperature, cultures were shifted to 22 °C at OD550 = 0.2 and incubated for 40 min before IPTG addition. In experiments involving SKP1101/SKP1102, cultures were grown at 30 °C to OD550 = 0.1 and then incubated at 42 °C for 1.5 h before IPTG was added. In all experiments aliquots were removed from each culture 20-30 min after IPTG addition. Cells were then pulse-labeled with 30 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 s and incubated for various chase times. After the chase period proteins were precipitated immediately by the addition of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (29Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43527-43535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8-16% minigels (Novex). In Vitro Translation and Cross-linking—An E. coli translation extract was prepared by first rapidly chilling exponentially growing MRE600. Cells were washed and resuspended in 50 mm triethanolamine-acetic acid (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and passed twice through a French pressure cell at 8000 p.s.i. in a 1:1 (w/v) suspension. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before freezing. Truncated mRNAs were synthesized by incubating BamHI-digested pJH56 and pJH57 (100 ng/μl) and 15 units of SP6 polymerase (Promega) in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm rNTPs for 1 h at 40 °C. In vitro translation reactions (50 μl) programmed with these mRNAs were performed essentially as described (31Lesley S.A. Brow M.D. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2632-2638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that they were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Reactions were then placed on ice for 5 min and diluted with an equal volume of buffer A (35 mm triethanolamine in acetic acid (pH 8.0), 60 mm potassium acetate, 11 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Ribosome-nascent chain complexes were collected by centrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA100 rotor at 4 °C. The pellets were washed, resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A, and divided in half. E. coli SRP (50 nm) that had been purified as described (32Lu Y. Qi H.-Y. Hyndman J.B. Ulbrandt N.D. Teplyakov A. Tomasevic N. Bernstein H.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6724-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was added to one portion. Cross-linking reactions were then performed with 2 mm disuccinimidyl suberate as described (33Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. deGier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and proteins were precipitated with cold acetone. Half of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 14% minigels. Ffh-containing polypeptides were isolated from the other half by immunoprecipitation and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8-16% minigels. The Highly Basic ΔEspP Signal Peptide Reroutes E. coli Presecretory Proteins into the SRP Pathway—In considering the hypothesis that basic amino acids in signal peptides play a role in targeting pathway selection, we reasoned that naturally occurring presecretory proteins that contain signal peptides with atypically charged N regions might be SRP substrates. Strikingly, the signal peptides of the serine protease autotransporters of E. coli and Shigella (“SPATEs”) are both unusually long and unusually basic. These signal peptides contain a ∼25-amino acid segment that resembles typical signal peptides as well as a ∼25-amino acid N-terminal extension of unknown function. Previous results indicate that one member of the SPATE family, Hbp, is targeted to the IM by SRP (34Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine whether the basic residues found in SPATE signal peptides promote SRP recognition, we first replaced the native signal peptides of MBP and OmpA, two proteins that are normally targeted by SecB, with either the complete EspP signal peptide or a truncated version that lacks the N-terminal extension (ΔEsp). We then examined the effect of changing the signal peptide on the targeting of each protein. The EspP signal peptide was chosen as a model because its N region contains four closely spaced basic residues and a histidine, which might also be slightly charged (Fig. 1). Although the EspP signal peptide did not alter the targeting pathway of either MBP or OmpA (data not shown), we found that the ΔEspP signal peptide eliminated the SecB requirement for export. Initially MC4100 (secB+) and HDB55 (secB-) were transformed with plasmids encoding MBP or OmpA or a derivative containing the ΔEspP signal peptide ΔEspP-MBP or ΔEspP-OmpA under the control of the trc promoter. The plasmid-borne versions of OmpA were HA-tagged to distinguish them from endogenous OmpA. The synthesis of plasmid-borne proteins was induced by the addition of IPTG, and export was examined in pulse-chase labeling experiments. Radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated, and export was assessed by comparing the relative amounts of precursor and mature forms of MBP or OmpA at each time point. Consistent with previous results, the wild-type proteins were exported much less efficiently in the secB- strain than in MC4100 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-6). By contrast, ΔEspP-MBP or ΔEspP-OmpA was exported equally well in both strains (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-12). These results imply that the presence of the highly basic signal peptide reroutes the proteins from the SecB pathway to another targeting pathway or abolishes the need for a targeting factor altogether. Further investigation indicated that the ΔEspP signal peptide directs presecretory proteins into the SRP targeting pathway. To test the effect of depleting SRP on the export of proteins containing the ΔEspP signal peptide, isogenic secB+ and secB- strains in which ffh is under the control of the araBAD promoter (HDB51 and HDB52, respectively) were transformed with a plasmid encoding MBP or ΔEspP-MBP and grown in medium supplemented with arabinose. Ffh was then depleted from half of the cells by switching the carbon source to glucose, and protein export was assayed as described above. Ffh depletion did not measurably affect the export of ΔEspP-MBP in HDB51 but caused a significant export defect in the secB- strain (Fig. 2B, lane 4). The results suggest that ΔEspP-MBP is targeted by SRP in wild-type E. coli but can also be targeted effectively by molecular chaperones when the SRP pathway is impaired. Indeed given that the ΔEspP signal peptide is only moderately hydrophobic, this interpretation of the data is consistent with other results showing that SRP dependence correlates with an unusual degree of signal peptide hydrophobicity (see below and Ref. 18Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We next obtained direct evidence that SRP can interact with the ΔEspP signal peptide in chemical cross-linking experiments. Cell-free translation reactions were programmed with mRNAs that encode the first 94 amino acids of MBP or ΔEspP-MBP, radioactive nascent chains were synthesized, and the homobifunctional cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate was added to isolated ribosome-nascent chain complexes in the presence or absence of 50 nm E. coli SRP. When ΔEspP-MBP (but not wild-type MBP) nascent chains were synthesized, a prominent radiolabeled band of ∼55 kDa (the combined molecular mass of Ffh and the nascent chain) was observed in the presence of SRP (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-4). Immunoprecipitation with an anti-Ffh antiserum confirmed that the band corresponded to a cross-linked complex of Ffh and the nascent chain (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Ffh was cross-linked to the ΔEspP signal peptide considerably less efficiently than to the highly hydrophobic MBP*1 signal peptide (data not shown), but the reason for this discrepancy is unclear. The results of a different set of experiments strongly suggested that SRP also targets ΔEspP-OmpA to the IM. Presumably because SecB targets wild-type OmpA post-translationally, a variable amount of pro-OmpA was reproducibly observed in pulse-labeled MC4100 and related secB+ strains (Figs. 2, A and C, lane 1). This effect was particularly pronounced when cells were grown at 22 °C (Fig. 2C, lane 1, top panel). Interestingly, the precursor form of ΔEspP-OmpA was not observed in pulse-labeled MC4100 (Fig. 2A, lane 7; Fig. 2C, lane 3, top panel). When a strain harboring an ffh Ts mutation (SKP1101) and an isogenic ffh+ strain (SKP1102) were shifted to 42 °C, however, the ΔEspP-OmpA precursor was observed in the mutant strain (Fig. 2C, lane 3, bottom panel). These results suggest that ΔEspP-OmpA is targeted rapidly to the IM by the co-translational SRP pathway in wild-type cells but routed by default into a slower post-translational pathway when SRP function is impaired. We obtained further evidence that SRP targets ΔEspP-OmpA to the IM in experiments in which we overproduced TF, a chaperone that binds promiscuously to nascent polypeptides early in biosynthesis. Previous work showed that TF overproduction strongly retards the export of OmpA, β-lactamase, and alkaline phosphatase (a protein that does not require a chaperone for export) but does not affect the biogenesis of proteins targeted by SRP (29Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43527-43535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This effect can be explained by the observation that the binding of SRP and TF to nascent polypeptides is mutually exclusive (35Ullers R.S. Houben E.N. Raine A. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Ehrenberg M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Harms N. Luirink J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We transformed HDB37 (MC4100 ara+) with plasmids expressing the TF gene under the control of the araBAD promoter and either OmpA or ΔEspP-OmpA. As expected, the addition of arabinose greatly delayed the export of OmpA (Fig. 2D, lanes 1-4). TF overproduction, however, only very slightly affected the export of ΔEspP-OmpA (Fig. 2D, lanes 5-8). Taken together with the results described above these data provide strong evidence that the presence of the ΔEspP signal peptide routes presecretory proteins into the SRP pathway.

To further investigate the mechanism(s) involved in regulation of the MPT, we used diethylmaleate to deplete GSH in HL60 cells and increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The site of mitochondrial ROS production was determined to be mitochondrial respiratory complex III (cytochrome bc1), because 1) stigmatellin, a Qo site inhibitor, blocked ROS production and prevented the MPT and cell death and 2) cytochrome bc1 activity was abolished in cells protected from the redox-dependent MPT by stigmatellin.

Pretreatment of HL60 cells with dUb blocked ROS production induced by GSH depletion and prevented activation of the MPT and cell death, whereas Ub0 did not. Since we also found that dUb did not inhibit cytochrome bc1 activity, the mechanism of protection against redox-dependent MPT by dUb may depend on its ability to scavenge ROS generated by cytochrome bc1.

The factors involved in MPT regulation are of considerable importance in cell biology because the MPT is central to the cell death process.

FASEB J. 2002; 10: 1263-1265Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the absence of mitochondrial GSH, ROS production by cytochrome bc1 reaches toxic levels resulting in activation of the MPT and cell death (15.Armstrong J.S. Steinauer K. Lecane P.M. Birell G. Peehl D. Knox S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 24.Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P. FASEB J. 2002; 10: 1263-1265Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Given this scenario, and the key role of cytochrome bc1 in ROS production in redox modulated cells, pharmacological strategies aimed at inhibiting mitochondrial ROS production by cytochrome bc1 may be useful in preventing oxidative stress dependent activation of the MPT and cell death in a number of biological settings. In this respect, much interest has been shown in the natural lipid soluble antioxidant compound coenzyme Q (CoQ10) (18.Boveris A. Cadenas E. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25.Valls V. Castelluccio C. Fato R. Genova M.L. Bovina C. Saez G. Marchetti M. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. Biochem. Mol.

Med. 2002; 33: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). CoQ10 is a lipid-soluble compound that contains a redox active quinoid nucleus and a hydrophobic trans-isoprenoid side chain (28.Frei B. Kim M.C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4879-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Its hydrophobicity causes it to be inserted into the membrane phospholipid of the mitochondrial inner membrane (29.Lenaz G. Bovina C. D'Aurelio M. Fato R. Formiggini G. Genova M.L. Giuliano G. Pich M.M. Paolucci U. Castelli G.P. Ventura B. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Although CoQ10 is a natural lipid antioxidant, it is extremely insoluble in water and is therefore not taken up by cells to any significant degree which hinders its use as a therapeutic agent (32.Geromel V. Darin N. Chretien D. Benit P. DeLonlay P. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33.Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V.

One approach to circumvent this problem has been to develop mitochondrially targeted ubiquinone analogs including the compound Mito Q, which has been shown to possess both antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties (33.Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4588-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Yet another approach has been to synthesize ubiquinone analogs with a reduced number of carbons in the side chain compared with CoQ10. Included in this group is the clinically used synthetic compound idebenone (6-(10-hydroxydecyl)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone) (32.Geromel V. Darin N. Chretien D. Benit P. DeLonlay P. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that many short-chain CoQ10 analogs, including idebenone, enhance superoxide formation by respiratory complex I (30.Genova M.L. Pich M.M. Biondi A. Bernacchia A. Falasca A. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because idebenone is used in a number of clinical cytopathies and in neurodegenerative diseases, its potential pro-oxidant effects raise doubts regarding its safety as a drug (35.Gillis J.C. Benefield P. McTavish D. Drugs Aging. 1994; 5: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). From this foreword it is apparent that the identification of alternative compounds that may be employed therapeutically in diseases with an oxidative stress component is warranted. In this study we show that mitochondrial ROS production by cytochrome bc1 activates the MPT in redox sensitive HL60 (B) cells after GSH depletion. The redox-dependent MPT is blocked by inhibition of ROS production in cells pretreated with the CoQ10 analog decylubiquinone (dUb). Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma. Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bongkrekic acid (BA) was obtained from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—HL60 cells transfected with bcl-2 (bcl-2) (HL60 B cells) were cultured as described previously (24.Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P. FASEB J. 2002; 10: 1263-1265Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These cells were used in the experiments outlined below because we have previously shown that 1) Bcl-2 overexpression in the HL60 cell line confers a high sensitivity to GSH depletion and 2) that these cells are highly reproducible in their response to l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine and diethylmaleate (DEM) (24.Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P. FASEB J. 2002; 10: 1263-1265Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged daily to maintain them in log-phase and kept at a concentration between 2.5–5 × 105/ml. Measurement of Intracellular GSH Redox Change—Cells were treated with DEM (1 mm) for 0, 15, and 30 min. They were then pelleted by centrifugation and extracted with 5% perchloric acid/saturated boric acid. Intracellular GSH was measured with high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (24.Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P. FASEB J. 2002; 10: 1263-1265Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The amount of acid-insoluble protein was determined by the Bradford method with γ-globulin as a standard. Measurement of ROS Production—After treatment with DEM (1 mm) for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, cells were stained with 50 μm DCFDA for 15 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm glucose, and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). DCFDA is a non-fluorescent ester of the dye fluorescein. DCFDA is cleaved by intracellular esterases and entrapped within the cell as the oxidant-sensitive DCF. ROS oxidize DCF to the fluorescent product fluorescein (36.Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). The green fluorescence of fluorescein was measured using the FL-1 setting (log mode) after cell debris were electronically gated out. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. Measurement of Δψm—Δψm was measured with the fluorescent lipophilic cationic dye TMRM (250 nm), which accumulates within mitochondria according to the Δψm. After treatment with DEM for 0, 60, and 120 min, cells were stained with TMRM for 15 min and red fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using the FL-2 setting. The protonophore CCCP (1 μm) was used to dissipate the chemiosmotic proton gradient (ΔμH+) and served as a control for loss of Δψm. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. Electron Microscopic Examination of HL60 Cells—HL60 cells in the logarithmic proliferation phase were cultured with RPMI and DEM (1 mm) ± stigmatellin for 120 min and were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetraoxide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. Finally, the cells were dehydrated with graded series of ethanol and embedded in LX112. Thin sections were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate. Specimens were examined on a JEOL 1000X electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Respiratory Complex III (Cytochrome bc1) Activity Measurements— Cytochrome bc1 activity measurements were made as described in Ref. 37.Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar with modifications. Briefly, cytochrome bc1 complex activity from digitonin permeabilized and sonicated HL60 cell fractions were assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1% (w/v) and 0.01% Tween 20 at 23 °C, using 50 μm 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6n-decyl-1,4-benzoquinol(decylubiquinol) (dUb) as substrate and 50 μm cytochrome c. Decylubiquinonol was synthesized in the laboratory from decylubiquinone by reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) (37.Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome c was monitored in a spectrophotometer at 550 versus 539 nm in dual wavelength mode. Data are expressed as percentage of control activity and were determined from five individual isolations that were assayed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for unpaired data, and p values <0.05 were considered significant. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. After DEM Treatment, GSH Is Depleted and Levels of Intracellular ROS Increase—HL60 (B) cells were treated with DEM (1 mm), and GSH levels were determined on cell aliquots at 0, 15, and 30 min after DEM treatment (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1 shows that DEM treatment caused the depletion of GSH in the HL60 (B) cell line. GSH was ∼95% depleted 30 min after DEM treatment. Fig. 1B shows that an increase in cellular ROS production was detected 15 min after cells were treated with DEM. The Respiratory Site of ROS Production Is Cytochrome bc1—To determine the cellular site regulating ROS-production after GSH depletion, cells were co-incubated with DEM, DEM + rotenone, DEM + stigmatellin, or DEM + antimycin A. Rotenone selectively blocks respiratory complex I (38.Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), stigmatellin blocks the Qo site of cytochrome bc1 (39.Zhang L. Tai C. Yu L. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7656-7661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and antimycin A blocks the Qi site of cytochrome bc1 (40.Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Whereas rotenone and antimycin did not prevent ROS increase (Fig. 1B), stigmatellin blocked ROS production during the time course of the experiment indicating the involvement of the Qo site of cytochrome bc1 in ROS formation. To confirm the role of cytochrome bc1 in mitochondrial ROS production, cells were digitonin permeabilized and sonicated as described in the methods. Extracts from cells treated with DEM or DEM + stigmatellin (protected from ROS production and cell death) were assayed for cytochrome bc1 activity. Fig. 1C shows a representative example of cytochrome bc1 activity in control, DEM-treated, and control + stigmatellin-treated cells. Fig. 1D shows 1) that GSH depletion did not significantly alter cytochrome bc1 enzyme activity and 2) that cytochrome bc1 enzyme activity in both control cells + stigmatellin or DEM + stigmatellin-treated cells was decreased ∼95%. Inhibition of Cytochrome bc1 with Stigmatellin Blocks Loss of Δψm and Cell Death in DEM-treated Cells—Δψm was determined in cells by monitoring the fluorescence of the cationic potentiometric dye TMRM. Fig. 2A shows the Δψm at0h(panel a), 1 h (panel b), 2 h (panel c), 2 h + stigmatellin (1 μm) (panel d), 2 h + BA (25 μm) (panel e), 2 h + BA (50 μm) (panel f), 2 h + rotenone (1 μm) (panel g), control cells + CCCP (1 μm) (panel h). Δψm was decreased after DEM treatment which was prevented by BA and stigmatellin. Rotenone failed to prevent loss of Δψm induced by DEM. CCCP was used as control for loss of Δψm. Inhibition of loss of Δψm, after GSH depletion by BA, suggested that cytochrome bc1 activity was a critical factor leading to the activation of the MPT in GSH depleted cells. To confirm this electron microscopy was performed to determine the mitochondrial ultrastructure in cells after GSH depletion. Fig. 2B shows representative electron micrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure in control cells (panel a), cells treated with DEM for 150 min h (panel b), and cells treated with DEM for 2 h + stigmatellin (panel c). Co-incubation of cells with DEM + stigmatellin preserved mitochondrial structure and prevented changes (mitochondrial swelling) associated with activation of the MPT). We next hypothesized that since stigmatellin blocked ROS production and mitochondrial changes associated with activation of the MPT in GSH depleted cells, that stigmatellin should protect cells from loss of viability after GSH depletion. Fig. 2C shows that stigmatellin, but not the complex I inhibitor rotenone, significantly protects cells from loss of viability induced by GSH depletion. Cellular Pretreatment with dUb Blocks ROS Production, Loss of Δψm, and Loss of Cell Viability after DEM Treatment— Previously it has been found that the coenzyme Q analogs dUb and ubiquinone 0 (Ub0) block the MPT in isolated mitochondria. To test whether these analogs blocked the MPT in mitochondria in situ, we pretreated cells with either dUb (10 μm) or Ub0 (10 μm) for 6 h, washed the cells in fresh medium, and incubated the cells with DEM. Fig. 3A shows that cells pretreated with dUb blocked the increase in DCF fluorescence induced by H2O2 compared with untreated cells, indicating that dUb pretreatment increased the cellular antioxidant potential of these cells. By contrast, pretreatment with Ub0 increased the level of ROS compared with untreated cells after treatment with H2O2. We next determined whether pretreatment of cells with dUb or Ub0 blocked the increased mitochondrial ROS produced by GSH depletion using DEM. dUb attenuated the increase in ROS mediated by DEM, whereas levels of ROS in cells pretreated with Ub0 did not significantly differ from unconditioned cells (Fig. 3B). Since dUb pretreatment attenuated the ROS increase in HL60 (B) cells, we next determined the effect of pretreatment of cells with dUb and Ub0 on Δψm after DEM treatment. Fig. 3C (top panel) shows a representative example of Δψm in cells either pretreated with dUb, Ub0, or RPMI (control) after DEM treatment. Pretreatment with dUb blocked the loss of Δψm induced by DEM, whereas pretreatment with Ub0 did not. Fig. 3C (bottom panel) shows that the percentage of cells with intact Δψm either pretreated with dUb followed by treatment with DEM, or co-incubated with DEM + BA, is not significantly different from the percentage of control cells with intact Δψm. Since the pretreatment of HL60 (B) cells with dUb blocked both ROS increase and activation of the MPT, we hypothesized that pretreatment with dUb would protect cells against loss of viability induced by GSH depletion with DEM. Fig. 3D shows that dUb pretreatment protected cells against loss of viability induced by DEM treatment, whereas pretreatment with Ub0 had no protective effect. We next determined whether the mechanism of protection against ROS increase and activation of the MPT by dUb was due to inhibition of cytochrome bc1 activity or was the result of either inhibition of ROS production by cytochrome bc1 or was due to ROS scavenging. To differentiate between these possibilities we pretreated cells with a range of concentrations of dUb (100 nm to 50 μm), incubated them with DEM for 150 min, and measured cytochrome bc1 activity. Fig. 3E shows that cytochrome bc1 activity was not inhibited by dUb (even at concentrations of dUb well in excess of those used to protect cells from ROS-dependent activation of the MPT and cell death). These results indicated that dUb exerted its effects on ROS by either inhibition of ROS production by cytochrome bc1 or that it scavenged ROS produced. Determining the cellular mechanisms controlling life and death is of central importance in understanding the pathogenesis, progression, and possible modes of intervention in many age-related diseases and disorders. Mitochondria, because of their role in energy transduction, are central to the health of the cell; however, they also play a crucial role in mediating cell death via activation of the MPT. The MPT, although a poorly understood phenomenon, is activated in response to either increased levels of matrix calcium or oxidative stress (5.Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 124: 139-176Crossref Scopus (2199) Google Scholar, 6.Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar, 7.Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Depletion of mitochondrial GSH creates oxidative stress via increased mitochondrial ROS production; therefore, it is clearly important to define both the mitochondrial site and mechanism responsible for ROS production. Using a simple pharmacological approach we found that inhibition of cytochrome bc1 activity blocked ROS production in GSH depleted HL60 cells, whereas inhibition of respiratory complex I, in the same experimental setting, did not. These results implicated cytochrome bc1 as being a critical site in ROS production in redox modulated HL60 cells. The importance of cytochrome bc1 in ROS production was further supported by the observation that its inhibition blocked the MPT and cell death in GSH depleted cells and was confirmed with the finding that in cells pharmacologically protected from the MPT cytochrome bc1 activity was abolished. Cytochrome bc1, an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c while concomitantly translocating protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane during the process of redox energy conservation (41.Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of cytochrome bc1, although incompletely understood, is suggested to involve separate catalytic sites for quinol oxidation (Qo site) and quinone reduction (Qi site) (42.Crofts A.R. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L. Kuras R. Zhang Z. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15791-15806Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 43.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K.

Acta. 1998; 1365: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Quinol oxidation requires the bifurcated transfer of two electrons in cytochrome bc1. This process depends on alternating movement of the iron sulfur protein, which is blocked by the Qo site-selective inhibitor stigmatellin (38.Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We found that antimycin A, a Qi site inhibitor of cytochrome bc1 (40.Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), failed to block ROS production, whereas stigmatellin, a Qo site inhibitor, abolished ROS production, which suggested that the intermediate responsible for ROS formation by cytochrome bc1 was the ubisemiquinone radical as previously suggested (17.Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 18.Boveris A. Cadenas E. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23.Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36027-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). We next determined the effects of ROS production by cytochrome bc1 on Δψm and mitochondrial ultrastructure (Fig. 2, A and B). DEM treatment caused loss of Δψm, which was effectively blocked with the adenine nucleotide translocator ligand BA. This indicated that the loss of Δψm observed after DEM treatment was due to activation of the MPT (17.Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 45.Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Masse B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 46.Jiang D. Sullivan P.G. Sensi S.L. Steward O. Weiss J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7524-7529Google Scholar, 47.Chinopoulos C. Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27382-27389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This conclusion was confirmed using electron microscopy, since we observed that DEM treatment caused mitochondrial swelling reminiscent of the MPT (48.von Ahsen O. Renken C. Perkins G. Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B, panel b), which was prevented by inhibition of cytochrome bc1 activity (Fig. 2B, panel c). We next determined whether pretreatment with the ubiquinone analogs, dUb and Ub0, would prevent the activation of the MPT by cytochrome bc1 in redox modulated HL60 cells, because these ubiquinone analogs have previously been shown to block the MPT in isolated mitochondria (49.Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We found that dUb inhibited both the DCF fluorescence increase resulting from H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3A) and the DCF fluorescence increase resulting after GSH depletion using DEM (mitochondrially generated ROS) (Fig. 3B), whereas Ub0 did not. Thus, cellular pretreatment with dUb was shown to be effective in decreasing ROS levels after treatment with both exogenous oxidants as well as endogenous ROS generated by the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This suggested that dUb, but not Ub0, by blocking ROS production, would also prevent the redox-dependent MPT. We found that dUb was effective in preventing the loss of Δψm induced by DEM treatment, whereas Ub0 was not (Fig. 3C). These results are supported by a study reported by Walter et al. (49.Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) who also found that dUb was effective at preventing the MPT in isolated mitochondria; however, these investigators also found that Ub0 was effective at blocking the MPT (49.Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In our studies, we found that Ub0 was cytotoxic to HL60 (B) cells after either extended treatment (∼ 24 h) or when used at high concentrations (data not shown), which may be due to predominant partitioning of Ub0 in aqueous cell compartments where it can redox cycle. In this respect, Ub0 has been previously shown to mediate similar toxicity to menadione, a known redox cycling agent, in filarial parasites by interrupting mitochondrial electron transfer, ATP synthesis, and oxygen consumption (34.Santhamma K.R. Raj R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Since the MPT is generally regarded as a phenomenon preceding and culminating in cell death, if Ub0 blocked the MPT in vivo, it would not be expected to be cytotoxic per se, which it is in our experimental setting. Next we considered the mechanism of inhibition of MPT by dUb. Since dUb was effective at blocking mitochondrial ROS production which preceded MPT activation, we reasoned that the mechanism either involved inhibition of cytochrome bc1, which would concomitantly decrease ROS production (Fig. 1B) or that dUb was inhibiting or scavenging ROS produced by cytochrome bc1. If dUb blocked complex III activity, then it would be of little value as a candidate antioxidant compound in the biological setting, since inhibition of cytochrome bc1 activity blocks redox-energy conservation and the production of ATP. Our results (Fig. 3F) show that dUb does not inhibit complex III activity, even at high concentrations, leading us to conclude that its inhibitory effect on the MPT is a consequence of its antioxidant action, either preventing ROS formation or scavenging ROS generated by cytochrome bc1. It is known that by manipulating ubiquinone hydrophobicity, it is possible to produce analogs that partition to various cell compartments (32.Geromel V. Darin N. Chretien D. Benit P. DeLonlay P. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which, in part, determines their efficiency as antioxidants in vivo (32.Geromel V. Darin N. Chretien D. Benit P. DeLonlay P. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Since the major structural difference between dUb and Ub0 is the 10 carbon side chain, this indicates that both the presence of the hydrocarbon side chain, and its length, are critically important factors in conferring antioxidant or pro-oxidant properties to the ubiquinone analog. Because dUb is structurally quite similar to idebenone, it is possible that it functions in a similar manner. In this respect, it may localize at the surface of the mitochondrial membrane (32.Geromel V. Darin N. Chretien D. Benit P. DeLonlay P. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) where it intercepts and scavenges superoxide radicals generated by ubisemiquinone autoxidation within cytochrome bc1. In conclusion, the compound dUb provides a structural platform for the design and development of ubiquinone analogs that may be used as potential therapeutic antioxidants in age-related diseases where there is oxidative stress component. It also highlights the importance of the hydrophobic side chain during the drug design process. We acknowledge Professor Barry Halliwell for his critical review of this manuscript."

Here, we characterize Drosophila pod-1 (dpod1) and show that purified Dpod1 can crosslink both actin and MTs. In cultured S2 cells, Dpod1 colocalizes with lamellar actin and MTs, and overexpression remodels the cytoskeleton to promote dynamic neurite-like actin-dependent projections. Consistent with these observations, Dpod1 localizes to the tips of growing axons, regions where actin and MTs interact, and is especially abundant at navigational choice points. In either the absence or overabundance of Dpod1, growth cone targeting but not outgrowth is disrupted. Taken together, these results reveal novel activities for pod-1 and show that proper levels of Dpod1, an actin/MT crosslinker, must be maintained in the growth cone for correct axon guidance."

Escherichia coli CutA1 is involved in copper tolerance, whereas mammalian proteins are implicated in the anchoring of acetylcholinesterase in neuronal cell membranes. The x-ray structures of CutA1 from E. coli and rat were determined. Both proteins are trimeric in the crystals and in solution through an inter-subunit β-sheet formation. Each subunit consists of a ferredoxin-like (β1α1β2β3α2β4) fold with an additional strand (β5), a C-terminal helix (α3), and an unusual extended β-hairpin involving strands β2 and β3. The bacterial CutA1 is able to bind copper(II) in vitro through His2Cys coordination in a type II water-accessible site, whereas the rat protein precipitates in the presence of copper(II). The evolutionarily conserved trimeric assembly of CutA1 is reminiscent of the architecture of PII signal transduction proteins. This similarity suggests an intriguing role of CutA1 proteins in signal transduction through allosteric communications between subunits.

The evolutionarily conserved trimeric assembly of CutA1 is reminiscent of the architecture of PII signal transduction proteins. This similarity suggests an intriguing role of CutA1 proteins in signal transduction through allosteric communications between subunits. CutA1 is a widespread protein of about 12 kDa found in bacteria, plants, and animals, including humans. The protein was originally identified in a gene locus of Escherichia coli called cutA involved in divalent metal tolerance (1Fong S.T. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cutA locus consists of two operons, one containing a single gene encoding a cytoplasmic protein, CutA1, and the other composed of two genes encoding a 50-kDa (CutA2) and a 24-kDa (CutA3) inner membrane proteins. Molecular genetics studies on the E. coli cutA locus showed that some mutations lead to copper sensitivity due to its increased uptake (1Fong S.T. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the specific function of CutA1 in E. coli is still unknown. On the other hand recent studies from two independent groups highlighted a possible role of mammalian CutA1 in the anchoring of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 1The abbreviations used are: AChE, acetylcholinesterase; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy.1The abbreviations used are: AChE, acetylcholinesterase; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy. in neuronal cell membranes (2Perrier A.L.

In addition CutA1 copurified with AChE from human caudate nucleus (3Navaratnam D.S. Fernando F.S. Priddle J.D. Giles K. Clegg S.M. Pappin D.J. Craig I. Smith A.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2146-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CutA1, thus, might provide an intriguing link between copper tolerance in bacteria and a complex process in the brain of the most evolved organisms. The function of CutA1 in plants is still unknown. Copper is a transition metal essential to all organisms since it is involved in many redox reactions and in several biological processes (4Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). Although essential for cellular metabolism, copper is highly toxic when it exceeds cellular needs and accumulates in the cell. Proteins which bind copper are involved in several human neurological pathologies, such as the Menkes and Wilson diseases, the Alzheimer pathology, and the Creutzfeld-Jacob syndrome (5Bush A.I. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). For this reason, all organisms must have homeostatic mechanisms that allow the intake of the necessary amount of copper, thus preventing its accumulation beyond the level of toxicity (6Rosenzweig A.C. O'Halloran T.V. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Pena M.M.O. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar); these mechanisms are carried out by proteins that specifically bind copper in the cell. Intriguingly, although CutA1 from several organisms was annotated as a “divalent cation tolerant protein” in GenBank™, it was also suggested to be possibly involved in at least two unrelated processes in bacteria and mammals, thus fulfilling different functions (1Fong S.T. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Perrier A.L. Cousin X. Boschetti N. Haas R. Chatel J.M. Bon S. Roberts W.L. Pickett S.R.

In an attempt to understand this peculiar behavior and unravel its function, we have determined the crystal structure of one representative protein from bacteria (E. coli CutA1) and one from mammals (Rat CutA1) and characterized their copper binding properties. The structural arrangement of CutA1 from both organisms shows a striking similarity to the trimeric assembly of signal transduction proteins, called PII (8Cheah E. Carr P.D. Suffolk P.M. Vasudevan S.G. Dixon N.E. Ollis D.L. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which are involved in the nitrogen regulatory response in bacterial cells and eukaryotic chloroplasts (9Ninfa A.J.

Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition, the E. coli protein is able to bind a Cu(II) ion in a site structurally equivalent to the ATP binding site in PII proteins (11Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 2028-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The conserved quaternary structure between bacterial and mammalian CutA1 proteins represents an important breakthrough for the comprehension of their function. Genome Analysis—CutA1 sequences were searched in GenBank™ (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez) using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Conservation was calculated from multiple alignment of CutA1 sequences using MULTALIN (pbil.ibcp.fr). STRING (www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/STRING) was used to identify possible functional associations between CutA1 and neighboring genes. Cloning, Expression and Purification of CutA1—Genomic DNA from E. coli (strain LE392) was extracted and purified using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). The plasmid encoding the CutA1 gene from Rattus norvegicus was a kind gift of Prof. Eric Krejci. E. coli strain DH5α was used as the cloning host, and the strain BL21(DE3) Gold was used for protein expression (Stratagene). The expression vector was constructed by amplifying the CutA1 gene from E. coli genomic DNA and from rat cDNA through PCR. The primers were designed to introduce NcoI and BamHI sites at either end of the gene to facilitate cloning into the expression vector pET16-b (Novagen). The correct DNA sequences of the obtained plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. For protein production E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold competent cells were transformed with the constructed plasmids and selected with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. E. coli cultures were grown aerobically in 2× yeast-tryptone (YT) medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin to mid-exponential phase and induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended, and disrupted through sonication (8 cycles, 30 s each). Both proteins were purified through anionic exchange chromatography using a DEAE-Sepharose CL6B (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and then eluted with two linear gradients (0-0.3 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8 (total volume 200 ml), and 0.3-1.0 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8 (total volume 900 ml)). Fractions containing the CutA1 proteins and detected through SDS-PAGE were pooled together and concentrated. Both the proteins were obtained in high yield (∼150 mg/liter of culture). Protein Characterization—Electrospray mass spectra were taken with an Applied Biosystems electrospray ionization-time of flight Mariner mass spectrometer. The actual molecular mass was determined by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. To obtain a calibration line mixtures of various size standards were loaded. Transferrin was used in each mixture to determine the void volume. 1H,15N and 1H,13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR experiments were recorded on a 13C,15N-enriched apoCutA1 sample on Ultra Shield 700 Bruker spectrometer using a triple resonance (TXI) 5-mm probe equipped with pulsed field gradients along the xyz axes. Binding of copper(II) to CutA1 was followed through electronic spectroscopy using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Copper content was evaluated through atomic absorption measurements with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2380 instrument. X-band EPR spectra were acquired with a magnetic field modulation frequency and amplitude of 100 kHz and 12.00 G, respectively, at 10 K on a BRUKER EMX (9.5 GHz) EPR spectrometer equipped with an ESR 900 helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Crystallization of CutA1 from E. coli and Rat—Crystals of CutA1 were grown in a few days using the vapor diffusion technique at 20 °C from about 12 mg/ml E. coli and 10 mg/ml rat CutA1 (∼1 mm protein solutions). For E. coli CutA1, the solution contained 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 2% PEG 400 (polyethylene glycol), and 3 mm 4-(hydroxymercuri)benzoic acid, and for rat CutA1, the solution contained 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 5 mm CuSO4, 20 mm CaCl2. The crystals of CutA1 both from E. coli and from rat were flash-frozen under a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K without the addition of cryoprotectants. Data Collection and Structure Determination—A 2.1-Å resolution MAD data set at the mercury edge was collected at 100 K on CutA1 from E. coli using synchrotron radiation (European Molecular Biology Laboratory PX beamline BW7B at the DORIS storage ring, DESY, Hamburg, Germany). Furthermore, a monochromatic data set at 0.93 Å was collected at the same beamline on a crystal that diffracted up to 1.7 Å resolution. A monochromatic data set at 0.93 Å was collected at 100 K on rat CutA1 using synchrotron radiation (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ID14-1 beamline, Grenoble, France). The crystals diffracted up to 2.1 Å resolution. All the data sets were processed using MOSFLM 6.2 (13Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.-C. Crystallographic Computing V.

The phasing on CutA1 from E. coli was performed with the program SOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The density modification and a partial chain tracing were performed with the program RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The subsequent exhaustive chain tracing was carried out on the high resolution monochromatic data set with the program ARP/WARP 6.0 (17Perrakis A. Morris R.J.H. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). The structure of rat CutA1 was solved using the molecular replacement method and the software MOLREP (14Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar, 18Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar); a monomer of CutA1 from E. coli was used as the model in the rotation and translation function. The rat CutA1 structure shows some degree of disorder in the loop encompassing residues 82-90. In subunit A the electron density for the side chains of residues Tyr-86 and Glu-87 is very weak, and His-84 appears to be present in at least two conformers. Similar disorder of this loop is present in subunits E and F, which prevents the building of side chains of Tyr-86 and Glu-87 in E and of Glu-87 in F. Both structures were then refined, and water molecules were added using REFMAC5 (14Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) was used for molecular rebuilding and visualization for both structures. The stereochemical quality was assessed using the program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The program DALI (23Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) was used to search the Protein Data Bank for proteins with a similar structure to CutA1. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) Data Collection and Analysis— XAS data were collected at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory bending magnet beam line D2 using a silicon (111) double monochromator for the measurement at the copper edge, with the DESY storage ring operating under normal conditions (4.5 GeV, 90-140 mA). The XAS data were recorded by measuring the Cu-Kα fluorescence using a Canberra 13-element solid-state detector over the energy range from 8735 to 9875 eV using variable energy step widths. In the x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) regions steps of 0.3 and 0.5-1.2 eV were used, respectively. 10 scans were recorded for a total of more than 1.0/0.6 million counts per experimental point and then averaged. The full, k3 weighted, EXAFS spectrum (17-750 eV above E 0 and its Fourier transform calculated over the range 3.0-14.0 Å-1 were compared with theoretical simulations obtained using the set of programs EXCURVE9.20 (24Binsted N. Hasnain S.S. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1996; 3: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The quality of the fit was assessed by the fit function through the parameter ϵ2 (25Lytle F.W. Sayers D.E. Stern E.A. Phys. Rev. B. 1989; 11: 2795-2801Google Scholar) and by the R-factor as defined within EXCURVE9.20 (24Binsted N. Hasnain S.S. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1996; 3: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Ortholog and Paralog Analysis of CutA1 Sequences—In E. coli CutA1 is encoded by one of the three genes of the cutA locus, which is involved in tolerance to Cu2+ and other heavy metal ions (1Fong S.T. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A search of gene data banks located numerous sequences similar to CutA1 from E. coli in a large variety of organisms (36 bacteria, 13 Archaea, and 9 eukaryotes). They are reported in Supplemental Fig. 1. The second gene of the cutA locus encodes the transmembrane electron transporter CutA2. A gene homologous to CutA2 is found adjacent to CutA1 in a group of bacterial species (Yersinia pestis, Salmonella typhimurium, Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris, Xanthomonas axonopodis, Xylella fastidiosa). For some of them (Y. pestis and S. typhimurium) the CutA1 sequence is highly similar to the E. coli protein (>60% identity). Moreover, in the same group of organisms a third gene, called CutA3 and belonging to the cutA locus, is found next to CutA2. In E. coli, CutA1 and CutA2 are in different operons but implicated together in divalent cation tolerance (1Fong S.T. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The function of CutA3 is not known, but a search of similar sequences suggests it is a putative transcriptional regulator. CutA1 also exists in all the eukaryotic genomes sequenced up to now, except yeast, with all the sequences sharing a high degree of identity except in the N-terminal part. In CutA1 of mammals the N-terminal sequence is hydrophobic and might represent either a cleavable secretion signal, a mitochondrial import signal, or a transmembrane anchor (2Perrier A.L. Cousin X. Boschetti N. Haas R. Chatel J.M. Bon S. Roberts W.L. Pickett S.R. Massoulie J. Rosenberry T.L. Krejci E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34260-34265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The bacterial protein is devoid of this hydrophobic domain, and CutA1 is cytoplasmic in E. coli. The rat sequence contains an additional Pro-rich stretch of 12 residues (to which we assign negative residue numbers) at the N terminus, and 6 more residues at the C terminus. Excluding the N-terminal sequence, CutA1 from E. coli and rat have 35% residue identity, which increases to 55% when conservative substitutions are considered. Interestingly, in rat and mouse two further genes are present whose sequences are very similar (80% residue identity). These proteins lack the highly conserved Cys-39, which is replaced by a Ser, and share only 40% residue identity with their paralog sequences containing Cys-39. Protein Characterization—The expressed CutA1 proteins from both organisms turned out soluble and stable for concentrations up to 3 mm in various buffers. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm was determined on the basis of the amino acidic compositions of the proteins and was 17,900 cm-1m-1 for E. coli and 16,500 cm-1m-1 for rat CutA1. The molecular weight, as measured from electrospray mass spectra in denaturing conditions, was 11,841 ± 1 Da for E. coli CutA1, corresponding to residues 5-112, and 13,893 ± 1 Da for rat CutA1, corresponding to residues -12 to 118. On the other hand gel filtration chromatography at neutral pH gives an apparent molecular mass of 35,300 ± 400 Da for E. coli CutA1, which indicates that the protein is in a trimeric state (Fig. 1). The foldedness and the aggregation state were assessed through 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR spectra, which showed well dispersed signals in both dimensions, indicative of a well folded protein (Supplemental Fig. 2). Furthermore, a signal line width analysis carried out on the 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum of CutA1 indicates that line widths are essentially the same for all the signals, with an average value of 32 ± 3Hz, which is comparable with a value of 30 ± 4Hz found for dimeric human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (153 amino acids, ∼32 kDa) and different, outside the experimental error, from that of monomeric superoxide dismutase (∼16 kDa), which is found to be 17 ± 2 Hz. All these data are consistent beyond any uncertainty with a trimeric state of the protein in solution. Structure Analysis, a Trimeric Assembly of Ferredoxin-like Subunits—The structure of E. coli CutA1 consists of homotrimers displaying approximately a c3v symmetry. In the crystal asymmetric unit, two homotrimers are present that make extensive contacts leading to a dimer of trimers. One trimer is rotated by 60° with respect to the other one around the axis perpendicular to the trimer plane (Fig. 2A). The interface between the two trimers is about 3000 Å2, whereas the total interacting surface between each pair of monomers in the trimer is greater than 6000 Å2, giving some evidence that the interactions within the trimer are more specific than those between the two trimers. This is consistent with the observation that in solution the protein exists as a trimer (Fig. 2C). The overall structure of rat CutA1 clearly resembles that of CutA1 from E. coli; the space group is the same, and the asymmetric unit contains six subunits in both cases. However, in rat CutA1 the second trimer is rotated by 25° with respect to the first one around the ternary axis (Figs. 2, B and D). The a axis of the cell is about 15 Å larger in the case of rat CutA1, consistent with the rat protein construct having 18 residues more than the E. coli protein. However, the longer N terminus in the rat protein cannot be resolved as the interpretable electron density of rat CutA1 crystals starts at residue Gly-3, whereas for E. coli CutA1 starts at residue Ser-7. The r.m.s.d. of Cα atoms between E. coli and rat proteins as trimers is 0.95 Å, which confirms a high degree of homology between them, with the larger deviations located in the N- and C-terminal regions. The following analysis applies to both E. coli and rat CutA1. Each monomer exhibits the same overall structure, adopting a ferredoxin-like fold made of an α-β sandwich with antiparallel β-sheet (SCOP classification) (26Lo Conte L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J. Brenner S.E. Murzin A.G. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and containing an additional short strand (β5) and a C-terminal helix (α3). In the β-sheet, alternate strands are connected by helices with positive crossovers, resulting in a double βαβ motif where the antiparallel β-sheet packs against antiparallel α-helices. The C-terminal helix packs orthogonal to the N terminus. The β-strands 2 and 3 are connected by an extended β-hairpin (residues Gly-45-Glu-61 in E. coli and Ile-46-Glu-60 in rat CutA1) with a Gly at the apex (Gly-54 in E. coli and in rat CutA1). The β-hairpin includes a number of residues conserved among all the species (Ser-48, Glu-61, and two aromatic residues, Tyr-50 and Trp-52; residue numbering refers to the E. coli CutA1 sequence). Mapping of residue conservation on the structure of the CutA1 monomer, shown in Fig. 3A, also highlights a loop region between α2 and β4, spatially close to the β-hairpin and encompassing conserved residues His-84, Tyr-86, and Glu-90. The other highly conserved amino acids are Ala-40 and Cys-39 on β2, Lys-67 on β3, and Trp-106 on α3. These four residues are clustered at the other end of the scaffold. Least squares superposition of the three E. coli CutA1 monomers shows that there are small but significant differences among them, mainly located in the β-hairpin loop (r.m.s.d. of all Cα atoms 0.43-0.56 Å, compared with an estimated error on the coordinates of 0.11 Å). The same occurs for the rat CutA1 monomers (r.m.s.d. of all Cα atoms is 0.32-0.77 Å compared with an estimated error of 0.16 Å). The formation of inter-subunit β-sheets is the primary force driving trimer assembly. Hydrogen-bond pairing occurs between the N-terminal half of strand β2 from one subunit and the C-terminal half of strand β2 from another subunit and between strand β4 from one subunit and the short strand β5 from another subunit. These interactions result in three six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets in the trimer. The β-sheets pack around the 3-fold axis and form 3 concave surfaces (see Fig. 3B). The β-hairpin (β2-Loop3-β3) acts as a recognition/oligomerization site because it protrudes from the body of the structure, thus favoring inter-subunit hydrogen bond formation. In addition to the inter-subunit β-sheets, some conserved contacts between two CutA1 subunits (e.g. a salt bridge between Lys-67 and Glu-90) stabilize the trimer. The three monomers assemble such that the two highly conserved regions in the monomers are brought together, thus forming three potential functional sites per trimer (Fig. 3, B and C). A similar trimeric organization is observed in the crystal structure of copper(II)-nitrosocyanin, a trimer of single domain cupredoxins, where each copper center was partially covered by an unusual extended β-hairpin structure from an adjacent monomer (27Lieberman R.L. Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5674-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potential surface of the E. coli CutA1 monomer is shown in Fig. 4A, top panel. One face of the protein is largely neutral, whereas the other contains several charged residues producing regions either with negative or positive electrostatic potential. In particular, four Glu residues, also present in the rat protein, produce a large negative potential on the β-hairpin. The rest of the surface shows some scattered negative and positive charges. The trimer-trimer interface is mainly non-polar and hydrophobic, whereas the opposite side of the trimers is negatively charged and exposed to the solvent (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). The clefts occurring at the trimer interface are lined with conserved acidic residues because they are partially formed by the negatively charged β-hairpins. Sideways, the trimer has a ridge of both positive and negative charges. In rat CutA1 monomers, the neutral region characterizing one face of the protein is somewhat reduced compared with E. coli CutA1. The other face shows a more marked separation between a negative and a positive half, with the latter more extended than in E. coli CutA1 (Fig. 4B, top panel). In the trimer of rat CutA1, the non-polar face has a negative cavity not present in the E. coli protein, whereas the other face is entirely charged (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). As found in E. coli CutA1, negative and positive regions from different subunits are in contact, thus stabilizing the trimer through electrostatic interactions throughout its perimeter. The properties of the electrostatic potential surface of CutA1 trimers suggest very different interaction mechanisms for the apolar face, which interact with the same face of a second trimer,"

Despite these peculiarities, T. brucei thioredoxin behaves like classical thioredoxins. It is reduced by thioredoxin reductases from different species, serves as donor of reducing equivalents for the ribonucleotide reductase of the parasite, and catalyzes the reduction of protein disulfides. The redox potential of —267 mV was obtained from protein-protein redox equilibration with Escherichia coli thioredoxin. The pK value of T. brucei thioredoxin was determined by two different methods. Carboxamidomethylation of the reduced protein yielded a pK value of 7.4 and generated mono-alkylated protein. The thiolate absorption at 240 nm resulted in a pK of 7.6 and, based on the extinction coefficient of 11.6 mm—1 cm—1, there are two (or three) cysteines titrating with very similar pK values. A thioredoxin reductase has not yet been detected in any organism of the order Kinetoplastida. T. brucei thioredoxin is spontaneously reduced by trypanothione (bis(glutathionyl)spermidine).

Trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, have a unique thiol metabolism in which the ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase couple is replaced by trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), and the flavoenzyme trypanothione reductase (1Fairlamb A.H.

It is a spontaneous reductant of dehydroascorbate as well as the disulfide forms of glutathione and ovothiol (2Krauth-Siegel R.L. Meiering S.K. Schmidt H. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple is the donor of reducing equivalents for the detoxication of hydroperoxides catalyzed by a cascade of proteins that are composed of trypanothione reductase, trypanothione, tryparedoxin, and a peroxiredoxin-type tryparedoxin peroxidase. Tryparedoxin is also involved in the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase (4Dormeyer M. Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol.

Cells from 1 liter of bacterial culture were suspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) containing 1 mm imidazol, 150 nm pepstatin, 4 nm cystatin, 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg of lysozyme, and 0.5 mg of DNase I. The suspension was gently stirred at room temperature for 30 min. 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.04% sodium deoxycholate were added and the cells were disintegrated by sonication. After centrifugation and re-extraction, 3 ml of Talon resin (Clontech) equilibrated in buffer A with 1 mm imidazol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% sodium deoxycholate were added to the supernatant. The suspension was gently stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The resin was transferred into a column and intensively washed with 100 ml of buffer A containing 1 mm imidazol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% sodium deoxycholate followed by 100 ml of buffer A with 5 mm imidazol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% sodium deoxycholate. After storing the column overnight at 4 °C and washing with 50 ml of 5 mm imidazol in buffer A, pure His-tagged T. brucei thioredoxin was eluted by 250 mm imidazol in buffer A. Reduction of Thioredoxin by Different Thioredoxin Reductases—The reaction mixtures contained in a total volume of 90 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 133 μm NADPH, 55 μm insulin, varying amounts of T. brucei thioredoxin and human, E. coli, and D. melanogaster thioredoxin reductase, respectively. In the case of the D. melanogaster enzyme, the assays were carried out at thioredoxin concentrations of 19–48 μm in the absence of insulin. The absorption decrease at 340 nm was followed at 25 °C and the kinetic constants were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Ribonucleotide Reductase Assay—The activity of T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase was determined from the rate of conversion of [3H]GDP into [3H]dGDP as described (4Dormeyer M. Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10602-10606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained in a total volume of 200 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 500 μm GDP (including 1.25 μCi of [3H]GDP), 100 μm dTTP, 100 mm KCl, and 6.4 mm MgCl2. As the electron donor served either a thioredoxin system composed of 220 μm NADPH, 57 nm human thioredoxin reductase, and 0.5 to 30 μmT. brucei thioredoxin or a trypanothione system consisting of 8 mm NADPH, 100 milliunits of trypanothione reductase, and 0.1 mm trypanothione disulfide and variable concentrations of T. brucei thioredoxin and tryparedoxin, respectively. The reaction was started by adding 2.2 μm R1 protein and about 6 μm R2. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 10 min. Products and educts were separated and quantified as described (16Krauth-Siegel R.L. Schmidt H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Insulin Reduction Assay—A fresh solution of 1 mg/ml insulin was prepared in 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. In a total volume of 800 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, the assay mixture contained 130 μm insulin, varying amounts of T. brucei thioredoxin, T. brucei tryparedoxin, or E. coli thioredoxin, and different reducing systems: (a) 535 μm dithioerythritol, (b) 813 μm NADPH, 150 milliunits of trypanothione reductase, 515 μm trypanothione disulfide, (c) 813 μm NADPH, 1.19 units of trypanothione reductase, 500 μm glutathionylspermidine disulfide, and (d) 150 μm NADH, 1.45 units of T. cruzi lipoamide dehydrogenase, 500 μm dihydrolipoamide. The reaction was started, in case of systems b and c after 15 min preincubation to reduce the disulfide, by adding thioredoxin (if any) and insulin. The increase in turbidity because of the formation of insoluble insulin B chain was followed at 650 nm and 30 °C. Km Value of T. brucei Thioredoxin for C. fasciculata Tryparedoxin Peroxidase—The reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 800 μl of 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 150 μm NADPH, 130 nm human thioredoxin reductase, 2 μmT. brucei thioredoxin, and 0.26–2.6 μmC. fasciculata tryparedoxin peroxidase. The assay mixtures were preincubated until a constant baseline was obtained and the reaction was started by adding 91 μmt-butyl hydroperoxide. The absorption decrease was followed at 340 nm and 25 °C. The apparent Km value was derived from a Lineweaver-Burk plot based on initial velocities. Reduction of Different Disulfides by T. brucei Thioredoxin—The rate constants for the reduction of different low molecular mass disulfides by T. brucei thioredoxin were measured by following two consecutive reactions in 90 μl of 200 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at 340 nm and 25 °C in a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. The first reaction contained 133 μm NADPH, 10–30 μm thioredoxin, and 100 nm human thioredoxin reductase. The Vmax value for thioredoxin reduction was calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation with a Km of 6 μm for Trx-S2 (8Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After reduction of thioredoxin had come to an end, 100 or 200 μm lipoamide, 66 or 111 μm trypanothione disulfide, and 66, 222, or 444 μm glutathione disulfide, respectively, were added. The decrease in absorption now represented reduction of the respective disulfide by Trx-(SH)2. The steady state concentration of Trx-S2 was calculated from the rate of NADPH consumption (ν) and the Vmax of the first reaction according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Trx-(SH)2 concentration in the second reaction corresponds to the difference between the total concentration of thioredoxin and the Trx-S2 concentration. Western Blot Analysis—Procyclic T. brucei (cell line 449) were grown as described (8Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested at a density of 3.5 × 106 cells/ml and directly lysed in sample buffer containing tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Bond-Breaker, Pierce). Protein samples were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by wet blotting (Bio-Rad) and probed with 1:1000 diluted polyclonal rabbit antibodies against recombinant T. brucei thioredoxin (Eurogentec). The secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, Santa Cruz) was diluted 1:20000. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). Construction of a C68S Mutant of T. brucei Thioredoxin—Two overlapping PCR products both containing the C68S mutation were synthesized. The first fragment was amplified using the TrxHis forward (5′-TCGGTAGTGGATGTTTATAGCG-3′) and the Trx S/C reverse (5′-TAACACCCTGGACTTGGACACTATTTCAG-3′) primers and the second one with the Trx S/C forward (5′-CCAAGTCCAGGGTGTTACAGCTGCCTACC-3′, a PvuII-cleavage site is underlined) and the vector pQE30 reverse (5′-GCTTGGCTGCAGGTCGACCC-3′, a PstI-cleavage site is underlined) primer. Codons representing the mutation are given in bold letters. The bold italic codon marks an altered Lys codon to introduce a PvuII restriction site. PCR was carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase (95 °C, 2 min; 31 times (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 3 min); 72 °C, 3 min) using the pQE 32/trx plasmid as template (8Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The two purified fragments were used as templates in the third PCR, amplifying the complete trx gene with the TrxHis forward and pQE30 reverse primer. The PCR product was purified and cloned into the SmaI and PstI sites of the pQE32 vector (Qiagen) and completely sequenced in both directions. The mutant gene was expressed in E. coli SG13009 cells and the protein (Trx C68S) was purified as described above for wild type thioredoxin. Chemical Reduction of Thioredoxin—400–800 μmT. brucei and E. coli thioredoxin, respectively, in 300 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazol, pH 8.0, was incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of DTT for 1 h at room temperature. The reduced protein was desalted on a 15-ml Sephadex G-25 (fine) column equilibrated in the respective buffer. Measurement of the Thiolate Anion by UV Absorption—The pH-dependent cysteine ionization was followed by the absorption of the thiolate anion at 240 nm (19Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Spectra of 10–18 μm oxidized and reduced Trx and the oxidized C68S mutant were recorded between 200 and 400 nm at 25 °C in 1.3 ml of 1 mm citrate, 1 mm borate, and 1 mm phosphate, 0.2 m KCl, pH 5.1, purged with argon. The pH value was adjusted by adding defined volumes of 0.2 or 0.1 m KOH from pH 5.1 to 10.5. The spectra were measured against air in a stoppered quartz cuvette in a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. The buffer spectrum recorded in the same cuvette was subtracted from the spectrum of the respective protein solution. The absorbance was converted into molar extinction coefficients and corrected for the dilution because of the pH adjustment. The protein concentration was derived from the absorbance at 280 nm. An A280 = 1 corresponds to 1 mg/ml pure T. brucei thioredoxin. pH Dependent Carboxamidomethylation—50 μm Reduced thioredoxin and 50 μm iodoacetamide were incubated in 10 mm each of acetate, MES, MOPS, Tris, and 0.2 m KCl between pH 5 and 9.7 at 25 °C in a total volume of 150 μl. The reaction was stopped at different time points by mixing a 10-μl sample and 10 μl of 500 mm DTT. Reduced and carboxamidomethylated thioredoxin were separated by HPLC on a C8-VYDAC column (2.1 mm × 25 cm, 208TP52) with a C8 pre-column (VYDAC, 208GK52) equilibrated in 38.5% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 5-μl samples were injected. After 15 min of isocratic washing, the proteins were eluted by a 30-min gradient from 38.5 to 49% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and 25 °C. The proteins were detected at 214 nm. Determination of the Redox Potential—The redox potential of T. brucei thioredoxin was determined by direct protein-protein redox equilibration (20Åslund F.

Different concentrations of reduced and oxidized T. brucei and E. coli thioredoxin in 100 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, were allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C in closed 1.5-ml reaction vessels purged with argon. After different times, 5-μl samples were immediately analyzed by HPLC as described above. The column was run for 15 min in 39.2% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid followed by a 35-min gradient from 39.2 to 52.5% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and 25 °C. The proteins were monitored at 214 nm. The redox equilibrium was reached after 2 h and was stable for at least 9 h. T. brucei Thioredoxin Is Reduced by Different Thioredoxin Reductases—Because a specific thioredoxin reductase has not yet been detected in any kinetoplastid parasite, we studied thioredoxin reductases from different organisms for their ability to reduce T. brucei thioredoxin. To maintain a constant concentration of oxidized thioredoxin during the reaction, assays at low substrate concentrations contained an excess of insulin. As shown previously, T. brucei thioredoxin is readily reduced by human thioredoxin reductase (8Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The E. coli enzyme accepts T. brucei thioredoxin with a Km value 8-fold higher than that for wild type E. coli thioredoxin 1 (1.84 μm) and comparable with that for a mutant where Asp-26 had been replaced by an alanine residue (9Gleason F.K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The kcat value with the parasite thioredoxin is about 40-fold lower resulting in a 300-fold lower kcat/Km value when compared with the homologous bacterial system (Table I) (22Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This reflects the fact that, in contrast to the mammalian enzymes with very broad substrate specificity, bacterial thioredoxin reductases are much more specific for their disulfide substrate. T. brucei thioredoxin is also reduced by thioredoxin reductase from D. melanogaster with a kcat/Km value 200-fold lower than that reported for the authentic substrate/enzyme couple (23Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Türbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Taken together, thioredoxin reductases from different organisms accept T. brucei thioredoxin as substrate although with relatively low efficiency.Table IKinetic parameters for the reduction of T. brucei thioredoxin by different thioredoxin reductasesThioredoxin reductase speciesKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmμmunits/mgs-1m-1 s-1HumanaFrom Ref. 8.6NDbND, not determined.NDNDE. coli130.450.272.1 × 104D. melanogaster510.820.751.5 × 104a From Ref. 8Reckenfelderbäumer N.

Open table in a new tab T. brucei Thioredoxin as Electron Donor for Ribonucleotide Reductase—Ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the conversion of all four ribonucleoside diphosphates into the respective deoxyribonucleotides essential for DNA synthesis. Well known physiological electron donors in the reaction are the nearly ubiquitous dithiol proteins thioredoxin and glutaredoxin (24Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In T. brucei, the trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple acts as an efficient thiol system for the parasite ribonucleotide reductase (4Dormeyer M. Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10602-10606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). T. brucei thioredoxin in concert with NADPH and human thioredoxin reductase is also able to deliver electrons to the enzyme. The apparent Km value of T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase for T. brucei thioredoxin derived from a Lineweaver-Burk plot was 29 ± 7 μm (data not shown). The value is about an order of magnitude higher than that for T. brucei tryparedoxin (3.7 μm (4Dormeyer M. Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10602-10606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) and 20-fold higher than the Km value of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase for E. coli thioredoxin (1.25 (25Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 2.0 μm (9Gleason F.K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, with the D26A mutant of E. coli thioredoxin the bacterial enzyme also yields a more than 10-fold increased Km value of 33 μm (9Gleason F.K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown previously, T. brucei thioredoxin is not a substrate of trypanothione reductase (8Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore we studied if thioredoxin is spontaneously reduced by trypanothione using the ribonucleotide reductase reaction as the first assay system. The reaction mixtures contained 100 μm trypanothione and varying concentrations of T. brucei thioredoxin and tryparedoxin, respectively. Addition of thioredoxin caused only a very slight increase in ribonucleotide reductase activity (Fig. 1) that may be because of the relatively low trypanothione concentration in the assay. Higher trypanothione concentrations could not be used because of the pronounced spontaneous reduction of ribonucleotide reductase by the dithiol (4Dormeyer M. Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10602-10606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As expected, tryparedoxin strongly increased the trypanothione-dependent activity of ribonucleotide reductase under these conditions. Reduction of T. brucei Thioredoxin by Trypanothione and Other Non-protein Thiols—Thioredoxins catalyze the reduction of protein disulfides such as those of insulin (8Reckenfelderbäumer N.

Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction is followed by an increase in turbidity because of the precipitation of the insoluble B chain. Here we used the insulin assay to study different non-protein thiols for their ability to reduce T. brucei thioredoxin. Addition of E. coli thioredoxin as well as the parasite thioredoxin and tryparedoxin to a reaction mixture containing insulin and 515 μm trypanothione, strongly enhanced turbidity formation (Fig. 2). All three proteins are spontaneously reduced by T(SH)2 and then function as protein-disulfide reductases. Corresponding assays in the presence of 500 μm dihydrolipoamide and glutathionylspermidine, respectively, revealed that dihydrolipoamide but not the monothiol glutathionylspermidine also serves as an efficient electron donor for T. brucei thioredoxin (not shown). Thus, T. brucei thioredoxin is readily reduced by non-protein dithiols such as trypanothione. The marginal cellular concentration of free lipoate should rule it out as physiological reductant (27Jackman S.A. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Stevenson K.J. Biochem. Soc.

Mnk1/2 also bind to the scaffold protein eIF4G. The N-terminal region of Mnk1 has previously been shown to bind to importin α, a component of the nuclear transport machinery, although Mnk1 itself is cytoplasmic. Here we identify a CRM1-type nuclear export motif in the C-terminal part of Mnk1. Substitution of hydrophobic residues in this motif results in Mnk1 becoming nuclear. This has allowed us to study the features of Mnk1 that are involved in its transport to the nucleus. This process requires part, but not all, of a polybasic region near the N terminus of Mnk1. Residues required for nuclear transport are also required for its interaction with importin α. This polybasic region also serves a second function in that it is required for the binding of Mnk1 to eIF4G, although the residues involved in this interaction are not identical to those involved in the binding of Mnk1 to importin α. Interaction of Mnk1 with eIF4G promotes the phosphorylation of eIF4E. Mutations that reduce the binding of Mnk1 to eIF4G in vivo and in vitro also decrease the ability of Mnk1 to enhance eIF4E phosphorylation in vivo, underlining the importance of the eIF4G-Mnk1 interaction in this process.

Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this factor can lead to transformation of cells (2Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 3De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and elevated levels of eIF4E correlate with the malignancy of human cancers (4De Benedetti A. Harris A.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), implying that eIF4E plays a key role in cellular regulation. Not surprisingly, the activity of eIF4E is regulated by several mechanisms.One major regulatory mechanism is through the binding of 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) to eIF4E (5Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 6Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The binding of 4E-BP1, the best studied of the 4E-BPs, is controlled by a complex mechanism involving phosphorylation at multiple sites, in which phosphorylation on some residues is dependent on the prior phosphorylation of other residues. The 4E-BPs bind to the so-called dorsal site of eIF4E. After phosphorylation and release of the 4E-BPs, eIF4G can bind to this site in eIF4E, resulting in the formation of the eIF4F complex (consisting of eIF4E, eIF4G, and the RNA helicase eIF4A). Subsequent binding of several other components of the translational machinery, e.g. eIF4B, eIF3, and the initiator-tRNA carrying 40 S ribosomal subunit leads to formation of active initiation complexes (7Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). Binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E therefore blocks the engagement of eIF4E with eIF4G and the formation of initiation factor complexes.A second mechanism for regulating eIF4E function is through its phosphorylation at Ser-209. Recent work has indicated that this modification reduces the affinity of eIF4E for capped RNA (8Scheper G.C. van Kollenburg B. Hu J. Luo Y. Goss D.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Zuberek J. Wyslouch-Cieczyska A. Niedzwiecka A. Dadlez M. Stepinski J. Augustyniak W. Gingras A.-C. Zhang Z. Burley S.K. Sonenberg N. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Within the eIF4F complex, eIF4E can be phosphorylated by the MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnks) Mnk1 or Mnk2 (10Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N.

These kinases are under the control of the classic MAPK and the stress-activated p38 MAPK α/β pathways. The Mnks bind to the C terminus of eIF4G (10Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), which is thought to ensure that phosphorylation of eIF4E only occurs within initiation complexes. Binding of Mnk1 to eIF4G involves a sequence near the N terminus of Mnk1 (11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), although this has not been defined further. Replacement of the wild type eIF4E with a non-phosphorylatable form has been shown to reduce cell size in Drosophila, and to result in smaller flies, indicating that phosphorylation of eIF4E plays an important role in cell growth (15Lachance P.E.D. Miron M. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Several groups have reported that eIF4E is found in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm (reviewed in Ref. 16Strudwick S. Borden K.L.B. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Its exact role within this compartment is not clear, but it seems to play a role in the transport of certain mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The best described example is the mRNA encoding cyclin D1 (17Rousseau D. Kaspar R. Rosenwald I. Gehrke L. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Overexpression of eIF4E results in increased levels of cytoplasmic cyclin D1 mRNA levels and consequently higher protein levels. This is thought to be one of the main causes for transformation of cells that overexpress eIF4E. The effects of eIF4E on cyclin D1 mRNA transport can be counteracted by overexpression of the promyelocytic leukemia protein, which reduces the affinity of eIF4E for cap structures (18Cohen N. Sharma M. Kentsis A. Perez J.M. Strudwick S. Borden K.L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4547-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This may play a role on the transformation-repressing functions of promyelocytic leukemia protein.The intracellular localization of Mnk1 has been shown to be sensitive to leptomycin B, a compound that blocks CRM1-mediated nuclear export (19McKendrick L. Thompson E. Ferreira J. Morley S.J. Lewis J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3632-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings imply that Mnk1 can enter the nucleus, and thus that it possesses motifs for nuclear localization (import). This notion is consistent with the finding that Mnk1 binds to importin α in a yeast two-hybrid assay. This interaction, like its binding to eIF4G, appeared to involve the N-terminal region of Mnk1 (11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Here we have defined, in detail, the regions of Mnk1 that are required for the nuclear import of Mnk1, its interaction with importin α, and for its binding to eIF4G. We show that these sequences partially overlap, although eIF4G and importin α do not appear to compete with one another for binding to Mnk1. Furthermore, we have identified a canonical leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in the C-terminal end of Mnk1. Mnk1 appears to shuttle actively between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—pCS3MT-Mnk1 has been described previously (20Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). pEGFP-Mnk1 was made by cloning an HindIII-BamHI-digested PCR product, encoding the full-length Mnk1 into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Mutations in both pCS3MT-Mnk1 and pEGFP-Mnk1 that change residues Lys-14, Arg-15, Ser-380, Ser-383 to alanine, Leu-378 to serine, and triple mutations of KRR (residues 14–16) and KKR (residues 18–20) to alanyl residues were created using the QuikChange® kit from Stratagene. The K18A and K19A mutations were introduced as PCR-generated HindIII-XmaI-digested fragments. PCR reactions were carried out using the high fidelity Expand HiFi® kit from Roche Applied Science. DNA sequencing was performed by the Sequencing Service (School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland (available at www.dnaseq.co.uk)) using a DYEnamic ET terminator chemistry (Amersham Biosciences) on Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencers.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation of the DNA in BES-buffered saline as described earlier (21Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For most purposes, 10 μg of DNA were used per 10-cm dish; however, for experiments where the phosphorylation of eIF4E was studied, it was important to achieve lower levels of expression of Mnk1, and 1.5 μg of Mnk1 vector plus 8.5 μg of carrier DNA (empty vector) was used.Harvesting of Cells—After treatments, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and either harvested in 400 μl of harvesting buffer A (20 m1m HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) or (for studies on binding to eIF4G) in buffer B (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 1 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes.Isoelectric Focusing—Endogenous eIF4E was purified from 200 μg of cell lysate protein by m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography, resolved by isoelectric focusing, and detected by Western blotting as described previously (22Kleijn M. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitations using anti-myc, 2 μl of antibody (9E10 from Sigma, catalog number M5546) was added to cell extracts (200 μg of protein) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl of packed beads per immunoprecipitation) of the appropriate harvesting buffer were added and allowed to bind the antibody for an additional hour at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of buffer and finally resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using appropriate antisera.Fluorescence Microscopy—HEK293 cells were grown on coverslips, transfected, and grown for an additional 24 h. Coverslips were then washed with DAPI/fixation solution (0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.9, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA in 90% methanol) and then incubated in the same solution for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by a wash step with methanol. Coverslips were then mounted onto microscope slides with Citi-Fluor (Agar) and sealed with nail polish. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 2000M fluorescence microscope.Assays for Binding of Mnk1 to Importin α or eIF4G—Hexahistidine-tagged importin α (His-importin α; encoded by the vector pQE70-importin α, a kind gift from Dr. D. Görlich, Heidelberg) was expressed in Escherichia coli Origami (DE3) pLacI (Novagen). Two hours after the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Melford Laboratories) cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol and sonicated (three times for 30 s at 60% of maximal output, Bandelin Sonoplus). After clearing the lysate by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 rpm, the recombinant protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and the eluted protein was then dialyzed against buffer comprising 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 250 mm sucrose.The hexahistidine-tagged C-terminal fragment of eIF4G (His-eIF4Gc) was expressed from the vector pET28–4Gc-term (23Li W. Belsham G.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29111-29115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Two hours after addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were sonicated in buffer comprising 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After clearing the lysate by centrifugation, the recombinant protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol.To study the binding of Mnk1 to importin α, 293 cells were transiently transfected plasmids encoding myc-tagged wild type or mutant Mnk. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and l mm PMSF. The lysates were then incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with His-importin α bound to Talon® beads (Clontech). After washing the beads thrice with the same buffer, the amount of bound myc-Mnk1 was determined by Western blotting with anti-myc.To study the binding of Mnk1 to eIF4G, 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding myc-tagged wild type or mutant Mnk. After transfection, the cells were lysed with buffer C (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and l mm PMSF), and lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15 min, 14,000 × g, 4 °C). Anti-myc immunoprecipitations were performed by adding 3 μl of α-myc to the extracts, and after rotation for 1 h at 4 °C, 15 μl (packed volume) of protein G-Sepharose was added to the mix and incubated for a further 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer C, resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-eIF4G or (as a loading control) anti-myc.To study the possible competition between eIF4G and His-importin α for binding to Mnk1, GST-Mnk1 (expressed in E. coli (12Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)) was immobilized at a final concentration of 4 μg/μl on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of 5% (w/v) BSA. The amount of His-importin α was fixed, and the amount of His-eIF4Gc was varied. The final concentration of NaCl in the buffer used in the assay was always adjusted to 50 mm.To assess whether eIF4Gc interacted directly with importin α, it was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein. The purified fusion protein was incubated with recombinant his-tagged importin α in the presence of 5% (w/v) BSA at 50 mm NaCl (as for the above experiments). A negative control was performed in which GST-eIF4Gc was omitted. The material bound to glutathione-Sepharose was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe C-terminal Part of Mnk1 Contains a Hydrophobic Nuclear Export Signal—Waskiewicz et al. (11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) have reported that Mnk1 interacts with eIF4G and importin α in a yeast two-hybrid system. The interaction with eIF4G or importin α was abrogated by deletion of the N-terminal 23 amino acids, and it was suggested that the stretch of basic residues in the N terminus of Mnk1 (KKRKKKRK, residues 14–21 in the mouse sequence) might be involved in these interactions, because nuclear localization signals (NLS) often contain multiple basic residues (24Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). However, the interaction with importin α was not investigated further in that study, because immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Mnk1 was localized in the cytoplasm, suggesting that Mnk1 might not actually be imported into the nucleus. However, McKendrick et al. (19McKendrick L. Thompson E. Ferreira J. Morley S.J. Lewis J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3632-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) subsequently showed that the localization of Mnk1 is sensitive to leptomycin B (LMB), such that treatment of cells with this compound resulted in an increased proportion of the Mnk1 being found in the nuclear compartment. This finding implies that Mnk1 may shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.We expressed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein of Mnk1 by transient expression in transfected HEK 293 cells. Our data confirm the results of McKendrick et al. (19McKendrick L. Thompson E. Ferreira J. Morley S.J. Lewis J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3632-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), i.e. that LMB treatment resulted in the accumulation of GFP-Mnk1 in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). To be sure that the cytoplasmic location seen in the absence of LMB is not due to the presence of the large GFP tag, the experiments were repeated with Mnk1 variants containing the much smaller myc tag. As shown in Fig. 1B, the myc-Mnk1 fusion protein is also primarily cytoplasmic in the absence of LMB and relocalizes completely to the nucleus when this compound is added. Thus, the sensitivity to LMB is likely an intrinsic property of Mnk1 itself rather than a feature conferred by the GFP tag. Indeed, other work has shown that the localization of GFP itself is not affected by LMB (25Alefantis T. Barmak K. Harhaj E. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21814-21822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The effects of LMB on the localization of Mnk1 suggest that its export from the nucleus is mediated via CRM1. The consensus sequence for CRM1-mediated nuclear export signals is ψX 3/4ψX 2ψXψ (where ψ represents a hydrophobic residue, and X is any amino acid). Inspection of the amino acid sequences of human or murine Mnk1 revealed a possible leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) is found in the C-terminal part of the protein (Fig. 1C). In murine Mnk1 the motif lies between residues 374 and 383 and has the sequence LAEGLCSMKL (where hydrophobic residues are shown in boldface).To test whether this motif is involved in the export of Mnk1 from the nucleus, we mutated Leu-378 and Leu-383 individually to non-hydrophobic residues, i.e. serine or alanine, respectively. As a negative control, we also mutated a residue within the region of the motif but which does not form part of the hydrophobic consensus (Ser-380, to Ala). The resulting S380A mutant of Mnk1 was found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, see insets for higher magnification images), as is the case for the wild type protein. In marked contrast, the variants L378S and L383A were both almost completely located in the nucleus, indicating that Leu-378 and Leu-383 play a key role in ensuring the cytoplasmic location of the wild type protein. This indicates that the series of hydrophobic residues highlighted in Fig. 1C is indeed likely to be a CRM1-binding nuclear export motif that mediates transfer of Mnk1 to the cytoplasm. Importantly, these data also strongly imply that Mnk1 does normally enter the nucleus (perhaps through its interaction with importin α), its overall cytoplasmic distribution being due to efficient re-export via CRM1, which is dependent upon the hydrophobic NES. Similar conclusions were recently drawn for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling for several other translation factors (26Bohnsack M.T. Regener K. Schwappach B. Saffrich R. Paraskeva E. Hartmann E. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6205-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Indeed, like Mnk1, a range of translation factors appears to be actively excluded from the nucleus.Nuclear Entry of Mnk1 Requires a Polybasic Region Near Its N Terminus—Because the above data indicated that Mnk1 can enter the nucleus, and given the indications that the stretch of basic residues near the N terminus allowed interaction with the importin α (11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), we next studied the role of this basic region in the nuclear import of Mnk1. To facilitate these studies, we made use of the L378S variant that, as described in Fig. 1, localizes to the nucleus due to inactivation of its NES. We anticipated that mutation of additional residues that are critical for nuclear import should result in the L378S variant becoming cytoplasmic. Alignment of the part of various Mnk sequences containing the basic stretch reveals several residues that are conserved among the Mnk1/2 proteins from mouse, human, and Xenopus (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2The basic region in the N terminus of Mnk1 functions as an NLS. A, alignment of the basic region and surrounding sequences of human, mouse, and Xenopus Mnks. B, amino acid sequences of the Mnk1 variants used here. Several alanine substitutions were introduced, as indicated, in the construct expressing GFP-Mnk1[L378S]. C, the second half of the basic region is required for nuclear import. HEK293 cells were transfected with indicated constructs and after 24 h were fixed with cold methanol. Localization of the expressed proteins was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. D, single point mutations do not inhibit nuclear import. Experiments as described under C were performed with the indicated single alanine substitution variants. Similar data were obtained in at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Initially, we made two triple mutations in Mnk1 in which, respectively, the basic residues at positions 14–16 (KRR) or 18–20 (KKR) were changed to alanine (KRR/AAA and KKR/AAA variants, respectively; Fig. 2B). The resulting mutated proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with GFP in HEK293 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the KRR/AAA variant of GFP-Mnk1[L378S] still localized to the nucleus. In contrast, the triple Ala mutation in the second part of the basic stretch completely abolished nuclear fluorescence (variant KKR/AAA; Fig. 2C). Apparently, the second part of this region is essential for nuclear import, whereas the first half of the basic region is dispensable for this process.To pinpoint which residues within this polybasic region are critical for NLS function, a set of single residue substitutions was created. The basic residues at positions 14, 15, 18, or 19 were individually replaced by alanines, and the effects of these changes on the localization of GFP-Mnk1[L378S] were studied. As shown in Fig. 2D, the behavior of the K14A and R15A variants was indistinguishable from that of GFP-Mnk1[L378S] itself: both were found almost entirely within the nucleus. This corroborates the above data, which showed that the first part of the polybasic region (in which these residues are situated) is dispensable for nuclear import of Mnk1. The K18A variant also showed a similar localization to the GFP-Mnk1[L378S] fusion, i.e. it was nuclear. A high proportion of the K19A variant was also found in the nucleus, but substantially more of this variant was found in the cytoplasm than was the case for the other three mutants. These findings suggest that the most C-terminal part of the polybasic region is important for nuclear import, consistent with the findings for the triple mutants studied in Fig. 2C. The cytoplasmic localization of the KKR/AAA variant is presumably due to the alteration of Lys-19 and probably Arg-20 to alanine rather than the substitution of Lys-18.The More C-terminal Part of the Polybasic Motif of Mnk1 Is Required for Binding to Importin α—A previous study had shown that all or some of the first 23 amino acids of Mnk1 were required for its binding to importin α but had not further identified the exact binding site (11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The facts that importin α generally binds polybasic regions in its cargoes (27Jans D.A. Xiao C.-Y. Lam M.H.C. Bioessays. 2003; 22: 532-544Crossref Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and that mutation of three residues within this part of Mnk1 hinders nuclear transport (in the KKR/AAA mutant; Fig. 2C) suggested that this region might interact directly with importin α.To test this idea, importin α was expressed as a hexahistidine fusion protein in E. coli, and purified on Talon® resin. This purified protein, still bound to this resin, was then incubated with wild type Myc-Mnk1 or with the various point mutants of Myc-tagged Mnk1 (all made in HEK293 cells). The His-importin α was then recovered by centrifugation, and the amount of associated myc-Mnk1 was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-myc.As shown in Fig. 3, wild type Mnk1 bound to His-importin α, as expected from earlier findings using the yeast two-hybrid system (11Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The KRR/AAA variant of Mnk1 still bound to His-importin α, but the other triple mutant, KKR/AAA, showed only a"

Recent data show that HJs are critical intermediates in replication fork stalling leading to subsequent correction of the corrupting template lesion (9McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl.

If this process is not terminated by resolvases, branch migration leads to complete strand separation as shown in Fig. 1A. Branch migration, whether spontaneous or mediated by proteins, is a key step in various genetic processes involving the Holliday junction. Various models for the Holliday junction intermediate have been utilized to unravel the structural basis for branch migration and resolution of the junction. The immobile four-way junction was a primary model system for the Holliday junction, and a great deal of information on the structure of HJs was obtained from their study. Numerous techniques (12Churchill M.E. Tullius T.D. Kallenbach N.R. Seeman N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4653-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Lilley D.M. Proc.

Biol. 2002; 320: 1037-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), show that in the presence of multivalent cations, the junction adopts an antiparallel orientation in which the four helices stack in pairs to form two double-helical domains. Immobile HJs can adopt two conformational states undergoing transition between them via extended conformation as a transient state (20McKinney S.A. Declais A.C. Lilley D.M. Ha T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, these findings are in contrast to data obtained for HJs formed by inverted repeats (2-fold sequence symmetry), which allow branch migration to occur. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of a supercoil-stabilized cruciform (21Shlyakhtenko L.S. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) shows that the cruciform adopts various conformations and that parallel orientation of the arms is the predominant HJ structure in the presence of Mg cations (22Shlyakhtenko L.S. Hsieh P. Grigoriev M. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This finding is in line with results on the structure of the 2-fold symmetry intermediate for the Flp recombination reaction even after the removal of the protein (23Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that DNA supercoiling and the mobility of the junction are important factors contributing to HJ conformation (21Shlyakhtenko L.S. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Shlyakhtenko L.S. Hsieh P. Grigoriev M. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Little is known as to how the structural features of the HJ relate to the mechanism of branch migration. A textbook model suggested 30 years ago (1Sigal N. Alberts B. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) utilizes the parallel orientation of exchanging strands (Path I in Fig. 1A). In this model, hybrid DNA molecules are formed by rotatory diffusion of the arms (2Meselson M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This view has been challenged with an alternative model suggesting that an extended configuration of the junction (Path II in Fig. 1A) is more appropriate for spontaneous movement of the HJ (3Panyutin I.G.

We show that the mobile junction adopts an extended conformation during branch migration supporting the Path II model for branch migration (Fig. 1A). The Design of a Symmetric (Mobile) Holliday Junction—Four synthetic oligonucleotides, 1) 5′-AGCTTGCATGCATCGATAT AATACGTGAGGCCTAGGATC-3′; 2) 5′-ACCATGCTCGAGATTACGAG ATATCGATGCATGCA-3′; 3) 5′-AGCTTGCATGCATCGATAT CTCGTAATCTCGAGCATGGT-3′; and 4) 5′-GATCCTAGGCCTCACGTATT ATATCGATGCATGCA-3′, were pair-wise (1 + 2 and 3 + 4) annealed to form the hemi-junctions. 235 and 300 bp linear DNA duplexes were obtained by HindIII (New England Biolabs) digestion of a 535-bp PCR fragment, which was generated using the primers for positions 97–116 and 614– 632 of plasmid pUC18. The hemi-junction synthetic duplexes (1 + 2 and 3 + 4) were ligated with the 300-bp Hind III fragments using the procedure described earlier (24Lyubchenko Y.L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) to form hemi-junctions L and R (Fig. 1B). The hemi-junctions were separated in 6% polyacrylamide and purified using the QIAquick DNA purification kit (Qiagen Inc.). Equimolar amounts of hemi-junctions L and R (30–50 ng) were mixed in 5 μl of TNM buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). The mixture was incubated for 4 min at 50 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of ice-cold TNM buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose was performed at 4 °C in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate, 1 mm EDTA) containing 10 mm MgCl2. The slow moving HJ band was excised from the gel and purified by filtration on an UltraFree UFC3 0HV column (Millipore) at 4 °C. The filtrate was immediately used for deposition on pretreated mica. AFM Procedures—Mica functionalized with aminopropyl silatrane (APS-mica) was used as an AFM substrate (26Shlyakhtenko L.S. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Gall A.A. Lyubchenko Y.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA samples (3–5 μl) were placed onto APS-mica for 2 mins, and the mica was rinsed with deionized water (Continental Water System Co., San Antonio, TX) and dried with argon. Images were acquired in air using a MultiMode SPM NanoScope III system (Veeco/Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) operating in tapping mode using OTESPA probes (Digital Instruments, Inc.). The length, height, and angle measurements were performed using Femtoscan software (Advanced Technologies Center, Moscow, Russia). For imaging in aqueous solutions, the sample was diluted in TNM buffer right before application to APS-mica to make the final DNA concentration 0.8 ng/μl. The sample was placed onto APS-mica mounted on the scanning stage of the MultiMode SPM NanoScope III system. The optical head with mounted liquid cell was placed on the sample, and the tip was brought into contact with the surface. TNM buffer was added to fill up the space between the cell and mica surface as needed. Images were acquired in tapping mode using standard silicon nitride probes (Veeco/Digital Instruments). Buffer was changed by injection of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 5 mm EDTA) with 1 ml plastic syringes attached to the inlet and outlet holes of the flow cell. The schematic illustrating the procedure for preparation of the mobile HJ is shown in Fig. 1B. The HJ was obtained by hybridization of left and right hemi-junctions having homologous duplex regions via annealing of the single-stranded ends (3Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Panyutin I.G. Biswas I. Hsieh P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The annealing was performed in Mg2+-containing TNM buffer to slow down branch migration (3Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Panyutin I.G. Biswas I. Hsieh P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A partial sequence of the center of the junction illustrating the initial one-step migration is shown in Fig. 1C. A complete sequence for synthetic oligonucleotides forming the mobile HJ is given in the “Experimental Procedures” section. Removal of Mg2+ speeds up branch migration, which eventually leads to the formation of two DNA duplexes as shown at the bottom of Fig. 1A. Gel electrophoresis analysis showed that more than 90% of the HJs were converted into linear duplexes after a 1-hour incubation in TE buffer at 50 °C (data not shown). The HJs were separated from unreacted hemi-junctions by agarose gel electrophoresis and extracted from the gel. Magnesium cations in a 10 mm concentration were present at all steps of the sample purification to decrease the rate of branch migration. AFM data for the sample deposited onto APS-mica and subsequently argon-dried are shown in Fig. 2. All of the molecules in Fig. 2 are four-way DNA junctions. The lengths of the arms for the molecules vary. This is the expected result for HJs undergoing branch migration as typified by the one-dimensional random walk model (3Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 5Biswas I. Yamamoto A. Hsieh P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The conformations of the HJs were classified in the following way. The HJ conformations in which the long arms form an almost continuous strand and with the short arms situated on opposite sides of the long filaments are referred to as being in the trans conformation (type 1 in Fig. 2). The extended conformation, in which the short arms are perpendicular to a continuous long filament, is a subset of the trans conformation. The conformations of the HJs having like arms positioned adjacent to one another are referred to as being in the cis conformation (type 2 in Fig. 2). The parallel conformation, having an angle of 0–90 degrees between homologous arms is a subset of the cis conformation. The antiparallel conformation is characterized by angles less than 90° between a short arm and the closest long arm and can be trans or cis conformations (27Seeman N.C. Kallenbach N.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 53-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To look directly at the dynamics of mobile HJs and to test the models of branch migration, we employed the capability of AFM to acquire images of fully hydrated samples, omitting the drying step. In this time-lapse imaging mode, AFM performs continued scanning over a selected area allowing the observation of molecular dynamics at the single molecule level (21Shlyakhtenko L.S. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Lyubchenko Y.L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, imaging in aqueous solutions eliminates potential sample preparation artifacts induced by drying of the sample. This AFM imaging mode has been very effective for the single molecule observation of the dynamics of supercoiled DNA (26Shlyakhtenko L.S. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Gall A.A. Lyubchenko Y.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), DNA cruciforms (21Shlyakhtenko L.S. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and the H-DNA to B-DNA transition (25Lyubchenko Y.L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Microsc. Microanal. 2002; 8: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the time-lapse experiments, the sample was deposited onto APS-mica (28Shlyakhtenko L.S. Gall A.A. Filonov A. Cerovac Z. Lushnikov A. Lyubchenko Y.L. Ultramicroscopy. 2003; 97: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and imaged with AFM continuously immediately after the AFM tip engaged the surface. The results of such experiments performed in TNM buffer are shown in Fig. 3. Molecule 1 is in the cis conformation in Fig. 3A, but adopts the trans conformation in Fig. 3B. There is another molecule (2Meselson M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) on the same scanning area that undergoes conformational transitions. This molecule is in the trans conformation with variable angles between the short and long arms in plates A and B, but the junction adopts the cis conformation in Fig. 3C. The molecule keeps changing and the conformation captured in Fig. 3D is probably an intermediate state of the HJ changing back to the trans conformation. For clarity, the conformational transitions for these two molecules are shown in Fig 3E. These images are traces of the molecules on a black background. In this figure, 1a and 1b and 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d are the traces of molecules 1 and 2, respectively. We continued the time-lapse observations in an attempt to visualize the process of strand separation. To facilitate branch migration, Mg2+-containing TNM buffer in the AFM cell was replaced with TE buffer without the termination of scanning. The set of 4 images captured after changing of the buffer is shown in Fig. 4, A–D. The molecule indicated with the arrow is in the trans conformation in the initial image (Fig. 4A). The arms subsequently move to an extended conformation (Fig. 4B). One of the short arms is barely seen in Fig. 4C probably due to branch migration resulting in the dissociation of the molecule into two linear strands as imaged in Fig. 4D. To graphically illustrate the dynamics of this HJ, the images of the molecule were copied onto a blank area from a separate image. The subset containing 18 images of the entire data set (54 frames) is shown in Fig. 4E. This data set includes images illustrating the dynamics of the junction in TNM buffer in which the HJ changes conformation from cis to trans (images 1–4 in Fig. 4E shown in black on a white background). The majority of the images of this data set show the dynamics of the HJ observed after the removal of Mg cations (white molecules on a black background). They show that the mobility of the arms is considerably higher in TE buffer than in TNM buffer. Lower mobility of the arms in the presence of Mg2+ is explained by bridging of the DNA molecules to the mica surface in addition to electrostatic interaction of the negatively charged DNA backbone with protonated amines of immobilized aminopropyl groups (24Lyubchenko Y.L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 26Shlyakhtenko L.S. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Gall A.A. Lyubchenko Y.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite an elevated mobility in TE buffer, the HJ does not change from the trans conformation into the cis (images 8–14). Moreover, the transition to the extended conformation prior to strand dissociation was observed in all images acquired (images 6–15). These observations suggest that the extended conformation, rather than the cis conformation is required for branch migration. We measured the lengths of the arms of the molecules in the images in Fig. 4E and the data are plotted in Fig. 4F. The data show that the lengths of the arms fluctuate without considerable change during the entire observation period. Branch migration leading to the dissociation of the junction is observed as a one-step process between images 15 and 16 in Fig. 4E. However, this is not a surprising finding. The time interval between the two imaging frames is 1.4 min, and according to Refs. 3Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar and 4Panyutin I.G. Biswas I. Hsieh P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, the characteristic time for strand exchange via spontaneous branch migration modeled by a random walk mechanism is 1–2 s. The interaction of the molecule with the surface should slow down the kinetics, therefore a 100-fold difference for free molecules and those confined to the surface is quite reasonable. In fact, spontaneous branch migration is a one-dimensional random walk; therefore the length of the arms can change in either direction. Another example of HJ dynamics is shown in Fig. 5. Three frames on the top (A, B, and C) show the dynamics (A and B) and the strand separation (C), and the set of images below (D) illustrates the dynamics on 13 frames including the first two frames taken in TNM buffer. Similar to the data set in Fig. 4E, the traces of the molecules placed on a black background are shown for simplicity in observing the dynamics. Interestingly, this junction retains the cis conformation even after the buffer change (frames 3–6) and dissociates rather quickly after adopting the trans conformation. Linear molecules separate pretty quickly after strand separation (image 13). The graph in Fig. 5E shows the changes in the lengths of the arms during the entire observation period. There is a substantial change in the lengths of the arms starting in frame 7 after the transition from the cis to the trans conformation occurred. The short arms after image 9 start growing and slightly fluctuate in length before the abrupt dissociation of the junction occurs. The lengths of the long arms change in an opposite fashion, as one would expect for coordinated arms changing lengths during branch migration. The strand dissociation also occurs abruptly (images 12 and 13) as we observed for the set in Fig. 4. The complete sets of images for both experiments assembled as animated files can be viewed in the supplementary materials attached to the paper (Figs. S1 and S2, respectively). We observed substantial elongation and shortening of the arms prior to strand dissociation. The data in Table I show that the shortening of shorter arms A and B accompanied the elongation of longer arms C and D.Table IThe changes of the lengths of the arms with timeTimeArm AArm BArm CArm Dminnmnmnmnm0655995961605354106107 Open table in a new tab Similar analysis was applied to the dynamics of HJs in Mg2+-containing TNM buffer. The results for two molecules imaged in the same experiment are shown in Fig. 6. The data set in Fig. 6A shows the dynamics of the molecule in the trans conformation. The graph below (B) shows the coordinated arms changing for images 3, 4, and 5. Short arms are shortened and long arms are elongated. The dynamics of the molecule in the cis conformation is analyzed in Fig. 6, C and D. There is no substantial change in the lengths of the arms for this molecule. Similar to previous data sets (Fig. 3), we have never observed strand dissociation of the junctions in TNM buffer, suggesting that Mg2+ cations slow down the kinetics of branch migration. This conclusion is in line with the branch migration results of Hsieh and colleagues (3Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Panyutin I.G. Biswas I. Hsieh P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Biswas I. Yamamoto A. Hsieh P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) who reported a 1,000-fold drop in branch migration rate in the presence of Mg2+. Our data also show that HJs in the presence of Mg2+ cations are very dynamic adopting various conformations including extended and folded parallel and antiparallel conformations. The dynamics of two molecules can be viewed in animated files S3 and S4 in the supplementary materials to this paper. Such broad dynamics of HJs is in line with recent findings (20McKinney S.A. Declais A.C. Lilley D.M. Ha T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) where single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was applied to immobile HJs undergoing transitions between two folded crossover conformations via the extended conformations as an intermediate state. The major conclusion from these data is that the extended conformation is the predominant geometry of the HJ during branch migration. Moreover, the transition of HJs from the cis to the extended geometry is required for branch migration to occur, suggesting that the folding of HJs impedes branch migration. These observations are consistent with the branch migration model of Refs. 3Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Panyutin I.G. Biswas I. Hsieh P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Biswas I. Yamamoto A. Hsieh P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, suggesting that the unfolding of HJs from the conformation stabilized by Mg2+ was necessary for rapid branch migration. Our data show that neither folded conformation of HJs is involved in branch migration. Moreover, the unfolding of the junction into an extended conformation is needed for branch migration to occur. Our data show that the extended conformation is a rather stable state for mobile HJs even in the presence of Mg2+ cations and there is a spontaneous transition between different conformations suggesting that the barrier between various conformations is comparable with the kT value. This conclusion is consistent with energetic analysis of the various models of HJs performed (29Srinivasan A.R. Olson W.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9389-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, branch migration is the protein-mediated process in which the extended conformation of the junction is stabilized by RuvA protein even in the presence of Mg2+ cations (22Shlyakhtenko L.S. Hsieh P. Grigoriev M. Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Constantinou A. Davies A.A. West S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similar conformations of HJs are found in a number of site-specific recombination systems (31van Duyne G.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Altogether, this evidence suggests that an extended conformation of mobile Holliday junctions is their inherent conformation during branch migration, and that proteins are needed to select the unfolded conformation of the junction and stabilize this conformation for protein-mediated branch migration. Single molecule AFM was successfully used in this work to assess the dynamics of HJs under conditions allowing branch migration. The advantage of time-lapse AFM imaging is that this technique enables one to observe the dynamics of an entire molecule with nanometer range resolution. Importantly, several molecules in the scanning area can be imaged and analyzed simultaneously allowing the comparison of the dynamics of different molecules at fully identical environmental conditions. However, the dynamics of molecules confines to the space of a surface-liquid interface and cannot be compared with the unrestricted dynamics of molecules free in solution. Our immobilization approach enables us to decrease the strength of the surface-DNA links allowing the observation of extensive dynamics of HJs including the separation of strands, but the rate of branch migration is several orders of magnitude lower in AFM experiments than for freely diffusing molecules (see the estimates above). Therefore, single molecule AFM is a technique that provides information on the range of conformational changes of the molecules rather than the time scale of these changes, which can be retrieved by other single molecule techniques. Note in this regard that a broad dynamics of the arms of mobile HJs at conditions unfavorable for branch migration (in the presence of magnesium cations) is consistent with the recent findings (20McKinney S.A. Declais A.C. Lilley D.M. Ha T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) where the arms dynamics of immobile HJs was analyzed with FRET at the single molecule level. We thank L. Shlyakhtenko, C.

The functional coupling of ATP hydrolysis activity to proton transport in V-pumps requires a regulatory component known as subunit H (SFD) as has been shown both in vivo and in vitro (Ho, M. N., Hirata, R., Umemoto, N., Ohya, Y., Takatsuki, A., Stevens, T. H., and Anraku, Y. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18286–18292; Xie, X. S., Crider, B. P., Ma, Y. M., and Stone, D. K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 25809–25815). Ca2+ is thought to uncouple V-pumps because it is found to support ATP hydrolysis but not proton transport, while Mg2+ supports both activities. The direct effect of phospholipids on the coupling of V-ATPases has not been reported, likely due to the fact that phospholipids are constituents of biological membranes. We now report that Ca2+-induced uncoupling of the bovine brain V-ATPase can be reversed by imposition of a favorable membrane potential. Furthermore we report a simple “membrane-free” assay system using the V0 proton channel-specific inhibitor bafilomycin as a probe to detect the coupling of V-ATPase under certain conditions. With this system, we have characterized the functional effect of subunit H, divalent cations, and phospholipids on bovine brain V-ATPase and have found that each of these three factors plays a critical role in the functional coupling of the V-pump.

The vacuolar or V-type ATPases constitute a broad class of electrogenic proton-translocating ATPases that are among the most widely distributed ATP-driven ion pumps in nature. V-type proton ATPases are present in all eukaryotic cells, and the structure of these proton pumps is highly conserved from yeast to human (1Sudhof T.C. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Johnston P.A. Xie X.S.

Within eukaryotic cells, V-type proton pumps are distributed among intracellular organelles of both constitutive and regulated pathways. In addition, V-ATPases have been localized to the plasma membranes of certain specialized cells such as renal intercalated cells, osteoclasts, and macrophages. Over the past 2 decades, the importance of V-type ATPases has become increasingly appreciated (12Al Awqati Q. Annu. Rev.

The ubiquitous function of V-pumps within cells is to acidify intracellular organelles, which is essential for receptor-mediated endocytosis, lysosomal hydrolase activities, intracellular protein targeting, processing of hormones, and uptake and storage of neurotransmitters. In cells with certain specialized functions, V-pumps are localized in the plasma membrane and are instrumental in the regulation of intracellular pH, acid secretion, and bone reabsorption. V-ATPases are complex proteins containing at least 13 different subunits and are organized into two distinct functional domains: a peripheral catalytic sector V1 and a membranous proton channel V0, similar to the F1F0 complex structure of mitochondrial and bacterial ATP synthases. V-pumps are regulated at various levels including transcription (19Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Gluck S.L. J. Biol.

But a regulatory mechanism that is unique to V-pumps is the reversible dissociation and association of V1 and V0 in response to energy demand; this mechanism has been extensively studied in yeast and in tobacco hornworm (28Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wieczorek H. Gruber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A novel complex, RAVE (regulator of the ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes), has been shown to associate with the V1 domain of the yeast V-ATPase and to promote glucose-triggered assembly of V-ATPase (30Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In mammals, interaction between the V-pump and aldolase has been observed in both osteoclasts and kidney cells (31Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn Jr., W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), implying a certain type of coupling between glucose metabolism and V-pump activity that could be similar to what has been characterized in yeast. The physical association between V1 and V0, however, is not sufficient for the functional coupling of V-pumps, which in addition requires subunit H (SFD). Subunit H is a key regulatory element of V-ATPase that is not required for the assembly of V1V0 but is absolutely essential for the function of V-type proton pumps as has been shown both in vivo (32Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro (33Xie X.S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.M.

It remains to be determined how subunit H regulates the functional coupling of V-ATPases, and it is equally unclear what role certain non-protein factors may play in this process, such as divalent cations and phospholipids. Investigations of the role of divalent cations in the function of V-ATPase have been largely limited to comparisons of the rates of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and proton pumping catalyzed by various divalent cation-ATP complexes (35Xie X.S.

In general, most investigators have found that Mg2+ and Mn2+ support all three activities, whereas Ca2+ only supports ATP binding and hydrolysis, not proton pumping. An exception to this generalization is a report indicating that Ca-ATP will support proton pumping in chromaffin granule ghosts (39Flatmark T. Gronberg M. Husebye Jr., E. Berge S.V. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which other investigators have not observed for unknown reasons. In contrast, a significant body of literature exists regarding the interactions of divalent cations with F-ATPase (40Senior A.E. Richardson L.V. Baker K. Wise J.G. J. Biol.

Multiple sites have been demonstrated; these include catalytic sites involved with cation-ATP interactions, a Mg2+ specific non-catalytic site that is responsible for stabilization of the complex, and additional sites that have regulatory functions. In general, divalent cations have been proposed to regulate the functional coupling of ATP hydrolysis/synthesis and proton movement in F1F0 systems. More specifically, Ca2+ has been shown to uncouple ATP hydrolysis/synthesis from proton movement in F-ATPases (43Papageorgiou S. Melandri A.B. Solaini G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Studies on ion transport require an assay system that is partitioned into two compartments by membranes, which contain phospholipids. This represents an inherent difficulty in determining whether phospholipids play a direct role in the functional coupling of V-pumps. In this study, we demonstrate that Ca-ATP results in only a partial uncoupling of V-ATPase and that significant proton translocation in this setting is restored by a favorable membrane potential. In addition, we report a simple assay system using the V0 proton channel-specific inhibitor bafilomycin A1 as an indicator of functional coupling of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation. With this assay system, a direct role of phospholipids in the functional coupling of V-ATPase is demonstrated, and the effects of subunit H and divalent cations are further characterized. Materials—Acridine orange was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co., 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF) was from Molecular Probes, Zwittergent 3-16 was from Calbiochem, [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences, and all phospholipids were from Avanti Polar lipids, Inc. The proton ionophore 1799 was the generous gift of Dr. Peter Heytler (DuPont). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Preparations—The bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicle V-ATPase was purified to a specific activity of 14–16 μmol of Pi × mg–1 × min–1 as described previously (47Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subunit H-free V-ATPase was prepared by removal of subunit H (SFD) from purified V-ATPase using Zwittergent 3-16 as reported previously (33Xie X.S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a minor modification. In brief, 5 mg of purified V-ATPase was precipitated by ammonium sulfate at 45% saturation and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm with a Ti70 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in 2 ml of a solution containing 1% Zwittergent 3-16, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated on ice for 1 h. The resultant subunit H-free V-ATPase and dissociated subunit H were separated by glycerol density gradient centrifugation as described previously (33Xie X.S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant subunit H was prepared as reported earlier (34Zhou Z. Peng S.B. Crider B.P. Andersen P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15913-15919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The two isoforms of subunit H (SFDα and SFDβ) showed no detectable difference in their activation activity. Reconstitution of V-pump into Proteoliposomes—The bovine brain V-pump was reconstituted into liposomes, which contain phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and cholesterol at a weight ratio of 40:26.5:7.5:26, by the cholate dilution, freeze-thaw method as described previously (48Xie X.S. Tsai S.J. Stone D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8913-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, liposomes (200 μg) were added to 1 μg of V-ATPase and were well mixed. Glycerol, sodium cholate, KCl/NaCl, and MgCl2 (or CaCl2) were added to the protein-lipid mixture at final concentrations of 10% (v/v), 1%, 0.15 m, and 2.5 mm, respectively. The KCl/NaCl ratio varied to allow for designated interior [KCl] of proteoliposomes. For experiments with interior negative membrane potential, [KCl]in was 150 mm; for experiments with interior positive membrane potential, [KCl] decreased, but [KCl + NaCl] was constant at 150 mm. The reconstitution mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, frozen in liquid N2 for 1 min, and then thawed at room temperature. For the proton pumping assays in which no membrane potential was applied, the mixture was directly diluted with 1.5 ml of proton pumping assay buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Na-Tricine, pH 7.0, and a 3 mm concentration either of MgCl2 or CaCl2) in a spectrophotometer cuvette, which allows the formation of sealed ready-to-assay proteoliposomes. The volume of the reconstitution mixture was maintained at <30 μl such that it would be diluted at least 50-fold when assayed. For experiments requiring the imposition of a membrane potential, the protein-lipid mixtures containing the designated [KCl] were diluted 60-fold in buffers with corresponding salt concentrations and centrifuged to sediment the sealed proteoliposomes. The proteoliposomes were then resuspended in a small volume of the dilution buffer and were stable for at least 2–3 days at 4 °C. Measurement of Proton Translocation—For experiments using the acridine orange quenching method (49Gluck S. Kelly S. Al Awqati Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9230-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the assays were conducted in an SLM-Aminco DW2C dual wavelength spectrophotometer, and the activity was registered as ΔA 492–540. Generally 5–10 μl of proteoliposomes were added to 1.5 ml of proton pumping assay buffer containing 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.0, 6.7 μm acridine orange, a 3 mm concentration of either MgCl2 or CaCl2, and varying concentrations of KCl from 0 to 150 mm to generate a predetermined membrane potential in the presence of valinomycin. The [KCl + NaCl] in the assay solution was constant at 150 mm. Due to the contribution of KCl from the proteoliposome samples, the actual [KCl]out was at least 0.5 mm. The reaction was initiated by addition of 1.3 mm ATP (pH 7.0) and 1 μg/ml valinomycin. For experiments where Mg2+ or Ca2+ was added to start the reaction, divalent cations were omitted initially from the assay buffer, which instead contained 0.2 mm EDTA to remove residual free divalent cations. For acidification assays using 5-CF, the experiments were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5B luminescence spectrometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 520 nm, respectively. In a typical reaction, 5 μl of proteoliposomes containing 0.5 mm 5-CF were diluted into 1.5 ml of assay solution containing various salt concentrations as described above. The reactions were initiated by the addition of valinomycin and ATP, and the results were normalized to control experiments conducted with Mg2+ under equal internal and external K+ concentration. Measurement of ATPase Activities—ATPase activity was measured as the liberation of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP (47Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the soluble system, purified V-ATPase was first mixed with or without effectors such as subunit H or phospholipids. The reaction was started by addition of 200 μl of ATPase assay solution A (30 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2 (or CaCl2), and 3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (400 cpm/nmol)) in the presence or absence of the inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and continued for 15–30 min at 37 °C. For the ATPase assay with proteoliposomes, the samples were first mixed with or without subunit H followed by addition of ATPase assay solution B to start the reaction. ATPase assay solution B is basically the same as the assay solution A except that it contained valinomycin and variable concentrations of KCl with a constant [KCl + NaCl] at 150 mm. The assays with proteoliposomes were carried out at room temperature to reduce the nonspecific leak of ions through the membrane and in the presence or absence of the proton ionophore 1799 as designated in the legends to figures. The ATP hydrolysis reaction was terminated by adding 1.0 ml of 1.25 n perchloric acid, and the released 32Pi was extracted and counted in a Beckman scintillation counter as described previously (50Stone D.K. Xie X.S. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2701-2703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were expressed either as the actual amount of ATP hydrolyzed (nmol of Pi/assay) or as specific activity (μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein). Measurement of ATP-driven Membrane Potential—Changes in the absorbance of oxonol VI at ΔA 625–587 (51Loh Y.P. Tam W.W. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8238-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a qualitative measure of ATP-driven membrane potential generated by V-ATPase. The assay was conducted in an SLM-Aminco DW2C dual wavelength spectrophotometer in a solution containing 200 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.0, and a 3 mm concentration of either CaCl2 or MgCl2. The reaction was started by addition of 1.3 mm ATP and terminated by adding 1799 at 1 nm. The Ca-ATPase Activity of Bovine Brain V-pump Is Coupled to Proton Translocation under an Advantageous Membrane Potential—V-ATPase complex hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of either Mg2+ or Ca2+, but proton pump activity is detected only in the presence of Mg2+ and not in the presence of Ca2+. The dissociated V1 domain, on the other hand, hydrolyzes ATP only in the presence of Ca2+ (33Xie X.S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Graf R. Harvey W.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with Mg2+ being inhibitory under the same conditions. Based on these observations, Ca2+ is thought to uncouple V-pumps, as it does the F-type pumps, and the Ca-ATPase activity has been considered to reflect the enzymatic activity of V-ATPase in the uncoupled state. This concept, however, was challenged by our observations that the Ca-ATPase activity of reconstituted bovine brain V-ATPase was stimulated by a proton ionophore 1799 (shown later in Fig. 3) and that a membrane potential was detected in the presence of Ca-ATP, albeit to a much lesser extent than that seen in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1A). Since the ionophore stimulation and the generation of membrane potential are both characteristics of a coupled ATPase activity, these data suggest that the Ca-ATPase activity of the intact V-pump is only partially uncoupled from proton movement and that the resulting acidification of proteoliposomes is too weak to detect under normal conditions.Fig. 1Detection of membrane potential and acidification in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Bovine brain V-ATPase was reconstituted into proteoliposomes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ATP-driven membrane potential (A) was measured as ΔA 625–587 using oxonol VI as a membrane potential probe in an assay solution containing 200 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.0, anda3mm concentration of either CaCl2 (trace 1) or MgCl2 (trace 2), and the reaction was initiated by addition of 1.3 mm ATP. Because the reconstituted vesicles were sealed by dilution into the assay solution, the internal ion composition of the proteoliposomes should be basically the same as that of the assay solution. To measure proton translocation (B), the proteoliposomes loaded with 150 mm KCl were sealed first as described under “Experimental Procedures” prior to the assay. Acidification was measured using acridine orange quenching as ΔA 492–540 in a solution containing 10 mm Na-Tricine, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, and a 150 mm concentration of either KCl (traces 1 and 2) or NaCl (traces 3 and 4). ATP and valinomycin were added as indicated before addition of either CaCl2 (traces 1 and 3) or MgCl2 (traces 2 and 4) at 3 mm to start the reaction. Val, valinomycin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our routine assay for proteoliposomes acidification was performed under conditions of [K+]out = [K+]in = 150 mm. We found that proton translocation in the presence of Ca-ATP was restored by decreasing [K+]out to 1.5 mm and therefore imposing a favorable membrane potential in the presence of the K+ ionophore valinomycin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1B, ATP-driven proton translocation was only detected in the presence of Mg2+ when [K+]out = [K+]in (traces 1 and 2). However, when an interior negative electrical gradient was established (traces 3 and 4), Ca-ATP-driven proton transport was restored to a level comparable to that supported by Mg2+ under usual conditions. To confirm that the activity is indeed supported by Ca2+, the reaction was initiated by adding the respective divalent cations. This is the first demonstration that the V-pump can be functionally coupled in the presence of Ca2+ in an in vitro experiment using purified enzyme at an advantageous membrane potential. This reaction is distinct from the membrane potential-driven proton translocation of reconstituted V0 proton channel (55Crider B.P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because it is ATP-dependent. We subsequently found that the weak acidification supported by Ca2+ under normal conditions could be detected using a more sensitive fluorescent pH probe, 5-CF (see Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows results from a series of experiments in which both proton translocation and ATPase activity of reconstituted proteoliposomes of bovine brain V-pump were measured in the presence of either Mg2+ or Ca 2+ as a function of the imposed membrane potential. Both ATPase and proton pumping activities in the presence of Mg2+ and at zero membrane potential were used as 100% activity, respectively. The membrane potential ΔΨ was established by varying the ratio of [K+]out to [K+]in in the presence of valinomycin. Since only a small number of ions moving across the membrane is needed to generate a substantial membrane potential, ΔΨ can be calculated using the formula E = 58 mV × log([K+] o /[K+] i) by simplifying the Nernst equation for the specific conditions used in this study. As shown in Fig. 2, the rate of proton translocation parallels that of ATPase activity in the presence of Mg2+, which is an indication of tight coupling. In the presence of Ca2+, the proton pump activity does not parallel the ATPase activity but rather falls with a greater slope following the increase in the membrane potential, suggesting changes in the coupling efficiency. This result is analogous to the “slippage” phenomenon observed in some P-type ion-transporting ATPases working against a transmembrane ion gradient in which the coupling ratios of ion transport to ATP hydrolysis in those P-type pumps are reduced from theoretical values down to zero (56Berman M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 95-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 57Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the mechanism underlying this slippage of V-pump in the presence of Ca2+ remains unclear, this observation provides a convenient experimental tool to monitor the transition of V-ATPase from the uncoupled to coupled states since the Mg-ATPase activity of V-pump is difficult to measure for uncoupled enzyme, whereas the Ca-ATPase activity is present in both coupled and uncoupled states. Effect of Phospholipids on the Coupling of V-ATPase in a Membrane-free System—The V-pump loses its Mg-ATPase activity when endogenous phospholipids are removed during the solubilization and purification of the enzyme, and the activity is restored when phospholipids are added back with the order of PS > phosphatidylcholine > phosphatidylethanolamine (see Fig. 4). However, a substantial level of Ca-ATPase activity remains in purified V-ATPase after the removal of endogenous phospholipids. Since the Ca-ATPase activity of V-pump is partially uncoupled, we compared its phospholipid dependence with that of the Mg-ATPase activity of the V-pump complex and the Ca-ATPase activity of dissociated V1.

A protease-deficient strain was used, recombinant clones were screened for multicopy genomic integrants, and protein expression, and time and temperature of methanol induction were optimized. A 3-liter culture provides 300-500 mg of membrane protein with ouabain binding capacity of 30-50 pmol mg-1.

Wild type (WT) and a D369N mutant have been analyzed by Fe2+- and ATP-Fe2+-catalyzed oxidative cleavage, described for renal Na+,K+-ATPase. Cleavage of the D369N mutant provides strong evidence for two Fe2+ sites: site 1 composed of residues in P and A cytoplasmic domains, and site 2 near trans-membrane segments M3/M1. The D369N mutation suppresses cleavages at site 1, which appears to be a normal Mg2+ site in E2 conformations. The results suggest a possible role of the charge of Asp369 on the E1 ↔ E2 conformational equilibrium. 5′-Adenylyl-β,γ-imidodi-phosphate(AMP-PNP)-Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage of the D369N mutant produces fragments in P (712VNDS) and N (near 440VAGDA) domains, described for WT, but only at high AMP-PNP-Fe2+ concentrations, and a new fragment in the P domain (near 367CSDKTGT) resulting from cleavage. Thus, the mutation distorts the active site. A molecular dynamic simulation of ATP-Mg2+ binding to WT and D351N structures of Ca2+-ATPase (analogous to Asp369 of Na+,K+-ATPase) supplies possible explanations for the new cleavage and for a high ATP affinity, which was observed previously for the mutant.

The Asn351 structure with bound ATP-Mg2+ may resemble the transition state of the WT poised for phosphorylation. The Na+,K+-ATPase utilizes the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP to actively transport three intracellular Na+ ions and two extracellular K+ ions in opposite directions across animal cell membranes. The Na+,K+-ATPase is a member of the P-type family of cation pumps. The kinetic mechanism of Na+,K+-ATPase, as of other P-type pumps, involves a phosphoenzyme intermediate and is now largely understood (1Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1993; 462: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As pointed out by Jencks (3Jencks W.P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 145-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), strict cation and substrate specificities of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions, and tight coupling of the E1 ↔ E2 conformational changes to cation movements are the essential features of all P-type ion pump mechanisms. These central questions of the energy transduction mechanism of P-type pumps can now be posed in structural terms (4Jorgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) because of availability of molecular structures of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase for both E12Ca2+ and E2 conformations (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase molecule consists of head, stalk, and membrane sectors (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). There are 10 transmembrane segments in the membrane domain with two Ca2+ ions ligated approximately in the center of the bilayer and between transmembrane segments M4, M5, M6, and M8 in the E12Ca2+ conformation. The stalk sector consists of the cytoplasmic extensions of the transmembrane helices, particularly S5 and S4. The cytoplasmic sector consists of three domains, nucleotide binding (N), 1The abbreviations used are: N, nucleotide binding domain; P, phosphorylating domain; A, anchor or actuator domain; AOX1, alcohol oxidase 1; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-1-amido-fluoresceinamine, isomer I; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Desferal, desferrioxamine mesylate; YNB, yeast nitrogen base; WT, wild type; BMG, buffered minimal glycerol; BMM, buffered minimal methanol medium; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. phosphorylating (P), and anchor or actuator domain (A). Comparison of the crystal structure an E12Ca2+ and E2 conformations shows that in the E1 conformations the N, P, and A domains are separate, whereas in E2 conformations the domains are gathered together, moving essentially as rigid bodies (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Movement of the A domain toward P and N domains in the E1 → E2 transition is associated with a bending of S5 that entails complex movements of several transmembrane segments. This changes the ligation of the occluded Ca2+ ions within the transmembrane segments allowing them to dissociate within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Whereas this general paradigm clearly applies to the other P-type pumps, not all features are explained by the crystal structures. As one example, phosphorylation by ATP requires close proximity of the nucleotide binding N and phosphorylation P domains, but this is not observed in the E12Ca2+ (Protein Data Bank code 1EUL) structure. In addition, of course, there are the specific features of other ion pumps particularly the cation selectivities, β subunits in the case of Na+,K+-ATPase or H+,K+-ATPase (7Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), or FXYD proteins, which are accessory subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase (8Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 64: 41-56Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). For analysis of conformational transitions and ligand binding on renal Na+,K+-ATPase or gastric H+,K+-ATPase specific oxidative cleavage catalyzed by bound Fe2+ or the ATP-Fe2+ complex has turned out to be very informative (see Refs. 9Goldshleger R.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1405-1410Google Scholar) and H+-ATPase (16Valiakhmetov A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6330-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The cleavages provide information on the spatial organization surrounding the bound Fe2+, or ATP-Fe2+ (14Karlish S.J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One major prediction from the cleavages catalyzed by bound Fe2+ ions is that E1 ↔ E2 conformational changes are associated with large movements in the cytoplasm domains, N, P, and A domains interacting in E2 states but separate in the E1 state (14Karlish S.J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This is fully consistent with the difference observed between the crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase in the E12Ca2+ conformation (Protein Data Bank code ID 1EUL) or an E2 conformation in the presence of vandadate/Mg2+ (Protein Data Bank code 1KJU) (Refs. 5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar and 17Xu C. Rice W.J. He W. Stokes D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 61: 884-894Google Scholar, see also Ref. 14Karlish S.J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for a discussion of differences between the 1KJU structure and the new E2 structure 1IWO). The Fe2+ in ATP-Fe2+ substitutes for Mg2+ ions in catalyzing phosphorylation and ATPase activity (18Rendi R. Uhr M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 89: 520-531PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fukushima Y. Post R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6853-6872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus cleavages mediated by ATP-Fe2+ provide information on ligation of Fe2+ or Mg2+ ions as well as N, P, and A domain proximity. The high selectivity of the ATP-Fe2+-mediated cleavages, as well as recent observations of similar cleavages mediated by a fluoresecein-DTPA-Fe2+ complex (13Patchornik G. Munson K. Goldshleger R. Shainskaya A. Sachs G. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11740-11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggest that cleavages occur only next to residues that bind the Fe2+ directly. Thus, overall, the cleavages have led to a picture of N, P, and A domain interactions and ATP-Mg2+ or Mg2+ ions binding in the different conformational states of the catalytic cycle (summarized in Refs. 4Jorgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 13Patchornik G. Munson K. Goldshleger R. Shainskaya A. Sachs G. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11740-11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, and 14Karlish S.J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In another recent development the masses of cleavage fragments have been measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (14Karlish S.J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Goldshleger, R., Pachornik, G., Mehlman, T., Benjamin, M., Merhav, D., Karlish, S. J. D., and Shainskaya, A. (2002) Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Mass Spectrometry (www.inmerge.com/aspfolder/ASMSAbstracts.html), Orlando, FLGoogle Scholar). With the exception of two fragments with exactly known N termini (214ESE and 712VNDS), other fragments could not be sequenced, and the N termini were designated previously as near XXXX by comparison with known proteolytic fragments. The analysis by mass spectrometry has now greatly improved the assignments, so that the designation of all N termini of fragments as near XXXX is accurate to within 2-4 residues. Whereas the Ca2+-ATPase structures and modeling based on the structures are invaluable for testing the validity of interpretations, cleavage experiments also lead to inferences on ATP and Mg2+ binding and N to P domain interactions not available from the crystal structures. Thus, it is highly desirable to investigate the predicted roles of specific residues by mutational analysis. As one relevant example, mutations of residues in the conserved 708TGDGVNDS sequence in the P domain have already shown that Asp710 is a Mg2+ binding residue (21Pedersen P.A. Jorgensen J.R. Jorgensen P.L J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37588-37595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We describe here expression of Na+,K+-ATPase in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and analysis of the wild type protein and the D369N mutant by Fe2+-catalyzed oxidative cleavages. The α1 and β1 subunit of cDNA, under control of the AOX1 promoter, are incorporated into the alcohol oxidase chromosomal locus (AOX1), and protein synthesis is induced with methanol (see Ref. 22Cereghino J.L. Cregg J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 45-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a general review). P. pastoris can grow to high cell densities and produce high levels of secreted soluble proteins. As a precedent for expression of an integral membrane protein in P. pastoris, the P-glycoprotein (MDR3) has been expressed in large quantities and purified for biochemical and structural work (23Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of functional Na+,K+-ATPase in P. pastoris at significant levels appeared to be an attractive possibility. Na+,K+-ATPase has been expressed in many cell types, and used extensively for structure-function analysis, but of most relevance to the present work wild type and mutant Na+,K+-ATPase proteins have been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and interactions of the pump ligands, ATP, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and ouabain characterized in detail, particularly by direct binding assays (21Pedersen P.A. Jorgensen J.R. Jorgensen P.L J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37588-37595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Nielsen J.M. Pedersen P.A. Karlish S.J.D. Jorgensen P.L.

On the other hand, analysis of structural organization and conformational changes by proteolytic cleavage or metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavage has not been described. As a first step in analysis of mutants by oxidative cleavage we have chosen to examine the active site mutant, D369N. Previously, the D369N and D369A mutants of pig α1β1 Na+,K+-ATPase complex were expressed in S. cerevisae and analyzed in detail at the biochemical level (26Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins are, of course, inactive because of the inability to undergo phosphorylation, but they show two striking properties. First, the ATP binding affinity of the D369N and D369A mutants is much higher than that of the WT protein. A similar effect of D351N, A and T mutants of Ca2+-ATPase has also been described (30McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Second, the conformational equilibrium E2 ↔ E1 is significantly poised toward the E2 forms compared with the WT. However, the structural consequences of the mutations have not been investigated. In view of the central role of the active site aspartate, evidence on changes in structural organization caused by the D369N mutation could provide important information on the energy transduction mechanism. Escherichia coli HB101 (hsdS20 (rB- mB-), recA13, ara-14, proA2, lacY1, galK2, rpsL20 (Smrr), xyl-5, mtl-1, supE44, λ-/F-) was used for propagation and preparation of various plasmid constructs. P. pastoris strains GS115 (his4) and SMD1165 (his4, prb1) were used for transformation with the expression vector pHIL-D2(α/β). YNB medium (without amino acids, with ammonium sulfate) was obtained from Difco. [3H]Ouabain (TRK429) and [γ-32P]ATP (PB 10132) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. α-Chymotrypsin (catalog number 2307) was obtained from Merck. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. cDNAs encoding porcine α1 (accession number X03938) in plasmid pGEM and porcine β1 (accession number X04635) in plasmid pBR322 were provided by P. L. Jorgenesen (Copenhagen University). Plasmid pGEM1(α1) was digested with XbaI, HindIII, and DraI, and treated by Klenow. The XbaI-HindIII fragment containing α1 was then ligated with the large fragment released from the E. coli-P. pastoris shuttle vector, pHIL-D2 after EcoRI, Klenow, and alkaline phosphatase treatment. The right orientation of the cloned fragment under the AOX1 promoter was determined by restriction analysis. Next, the β1 open reading frame and flanking regions (in plasmid pBR322) were amplified by PCR using two synthetic oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-cccgaattcgctgctgacccgccaccatggcccg and antisense 5′-atag aattcgtgtaggtccctacgtatgacag containing EcoRI sites (underlines). The PCR fragment was digested by EcoRI and ligated to EcoRI-treated plasmid pHIL-D2 to produce pHIL-D2β1. A large part of the β1 gene was then replaced (using SacII and SnaBI) by the original gene, and the remaining PCR-generated region was sequenced. To construct a vector encoding both genes (α1 and β1), an additional selection marker has been introduced; the kan R gene that confers resistance to kanamycin in bacteria and to G418 in yeast cells. The bacterial plasmid, pCV3 (kan R) 2A. Seluanov and E. Bibi, unpublished data. prepared in E. coli SCS110dam- dcm- (Stratagene) was digested with StuI and a fragment containing kan R was ligated to the SnaBI-treated plasmid pHIL-D2β1 to produce plasmid pHIL-D2β1(kan R). Next, the P AOX1/β1/kan R fragment was excised from pHIL-D2β1(kan R) by NotI and ClaI (partial digestion). The appropriate NotI-ClaI fragment (3,670 bp) was treated by Klenow and ligated to plasmid pHIL-D2α1 that was partially digested with NaeI and dephosphorylated to produce the final expression vector pHIL-D2(α/β) (15,332 bp). This plasmid was used to mutate Asp369 in the α1 gene (D369N) by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis using the overlap-extension PCR method (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The PCR product was sequenced. 10 μg of linear DNA obtained by digestion of plasmid pHIL-D2(α/β) with NotI were used to transform spheroplasts of P. pastoris GS115 or SMD1165, according to the Invitrogen manual (version F). Approximately 120-150 His+ prototrophs were replica plated to MM (1.34% YNB, 4 × 105% biotin, 0.5% methanol, 2% agar) and MD (1.34% YNB, 4 × 105% biotin, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) plates for Muts (methanol utilization slow) screening. 10-20% of His4+ transformants exhibited a Muts phenotype. P. pastoris GS115 and SMD115 were grown according to the instructions in the Invitrogen Pichia Expression kit manual. Plating and screening of transformants in RD medium (1 m sorbitol, 2% dextrose, 1.34% YNB, 4 × 105% biotin, 0.005% of each amino acids: l-glutamic acid, l-methionine, l-lysine, l-leucine, and l-isoleucine), MD, and MM media were performed according to the manual. Liquid cultures were grown in BMG (buffered minimal glycerol medium, consisting of 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.04% biotin, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, and glycerol at the indicated concentrations), BMM (buffered minimal methanol medium, consisting of BMG without glycerol but with methanol 0.5%), or YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose). Muts colonies were grown overnight at 30 °C in 200 μl of YPD medium in 96-well plates. 5-μl Aliquots were then spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm, Millipore) placed on the surface of a fresh YPD plate. After evaporation of the liquid, the plates were inverted and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Cell lysis and DNA fixation were done according to Ref. 32Romanos M. Scorer C. Sreekrishna K. Clare J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 103: 55-72PubMed Google Scholar. A StuI-SacII fragment of the α1 porcine cDNA (accession number X03938) was amplified by PCR with two deoxyoligonucleotides: sense 5′-gatgccaaggcctgcgtggtcc, and antisense 5′-gcc-ccgcggcaggaagatctcttgtagtaggtttccttctc. The PCR product was used to prepare a radioactive probe by random priming using a hexanucleotide mixture (Roche catalog number 1-277-081). The filter was incubated overnight with the probe at 42 °C in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 2 × SSC (×20 stock contains 3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denaturated salmon sperm DNA. Routinely yeast cultures were propagated in YPD medium. Screening Clones for Expression—5 ml of fresh BMG broth (0.1% glycerol) was inoculated with a candidate clone and incubated for 20-24 h with vigorous shaking at 25 °C, until the glycerol was exhausted and the A 600 was 2-4. Then, 0.5% methanol was added daily for 5 days. Cells were pelleted and membranes were prepared as described below. Cells were disrupted with 0.5-mm glass beads by shaking for 1 h in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes placed in a multitube shaker device VXR IKA basic IKA-Vibrax™ set to 2000 rpm. Optimization of Expression—5 ml of BMG broth (1% glycerol) were inoculated with the clone of interest and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 24 h. Cells were then diluted 1000-fold into 50-200 ml of BMG (1% glycerol) and grown to the desired A 600, usually 2-4 units. Cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in fresh BMM broth; cells were grown for 5 days with a daily addition of methanol (0.5%) at the desired temperature. Scaling Up of Cultures—3-Liter cultures were grown in 8- or 3-liter Bellco Spinner™ flasks with magnetic stirring and temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a thermostatically controlled water bath. Sterile compressed air was supplied via a 0.2-μm filter and bubbled into the culture via a 10-μm porous filter. 3 liters of BMG broth (0.2% glycerol) was inoculated with 0.2 liter of a starting culture and grown for 24 h with maximal agitation of 400 rpm and airflow set to 0.1-0.2 liters h-1. After the cell growth had stopped (at an A 600 of ∼ 2-4 units), expression of the Na+,K+-ATPase was induced by adding 0.5% methanol daily for 6 days. P. pastoris cells were collected by centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in an ice-cold buffer containing 1.4 m sorbitol, 10 mm MOPS/Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin and 10 μg/ml chymotrypsin), at 1 g of cells/10 ml of buffer. The cells were mixed with an equal volume of glass beads (0.5 mm) and disrupted by 8 × 1-min cycles using a Glass Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Inc.). The cooling jacket of the bead beater was filled with 50% glycerol at -20 °C. Unbroken cells and heavy membranes were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and light membranes were collected at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was suspended in 10 mm MOPS/Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol with protease inhibitors (as above), and stored at -80 °C. Renal Na+,K+-ATPase was prepared as described in Ref. 33Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. 12-25 μg of yeast membranes were mixed with 5-fold concentrated sample buffer containing 1 mm PMSF, and separated on 7.5 or 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunostained with anti-Lys1012-Tyr1016 (anti-KETYY antibodies, 1:3,000) that recognize the C terminus of the α subunit, or with anti-β antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of the β subunit (35Bar Shimon M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34190-34195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus kit) using anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugate as instructed (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were scanned with an imaging densitometer (GS-690, Bio-Rad) and analyzed using the Multi-analyst software (Bio-Rad). Ouabain binding to membranes or to whole cells was done using [3H]ouabain essentially as described in Refs. 25Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 26Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. In assays of ouabain binding to membranes, at the end of incubation 3 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl was added, the samples were filtered on Whatman GF/C filters and washed twice with the same buffer. Na+,K+-ATPase activities were assayed using [γ-32P]ATP as described in Ref. 33Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. Prior to both ouabain binding and ATPase assays, membranes (2 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.3 mg/ml SDS at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged. This procedure inactivates ouabain-insensitive ATPase and demasks any Na+,K+-ATPase molecules in closed vesicles (26Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Renal Na+,K+-ATPase or membranes containing the recombinant enzyme were centrifuged, and re-suspended in a medium containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and either 20 mm NaCl or 20 mm RbCl, at a concentration of 0.1 mg of protein/ml. The membranes were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 5 μg/ml α-chymotrypsin. The digestion was arrested by addition of 140 mm KCl plus 1 mm PMSF, and centrifugation. The pellets were re-suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm PMSF. Cleavage fragments were visualized by immunoblotting using the anti-KETYY antibody. Recombinant membranes were centrifuged and re-suspended (0.5 mg/ml) in media containing 20 mm MES (Tris), pH 6.5, with or without 130 mm NaCl or RbCl, or ATP, AMP-PNP, or other ligands as indicated in the figure legends. To 25 μl of the membrane suspension, freshly prepared solutions of 10 mm ascorbate, and different concentrations of FeSO4 were added, then 10 mm H2O2 was added to a total volume of 50 μl, and the suspension was incubated at 0 °C for 15 min. To arrest the reaction, 25 μl of a solution of EDTA, desferrioxamine mesylate (Desferal), and PMSF were added to final concentrations of 30, 3, and 1 mm, respectively. After 5 min at room temperature, 25 μl of ×5 concentrated sample buffer were added and samples were loaded onto gels. Cleavage fragments were visualized by immunoblotting using the anti-KETYY antibody. The initial three-dimensional model of the wild type Ca2+-ATPase was truncated to comprise only the P and N domains, including bound ATP and Mg2+, as described in a recent publication (13Patchornik G.

The D351N mutation was performed using the SwisPdbViewer. The Asn351 side chain was manually adjusted to remove clashes and to point the side chain N-atom in the direction of the ATP. The simulations were performed with the GROMACS simulation package (37Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comp. Phys.

PTP-oc has been assumed to be a truncated variant of GLEPP1, resulting from alternative splicing. However, the 5′-untranslated region sequence of PTP-oc mRNA contains 217 bp from an intron of GLEPP1. There are no splicing acceptor sites at the PTP-oc transcription site.

To test the hypothesis that the PTP-oc gene has an alternative, tissue-specific, intronic promoter, the promoter activity of a 1.3-kb PCR fragment covering the 5′-flanking region of the PTP-oc gene was measured. The putative PTP-oc promoter fragment showed strong promoter activity in U937 cells. Mutation of the putative TATA box within the PTP-oc promoter abolished 60–90% of its promoter activity. The PTP-oc promoter fragment showed strong promoter activity in cells that express PTP-oc (U937 cells and RAW264.7 cells) but not in cells that do not express the enzyme (skin fibroblasts, TE85 cells, and HEK293 cells). These findings strongly support the conclusion that the 1.3-kb intronic fragment contains the tissue-specific, PTP-oc proximal promoter. Deletion and functional analyses indicate that the proximal 5′ sequence flanking the TATA box of the PTP-oc contains potential repressor elements. The removal of the putative repressor elements led to the apparent loss of tissue specificity. In summary, we conclude that an intronic promoter within the GLEPP1 gene drives the expression of the PTP-oc in a cell type-specific manner.

Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by the two opposing dynamic activities of PTK and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). Although PTKs are key regulators of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, recent work has documented that PTPs also have important regulatory functions in osteoclasts. Accordingly, motheaten mutant mice, which have a defective SHP1-PTP gene, showed elevated numbers of highly active osteoclasts and increased osteoclastic resorption (4Umeda S. Beamer W.G. Takagi K.

Inhibition of cellular PTP activities in osteoclasts (e.g. by bisphosphonates or PTP inhibitors) suppressed the bone resorption activity of osteoclasts in vitro (5Schmidt A. Rutledge S.J. Endo N.

We have cloned an osteoclastic transmembrane PTP, termed PTP-oc, from a rabbit osteoclast cDNA library (6Wu L.-W. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Biochem.

Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PTP-oc is structurally unique in that, unlike most transmembrane PTPs, it lacks an extracellular domain, does not have a signal peptide proximal to the N terminus, contains only a single PTP catalytic domain, and is relatively small (405 amino acid residues). With the exception of an additional 28 amino acids (residues 66–93) at the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of PTP-oc, PTP-oc shows complete sequence identity with the intracellular domain of a large renal receptor-like transmembrane PTP, termed GLEPP1 and also known as PTP-U2, PTPRO, or PTP-ϕ (6Wu L.-W.

By contrast, PTP-oc is expressed predominantly in several hematopoietic cell types (including B lymphocytes and cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, which are precursors of osteoclasts) and mature osteoclasts (6Wu L.-W.

Res. 2001; 16: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because GLEPP1 and PTP-oc are products of the same gene assigned to human chromosome 12p12-p13 (9Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wiggins R.C. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Wharram B.L. Thomas P.E. Genomics. 1995; 27: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it has generally been assumed that PTP-oc is a truncated variant of GLEPP1, resulting from an alternative splicing of the gene (11Aguiar R.C.T. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Tiwari S. Freeman G.J. Shipp M.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, PTP-oc has also been referred to as the PTP-U2S, PTPROt, or truncated PTP-ϕ. On the other hand, there is no direct evidence that PTP-oc is derived from alternative splicing of the GLEPP1 gene. When we analyzed the 5′-UTR of rabbit PTP-oc sequence in the context of the human GLEPP1 gene, we noticed that, although most of the 5′-UTR sequence is derived from a GLEPP1 coding exon, a 217 bp of the PTP-oc 5′-UTR is derived from intronic sequences of GLEPP1. Alignment of both the human GLEPP1 gene and rabbit PTP-oc cDNA sequences showed 92% homology between the rabbit and human sequences in the exonic region and >70% homology in this short intronic region. Since the PTP-oc sequence is rabbit and the intronic sequence is human, one does not expect this high degree of homology to exist in this intron between the two species. If alternate splicing occurs to generate PTP-oc, one would also not expect intronic remnants of GLEPP1 in the 5′-UTR of the PTP-oc mRNA. Analysis of the sequence around the PTP-oc mRNA transcription start site reveals no sequence homology compatible with a splicing acceptor site. These preliminary analyses raise the interesting hypothesis that PTP-oc may not have resulted from alternative splicing and that there could be a functional promoter within the GLEPP1 intron that initiates the expression of PTP-oc. Consequently, the objective of this study was to test whether there is an intronic promoter that drives the expression of PTP-oc in a cell type-specific manner. Cell Cultures—Human U937 promyelomonocytic leukemic cells (ATCC CRL-1593.2), obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A murine RAW264.7 macrophage clonal cell line, generously provided by Dr. S. Khosla of the Mayo Clinics, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human TE85 osteosarcoma cells, which exhibit osteoblastic characteristics (15Rhim J.S. Cho H.Y. Huebner R.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), were originally obtained from Dr. J. Fogh of Sloan-Kettering Institute (New York, NY) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Human skin fibroblasts were isolated from a human foreskin sample according to the method of Wergedal and Baylink (16Wergedal J.E. Baylink D.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1984; 176: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Human HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573), a permanent line of primary human embryonic kidney cells, were obtained from ATCC and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Cell media were changed every 2–3 days, and cells were passaged weekly. Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Plasmids Construction—The luciferase reporter assay system purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) was used to monitor the promoter activity. A 162-kb human genomic BAC clone RPCI11-320J20 (BACPAC Resource Center, Oakland, CA) contains the putative intronic PTP-oc promoter. Accordingly, to construct the 1.3-kb (–1037/+239) PTP-oc proximal promoter-luciferase (PTP-oc-Luc or p(–1037/+239)) reporter plasmid, the DNA fragment corresponding to the putative PTP-oc promoter was prepared by PCR using the high fidelity native Pfu DNA polymerase (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) with the genomic DNA from the RPCI11-320J20 BAC clone as the template and the following primer set: 5′-CTGTTATGTGAACCTAGCAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GATTTGGGTGGAGCTGGTTC-3′ (reverse primer). Several deletion PTP-oc-Luc reporter plasmids were also prepared using the same reverse primer and various forward primers shown in Table I. The PCR reactions were subjected to a hot start for 3 min at 94 °C prior to the addition of the polymerase followed by 35 amplification cycles: denaturing for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 59 °C, and extending for 2 min at 72 °C/cycle. The sequence of each PCR product of the promoter construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing and was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the promoterless pGL3-basic plasmid to generate the truncated promoter constructs.Table IForward oligonucleotide primers used in the PCR amplification of various PTP-oc promoter deletion constructsPTP-oc promoter deletion constructForward oligonucleotide primer sequencep(-738/+239) PTP-oc-LucGGACAGACAACACAGCTTCCp(-388/+239) PTP-oc-LucGTGTTCGCACTACTGCACTCp(-98/+239) PTP-oc-LucCAGGGCAATGCTAACTTCAGp(-33/+239) PTP-oc-LucCTGAAGTAGAAAACAGAAGTp(+9/+239) PTP-oc-LucAATGGAAGGGGGAAAAGGCA Open table in a new tab The genomic DNA of a 122-kb human BAC clone, RPCI11-365O10 (BACPAC Resource Center), which contains the putative proximal promoter of GLEPP1, was used as the template of the PCR amplification for the construction of the GLEPP1 promoter-luciferase (GLEPP1-Luc) reporter plasmid. A 1.2-kb XhoI-HindIII PCR fragment covering the 5′-flanking proximal region (–1154/+118) of human GLEPP1 gene was generated with the native Pfu DNA polymerase using the following primer sets: 5′-CTCGAGCCGTTGACACTTGGACAACA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AAGCTTGGCTCACAATGGCGAACTGG-3′ (reverse primer). The restriction sites (underlined) were added to facilitate subsequent cloning into the PGL3-basic vector. The PCR amplification was subjected to a hot start for 3 min at 94 °C prior to the addition of the polymerase followed by 35 amplification cycles: denaturing for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 62 °C, and extending for 4 min at 72 °C/cycle. The PCR product was purified after agarose gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the PCR product of the putative GLEPP1 promoter was confirmed by DNA sequencing and was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of pGL3-basic plasmid to generate the GLEPP1-Luc reporter plasmid. Construction of Mutated PTP-oc Promoter-Luciferase Plasmids—A site-specific mutation of the promoter was introduced to the putative TATA box (sequence position –78) by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the 1.3-kb PTP-oc promoter fragment as the template and a specific oligonucleotide primer containing the mutated TATA box in which TATAAA was mutated to TCGCGA. The sequence of the TATA-mutated PTP-oc promoter fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing, cut with XhoI and HindIII restriction enzymes, and cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of pGL3-basic plasmid to generate the TATA-mutated PTP-oc-Luc reporter plasmid. DNA Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Briefly, U937 cells (or the test cells) were plated for 24 h at 5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. One μg (for U937 cells) or 0.2 μg (for other test cell types) each of the PTP-oc-Luc, the GLEPP1-Luc, or the promoterless pGL3-basic plasmid was transiently transfected into the test cells with the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Two days after the transfection, cell extract was prepared, and the luciferase activity in the extract was determined using a kit purchased from Promega with the Analytical Scientific Instruments model 3010 luminometer (Richmond, CA) and was expressed as arbitrary light units. As an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency, cells in each transfection experiment were also transfected with the pGL3-control plasmid, which contains the luciferase gene driven by the SV40 promoter. The PTP-oc or GLEPP1 promoter activity was normalized against the SV40 promoter activity and was reported as the percentage of the promoter activity of pGL3-control. Each experiment was repeated at least once. In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid vector, and the transfection efficiency was also normalized against the β-galactosidase expression in these experiments. Identical results were obtained regardless of whether normalization was against the promoter activity of pGL3-control or against β-galactosidase expression. Functional Analysis of the Putative Repressor Elements—To confirm that segments of PTP-oc promoter indeed contain repressor elements, the DNA fragments containing putative repressor elements were cloned upstream to the SV40 promoter of the pGL3-control plasmid vector, in which the luciferase reporter gene expression is driven by the powerful SV40 promoter and the SV40 enhancer. If the inserted DNA fragment contains repressor elements, the SV40 promoter-driven luciferase expression should be abolished or markedly suppressed. Accordingly, we determined the effect of these putative repressor sequences on the SV40 promoter-driven luciferase expression. Briefly, three DNA fragments (i.e. –1037/–738; –738/–388; –388/–98) corresponding to three regions of the PTP-oc intronic promoter (identified from deletion analysis) that contain putative repressor elements were prepared and amplified by PCR using the 1.3-kb (–1037/+239) PTP-oc promoter-luciferase construct as the template and the following three respective sets of primers: a) for p(–1037′/–738′), 5′-GCTAGCGTGAACCTAGCAGCAAGGTA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGATCTAGGAAGCTGTGTTGTCTGTC-3′ (reverse primer); b) for p(–738/–388), 5′-GCTAGCGGACAGACAACACAGCTTCC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGATCTCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGTAGTG-3′ (reverse primer); and c) for p(–388/–98), 5′-GCTAGCGTGTTCGCACTACTGCACTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGATCTGAAGTTAGCATTGCCCTGAT-3′ (reverse primer). The NheI (forward primers) and BglII (reverse primers) restriction sites, respectively (underlined), were added to facilitate subsequent cloning into the NheI/BglII cloning sites immediately upstream to the SV40 promoter of the pGL3-control vector. The PCR amplification was performed with an initial hot start for 5 min at 94 °C followed by 35 amplification cycles, each consisting of 94 °C for 30 s (denaturing), 57 °C for 1 min (annealing), and 72 °C for 2 min (extension). Each PCR product was gel-purified, digested with NheI and BglII, and cloned into the PGL3-control plasmid vector at the NheI and BglII sites. Each of the resulting repressor-pGL3-control plasmid vectors was used to transiently transfect U937 cells or RAW264.7 cells, and the luciferase activity was determined as described above. Statistical Analysis—Results are shown as mean ± S.D. of 4–8 replicates. Statistical significance was determined with two-tailed Student's t test, and the difference was significant when p < 0.05. Genomic Structure of the GLEPP1/PTP-oc Gene—The genomic structure of GLEPP1 or that of the PTP-oc gene has not been determined previously. Thus, we first performed a BLAST search of the rabbit PTP-oc cDNA sequence (accession number U32587) against the GenBank™ human genomic data base and identified a 162-kb human BAC clone RPCI11-320J20 (accession number AC007542), which contains the entire PTP-oc gene and most of the GLEPP1 genomic sequences (missing exon 1 and part of intron 1). Further BLAST searches of the human GLEPP1 cDNA sequence (accession number U20489) against human genomic data base reveal that a 122-kb human BAC clone RPCI11-365O10 (accession number AC022334) contains exon 1 and the major part of the intron 1 of GLEPP1. The intron 1 of GLEPP1 turns out to be very large and is 160 kb in length, and the majority of the intron 1 sequences have been identified within the reverse sequence of a 160-kb human BAC clone RPCI116K23 (accession number AC092183). Comparison and analysis of the sequences of the three human BAC clones with the cDNA sequences of GLEPP1 and PTP-oc allow us to determine the genomic structure of both GLEPP1 and PTP-oc (Fig. 1). Accordingly, the GLEPP1/PTP-oc gene contains 27 exons spanning over 223 kb. (The boxes represent coding exons, and the lines between the boxes are the introns.) Exon 17, which corresponds to the unique region of residues 66–93 of PTP-oc (6Wu L.-W. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), is not expressed in the kidney GLEPP1 mRNA (10Wiggins R.C. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Wharram B.L. Thomas P.E. Genomics. 1995; 27: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) but is expressed in the mRNA of brain GLEPP1 isoform (17Tagawa M. Shirasawa T. Yahagi Y. Tomoda T. Kuroyanagi H. Fujimura S. Sakiyama S. Maruyama N. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By contrast, the PTP-oc gene spans ∼56 kb encoded by 15 exons (corresponding to exon 13–27 of the GLEPP1 gene). Intriguingly, the PTP-oc mRNA transcription start site is located at the last 217 bases of intron 12 of GLEPP1. Accordingly, the first exon of the PTP-oc gene contains the 217-bp intronic sequence of intron 12 of GLEPP1. The start codon of the PTP-oc gene begins from the last 4 bases of exon 14 of GLEPP1. The stop codon of both genes is located near the end of exon 26. To test whether PTP-oc is an alternative spliced variant, we searched the sequence at and around the transcription start site of PTP-oc for potential splicing acceptor sites by the Splice Site Prediction software program by Neural Network of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html). Although the program accurately predicted the location of a splice acceptor site at the intron 12/exon 13 junction of GLEPP1 (Fig. 2), no potential alternative splicing acceptor and/or donor sites were found at or around the PTP-oc transcription start site, a finding that is incompatible with the premise that PTP-oc is a product of an alternative splicing. Analysis of the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the PTP-oc gene within the GLEPP1 intron 12 for transcriptional elements with the Transcription Element Search Software on the World Wide Web (TESS, Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess) using stringent sequence requirements reveals a TATA box near the PTP-oc transcription start site (consistent with the notion being a promoter) and at least 11 potential promoter elements, many of which (e.g. TATA box, CAT box) are essential for transcriptional initiation (Fig. 2). These findings support the interpretation that intron 12 of GLEPP1 could contain an intronic promoter for PTP-oc. Consistent with the possibility that the intronic sequence contains the proximal promoter for PTP-oc, analysis of the intronic sequence for eukaryotic transcription promoter with the Neural Network Promoter Prediction software program of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html) accurately predicted the transcription start site of PTP-oc within the intronic fragment with a score of 0.94 out of a maximum of 1.0. Basal Promoter Activity of Putative PTP-oc Proximal Promoter Fragment—To determine whether intron 12 of the GLEPP1 gene contains a proximal promoter for PTP-oc and to compare the promoter activity of the putative PTP-oc proximal promoter with that of the putative GLEPP1 proximal promoter, we prepared, by PCR, a 1.3-kb DNA fragment (–1037/+239) corresponding to the intronic sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the human PTP-oc transcription start site and a 1.2-kb DNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-flanking region (–1154/+118) of the GLEPP1 transcription start site and cloned it into pGL-3 basic plasmid to generate the PTP-oc-Luc and GLEPP1-Luc reporter plasmid, respectively. The two promoter reporter constructs were then used in transient transfections of human promyelomonocytic U937 cells for monitoring the promoter activity of respective reporter plasmids. U937 cells were used because these cells express both GLEPP1 and PTP-oc proteins (18Seimiya H. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21187-21193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that both the PTP-oc-Luc and the GLEPP1-Luc plasmids exhibited relatively strong basal promoter activity in human U937 cells. Interestingly, the promoter activity of both PTP-oc-Luc and GLEPP1-Luc reporter plasmids was similar and was each ∼15–25% of the promoter activity of the SV40-driven pGL3-control (SV40 promoter driven plasmid). When the putative TATA box (sequence –78) of the PTP-oc-Luc promoter construct was mutated, the TATA-mutated reporter construct lost 60–90% of the basal promoter activity as compared with the wild type PTP-oc-Luc construct (Fig. 3B), suggesting that this putative TATA box was probably a functional regulatory element and supporting the contention that this 1.3-kb intronic fragment might contain a proximal promoter that drives the expression of PTP-oc in U937 cells. Deletion Analysis of the Putative PTP-oc Proximal Promoter Fragment—To further characterize the putative intronic PTP-oc promoter fragment, we initiated deletion analysis in which several deletion promoter reporter constructs, i.e. p(–738/+239), p(–388/+239), p(–98/+239), p(–33/+239), and p(+9/+239), were prepared. The basal promoter activity of the deletion constructs were assessed and compared with that of the full-length PTP-oc-Luc construct (i.e. p(–1037/+239)). The deletion analysis was performed in two cell types that are known to express PTP-oc, namely U937 cells (Fig. 4, top panel) and RAW264.7 cells, an osteoclast precursor cell line (19Hotokezaka H. Sakai E. Kanaoka K. Saito K. Matsuo K. Kitaura H. Yoshida N. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47366-47372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, bottom panel). In both cell lines, the deletion of the distal 300 bp of the 5′ promoter sequences (i.e. –1037 to –738)) slightly reduced the basal promoter activity. However, further deletion of 5′ promoter sequences distal to the TATA box (i.e. –738 to –98) markedly enhanced (by 4–5-fold) the promoter activity of the putative PTP-oc intronic promoter in both cell types. This raises the possibility that there are repressor sequences for binding of repressive transcription factors within –738 and –98 of the promoter to suppress the basal PTP-oc promoter activity. Deletion of the TATA box and the removal of the PTP-oc transcription start site greatly or completely abolished the promoter activity, further supporting the conclusion that the putative TATA box is functional in PTP-oc gene transcriptional regulation. Functional Analysis of the Putative Repressor Sequences of the PTP-oc Intronic Promoter—To further assess whether the PTP-oc promoter sequence –738 to –98 indeed contains repressor sequences, we cloned each of the three pieces of DNA sequences corresponding to three regions of the PTP-oc intronic promoter that may contain repressor sequences (identified from deletion analysis) immediately upstream to the SV40 promoter of the pGL3-control plasmid to produce three repressor-Luc reporter constructs (i.e. p(–1037/–738), p(–738/–388), and p(–388/–98)). The U937 cells (Fig. 5, top panel) or RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 5, bottom panel) were then transiently transduced with these repressor-reporter constructs, along with the pGL3-control (positive control) and pGL3-basic (negative control), and the effect of each repressor sequence on the SV40 promoter activity was determined. Fig. 5 shows that the insertion of the DNA sequence –738/–388 almost completely abolished the SV40 promoter activity in U937 cells and RAW264.7 cells (by 97 and 94%, respectively). Similarly, the sequence –388 to –98 also greatly suppressed the SV40 promoter activity (by 90 and 86%, respectively) in U937 cells and RAW264.7 cells. In contrast, the distal sequence (from –1037 to –738) could only partially suppress the SV40 promoter activity (by 61 and 64% in U937 cells and RAW264.7 cells, respectively). These findings support our conclusion of the presence of repressor sequences for binding of repressive transcription factors within –738 and –98 of the promoter to suppress the basal PTP-oc promoter activity.

Thus, we investigated whether the putative intronic PTP-oc promoter is regulated in a cell type-specific manner by first assessing the basal promoter activity of the 1.3-kb putative PTP-oc promoter reporter plasmid (p(–1037/+239)) in U937 cells (cells that express PTP-oc) and in human skin fibroblasts (cells that do not express PTP-oc). Fig. 6 shows that the 1.3-kb putative PTP-oc promoter was highly active in U937 cells but not at all active in human skin fibroblasts. To further evaluate the tissue specificity of the putative PTP-oc intronic promoter, we compared the promoter activity of the 1.3-kb PTP-oc promoter construct to that of the putative GLEPP1 promoter (GLEPP1-Luc) in other cells that express PTP-oc (U937 cells and RAW264.7 cells), that do not express PTP-oc (human TE85 osteosarcoma cells), and that express GLEPP1 primarily (HEK293 cells) (Fig. 7). Because we postulate that the putative repressor elements within the PTP-oc promoter play an important role in the cell type specificity of PTP-oc expression, we also measured the relative promoter activity of the p(–98/+239) deletion construct, which appears to be devoid of repressive elements, in these cell types. As shown previously, the 1.3-kb PTP-oc promoter (p(–1037/+239)) also showed strong promoter activity in RAW264.7 cells, which express PTP-oc. The 1.3-kb PTP-oc-Luc construct had no appreciable promoter activity in cell types that do not express PTP-oc (i.e. TE85 cells and HEK293 cells). Conversely, the truncated p(–98/+239) promoter construct showed relatively strong basal promoter activity in each test cell type. Interestingly and unexpectedly, the p(–1154/+118) GLEPP1-Luc plasmid did not exhibit the anticipated cell type specificity and showed appreciable promoter activity in each of the test cell types.Fig. 7Cell type specificity of the 1.3-kb putative PTP-oc intronic promoter (p(–1037/+239)), the truncated PTP-oc promoter (p(–98/+239)), and the 1.2-kb putative GLEPP1 promoter (GLEPP1-Luc) in U937 cells (top left panel), RAW264.7 cells (top right panel), TE85 cells (bottom left panel), and HEK293 cells (bottom right panel).

N.S., not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presumption that PTP-oc is an alternative spliced truncated variant of GLEPP1 has primarily been based on the fact that PTP-oc and GLEPP1 share the same gene in human chromosome 12p12-p13 (9Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wiggins R.C. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Wharram B.L. Thomas P.E. Genomics. 1995; 27: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, this study presented several pieces of compelling evidence that the PTP-oc gene is probably not a product of alternative splicing and has its own promoter. First, the 5′-UTR sequence of PTP-oc contains a 217-bp sequence of intron 12 of GLEPP1. It would be highly unusual for alternatively spliced gene products to have intronic remanants in the 5′-UTR. Second, there are no potential splice acceptor sites at or around the PTP-oc transcription start site. The lack of splicing acceptor at the PTP-oc transcription start site is inconsistent with the presumption that PTP-oc is an alternative spliced gene product. Third, the fact that there are consensus sequences within the putative PTP-oc promoter fragment for a number of potential transcription promoter elements, including those essential for transcription (i.e. TATA box and CAT boxes), is supportive of the possibility that PTP-oc gene expression is driven by its own proximal promoter. Moreover, the transcription start site of PTP-oc mRNA is the predicted transcription start site of a promoter, based on computer analysis of putative promoters. However, two additional important observations of this study afford the strongest pieces of evidence for the existence of the intronic promoter for PTP-oc: 1) The 1.3-kb intronic DNA fragment of GLEPP1 gene proximal to 5′ end of the transcription start site of PTP-oc exhibited basal promoter activity in cell types that are known to express PTP-oc, e.g. U937 cells and RAW264.7 cells. The basal promoter activity of this putative promoter fragment appeared to be relatively strong in that it was greater than 30% of that of the powerful viral SV40 promoter. 2) More importantly, mutation of the putative TATA box of this promoter fragment drastically reduced the basal promoter activity, indicating that the TATA box of the putative PTP-oc intronic promoter is functional. Consequently, these findings led us to conclude that PTP-oc is probably not an alternative spliced product of the GLEPP1 gene, but rather, it has its own intronic promoter to drive its gene expression. Expression of PTP-oc and GLEPP1 is tissue- and cell type-specific in that PTP-oc expression appears to be restricted to cells of osteoclast lineage whereas GLEPP1 is expressed predominantly in the kidney and brain (6Wu L.-W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27339-27347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our findings that the 1.3-kb intronic PTP-oc promoter fragment exhibited strong basal promoter activity only in cell types that express PTP-oc (i.e. U-937 cells and RAW264.7 cells) but not in those cell types that do not express the enzyme (i.e. human skin fibroblasts, TE85 osteosarcoma cells, and HEK293 cells) provide strong evidence for the conclusion that the putative intronic PTP-oc promoter indeed functions in a cell type-specific manner. In addition, the promoter deletion and functional analyses of this study strongly suggest that the putative PTP-oc intronic promoter could be controlled by repressors, since deletion of 5′ sequences distal to the TATA box greatly enhanced the basal promoter activity and since insertion of DNA sequences corresponding to the putative repressor sequences into the pGL3-control plasmid vector almost completely blocked the SV40 promoter activity in U937 and RAW264.7 cells. Tissue-specific genes are frequently silenced in non-expressing cells by binding of the repressors to repressive elements within their promoters and are activated in expressing cells by the removal of the repressive effects of the repressors through enhancers (20Matsui T. Sashihara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1961-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Jones F.S. Meech R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fact that the removal of sequences containing the putative repressor elements (i.e. 5′ sequences distal to the TATA box) led to the complete loss of cell type specificity supports strongly the concept that repressor elements within the PTP-oc promoter could have a major role in allowing the promoter to exhibit cell type specificity. Consequently, the possibility of the repressive elements within the promoter provides strong, albeit circumstantial, evidence for the notion that this putative PTP-oc intronic promoter is a tissue-specific promoter. Two observations of the putative proximal promoter of GLEPP1 (i.e. the 1.2-kb DNA fragment covering the 5′-flanking region of GLEPP1 transcription start site) are noteworthy. First, the putative GLEPP1 promoter, unlike the PTP-oc promoter, does not contain a TATA box near the transcription start site. Thus, GLEPP1 promoter belongs to the family of promoters that do not involve the binding of TFIID to TATA box for enhancement of gene transcription. Second, although the 1.2-kb putative GLEPP1 promoter fragment showed relatively strong basal promoter activity, it did not exhibit the anticipated tissue specificity for renal cells (i.e. HEK293 cells) since this promoter fragment was active for all test cell types. However, we cannot rule out the likely possibility that this 1.2-kb fragment does not contain the entire GLEPP1 proximal promoter and that upstream transcriptional elements are required for the tissue specificity of the promoter. The concept that PTP-oc gene transcription is controlled by an osteoclast-specific, intronic promoter is intriguing and noteworthy. Although there are some examples that certain genes, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (22Barber M.C. Travers M.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or p45 NF-E2 transcription factor (23Moroni E. Mastrangelo T. Razzini R. Cairns L. Moi P. Ottolenghi S. Giglioni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10567-10576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), use intronic alternative promoters to regulate tissue- or cell type-restricted gene expression, the GLEPP1/PTP-oc gene system, to our knowledge, is one of the very few, if not the only, systems in which two distinct gene products, each of which has important function in different tissues (i.e. kidney and bone, respectively), are derived from the same gene through the use of intronic promoters rather than alternative splicing. In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that the expression of a structurally unique osteoclastic protein-tyrosine phosphatase is driven by an intronic, cell type-specific promoter. These findings, in general, support our view that PTP-oc has important cell type-specific functions in cells of osteoclast lineage. If the hypothesis that a cell type-specific, intronic promoter drives the expression of PTP-oc is confirmed, targeted disruption of this PTP-oc promoter should block basal, as well as stimulated, PTP-oc transcription without affecting the GLEPP1 gene transcription. This possibility is exciting because the most direct approach to confirm the physiological function of PTP-oc is to evaluate the effect of knocking out PTP-oc gene expression on osteoclast differentiation and resorption. Because GLEPP1 and PTP-oc share parts of the same gene, the commonly used approaches for producing knockout animals (e.g. interruption of exons coding for important portions of PTP-oc) would also knock out GLEPP1 gene expression. Consequently, we believe that it would be feasible to create PTP-oc knockout mice that maintain normal GLEPP1 expression by targeted disruption of this intronic promoter. We thank Drs. Donna Strong and Tom Linkhart for discussion and suggestions."

Although SCCA2 inhibits serine proteinases such as cathepsin G and mast cell chymase, SCCA1 targets cysteine proteinases such as cathepsin S, K, L, and papain. SCCA1 is therefore called a cross-class serpin. The inhibitory mechanism of the standard serpins is well characterized; those use a suicide substrate-like inhibitory mechanism during which an acyl-enzyme intermediate by a covalent bond is formed, and this complex is stable against hydrolysis. However, the inhibitory mechanism of cross-class serpins remains unresolved. In this article, we analyzed the inhibitory mechanism of SCCA1 on a cysteine proteinase, papain. SCCA1 interacted with papain at its reactive site loop, which was then cleaved, as the standard serpins. However, gel-filtration analyses showed that SCCA1 did not form a covalent complex with papain, in contrast to other serpins. Interaction with SCCA1 severely impaired the proteinase activity of papain, probably by inducing conformational change. The decreased, but still existing, proteinase activity of papain was completely inhibited by SCCA1 according to the suicide substrate-like inhibitory mechanism; however, papain recovered its proteinase activity with the compromised level, when all of intact SCCA1 was cleaved. These results suggest that the inhibitory mechanism of SCCA1 is unique among the serpin superfamily in that SCCA1 performs its inhibitory activity in two ways, contributing the suicide substrate-like mechanism without formation of a covalent complex and causing irreversible impairment of the catalytic activity of a proteinase.

Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The exposed RSL of the serpin is recognized by the proteinase, and an initial non-covalent Michaelis encounter complex is formed. Then, in the inhibitory pathway, a “bait” peptide bond (P1-P1′) that mimics the normal substrate of the proteinase is attacked by the active serine residue of the proteinase, subsequently forming an acyl-enzyme intermediate linked by an oxy-ester bond. In the cleaved form, the P side of the RSL inserts into the body of the protein, which dramatically changes the conformations of the serpin and the proteinase, making it impossible for the ester bond to hydrolyze (3Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). In the non-inhibitory or substrate pathways, the serpin is cleaved by the proteinase just as the substrate of the proteinase after the Michaelis encounter complex is formed. It has been revealed that the serpins are involved in various kinds of biological functions: fibrinolysis, coagulation, inflammation, tumor cell invasion, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis (1Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

The squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) 1 (SERPINB3) and SCCA2 (SEPINB4) belong to the ovalbumin-serpin family, and these proteins are 91% identical at the amino acid level (4Schick C. Kamachi Y.

Both genes locate at 18q21.3 very closely, generating a cluster of serpins together with plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 and maspin, suggesting that either the SERPINB3 or the SEPINB4 gene could arise from the other by gene duplication (5Schneider S.S.

SCCA1 was originally purified from squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix (6Kato H. Torigoe T. Cancer (Phila.). 1977; 40: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), and it turned out later that SCCA1 and SCCA2 were co-expressed broadly in normal tissues: the epithelium of tongue, tonsil, esophagus, uterine cervix, vagina, and the conducting airways; Hassall's corpuscles of the thymus; and some areas of the skin (7Cataltepe S.

The biological functions of SCCA1 and SCCA2 still remain obscure. It has been reported that these proteins confer resistance against tumor necrosis factor-α- or radiation-inducing apoptosis (8Suminami Y. Nagashima S. Vujanovic N.L. Hirabayashi K. Kato H.

We have recently shown that expression of both SCCA1 and SCCA2 is up-regulated by two related Th2-type cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, in bronchial epithelial cells and that SCCA expression is also augmented in bronchial lesions and in peripheral blood of bronchial asthma patients (11Yuyama N.

These results shed light on the probable novel pathophysiological roles of SCCA1 and SCCA2. Although SCCA1 and SCCA2 are very homologous, SCCA1 has unique properties as a serpin; SCCA1 inhibits cysteine proteinases such as cathepsin K, L, S, and papain, whereas SCCA2 inhibits serine proteinases such as cathepsin G and human mast cell chymase (HMC) (4Schick C.

Although target proteinases for most serpins are the chymotrypsin family, very few serpins inhibit cysteine proteinases: for example, cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) produced by cowpox virus and proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI9, SERPINB9) are known to inhibit caspase proteins (cysteine proteinases) (14Komiyama T.

Such a proteinase inhibitor is defined as a cross-class inhibitor, and thus far, CrmA, PI9, and SCCA1 are all obvious cross-class serpins (1Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C.

The specificities of SCCA1 and SCCA2 are due to a difference in the RSL sequences because only 7 amino acid residues among 13 (54%) were identical in the RSL regions (P7 to P6′)of these proteins (17Luke C.

SCCA2 employs the typical suicide substrate-like inhibitory mechanism of the serpins. Through this mechanism, SCCA2 and serine proteinases are linked by the covalent oxy-ester bond, which is SDS-resistant (4Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A.

It has not yet been answered how cysteine proteinases lose their catalytic activities, although the thiol-ester bonds between the cross-class serpins and cysteine proteinases are unstable. In this article, we analyze the inhibitory mechanism of SCCA1 on papain. To retain the native association between SCCA1 and papain, we used gel-filtration system analyses. It turned out that the association between SCCA1 and papain was non-covalent and that the interaction with SCCA1 severely impaired the proteinase activity of papain. These results indicated the unique inhibitory mechanism of SCCA1 among the serpin superfamily. Materials—Papain, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chicken ovalbumin were purchased from Sigma.

SCCA2 mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, using two complementary primers (Proligo Japan, Kyoto, Japan), designed to introduce a single codon mutation by substituting for the corresponding SCCA1 residue at the RSL. Standard PCR amplification was performed using the SCCA2 cDNA as a template and a mixture of primers. Resulting amplified fragments were treated with DpnI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Isolated plasmid DNAs were digested with StuI/XbaI and then ligated into the StuI/XbaI site of the pGEX-KG-SCCA2 plasmid. The RSL replacement mutants of SCCA1 and SCCA2 were similarly generated by digestion and ligation into their StuI/XbaI site. Glutathione S transferase (GST)-fused SCCA1 and SCCA2 proteins were expressed in an Escherichia coli strain, BL21, and isolated by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Purity of the generated proteins was greater than 95% as estimated by SYPRO Ruby staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Concentrations of the proteins were determined by Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Enzyme Assays—The substrates used for enzyme assays of papain and cathepsin L were benzoyl-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Bz-Arg-MCA) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-methylcoumarin (Z-FR-MCA), respectively, and succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-methylcoumarin (Suc-AAPF-MCA) was used for cathepsin G and HMC, all purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. The molar concentrations of papain were determined by active site titration with E-64. The indicated concentration of each enzyme was incubated with indicated concentrations of GST-fused SCCA1 or SCCA2 for 30 min at 25 °C in activity-measuring buffer. The buffer was composed of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin for papain, or 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.001% bovine serum albumin for cathepsin L, or phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.001% bovine serum albumin for cathepsin G and HMC as described previously (4Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1849-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Upon addition of the substrate to the reaction mixture, the residual enzyme activity was measured by continuous monitoring using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Separation of the Incubated SCCA1 and Papain—After the indicated concentrations of papain and 54 μm GST-fused SCCA1 were incubated in the acetate reaction buffer for 30 min at 25 °C, the reaction mixture was applied to a high pressure-liquid chromatography system equipped with ProteinPak 300SW (Waters, Milford, MA). Then, the subjected samples were eluted with the acetate buffer (50 mm sodium acetate; pH 5.5), and each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE or the enzyme assay. The amounts of the proteins on the gels were estimated by protein assay. Western Blotting—The samples were applied to SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blotted by either anti-papain polyclonal antibody (Ab) (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) or anti-GST monoclonal Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Amino Acid Sequencing Analysis—The reaction mixture was applied to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R250 in 50% methanol, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Amino acid sequence analysis of the transferred peptides was performed using an Applied Biosystems 477A/120A protein sequencer (ABI Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Matrix-associated Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Papain (4.5 μm) and 36 μm GST-fused SCCA1 were mixed in the acetate reaction buffer for 30 min at 25 °C, and 18 μm E-64 was added to stop the reaction. Then, the reactive samples were applied to Voyager RP MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Chemical Cross-linking of Papain and SCCA1—Fifty-five μm GST-fused SCCA1 and 12 μm papain were incubated in the acetate reaction buffer for 5 min at 25 °C followed by incubation with 20 μm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, Pierce) for 30 min at 25 °C. The reacted samples were applied to SDS-PAGE. Chemical Modification of the Cysteine Residues of Papain—Eluted papain (0.4 μm) was incubated with 77 μm EZ-Link PEO-maleimide activated biotin {(+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3, 6-dioxaoctanediamine} (PEO-M-biotin, Pierce) for 2 h at 25 °C. The samples were applied to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Expression and Purification of Functional SCCA1 and SCCA2—To perform functional analyses of SCCA1 and SCCA2, we expressed and purified recombinant proteins of GST-fused SCCA1 and SCCA2. Purity of these two proteins was more than 95%, as estimated by SYPRO Ruby staining (Fig. 1A). We first confirmed proteinase-inhibitory effects of these two proteins. We examined the inhibitory effects of SCCA1 and SCCA2 on papain, cathepsin L, cathepsin G, and HMC. The Km and k cat values of papain used in the experiments were estimated as 23.8 ± 2.29 μm and 7.95 ± 0.218 s–1 (mean ± S.D., n = 3), respectively, which were compatible with those reported in the literature (20Melo R.L. Barbosa Pozzo R.C. Alves L.C. Perissutti E. Caliendo G. Santagada V. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SCCA1 inhibited cysteine proteinase activities of papain and cathepsin L but not the serine proteinase activities of cathepsin G and HMC, whereas SCCA2 showed the opposite effects (Fig. 1B), as reported previously (4Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1849-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Bromme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). SCCA1 inhibited the catalytic activity of papain in a dose-dependent manner, and the stoichiometry of inhibition value was estimated as 4.6 ± 0.1 at 10 nm SCCA1 (n = 3, Fig. 1B). It has been demonstrated that SCCA2 and cathepsin G form an SDS-resistant complex by a covalent bond (4Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1849-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We next analyzed how SCCA1 generated a complex with papain similar to that done by SCCA2 with cathepsin G. SCCA2 formed an SDS-resistant complex with cathepsin G but not with papain, whereas SCCA1 did not show any formation of a complex with either papain or cathepsin G (Fig. 1C). These results raised a possibility that SCCA1 performs its proteinase-inhibitory activity without generation of a covalent bond. Non-covalent Bond of SCCA1 and Papain—Although an SDS-resistant complex between SCCA1 and papain was not detected, it would be possible that the covalent bond between these two proteins is unstable to SDS, like the complex between chymotrypsin and α2-antiplasmin (21Enghild J.J. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To retain the native association between SCCA1 and papain, we employed a gel-filtration system. We subjected three different samples, whose I0/E0 ratios were 4.2, 5, and 6, for this analysis. It was confirmed that proteinase activities of papain were completely inhibited in the samples of I0/E0 = 6 and 5, but not 4.2 (data not shown). When these samples were applied to the gel-filtration column, most SCCA1 and papain were eluted according to their molecular weights (Fig. 2, A–C). However, an additional peak with a faster retention time was detected in the samples of I0/E0 = 6 and 5, but not 4.2, on the chart, although it was not detected when SCCA1 alone was applied (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Together with this peak on the chart, a band of low molecular weight the same as papain appeared on the SDS-PAGE gel in the samples of I0/E0 = 6 and 5, but not 4.2, as discussed later (Fig. 2, A–C). These results demonstrated that SCCA1 inhibited the catalytic activity of papain without forming a covalent bond. Determination of the Cleavage Site in SCCA1 and Loss of Its Inhibitory Effect—It has been shown that the inhibitory serpins exert their activities by the suicide substrate-like inhibitory mechanism, in which the serpins interact with their target proteinases at their RSLs, which are then cleaved (2Ye S. Goldsmith E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether SCCA1 also used the inhibitory mechanism against papain as other serpins do. When papain-treated SCCA1 was eluted from the gel-filtration column, doublet bands appeared with molecular sizes of 62 and 55 kDa (Fig. 2, A–C). Both bands were recognized by anti-GST Ab, indicating that the upper and lower bands corresponded to intact and C-terminal truncated SCCA1, respectively (data not shown). We then determined the cleavage site of SCCA1 by papain, using amino acid sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. When we applied the visible band of <10 kDa to the amino acid sequencing, two sequences derived from SCCA1 were read out; the major one started at Ser-354, and the minor one started at Phe-352 (Fig. 3A). The measurement of papain-cleaved peptides in SCCA1 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry also revealed the existence of the peptide corresponding from Ser-354 to the C terminus and the peptide from Phe-352 to the C terminus, which was less than the peptide starting at Ser-354 (Fig. 3B). These results clearly demonstrated that the bond between Gly-353 and Ser-354 was the main cleavage site of SCCA1 and that the one between Gly-351 and Phe-352 was minor, as reported previously (13Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Bromme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The intensities of the upper bands corresponding to intact SCCA1 became weaker as the I0/E0 ratio dropped, and those of the lower bands corresponding to truncated SCCA1 and of more degraded bands showed the opposite tendency (Fig. 2, A–C). If SCCA1 used the suicide mechanism, the inhibitory actions in these solutions would be parallel to the amount of intact SCCA1, irrespective of the amount of truncated SCCA1. To explore this possibility, after papain-treated SCCA1 was eluted by the gel-filtration column, we analyzed its inhibitory activity on freshly prepared papain. Consequently, the inhibitory activity of papain-treated SCCA1 increased parallel to the amount of intact SCCA (Fig. 4), which clearly supported the finding that the inhibitory manner of SCCA1 fit the suicide mechanism. Association of Truncated SCCA1 and Papain—Although SCCA1 and papain did not form a covalent complex (Fig. 2, A–C), it was possible that the truncated SCCA1 would associate with papain non-covalently in the solution. Actually, an additional peak with a faster retention time than monomers or dimers of SCCA1 was detected by gel-filtration analysis, and a band of the same low molecular weight as papain appeared on the SDS-PAGE gel in the fractions corresponding to this peak (Fig. 2). It was reasonable to think that this fraction would correspond to co-migration of SCCA1-associated papain and truncated SCCA1. To explore this possibility, we first examined whether the new peak was composed of SCCA1 and papain. Western blotting showed that the fractions corresponding to the peak with a faster retention time indicated the existence of papain (Fig. 5A). Both the peak on the chart and the band corresponding to papain in the Western blotting disappeared in the presence of an irreversible cysteine proteinase inhibitor, E-64 (Fig. 5, B and C). However, surprisingly, the molecular size of the complex was estimated as about 1100 kDa, judging from the retention time of the gel-filtration column (Fig. 5D), which is far larger than ∼90 kDa, the expected molecular size of the 1:1 complex of papain and GST-fused SCCA1. These results suggested that although SCCA1 and papain formed a non-covalent complex dependent on the proteinase activity of papain, this complex was a huge molecule composed of several oligomers of SCCA1 and papain. Although it was confirmed that papain and SCCA1 generated the relatively firmly associated complex of very large molecular weight, it was still possible that SCCA1-treated papain and truncated SCCA1 would form a transient, more loosely associated complex at 1:1 stoichiometry. To confirm the existence of such a complex, we next chemically cross-linked these two molecules by BS3, which elicited the appearance of a 97-kDa band corresponding to a 1:1 complex composed of papain and truncated SCCA1 in the absence of E-64 (Fig. 6). This complex was recognized by both anti-papain and anti-GST Abs. A much fainter band with a bigger molecular size corresponding to the complex composed of papain and intact SCCA1 appeared in the presence of E-64. These results clearly suggested that SCCA1-treated papain and truncated SCCA1 formed a 1:1 complex dependent on the proteinase activity of papain in the reaction solution. Preference of Amino Acids in RSL of SCCA1 for Papain—It is reasonable to assume that the distinct properties of SCCA1 and SCCA2 regarding the inhibitory effects on papain are due to the differences of their RSL sequences because only 7 amino acid residues among 13 (54%) are identical in the RSL regions (P7 to P6′) of these proteins (17Luke C. Schick C. Tsu C. Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bromme D. Juliano L. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7081-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Actually, swapping the RSL of SCCA1 for that of SCCA2, or vice versa, revealed that the inhibitory effect on papain was dependent on the RSL of SCCA1 (SCCA1 RSL2, SCCA2 RSL1: Table I). We then exchanged each amino acid specific for the RSL of SCCA2 with that corresponding to SCCA1 and analyzed its inhibitory effect on papain (Table I). When Glu-353 was replaced with Gly, the mutated type showed the inhibitory effect at the same level as native SCCA1 (SCCA2 mut3). However, when Val-351, Val-352, or Leu-354 was replaced with Gly, Phe, or Ser, respectively, none of the mutated types exhibited the inhibitory effect (SCCA2 mut1, SCCA2 mut2, SCCA2 mut4). Furthermore, switching of both Ser-356 and Pro-357 with Pro and Thr, respectively, also did not recover the inhibitory activity (SCCA2 mut5). These results demonstrated that Gly-353 was critical for SCCA1 to ex"

It also clears mischarged tRNAAla using a specialized domain in its C-terminal half. In contrast to full-length tRNAAla, minihelixAla was robustly mischarged and could not be edited. Addition in trans of the missing anticodon-containing domain did not activate editing of mischarged minihelixAla. To understand these differences between minihelixAla and tRNAAla, several chimeric full tRNAs were constructed. These had the acceptor stem of a non-cognate tRNA replaced with the stem of tRNAAla. The chimeric tRNAs collectively introduced multiple sequence changes in all parts but the acceptor stem. However, although the acceptor stem in isolation (as the minihelix) lacked determinants for editing, alanyl-tRNA synthetase effectively cleared a mischarged amino acid from each chimeric tRNA. Thus, a covalently continuous two-domain structure per se, not sequence, is a major determinant for clearance of errors of aminoacylation by alanyl-tRNA synthetase. Because errors of aminoacylation are known to be deleterious to cell growth, structure-specific determinants constitute a powerful selective pressure to retain the format of the two-domain L-shaped tRNA.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are ancient proteins that establish the rules of the genetic code through aminoacylation reactions, in which a specific amino acid is joined to its cognate tRNA (1Lapointe J.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The tRNA, in turn, harbors the anticodon triplet of the code that corresponds to the attached amino acid. Each amino acid has its own specific tRNA synthetase, so that a total of 20 enzymes are responsible for all of the aminoacylation reactions. In bacteria, a single gene typically encodes these 20 enzymes, whereas in eukaryotes, separate genes usually code for cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms. Because living systems are based on the genetic code, and because tRNA synthetases are key components of the code and only have single genes, a mutation that disrupts aminoacylation activity of any synthetase results in cell death (6Anderson J.J. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schimmel P.R. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 601-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The existence of single-copy genes is believed to reflect, in part, the result of selective pressure against any gene proliferations that could result in corruption of the code (8Lovato M.A. Chihade J.W. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4846-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For example, were the gene for a specific synthetase to be duplicated, one of the two copies could absorb mutations that might make possible new amino acid or tRNA specificities, whereas the other copy continued to maintain cell growth through the normal aminoacylation reaction. This circumstance could create genetic code ambiguities that, in turn, would place the organism at a selective disadvantage. Genetic code ambiguity can also be caused by misacylation reactions caused by the inherent inability of the active site domain to discriminate between closely similar amino acids (9Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Döring V. Mootz H.D. Nangle L.A. Hendrickson T.L. de Crécy Lagard V. Schimmel P. Marliere P.

This discrimination is typically tRNA-dependent; that is, it occurs only in the context of the cognate tRNA (12Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 839-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985Google Scholar, 19Beebe K.

An example is provided by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), 1The abbreviation used is: AlaRS, alanyl-tRNA synthetase. which misactivates glycine to form the aminoacyl adenylate (Gly-AMP). In the presence of tRNAAla, the misactivated Gly-AMP is cleared by hydrolysis at the editing site of AlaRS (13Tsui W.C. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4627-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). AlaRS+Gly+ATP→AlaRS(Gly-AMP)+AMP+PPi(Eq. 1) AlaRS(Gly-AMP)+tRNAAla→AlaRS+Gly+AMP+tRNAAla(Eq. 2) Thus, tRNAAla acts as a co-factor for the hydrolytic reaction so that, in the presence of AlaRS, Gly, ATP, and tRNAAla, an abortive cycle of ATP hydrolysis is established. Although the editing site in AlaRS has been localized to a discrete domain that is distinct from the active site (Fig. 1A) (19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Dock-Bregeon A. Sankaranarayanan R. Romby P. Caillet J. Springer M. Rees B. Francklyn C.S. Ehresmann C. Moras D. Cell. 2000; 103: 877-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and although amino acids important for editing have been identified, the role of the tRNAAla cofactor is not understood in detail. However, mischarged Gly-tRNAAla is specifically deacylated by AlaRS, whereas Ala-tRNAAla is not cleared. Gly-tRNAAla+AlaRS→Gly+tRNAAla+AlaRS(Eq. 3) Ala-tRNAAla+AlaRS→littleornoreaction(Eq. 4) Thus, although AlaRS has some discrimination, though limited, of Ala from Gly at the active site for aminoacylation, when in the context of tRNAAla, the two amino acids are further distinguished so that little or no stable Gly-tRNAAla can be generated. The stable production of Gly-tRNAAla would result in genetic code ambiguity from incorporation of glycine at codons for alanine that, ultimately, would lead to cell toxicity (11Nangle L.A. de Crécy-Lagard V.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Among the questions raised by these observations is the basis for the tRNAAla-dependent discrimination of Ala from Gly. Of particular interest is whether the RNA structure needed for aminoacylation is also critical for editing or whether the two activities require, at least in part, different components of the tRNA structure. For this purpose, we took advantage of a model RNA substrate for aminoacylation that lacked roughly half of the tRNA structure. Investigation of the model substrate, and of chimeric tRNAs in which the part of the tRNA that was missing from the model substrate was replaced with pieces from non-alanine tRNAs, provided a strategy to understand better the role of tRNA structural parameters in the discrimination of Gly from Ala. Construction of Plasmids—Construction of chimeric tRNAs was accomplished by annealing four overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA using a procedure detailed previously (21Farrow M.A. Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16898-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The annealed oligonucleotide cassette was ligated into PstNI/BamHI-digested pUC18 (22Yanisch-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). The coding sequences within the plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid for expression of Escherichia coli AlaRS was constructed through polymerase chain reaction amplification of the gene for AlaRS with oligonucleotides containing either an NdeI or XhoI site. Amplification was carried out on plasmid pQE-alaS-6H (23Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15041-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET21b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to create a coding sequence for a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for AlaRS in plasmid pET21b-AlaRS-H6. DNA sequencing was again used to verify the sequences of all constructs. RNA Preparation—Karin Musier-Forsyth (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) kindly supplied a plasmid for the preparation of the in vitro transcript of E. coli tRNAAla. Plasmids were linearized with BstNI, and transcription with T7 RNA polymerase was carried out as described previously (24Steer B.A. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4965-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The transcript was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and folded as previously detailed by heat denaturation and slow cooling to room temperature (19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). MinihelixAla and the sequence incorporating the second anticodon-containing domain of tRNAAla (Fig. 1C) were synthetically produced and purified as described previously (8Lovato M.A. Chihade J.W. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4846-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mischarged tRNAAla was produced in vitro using C666A/Q584H AlaRS, as described previously (19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) in aminoacylation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm MgCl2). Labeling of RNA at the 3′-terminal adenosine was accomplished using [γ-32P]ATP and E. coli tRNA-terminal nucleotidyl transferase, as described by Wolfson et al. (25Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—AlaRS was prepared from expression of its gene encoded by plasmid pET21b-AlaRS-H6 in BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression and purification were carried out as described previously (19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) except that cells were induced with 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–5 h. T7 RNA polymerase was purified as described previously by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (21Farrow M.A. Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16898-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding tRNA-terminal nucleotidyltransferase was a generous gift from Nancy Maizels and Alan Weiner and was purified as detailed elsewhere (27Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA. 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation and Deacylation Assays—Aminoacylation assays were performed at 37 °C as described previously (29Buechter D.D. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5267-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in charging buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and10 mm MgCl2). Mischarging with wild-type AlaRS (5 μm) was done in the presence of tRNAAla transcript (5 μm) or minihelixAla (15 μm) and [3H]Gly (10.7 μm) in charging buffer at 37 °C. Aminoacylation of 32P-labeled minihelixAla was followed by the assay described by Wolfson et al. (25Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The aminoacylation reaction was carried out with 3 mm alanine (or 175 mm glycine), 500 nm AlaRS, and 5.1 μm labeled minihelixAla. Briefly, at various time points, aliquots were quenched in 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing nuclease P1. After digestion to completion with nuclease P1, aliquots containing a mixture of [32P]AMP and 32P-Ala (or -Gly)-AMP were spotted onto thin layer chromatography plates. Separation was achieved on polyethylenimine cellulose and an SI PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) was used to quantitate the amount of product generated. For deacylation assays, [3H]Gly-tRNAAla (1 μm) or [3H]Gly-minihelixAla (5 μm) was added to AlaRS (20–200 nm) in charging buffer at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped at several time intervals by addition to filter paper saturated in 5% trichloroacetic acid (21Farrow M.A. Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16898-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Strategy for Identifying Role of tRNA Structure in Editing Response—The tRNA sequence is typically composed of 76 nucleotides arranged in a cloverleaf secondary structure with four stems and three loops. The loops with their associated hydrogen-bonded stems are designated as the dihydrouridine (D), anticodon, and TψC-stem loops (Fig. 1B). Aminoacylation occurs at the 3′-end of the acceptor stem that terminates in the universal sequence XCCA76, where X is the “discriminator base” that can be any of the four nucleotides. (For tRNAAla, X is an A.) The tRNA cloverleaf is arranged in three dimensions as a two-domain L-shaped structure, with the TψC-stem stacking on the acceptor stem to give a 12-bp minihelix domain (capped by the TψC-loop) and the anticodon stem stacking on the D-stem to give a 10-bp helix capped at opposite ends by the D-loop and anticodon loop, respectively, to give the anticodon-containing domain. Tertiary interactions that include contacts between the D- and TψC-loops bring together the minihelix and anticodon-containing domains at a corner (30Kim S.H. Suddath F.L. Quigley G.J. McPherson A. Sussman J.L. Wang A.H.J. Seeman N.C. Rich A. Science. 1974; 185: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 31Robertus J.D. Ladner J.E. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Brown R.S. Clark B.F.C. Klug A. Nature. 1974; 250: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). For tRNAAla, the major determinant for aminoacylation is a G3:U70 base pair in the acceptor stem (32Hou Y.M. Schimmel P. Nature. 1988; 333: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 33McClain W.H. Foss K. Science. 1988; 240: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Transfer of this base pair into other tRNA confers aminoacylation with alanine (32Hou Y.M. Schimmel P. Nature. 1988; 333: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 33McClain W.H. Foss K. Science. 1988; 240: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 34Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition, the 12-bp minihelix domain of tRNAAla (Fig. 1C) is an efficient substrate for aminoacylation with an elevation in the Km but no change in V max (34Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Minihelices and smaller oligonucleotide substrates with as few as four base pairs are also substrates for charging by AlaRS provided they contain the G3:U70 base pair (34Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 35Shi J.-P. Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. Acct. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 368-375Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, in this instance, the second domain of the tRNA structure is not essential for aminoacylation. Indeed, AlaRS makes no contact with the anticodon triplet, although some contacts are made with other parts of the anticodon-containing domain (37Park S.J. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16527-16530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These contacts mainly lower the Km for aminoacylation beyond that achieved with minihelixAla alone (34Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we first sought to determine whether determinants for aminoacylation could be separated from those for editing. Therefore, we investigated minihelix substrates because they are missing about half of the tRNA structure. The idea was to test whether the second domain of the tRNA structure, although not required for aminoacylation, was needed for editing. If it turned out that the anticodon-containing domain was important for editing, the question then was whether specific determinants for editing could be identified in that domain. MinihelixAla but Not tRNAAla Is Mischarged with Glycine—As stated, tRNAAla and minihelixAla are efficiently aminoacylated with alanine by AlaRS. In contrast, tRNAAla is not charged with glycine because of the enzyme's robust editing activity (13Tsui W.C. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4627-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In our first experiments, charging of minihelixAla with glycine was investigated. Remarkably, minihelixAla was efficiently mischarged with glycine under conditions in which no mischarging of tRNAAla was observed (Fig 2A). The experiments in Fig. 2A used concentrations of glycine (10.8 μm) well below the Km determined by the inorganic pyrophosphate exchange assay (58 mm), which is 50–100-fold higher than the Km for alanine (19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The low concentration of glycine was necessary because the assay used [3H]Gly to detect covalent attachment of glycine to minihelixAla, and raising the concentration of glycine by addition of unlabeled glycine would dilute the specific activity. To investigate further the mischarging of minihelixAla with glycine, efforts were focused on a direct comparison of alanine versus glycine, using concentrations of amino acid that were the same relative to the respective Km values. For this purpose, non-radioactive amino acid was used to aminoacylate 32P-end-labeled tRNAAla using an assay described by Wolfson et al. (25Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This assay allowed for use of amino acid concentrations well above the Km. With a ratio of concentration/Km of 3 for each amino acid, a direct comparison of charging of minihelixAla with either amino acid could be done. This experiment showed that, under these conditions, Ala and Gly were distinguished by less than 2-fold in the rate at which minihelixAla was charged (Fig. 2B). Thus, apart from RNA-dependent editing, no other activities or functions of AlaRS allow discrimination of Ala from Gly. To test whether the anticodon-containing domain that is missing from minihelixAla could be added in trans to restore editing, an aminoacylation mixture containing minihelixAla and the anticodon-containing domain of tRNAAla was set up. This domain is strongly predicted by MFOLD (38Walter A.E. Turner D.H. Kim J. Lyttle M.H. Muller P. Mathews D.H. Zuker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9218-9222Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) to approximate the stem-biloop structure of the second domain of tRNA (Fig. 1C). With this mixture, no effect of the addition of the anticodon-containing domain could be seen; minihelixAla was still efficiently mischarged with glycine (Fig. 2C). Thus, the two domains of tRNAAla must be covalently linked for efficient clearance of any glycine that has been activated by AlaRS. AlaRS Clears Gly-tRNAAla but Not Gly-MinihelixAla—The results in Fig. 2 collectively show that minihelixAla is missing determinants for RNA-dependent editing. Because Gly-tRNAAla is an efficient substrate for editing by AlaRS, the above results implied that Gly-minihelixAla was not a substrate for editing. To investigate directly this possibility, Gly-tRNAAla and Gly-minihelixAla were prepared by using editing-defective C666A/Q584H AlaRS. (Because of two mutations in the center for editing, this mutant enzyme mischarges tRNAAla with glycine, allowing for the straightforward preparation of tRNAAla or other RNA substrates that are mis-acylated with glycine (19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).) AlaRS efficiently cleared Gly-tRNAAla. However, even at enzyme concentrations 10-fold higher than required to rapidly deacylate Gly-tRNAAla (data not shown) and substrate concentrations 25-fold higher than that of Gly-tRNAAla, no deacylation of Gly-minihelixAla was observed (Fig. 3). In fact, GlyminihelixAla was as stable in the presence as in the absence of AlaRS. Design and Analysis of Chimeric tRNAs with Acceptor Stem Replacements—The failure of AlaRS to clear mischarged minihelixAla (Fig. 3), and the lack of an effect from addition of the anticodon-containing domain to the aminoacylation mixture containing minihelixAla (Fig. 2c), prompted investigation of structural determinants for editing that were missing from minihelixAla. For this purpose, chimeric tRNAs were constructed in which the second, anticodon-containing domain from non-alanine tRNAs was grafted onto minihelixAla. Three different tRNAs were selected for this purpose (Fig. 4). E. coli tRNAPhe is identical in length to tRNAAla and, like tRNAAla, is classified as type I tRNA (39Rich A. RajBhandary U.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 805-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These tRNAs are in the most common class of tRNAs, containing 76 nucleotides, a variable loop of 5 nucleotides, and a D-stem composed of 4 base pairs. They also have eight nucleotides in the D-loop. As a less conservative example, tRNAGlu was selected, substantially differing in sequence from tRNAAla in the D-stem, and having a D-loop containing nine nucleotides. To complete the range of chimeras with a more dramatic contrast, bovine mitochondrial tRNASer was chosen. This unusual tRNA has only three nucleotides in the variable loop and a D-loop of five instead of eight bases. (Although mitochondrial tRNASer is substantially different in many ways from type I tRNAs, the overall l-shape can still be adopted (40de Bruijn M.H.L. Klug A. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 41Steinberg S. Leclerc F. Cedergren R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the use of this particular tRNA for making a chimera allowed formation of the basic L-like three-dimensional structure.) Collectively, these chimeric tRNAs introduced sequence differences through all parts of the anticodon-containing domain and, with the tRNAAla/Ser chimera, also offered a variation on the canonical structural format of type I tRNAs. Only U33 and A37 in the anticodon loop remained fixed throughout all the tRNAs tested. AlaRS efficiently charged each of the chimeric tRNAs with alanine. Indeed, the apparent k cat /Km for aminoacylation varied no more than 5-fold (arising from either slight alterations in the k cat and/or Km) from that seen with tRNAAla (data not shown). In contrast, like tRNAAla, none of the chimeric molecules could be mischarged with glycine, even using stoichiometric amounts of AlaRS (Fig. 5a). These results imply that all of the chimeric tRNAs are substrates for editing by AlaRS. To test directly the editing response with the chimeric structures, the editing-defective C666A/Q584H AlaRS was used to prepare the misacylated species. Strikingly, each tRNA was deacylated by AlaRS (Fig. 5B). Using catalytic amounts of enzyme, the rates of deacylation were not significantly different (within ∼15%) than that achieved with mischarged tRNAAla as substrate. Because of the collective differences between the three chimeric tRNAs and tRNAAla, and considering especially the differences introduced with the tRNAAla/Ser chimera, the results support the idea that tRNA structure per se and not sequence is essential for RNA-dependent editing by AlaRS. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two classes of ten enzymes each. The two classes are defined by the active site structures shared by members of the same class (42Webster T.A. Tsai H. Kula M. Mackie G.A. Schimmel P. Science. 1984; 226: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 43Ludmerer S.W. Schimmel P. J. Biol.

These classes seem to have independent origins and are thought to reflect, at least in part, an early system of pairing synthetases of opposite classes on the same tRNA acceptor stem (46Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Cell. 2001; 104: 191-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). AlaRS is a class II enzyme, defined by a catalytic domain for aminoacylation having a seven-stranded β-structure with flanking α-helices (44Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Hartlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 45Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D.

Sci. 1993; 2: 2259-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Joined to the C-terminal side of this structure is a domain that contains the active site for editing (Fig. 1A). Class I enzymes are characterized by a Rossmann nucleotide binding fold (48Rao S.T. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) that forms the catalytic site for amino acid activation (3Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev.

For the closely related class I isoleucyl-, leucyl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases, an insertion known as CP1 splits the active site (42Webster T.A. Tsai H. Kula M. Mackie G.A. Schimmel P.

This insertion harbors the center for editing that, in the three-dimensional structures, is about 30 Å from the site for amino acid activation (15Schmidt E. Schimmel P.

Cell. 2002; 9: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the cases of at least isoleucyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetases, the role of the cognate tRNA is to trigger translocation in cis of the misactivated amino acid from the catalytic site for activation to that for editing (56Lin L. Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Nature. 1996; 384: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 59Nomanbhoy T.K. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, the editing site can act “in trans” on exogenously added mischarged tRNAs (18Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985Google Scholar, 57Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A.

Whether tRNAAla has the same role (a cofactor to stimulate translocation) is not known for AlaRS or for any other class II enzyme. For at least the class I isoleucyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetase, the center for editing can clear either the misactivated aminoacyl adenylate (pretransfer editing) or the mischarged aminoacyl ester (in the form of mischarged tRNA (post-transfer editing)) (11Nangle L.A. de Crécy-Lagard V.

A. 2003; 100: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The overall editing reactions can be followed by the continuous abortive hydrolysis of ATP (analogous to the summation of Equations 1 and 2 for AlaRS). Not known is whether AlaRS can directly clear Gly-AMP or all of the clearance is through Gly-tRNAAla. However, we confirmed that minihelixAla is inactive in stimulating overall ATP hydrolysis, in the presence of glycine, ATP, and AlaRS. 2K. Beebe, unpublished observations. Thus, if pretransfer editing occurs with AlaRS, then minihelixAla is also inactive for this reaction. Like the class II AlaRS, the class I isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase also needs the entire tRNA structure to activate the editing reaction, with minihelix substrates failing to support editing (66Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6835-6838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Many chimeric tRNAs (composed of pieces of tRNAIle and tRNAVal) were shown to be active for aminoacylation but not for editing (67Hale S.P. Auld D.S. Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1997; 276: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After construction of a series of chimeric molecules and of site-specific mutations, three nucleotides in the D-loop were identified as essential for editing (21Farrow M.A. Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16898-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 67Hale S.P. Auld D.S. Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1997; 276: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, the editing response could be switched off and on by manipulation of these specific nucleotides located at the corner of the L-shaped structure. These particular nucleotides are important specifically for translocation of a misactivated amino acid from the catalytic site for adenylate synthesis to the center for editing (21Farrow M.A. Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16898-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, for the alanine system studied here, all chimeric molecules were active in editing, even though they collectively changed nearly every nucleotide in the second domain of the tRNA structure, including those in the D-loop. Particularly striking was the success of the chimera with bovine mitochondrial tRNASer that lacked several nucleotides compared with those seen in most canonical tRNAs. Thus, at least for this class II system, the L-shaped structure per se seems to be the critical factor sensed by the enzyme. Previous work showed that, under specific conditions, disruption of the editing function of AlaRS is cytotoxic (19Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, strong selective pressure assures retention of the editing activity. Several lines of evidence suggest that the two domains of tRNA had separate origins and were brought together into a two-domain tRNA to make possible the modern genetic code (36Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. Acct. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 368-375Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 68Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ribas de Pouplana L. Cell. 1995; 81: 983-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Results with the class I isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and class II alanyl-tRNA synthetase showed that, for both systems, a full tRNA structure is required to trigger the editing response. This requirement is one of several pressures for retaining the two domains of tRNA and the L-shape. Significantly, unlike isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, in which the anticodon is a major determinant for aminoacylation (26Nureki O. Niimi T. Muramatsu T. Kanno H. Kohno T. Florentz C. Giegé R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 710-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 74Muramatsu T. Nishikawa K. Nemoto F. Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Yokoyama S.

Cladistic analysis of the structure of biochemical pathways makes hypotheses in biochemical evolution explicit and parsimonious. Cellular metabolism is a complex process involving about a thousand chemical reactions catalyzed by globular proteins, enzymes. As any other biological phenomenon, metabolism has a structure that is the product of an evolutionary history. How can we infer that history? Because the history and interrelationships of living organisms is based on comparative anatomy, the history of metabolism must be reconstructed by the comparative analysis of the structure of its components (1Schoffeniels E.

Presses Universitaires de France, Paris1997: 425-447Google Scholar, 4Michal G. Biochemical Pathways. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Biochemists recognized this necessity long ago but have never used comparative methods that formally controlled the consistency of biochemical evolutionary theories (3Cunchillos C. Tort P. Pour Darwin. Presses Universitaires de France, Paris1997: 425-447Google Scholar, 4Michal G. Biochemical Pathways. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 5Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev.

Müller M. Nature. 1998; 392: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In systematics, the science of classification of living things, there are now standardized comparative methods to infer events of the past with a measurement of the consistency of a theory. The standard comparative method starts with a number of things to compare. These are known as “operational taxonomic units,” “terminals,” often “species,” or “individuals.” These words are not strictly equivalent. By convenience we often call them “taxons.” Among those different things we detect that some structures are under different versions. To formalize that observation we create a column in a table called a “matrix” in which a given version is associated with 0, and the other version is associated with 1 in the list of things to compare (versions can be also “coded” 2, 3, etc. depending on the number found). The column is a character; its version as 0 or 1 is the character state. We bet that the versions are homologous; sameness must come from common ancestry. That bet is called “primary homology.” Once the matrix is filled with all the characters we were able to detect for that collection of things, a phylogenetic tree is retained according to a criterion explained below. Onto that tree changes of character states become hypothetical events of transformation, and the tree yields a relative order of these events. That tree will show for each character whether that bet is won or lost. If a state appears only once in the tree, the bet is won, and it is called a secondary homology, or a synapomorphy; the state is present from common ancestry in those things that have it. If a state of a character is associated with more than one event, the bet is lost. It is homoplasy, i.e. sameness without common ancestry. But how do we choose a tree over others? For a given number of taxons there are a limited but high number of possible trees, which are different theories of interrelationships. In science theories are to be compared in terms of internal consistency. The theory that is the most consistent is the one that appeals the less ad hoc hypotheses. The most parsimonious tree is the best theory (against alternative trees) because it requires the smallest number of ad hoc hypotheses of transformation onto its branches. This is the reason why one always associates to the most parsimonious tree the number of transformations (“number of steps”) and measurements of internal consistency, like the consistency index (C.I.) 1The abbreviations used are: C.I.consistency indexR.I.retention indexKCKrebs cyclePLPpyridoxal phosphate. and the retention index (R.I.). We propose the use of such a parsimony analysis (9Hennig W. Grundzüge einer Theorie der Phylogenetischen Systematik. Deutscher Zentralverlag, Berlin1950Google Scholar, 10Hennig W.

In 1945 Horowitz (14Horowitz N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1945; 31: 153-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) postulated that the earliest biosynthetic pathways evolved in a backward direction if life began in a rich soup of organic molecules. If primitive cells were using a particular external nutrient, soon this organic molecule would be depleted in the environment. A selective advantage could be obtained by organisms able to synthesize this nutrient from an available precursor. Each biosynthetic step was selected according to successive depletions of precursors in the environment. The first enzyme to appear in the biosynthetic pathway was, therefore, the most distal (i.e. downstream) in the pathway. Confluence of pathways was selected because it saved energy. This energy is used for other needs that will be more difficult to satisfy for competitor cells without confluence. This optimization of pathways is considered as a general basic rule of comparative biochemistry (1Schoffeniels E. Biochimie Comparée. Masson, Paris1984Google Scholar). For these early anabolisms, common enzymes or common reactions shared by two (or more) synthetic pathways are distal and are, therefore, evidence for common ancestry for these pathways. In terms of kinship pathways sharing these enzymes are judged to be closer to each other than to other pathways not using these enzymes. In 1990, Cordón (2Cordón F. Tratado Evolucionista de Biologia. Aguilar, Madrid, Spain1990Google Scholar) proposed a symmetrical scenario of catabolic pathways. Early forms of life extracted energy from the degradation of substrates available in the environment into a product. Selective advantage was obtained for those able to produce a supplementary reaction of deeper degradation of this product, therefore obtaining more energy from the original substrate. Confluence is selected by obtaining the transformation of another substrate into an intermediate product already present in the protocell. The first reactions to appear in evolution of catabolism are proximal ones (i.e. upstream ones). The common distal elongation of two branched catabolic pathways is, therefore, a phenomenon whose final result will be evidence for common ancestry of these pathways. Two catabolic pathways sharing one or several distal portions of catabolism are supposed to be more closely related to each other than to other pathways. But there is a risk, which consists of the late connection of an “opportunistic” catabolic pathway once the early catabolism onto which it connects is already complete. In that case the common downstream portion is not evidence for common ancestry but just convergence obtained by recruitment, a phenomenon recognized for having played a role in biochemical evolution (5Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 15Petsko P. Kenyon G.L. Gerlt J.A. Ringe D. Kozarich J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 372-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Copley S.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 261-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It is sameness without common ancestry. When we reconstruct the past, homoplasy appears when there are character conflicts due to such similarities obtained by evolutionary convergence or reversion. The risk of homoplasy in our data just depends on the relative timing between events of distal elongation of a pathway and the connecting event of another pathway. An early connecting event followed by distal elongation will provide good phylogenetic indicators. A late connecting event (late in time and/or late in the pathway) will probably bring homoplasy. As in any other study of systematics where putative homologies are coded into a matrix, there are risks of homoplasy to carry on. We make the bet that this homoplasy will not swamp the phylogenetic signal. According to Cordón (2Cordón F. Tratado Evolucionista de Biologia. Aguilar, Madrid, Spain1990Google Scholar) the symmetrical scenario is not rigid and can change from one type of metabolites to another; the order of development of a given pathway depends on the position and availability of the initial substrate and/or final product. The above timings in the genesis of reactions in anabolic pathways and catabolic pathways are valid because the final product and the initial substrate, respectively, are imposed from the outside to the cell, at least initially. Alternative scenarios can be obtained for transformations starting from products already integrated into the cellular metabolism. New biosynthetic pathways can develop in a forward direction by the addition of new enzymes and reactions to pre-existing pathways. For example, the urea cycle uses the biosynthesis of arginine (17Takiguchi M. Matsubasa T. Amaya Y. Mori M. BioEssays. 1989; 10: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, Cordón (2Cordón F. Tratado Evolucionista de Biologia. Aguilar, Madrid, Spain1990Google Scholar) proposed a forward development for amino acid catabolism, fatty acids anabolism, and glycogenesis and a backward development for amino acid anabolism, fatty acids catabolism, and glycolysis (confirmed in 1993 by Fothergill-Gilmore and Michels (18Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 105-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar)). However, late opportunistic connections of pathways can complicate the general ordering of metabolism development as predicted by Cordón (2Cordón F. Tratado Evolucionista de Biologia. Aguilar, Madrid, Spain1990Google Scholar). For example, some catabolic pathways can develop backwards by opportunistic connecting to intermediate compounds from already developed pathways (e.g. Cordón's catabolism of serine). For the same reasons some anabolic pathways can develop forward (e.g. Cordón's anabolism of methionine and threonine). The complexity of the matter is increased by the fact that some biochemical pathways can be considered both catabolic and anabolic (pentose phosphate shunt, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the Krebs Cycle). Therefore, it is clear for all biochemists today that there is no direct link between being either anabolic or catabolic and having grown either forward or backward. This is one of the reasons why it is important to start the present methodological improvement with simple examples, like amino acids, for which in most cases the catabolic pathway is different from the anabolic pathway. The evolutionary development of pathways has to do with the darwinian concept of descent with modification, justifying the use of cladistic analysis (19Kluge A.G. Cladistics. 2001; 17: 199-210Crossref Google Scholar) for metabolic pathways. By using that concept we bet that present similarities in pathways detected through shared enzymes and enzymatic reactions can be interpreted as the result of pathway transformations through time. Comparison of pathways can, therefore, be followed by phylogenetic reconstruction of metabolic pathways. Why focus on amino acids and not on nucleic acids, fatty acids, or monosaccharides? The reasons are manyfold. Amino acids are among the earliest abiotic sources of energy and molecules for protocells without excluding other possible sources (for instance, sunlight for energy, pentoses). Consequently, their metabolism must have been involved among the earliest biochemical reactions. Simple amino acids have been obtained experimentally in an abiotic way for example by Miller in 1953 (20Miller S.A. Science. 1953; 117: 528Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar), who obtained glycine, alanine, glutamate, and aspartate from simple molecules like ammoniac, hydrogen, methane, and water. Serine can be obtained abiotically in the presence of formaldehyde (20Miller S.A. Science. 1953; 117: 528Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Even if the chemical environment of the primitive soup is today interpreted in a different manner than it was at the time of Miller, free amino acids are still found in abiotic and extraterrestrial environments, for example, in meteorites, like the famous carbonaceous chondrites, which are probably the source on primitive earth. Moreover, among classical candidates for early energy providers (fatty acids, monosaccharides, amino acids), amino acids are the only chemical precursors whose structure is complex enough to contain all the atoms and reactive groups necessary for most of the reactions necessary for central metabolism. Other compounds like monosaccharides, polysaccharides, and fatty acids have a poorer variety of atoms and groups and are rather monotonous. However, the strongest argument for early availability of amino acids to protocells might be the fact that any metabolism defined as a coordinated network of enzymatic activities performed by proteins needs in its very early steps amino acid anabolism and catabolism for these proteins. Amino acid metabolism might, therefore, have preceded any other metabolism, even the most central metabolism like the Krebs cycle. However, this question is still debated. Whatever the metabolic specialization found in diverse living organisms (heterotrophy, photosynthetic autotrophy, chemosynthetic autotrophy, various forms of respiration and fermentation), there is a universal core of about 50 metabolic pathways involving the anabolism and catabolism of amino acids, fatty acids, saccharides (the glycolysis and the glycogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway), and the Krebs cycle. Because the Krebs cycle is the point of confluence of all other metabolic pathways, it is sometimes viewed as primitive. That view is, however, challenged by several lines of evidence. Molecules entering the Krebs cycle (oxo acids and acyl-CoAs) are intermediate metabolites that are diversely interpreted with regard to their availability in primitive abiotic environments. Some biochemists consider them as most likely the products of a peripheral cellular metabolism. For example, the origin of the Krebs cycle was thought to be secondary and composite by Schoffeniels (1Schoffeniels E. Biochimie Comparée. Masson, Paris1984Google Scholar, 21Schoffeniels E. Les Cahiers de Biochimie (Paris). Vaillant-Carmanne Maloine, Paris1981Google Scholar), Gest (22Gest H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1981; 12: 209-215Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Gest H. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1987; 54: 3-16PubMed Google Scholar), and Meléndez-Hevia et al. (7Meléndez-Hevia E. Waddell T.G. Cascante M. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Others consider them as most likely available right from the beginning; for instance, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight provide oxalic acid through pyrite catalysis. Then, the primitive soup would have been rich in dicarboxylic acids. These debates led us to incorporate two portions of the Krebs cycle as taxons in the matrix along with the metabolic pathways of each of the 16 aliphatic amino acids in our data sets. By analyzing anabolism and catabolism all together following the protocol of Cunchillos and Lecointre (24Cunchillos C. Lecointre G. Barriel, V. Bourgoin T. Biosystema 18. Société Française de Systématique, Paris2000: 87-106Google Scholar, 25Cunchillos C. Lecointre G. C. R. Biologies. 2002; 325: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) for catabolism only, we compared portions of the Krebs cycle both to amino acid catabolism and anabolism. The ultimate question was to find the earliest pathways and enzymatic functions among peripheral amino acid metabolisms and portions of the Krebs cycle. This work is a cladistic analysis of the structure of a part of the cellular metabolism. This is allowed by taking each pathway as a taxon and shared enzymes, shared enzymatic functions, and shared cofactors as characters. Each taxon starts from the initial substrate and includes the pathway until its entry into the Krebs cycle or starts from the metabolites of the Krebs cycle and includes the pathway to the amino acid. For example, the taxon dASN1 is the catabolic pathway from asparagine to oxaloacetate, and the enzymes and functions along this pathway will be the characters of this taxon (Fig. 1, characters 2, 4, 11, 13, and 28). The taxon sASN1 is the anabolic pathway from oxaloacetate to asparagine (Fig. 1, characters 2, 4, 11, 28, 56, 106, and 107). In this example the pathways used for the degradation (“d”) and the synthesis (“s”) of the amino acid are very similar; however, this is not the case for all taxons. Some amino acids can be degraded or synthesized through several possible ways (cysteine, aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, threonine). In these cases each way is taken separately as an additional taxon (for instance, dCYS1, dCYS2, dCYS3 for the degradation (d) of cysteine (Cys) after the pathways 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The Krebs cycle (KC) is considered in two portions, each beginning with an oxo acid, which is a point of entrance into the cycle and also a point of output. These two oxo acids are also, among the metabolites of the Krebs cycle, the closest to amino acids structurally speaking. The portion KC1 begins with oxaloacetate and ends with α-oxoglutarate; the portion KC2 begins with α-oxoglutarate and ends with oxaloacetate. Aromatic amino acids have not been considered at this stage of cellular evolution because their complex metabolism needs too much oxygen and is only possible once the metabolism of aliphatic amino acids is set.Fig. 2List of characters of the matrix (Fig. 1). Each number and name associated corresponds to a column in the matrix, with the corresponding number of international nomenclature (Enzyme Nomenclature) and homology types defined in the text. For example, the 26th character is the alanine aminotransferase; it corresponds to the 26th column in Fig. 1, the international nomenclature is 2.6.1.2, and in the text it is a primary homology of type I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our aim is first to understand phylogenetic interrelationships of aliphatic amino acid catabolic and anabolic pathways, second to discover in the most parsimonious tree the earliest metabolic pathway, and third to discover the first enzymatic functions associated to them. This should answer the following connected questions; Is the Krebs cycle the first? Does amino acid catabolism appear before amino acid anabolism? Can we test the expected order of metabolism development as predicted by Horowitz (14Horowitz N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1945; 31: 153-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Cordón (2Cordón F. Tratado Evolucionista de Biologia. Aguilar, Madrid, Spain1990Google Scholar)? In other words, does anabolism develop backwards and catabolism forwards? Comparing differences in metabolisms of extant living organisms is of no help in reaching this aim because all the corresponding events are more differences in metabolism regulation than differences in structure of pathways (1Schoffeniels E. Biochimie Comparée. Masson, Paris1984Google Scholar) and, anyway, might have been posterior to the very early events we intend to infer. Comparing semantids of Zuckerkandl and Pauling (26Zuckerkandl E. Pauling L. J. Theor. Biol. 1965; 8: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), i.e. DNA sequences or protein sequences, is of no help because it leads to severe problems of linear sequence homology and would infer mutational changes that also are posterior to the occurrence of these early metabolisms. Problems with sequence data are even more complex. The present taxons are pathways. Each 0 and 1 coded into a cell of the matrix could have been replaced by the sequence of the corresponding enzyme in a given model organism. Then, comparing sequences would have mixed up different gene duplication histories, leading to no trees at all. Moreover, we have no theoretical model that links ordering events of gene duplication within a putative primitive genome with ordering the rise and organization of enzymatic activities in a protocellular metabolism. At last, the present work infers nothing about information storage, replication, and the RNA world. If shared enzymes or similar enzymes are evidence for common ancestry of metabolic pathways, similarities in the structure of active sites would be sufficient to formulate putative homologies. However, only a few active sites (27Knowles J.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) are known in detail compared with the large number of known enzyme types (4Michal G. Biochemical Pathways. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). We are, therefore, led to consider similarities in catalytic reactions and enzymatic mechanisms as reflecting similarities in active sites. The higher the specificity, the more accurate is this reflection. In the same way, considering the generally accepted idea that enzymes evolved from low specificities to high specificities (5Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 15Petsko P. Kenyon G.L. Gerlt J.A. Ringe D. Kozarich J.W. Trends Biochem.

(Lond.). 1999; 6: 91-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), putative common ancestry of pathways can be postulated not only on the basis of shared enzymes with high specificities but also on the basis of very similar reactions. Similarity in function must correspond to an underlying similarity in structure of active sites, a structural similarity that comes from common ancestry. Recognizing that two metabolic pathways share the same reaction with high specificity for substrate uses a strict criterion of primary homology (32de Pinna M.C.C. Cladistics. 1991; 7: 367-394Crossref Scopus (817) Google Scholar), whereas recognizing a common family of reaction relaxes this criterion with a risk of homoplasy obtained by convergence or recruitment. There is no reason for considering that this risk is higher in the present case than in aligned DNA sequences or in classical morpho-anatomical matrices, both usual in systematics (33Sanderson M.J. Hufford H. Homoplasy. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). The criteria of primary homology is 4-fold: shared specific enzymatic activity (I), shared enzymatic function without shared specificity for substrate (IIa), shared coenzymes (IIb), and shared family of function (IIc). Several pathways share the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. The enzyme itself is the hypothesis of primary homology. For reversible enzymes this is valid either for a given reaction or the reverse reaction. The absence is coded 0, and presence is coded 1. For instance, the catabolism of aspartate and asparagine both use the aspartate aminotransferase, which transforms aspartate into oxaloacetate. The anabolism of these two amino acids use the same enzyme for the reverse reaction, which transforms oxaloacetate into aspartate. The character is called “aspartate aminotransferase” (character 12); it is coded 1 for taxons dASP2, dASN2, sASP2, and sASN2 and 0 for dGLU, sGLU1, dALA, and sALA, for example. This type of homology is used in characters 11–26, 29–105, 109, and 110. IIa; Shared Enzymatic Functions—Several pathways utilize the same enzymatic functions, i.e. exhibit the same kind of chemical transformation, without considering the specificity of each enzyme for its substrate. The underlying hypothesis is that similarity in enzymatic function must correspond to similarity in the structure of active sites, with the hypothesis that enzymes must have evolved from generalist active sites to specialized ones (28Holden J.T.

https://openalex.org/W1965370593,"Serine proteases play fundamental roles in invertebrate development, hemostasis, and innate immunity. This is exemplified by the limulus Factor C, which is a serine protease that binds a pathogen-associated molecule, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to trigger a blood coagulation cascade. As a central molecule in the limulus innate immunity and hemostasis, Factor C gene expression has been detected in two major immune defense tissues, the amebocytes and hepatopancreas. Infection of the limulus with live Gram-negative bacteria induces a 2–3-fold increase in mRNA transcripts in both tissues. However, in vitro studies in Drosophila cell lines using Factor C promoter-reporter chimera DNA constructs, and site-directed mutagenesis of the promoter demonstrated that a proximal κB binding site, aided by an adjacent dorsal-like binding motif responds dramatically to LPS and dorsal transcription factor overexpression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay further confirmed a strong interaction of the limulus κB motif with Rel proteins. However, deletion constructs of the Factor C promoter harboring different numbers of dorsal-like binding sites upstream of the κB motif as well as the electrophoretic mobility shift assay of these motifs with Rel proteins strongly suggest that the up-regulation of Factor C gene expression is attenuated during microbial challenge. The repression of the dramatic activation of this pathogen-responsive gene by LPS is probably effected via competition between the dorsal-like motifs over the proximal LPS-responsive κB unit, or through inhibition from the upstream repressive element(s), which accounts for the gene expression pattern observed in vivo.

Our findings demonstrate that blood coagulation and innate immune response are integrated at the transcriptional level in this ancient organism, and that this LPS-responsive serine protease is controlled by an evolutionarily conserved NFκB pathway. Serine protease cascades are indispensable in various fundamental biological processes in both invertebrates and vertebrates (1.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). They play major roles in signal transduction in development, immunity, and hemostasis. In Drosophila, a well established serine protease cascade is involved in generating a signal that promotes ventral and lateral development of the embryo (2.Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 371-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The proteolytically processed product of this cascade, Spätzle, is thought to be recognized by the Toll receptor, which finally results in the translocation of dorsal transcription factor from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (2.Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 371-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 3.Belvin M. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The Dorsal concentration gradient regulated by this pathway controls the dorsoventral polarity in the early Drosophila embryo. Dorsal belongs to the Rel protein family, which is commonly referred to as NFκB protein in mammals. In Drosophila, in addition to Dorsal, two other Rel proteins have been identified: Dif (4.Petersen U-M. Bjorklund G. Engstrom Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3146-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Relish (5.Dushay M. Asling B. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10343-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The Rel protein family in particular controls transcription of many immune responsive genes (6.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 16: 649-681Crossref Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 7.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that the Spätzle/Toll/Dorsal pathway was also found to be involved in the expression of antimicrobial peptides during fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infection in Drosophila larvae (8.Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J-M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the adult fly, Dif substitutes the role of Dorsal to control the antifungal and anti-Gram-negative bacteria responses. In contrast, Relish is the Rel protein required in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCrFCCarcinoscopius rotundicauda Factor CEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaymbn-2Drosophila melanogaster malignant blood leukemia 2S2Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line-2TFtissue factorTKthymidylate kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidILinterleukinTLRToll-like receptor.1The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCrFCCarcinoscopius rotundicauda Factor CEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaymbn-2Drosophila melanogaster malignant blood leukemia 2S2Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line-2TFtissue factorTKthymidylate kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidILinterleukinTLRToll-like receptor.-mounted immune response against Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, the dorsoventral determination pathway and the antifungal and Gram-positive bacterial immune responses converge on the proteolytic processing of Spätzle. However, another uncharacterized serine protease cascade(s) distinguishable from the GD/SNK/Ea cascade has been suggested to cleave Spätzle into its active form (9.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). lipopolysaccharide chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Carcinoscopius rotundicauda Factor C electrophoretic mobility shift assay Drosophila melanogaster malignant blood leukemia 2 Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line-2 tissue factor thymidylate kinase glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid interleukin Toll-like receptor. lipopolysaccharide chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Carcinoscopius rotundicauda Factor C electrophoretic mobility shift assay Drosophila melanogaster malignant blood leukemia 2 Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line-2 tissue factor thymidylate kinase glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid interleukin Toll-like receptor. Fig. 1 illustrates an interesting parallel in the two serine protease cascades: the Drosophila dorsoventral polarity determination and the limulus LPS-sensitive blood coagulation (9.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar, 10.Gay N.J. Keith J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the limulus blood coagulation, the serine protease, Factor C is activated by LPS (also known as endotoxin, a component of the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria) and subsequently undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to expose its catalytic activity. Consequently, the LPS-activated Factor C initiates proteolytic processing to convert coagulogen to coagulin, which polymerizes to form an insoluble clot at the site of infection/injury (11.Ding J.L. Navas III, M.A. Ho B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12.Muta T. Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Coagulogen is so far the only reported structural homologue to Spätzle in invertebrates (13.Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14.Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The upstream serine proteases in both cascades show a significant sequence homology between Factor B and proclotting enzyme versus Snake and Easter (10.Gay N.J. Keith J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Persephone, a newly discovered serine protease involved in signal transduction of anti-Gram-positive bacteria and anti-fungal immune responses, is deduced to contain structural domains homologous to those in Easter, Snake (of the dorsoventral determination serine protease cascade), and proclotting enzymes (of the limulus blood coagulation) (15.Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J-M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although serine proteases involved in blood coagulation and innate immunity have not been well characterized in Drosophila, its genome, however, contains a high number of genes encoding putative proteases, including 199 members that appear to code for trypsin-like serine proteases and many others that code for proteins with fibrinogen- and complement-like domains (16.Khush R.S. Lemaitre B. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 442-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In mammalian hemostasis, the tissue factor (TF)-dependent pathway is the primary initiator of blood coagulation. Upon injury, Factor VII complexes with the exposed mature TF on the cell surface to activate Factor X to Factor Xa. Factor Xa converts prothrombin to thrombin, which eventually leads to fibrin clot formation (17.Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 18.Hoffman M. Monroe D.M. Roberts H.R. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 12-16PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Hoffman M. Monroe D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). During inflammation, blood coagulation can also be modulated by LPS and various cytokines through regulating the expression of coagulation related factors. These two fundamental biological processes, viz. inflammation and blood coagulation, are integrated into an essential part of the host immune response in higher vertebrates. The simultaneous activation of the innate immune response and the coagulation system after injury is a phylogenetically ancient, adaptive response that can be traced back to the early stages of evolution in eukaryotes as exemplified by the limulus LPS initiated blood coagulation cascade (20.Cicala C. Cirino G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21.Opal S.M. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: S77-S80Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tantalizing to speculate that a single ancestral developmental/immunity cascade has given rise to the developmental process, blood coagulation, and innate immunity in the animal kingdom (9.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar, 15.Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J-M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22.Krem M.M. Cera E.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In this respect, the limulus blood coagulation cascade contributes an invaluable system for studying the evolution of serine protease cascades in hemostasis and innate immune response. In innate immune response against microbial infection, pattern recognition receptors recognize and bind bacterial cell wall components and metabolic products like LPS and β-1,3-glucan (23.Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to transduce the signal to a downstream serine protease cascade or other signaling pathway. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins constituting a large protein family have been characterized as pattern recognition receptors that sense microbial infection in both vertebrates and invertebrates (24.Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 25.Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Gram-positive bacterial infection in Drosophila causes peptidoglycan recognition protein SA to recognize and activate Toll for antimicrobial peptide synthesis (26.Michel T. Reichhart J-M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To date, the limulus Factor C is the only known pattern recognition receptor that has a unique mosaic structure combining LPS recognition and serine protease activity (27.Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 28.Tan N.S. Ho B. Ding J.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Unlike Factor C, other pattern recognition receptors including peptidoglycan recognition proteins show no known serine protease activity and do not share any common structure, and indirectly activate serine proteases involved in the immune response. The functional and evolutionary connection of blood coagulation with innate immunity makes it an interesting subject to investigate the expression pattern of Factor C during microbial infection. Once activated by LPS, Factor C must be regulated spatially and temporally to limit and localize the immune response in the hemolymph. Currently, it is reported that the regulation of the limulus coagulation cascade appears to be limited to three types of serpin-related serine protease inhibitors. To date, research on the regulation of serine proteases involved in blood coagulation or developmental processes in other organisms has focused on the feedback regulation from within the cascade or the protein-protein interaction from protease inhibitors under normal physiological conditions. Although the limulus blood coagulation constitutes a primitive serine protease cascade, the knowledge we gained previously from the study on the protein structure and function has provided insights into the roles of serine proteases in fundamental biological processes (11.Ding J.L. Navas III, M.A. Ho B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29.Ding J.L. Navas III, M.A. Ho B. Mol. Marine Biol. Biotechnol. 1995; 4: 90-103PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Wang J. Tan N.S. Ho B. Ding J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36363-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By examining how the Factor C gene is regulated under bacterial infection at the transcriptional level, we sought to provide in-depth knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms controlling other serine proteases in immunologically challenging conditions. We report here the characterization of the Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda Factor C (CrFC) 5′-flanking region, cis-acting sites in the promoter region, and cognate transcription factors involved in its regulation. We demonstrate the transcriptional regulation of this unique serine protease during microbial infection and propose an in vivo model involving the interplay and competition among multiple cis-acting sites and/or probable upstream repressive elements that oppose a proximal κB binding element. Materials—Horseshoe crabs (C. rotundicauda) were collected from Kranji estuary, Singapore. Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATCC 27853, were cultured in tryptic soya broth (Difco, Detroit, MI). LPS from Escherichia coli O55:B5 was a product of Sigma. Human recombinant NFκB protein, p50, was from Promega. The mbn-2 cell line was a gift from Professor Y. Engstrom, Stockholm University, Sweden. Glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B was from Amersham Biosciences. Unless otherwise stated, all enzymes were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and molecular biology grade chemicals were from Sigma. Infection of Limulus—P. aeruginosa was cultured overnight in TSB at 37 °C. Bacteria was pelleted at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed in saline, and resuspended to the original culture volume in saline. Serial dilution and colony count were performed to determine colony forming units. Each time point constituted three experimental animals. The horseshoe crabs were injected with 2.5 × 106 colony forming units/kg of body weight. At various time points, the viable bacterial count in the hemolymph was determined by plating 100 μl of cell-free hemolymph or dilutions of it on TSA and cetrimide agar. Colonies were counted after overnight incubation at 37 °C. Northern Analysis—The tissue distribution of CrFC gene expression was studied by Northern analysis (31.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Hemolymph obtained by cardiac puncture (29.Ding J.L. Navas III, M.A. Ho B. Mol. Marine Biol. Biotechnol. 1995; 4: 90-103PubMed Google Scholar) were centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain amebocytes. Hepatopancreas, heart, intestine, and muscle were excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to homogenization just before use. Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL™ RNA extraction reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty μg of total RNA from each tissue was electrophoresed in a formaldehyde-treated 1% agarose gel and transferred overnight to a nylon membrane in 20× SSC solution (3 m NaCl and 0.3 m sodium citrate). The membrane was hybridized with a 2.1-kb fragment of the CrFC cDNA (GenBank™ accession number S77063) probe labeled by random priming with Rediprimer™ II (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then washed sequentially with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS; and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at 37 °C. Finally, the membrane was exposed overnight to x-ray film (Kodak) at -80 °C. For loading control, an 800-bp limulus actin-3 gene (32.Way M. Sanders M. Garcia Chafel C. Sakai J. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was used as probe. The existence of limulus Dorsal homologues was also probed by using a 2-kb fragment of Drosophila dorsal cDNA (33.Thisse C. Perrin-Schmitt F. Stoetzel F. Thisse B. Cell. 1991; 65: 1191-1201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Real Time PCR—Quantitative kinetic analysis of CrFC gene expression in response to Pseudomonas injection was conducted with the ABI PRISM™ 7000 system (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA from amebocytes and hepatopancreas were extracted at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h after injection. mRNAs were extracted using the Oligotex-direct mRNA purification kit (QIAgen). Aliquots of 200 ng of mRNA were used for every 20 μl of cDNA synthesis reaction, and 2 μl of the template was used in a 25-μl PCR reaction. The cDNA template was synthesized using Taqman™ reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed using SYBR™ Green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems). The primer concentrations were consistently at 600 nm. The results were analyzed by a comparative quantitative method using actin-3 as the endogenous control. Isolation of the CrFC Promoter—The genomic DNA was extracted from amebocytes and various genomic subclones were obtained by a PCR-based method of genome walking with the Universal Genome Walker system (Clontech). Briefly, various pools of adaptor-ligated genomic DNA fragments were generated. These genome walker libraries were used for PCR amplification, employing an outer adaptor primer (AP1) and a primary gene-specific primer (GSP1). A secondary nested PCR amplification was carried out with AP1 and another gene-specific primer (GSP2). The PCR-amplified genomic fragments were blunt endligated into the pT7Blue-3 Perfectly Blunt™ vector system (Novagen). Thus, the Factor C promoter and the 5′ region of its genomic sequence were obtained from the genomic library using gene-specific primer: 5′-GACACCAAAAACGACGCTAAGACCATAC-3, which contains the Factor C exon 1 sequence (GenBank™ accession number S77063). A fragment of 1.5 kb containing the leader signal and exon 1 was isolated and subcloned into pT7B3 vector. The 5′-flanking region in the resulting pT7B3pro1.5 clone was sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AF517565). Mapping Transcription Initiation Site by Primer Extension Assay—The primer extension assay was performed according to Mason et al. (34.Mason P.J. Enver T. Wilkinson D. Williams J.G. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 47-53Google Scholar) with various modifications. A probe derived entirely from within exon 1, 5′-GACACCAAAAACGACGCTAAGACCATAC-3′, was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Hybridization was carried out with 2.5 μg of mRNA and 2.5 fmol of the radiolabeled probe (specific activity of 106 cpm/pmol) in hybridization buffer (400 mm NaCl and 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.4) for 5–6 h at 55 °C. The primer extension reaction was performed using the annealed primer/mRNA mixture with the Superscript™ II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The primer extension product was resolved in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, alongside the A, T, G, and C sequencing ladder generated by the TaqTrack manual sequencing system (Promega). Construction of CrFC Promoter-Reporter Plasmids—To define essential cis-elements that transcriptionally control the CrFC gene expression, a nest of primers was designed to obtain sequential deletion constructs with the end fixed at the +1 site. The CAT reporter gene was used in the transfection assay for analyzing the promoter strength. pTKCAT vector was mutated to pMutTKCAT, in which two endogenous dorsal binding sites in the original vector were deleted using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Thus, using pT7B3pro1.5 as the template and a series of primers, different deletion fragments of the CrFC promoter were subcloned into compatible sites of the pMutTKCAT vector. In all the constructs, the CrFC promoter sequence (up to +43) was fused in-frame with the CAT reporter gene. The deletion constructs tested in the transient transfection assay extended to positions -1252, -1017, -682, -395, and -186, relative to the transcription start site (+1), and were termed pFL (full-length), p1017, p682, p395, and p186, respectively. All the plasmids used in the transfection assay were prepared by alkaline lysis and further purified through CsCl/ethidium bromide density gradient ultracentrifugation. Cell Culture and Transfection Assay—Drosophila S2 cells were used in transient transfection assays to define the regulatory sequence in the CrFC promoter region. Mbn-2 cells, which are responsive to LPS, were used to study the effect of LPS on the CrFC promoter. The S2 cells were maintained in DES expression medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Mbn-2 cells were cultured in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded 24 h before transfection at a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/3.5-cm culture well. Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation (Invitrogen) with 5 μg of reporter DNA, 1 μg of pACH110 (containing the β-galactosidase gene fused with the Drosophila actin promoter) as internal control (33.Thisse C. Perrin-Schmitt F. Stoetzel F. Thisse B. Cell. 1991; 65: 1191-1201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and 13 μg of pBluescript SKII plasmid to adjust the total amount of DNA in each transfection to 19 μg. In cotransfection assays, 1 μgof Drosophila pPACfl(dorsal) (33.Thisse C. Perrin-Schmitt F. Stoetzel F. Thisse B. Cell. 1991; 65: 1191-1201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) expression vector was used in each transfection with 12 μg of the pBluescript SKII. After 24 h, the culture medium was renewed and 48 h later, cells were harvested. CAT and β-galactosidase activities in the cell extracts were measured using the CAT and β-galactosidase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, respectively (Roche Diagnostics). Expression of CAT reporter gene was divided by β-galactosidase expression in each transfection experiment to normalize the transfection efficiency difference. To investigate the effect of LPS on the CrFC gene promoter, LPS from E. coli O55:B5 (Sigma) was added at 10 μg/ml into each well of transfected mbn-2 cells and incubated for 8 h before harvesting. Mutation of CrFC-κB and Its Adjacent GAAAA Motif—To further study the putative cis-elements in the CrFC promoter, the CrFC-κB motif at -133 bp and its adjacent GAAAA motif at -146 bp were mutated. By designing three sets of primers, the CrFC-κB motif was mutated by deleting its canonical GGGAAA sequence. The adjacent GAAAA motif was mutated by removing the AAAA site. The two sites were also combinatorially mutated using primers complementary to the template containing mutation of the CrFC-κB site. Primers used for this purpose were: 5′-GCACGAGAAAAAAGCCTCCATTAGAAATCAGCGCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCGCTGATTTCTAATGGAGGCTTTTTTCTCGTGC-3 (antisense) for mutation of the CrFC-κB; 5′-CTGTCATGCACGAGGCCGGGAAATCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGATTTCCCGGCCTCGTGCATGACAG-3 (antisense) for mutation of the adjacent GAAAA motif; 5′-GTCTGTCATGCACGAGGCCTCCATTAGAAATCAGCG-3′(sense) and 5′-CGCTGATTTCTAATGGAGGCCTCGTGCATGACAGAC-3′ (antisense) for double mutation of the two sites. Recombinant Expression and Partial Purification of Dorsal Protein—Rel and DNA binding domains of the dorsal transcription factor were amplified by PCR from the pPACfl(dorsal) expression vector. SmaI and NotI enzyme sites were introduced during PCR cycles and the fragments were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The primers were: 5′-GCTGCGGCCGCGAGGGTGTGAGCTCAGG-3′ (antisense) for the Rel domain amplification and 5′-GCTGCGGCCGCCTACACAGCCGGCAGAT-3′ (antisense) for the DNA binding domain. For PCR cycles, both antisense primers were paired with the same sense primer: 5′-GATCCCGGGGAACCAGAACAATGGAGCCG-3′. Briefly, the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21. After 3 h induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C, 500 ml of culture was pelleted and resuspended in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysate was prepared by using a French press (Basic Z 0.75KW Benchtop Cell Disruptor, UK) operated at 30 k.p.s.i., and immediately centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants containing either recombinant DNA binding domain or Rel domain of dorsal protein were separately applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min through the Sepharose™ 4B GST affinity column of 1-ml bed volume. The column was washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, followed by elution of the bound protein with 5 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) at the same flow rate. The recombinant proteins were confirmed by Western analysis with anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) with Dorsal and Human p50 —In each binding reaction with human recombinant NFκB p50 (Promega), 1 × 105 cpm/pmol probe was incubated with 20 ng of p50 protein in 30 μl of binding buffer at 25 °C for 30 min before electrophoresis on a native 6% PAGE gel (with acrylamide and bisacrylamide ratio of 79:1). The binding buffer for p50 contained 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Binding assay with the recombinant Drosophila dorsal protein was performed according to Ip et al. (35.Ip Y.T. Kraut R. Levine M. Rushlow C.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 439-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Recombinant Rel or DNA binding domain of dorsal protein at 50–100 ng each was used in each bindin"
