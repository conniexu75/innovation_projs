https://openalex.org/W2007256480,"The cellular gene encoding the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) has considerable homology to the oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus. In a human mammary carcinoma, a DNA sequence was identified that is related to v-erbB but amplified in a manner that appeared to distinguish it from the gene for the EGF receptor. Molecular cloning of this DNA segment and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of two putative exons in a DNA segment whose predicted amino acid sequence was closely related to, but different from, the corresponding sequence of the erbB/EGF receptor. Moreover, this DNA segment identified a 5-kilobase transcript distinct from the transcripts of the EGF receptor gene. Thus, a new member of the tyrosine kinase proto-oncogene family has been identified on the basis of its amplification in a human mammary carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2015326137,"The human T-cell lines MT-2 and MT-4 carry the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). When MT-2 and MT-4 were infected with HTLV-III, the probable etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), rapid cytopathogenic effects and cytotoxicity were observed that made it possible to titrate the biologically active virus in a plaque-forming assay. The cytopathogenic effects were preceded by the rapid induction and increase of HTLV-III antigens as revealed by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. Activities of HTLV-III were neutralized by the human antibodies against the virus when immunofluorescence and plaque assays were used. Essentially the same results were obtained with the lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV1)."
https://openalex.org/W2007918998,"We have characterized an in vitro transcription system derived from uninfected HeLa cells that accurately initiates RNA synthesis at the herpes virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. Analysis of linker-scanning, single-site, and promoter-inversion mutants reveals that the TK upstream elements previously mapped in vivo are accurately recognized in vitro. A protein fraction required for TK transcription in reconstitution experiments was found to contain multiple protein species that bind specifically to the TK promoter. DNAase I footprint experiments with wild-type and mutant promoters reveal that the TK upstream elements contain three distinctive protein binding sites, two of which appear to be recognized by the Sp1 transcription factor and one which interacts with a cellular protein that binds to ""CCAAT"" sequences. Optimal expression of the thymidine kinase gene appears to require the coordinate interaction of these two types of transcription factors with the three upstream elements of the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2012141473,"A novel transforming gene was detected by transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with human lymphoma DNA. The tumor DNA induced a single focus in primary transfections, whereas DNAs of transformed NIH cells induced transformation with high efficiencies in secondary and tertiary assays. Molecular clones spanning about 37 kb of human sequence were isolated from tertiary transformant DNA. Blot hybridization indicated that the transforming gene consisted of two segments that were unlinked in both normal human and primary lymphoma DNAs. The two segments of human DNA were cotranscribed in transformed NIH cells but not in any human cells examined. The transforming gene thus appeared to be activated by recombination between two unlinked human DNA segments, possibly by cointegration during transfection."

https://openalex.org/W1998461588,Expression of the pX protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) in animal cells demonstrates that this protein is a specific transcriptional activator of the long terminal repeats (LTR) of HTLV-I. Several other promoters are not affected by pX. No lymphocyte-specific factors are required for this activation. pX can be detected in the nucleus of transfected monkey kidney cells (line CV1) by indirect immunofluorescence. These results indicate that the pX protein is essential for the replication cycle of the virus and that it may be directly involved in the immortalization of human lymphocytes by HTLV-I.

https://openalex.org/W2018117114,"Many viral genomes, including those of SV40 and MuLV, are not efficiently expressed in undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells but are expressed in differentiated derivatives. This regulation appears to be at the level of transcription. We have used DNA-mediated gene transfer to analyze the function of several viral promoters in EC cells. We show that the SV40 early promoter works efficiently in an enhancer-independent fashion following transfection into un-differentiated cells. Strikingly, the promoter in the LTR of MSV does not function in such cells; but when upstream sequences, including the enhancer, are deleted expression ensues. Replacement of the SV40 enhancer by that of MSV results in inactivation of the SV40 early promoter in these cells. We propose that the undifferentiated cells contain a trans-acting regulatory factor (or factors) that reduces transcription by interacting with viral enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W1987205586,"Thrombin stimulates 32Pi incorporation into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bis-phosphate (PIP2), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), and initiates DNA synthesis in hamster (NIL) fibroblasts at a half-maximal concentration of 125 ng/ml. Neomycin, which binds PIP2 and PIP, inhibits both thrombin-stimulated initiation of cell proliferation and 32P pI incorporation into at concentrations above 2 mM without affecting thrombin binding, thymidine uptake, or cellular protein synthesis. At lower concentrations, neomycin inhibits thrombin-stimulated release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), by selectively binding PIP2, but does not inhibit 32P incorporation into PI or initiation of DNA synthesis. Phosphoinositide recycling and diacylglycerol release therefore appear necessary for initiation of cell proliferation by thrombin. IP3-stimulated Ca++ mobilization may not be required for thrombin mitogenesis, however, since neomycin can block IP3 release without inhibiting initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2169863303,"We have characterized the association of a nascent secretory protein with the microsomal membrane at two distinct stages in cell-free synthesis and translocation. Stage one corresponded to a nascent chain of approximately 70 residues generated via elongation arrest by the signal recognition particle (SRP). Binding to microsomal membranes occurred independently of chain elongation and required SRP receptor. Following binding, the 70-mer remained attached to the membrane after extraction of the ribosome. However, protein denaturants (4 M urea or alkaline pH) extracted the 70-mer from the membrane. Stage two of synthesis corresponded to nascent chains of approximately 158 residues generated by oligonucleotide-mediated hybrid arrest of translation. Again, these partially translocated nascent chains were extracted by 4 M urea. Therefore, the initial interaction of the signal sequence with the membrane as well as subsequent chain conductance occur in a microenvironment that is accessible to aqueous reagents. Thus, both processes probably require integral membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2014317403,"The DNA genomes of human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) isolated from 18 individuals with AIDS or who were at risk for AIDS were evaluated for evidence of variation. Although all of the 18 viral DNA's hybridized throughout their entire genomes to a full-length cloned probe of the original HTLV-III isolate, each of the 18 isolates showed a different restriction enzyme pattern. The number of restriction site differences between isolates ranged from only 1 site in 23 to at least 16 sites in 31. No particular viral genotype was associated with a particular disease state and 2 of the 18 patients had evidence of concurrent infection by more than one viral genotype. Propagation of three different viral isolates in vitro for up to 9 months did not lead to detectable changes in their restriction patterns. These findings indicate that different isolates of HTLV-III comprise a spectrum of highly related but distinguishable viruses and have important implications regarding the pathogenicity of HTLV-III and attempts to develop effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive measures for this virus."
https://openalex.org/W2039278637,"The white gene of Drosophila is expressed normally when introduced at many different sites in the genome by P-element-mediated DNA transformation, but is expressed abnormally when inserted at two particular genomic positions. It is now demonstrated that the mutant expression in these two cases is caused by the surrounding chromosomal region into which the white gene has been inserted. The white gene could be moved from these two positions, where it confers a mutant phenotype, to other positions in the genome where it confers a wild-type phenotype. However, flies in which white has been moved to one new location have an unusual mosaic phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1630286573,"The primary structure of the messenger RNA coding for cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was determined by sequencing cDNA and genomic DNA and by primer extension of the mRNA. The molecule is 2624 nucleotides in length; this includes 143 nontranslated nucleotides at the 5' end and 615 nontranslated nucleotides at the 3' end. The 3' nontranslated sequence contains a 102-base pair region of alternating purine-pyrimidine nucleotides (the majority of which are UpG dinucleotides), several direct repeats and palindromic sequences, and 8 CpG dinucleotides. The corresponding segment of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene thus has characteristics which favor the formation of Z-DNA. The amino acid sequence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was deduced from the mRNA sequence and confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometric analysis of peptides generated with trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The protein consists of 621 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 69,289. Charon 4A lambda bacteriophage clones containing genomic DNA coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were isolated from a library of partial HaeIII digests of rat liver DNA. Two clones, lambda PC112 and lambda PC103, contained the entire coding region in 15-kilobase inserts and were used to subclone the gene into pBR322 as EcoRI, BamHI, or SstI-KpnI fragments. Using these subclones, the structure of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene was determined by S1 nuclease mapping, R-loop analysis, and DNA sequencing. The gene is composed of 10 exons and 9 introns with a total length of 6.0 kilobases. The transcription initiation site of the gene was determined by a combination of in vitro transcription in a HeLa cell lysate system, primer extension of mRNAPEPCK, and S1 nuclease mapping. In vitro transcription of purified DNA templates revealed three RNA polymerase II-dependent start sites. Two sites were separated by 600 base pairs on the coding strand and the third site was on the noncoding strand. The products of S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension from a BglII site were compared in order to determine which of the coding strand initiation sites was expressed in vivo. In both cases a 69-base pair fragment was generated and the 5' end of this corresponded to a thymidine residue identified in a sequence ladder of the genomic DNA coding strand. We conclude that mRNAPEPCK synthesis initiates with an adenine residue 69 base pairs 5' of the BglII site; this corresponds to the 3' most transcription initiation site determined in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2053447701,"The coding sequences for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D, and the influenza virus hemagglutinin were inserted into a single vaccinia virus genome. Rabbits inoculated intravenously or intradermally with this polyvalent vaccinia virus recombinant produced antibodies reactive to all three authentic foreign antigens. In addition, the feasibility of multiple rounds of vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1515548591,"We have studied the Fe protein (Av2) of the Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase system with Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopies and magnetic susceptometry. In the oxidized state the protein exhibits Mossbauer spectra typical of diamagnetic [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. Addition of Mg.ATP or Mg.ADP causes a pronounced decline in the quadrupole splitting of the Mossbauer spectra of the oxidized protein. Our studies show that reduced Av2 in the native state is heterogeneous. Approximately half of the molecules contain a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster with electronic spin S = 1/2 and half contain a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster with spin S = 3/2. The former yields the characteristic g = 1.94 EPR signal whereas the latter exhibits signals around g = 5. The magnetization of reduced Av2 is dominated by the spin S = 3/2 form of its [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters. These results explain a long standing puzzle, namely why the integrated spin intensity of the g = 1.94 EPR signal is substantially less than 1 spin/4 Fe atoms. In 50% ethylene glycol, 90% of the clusters are in the spin S = 1/2 form whereas, in 0.4 M urea, 85% are in the S = 3/2 form. In 0.4 M urea, the EPR spectrum of reduced Av2 exhibits well defined resonances at g = 5.8 and 5.15, which we assign to the S = 3/2 system. The EPR and Mossbauer studies yield a zero-field splitting of 2D approximately equal to -5 cm-1 for this S = 3/2 state."
https://openalex.org/W1993910054,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs can cause regression of hormone-dependent breast carcinomas. These effects are thought to be mediated through the inhibition of gonadotropic and steroid hormones. These analogs may also act directly on the tumor because they are effective in treating breast cancer in some postmenopausal women. The presence of specific binding sites for gonadotropin-releasing hormone was demonstrated in human breast carcinomas by means of a novel approach of ligand immunoblotting. The results indicate a possible mechanism by which the peptide has direct effects on this tissue. These binding proteins were not detectable in non-neoplastic breast tissue.
https://openalex.org/W1534525572,"Several lines of evidence indicate that the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (GP IIb-IIIa) is necessary for the expression of platelet fibrinogen receptors. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether purified GP IIb-IIIa retains the properties of the fibrinogen receptor on platelets. Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa was incorporated by detergent dialysis into phospholipid vesicles composed of 30% phosphatidylcholine and 70% phosphatidylserine. 125I-Fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb-IIIa vesicles, as measured by filtration, had many of the characteristics of 125I-fibrinogen binding to whole platelets or isolated platelet plasma membranes: binding was specific, saturable, reversible, time dependent, and Ca2+ dependent. The apparent dissociation constant for 125I-fibrinogen binding to GP IIb-IIIa vesicles was 15 nM, and the maximal binding capacity was 0.1 mol of 125I-fibrinogen/mol of GP IIb-IIIa. 125I-Fibrinogen binding was inhibited by amino sugars, the GP IIb and/or IIIa monoclonal antibody 10E5, and the decapeptide from the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain. Furthermore, little or no 125I-fibrinogen bound to phospholipid vesicles lacking protein or containing proteins other than GP IIb-IIIa (i.e. bacteriorhodopsin, apolipoprotein A-I, or glycophorin). Also, other 125I-labeled plasma proteins (transferrin, orosomucoid) did not bind to the GP IIb-IIIa vesicles. These results demonstrate that GP IIb-IIIa contains the platelet fibrinogen receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1592692300,"Abstract P-57 is a novel calmodulin-binding protein which has recently been isolated from bovine cerebral cortex (Andreasen, T. J., Luetje, C. W., Heideman, W., and Storm, D. R. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 4615-4618). In contrast to all other calmodulin-binding proteins characterized thus far, P-57 has equivalent or higher affinity for calmodulin in the absence of free Ca2+ compared to the presence of Ca2+. In this study, the distribution of P-57 in other tissues and within brain was examined using a radioimmune assay and photoaffinity labeling with azido-125I-calmodulin. P-57 was not found in tissues other than brain, retina, and spinal cord. Within brain, P-57 levels varied from 0.1% of the total protein in white matter regions to about 0.5% in cell body-rich fractions. The protein was found in both membrane and soluble fractions. P-57 is the most abundant calmodulin-binding protein in brain and appears to be neural specific. The concentrations of P-57 in brain and its affinity for calmodulin in the absence of Ca2+ are sufficient to complex a significant fraction of the total calmodulin present."

https://openalex.org/W2022066607,"Coronavirus-like particles were found by electron microscopy in stools from infants with necrotizing enterocolitis. Stool samples from these infants as well as control specimens were passaged in cultures of human fetal intestinal organs. Two samples yielded virus-like particles and these have now been passaged 14 times (HEC 14). Gradient-purified HEC 14 strains had typical coronavirus morphology on electron microscopy and contained five major proteins with molecular sizes ranging from 190 to 23 kilodaltons. Infants with necrotizing enterocolitis developed specific antibody to the viral antigens between the acute and convalescent stages of the disease, as shown by examining serum specimens by single radial hemolysis, immunoenzymatic assay, and Western immunoblotting. No cross-reactivity was shown with other coronavirus strains tested, or with the newly isolated viruses of the Breda-Berne group, responsible for calf or horse diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W1480452288,"Abstract The nucleotide sequences of cDNAs coding for human salivary proline-rich proteins (PRPs) were determined. Clones cP1 and cP2 contain repetitive regions in which sites for the restriction enzyme HaeIII occur repeatedly; they code for the precursors of acidic PRPs. Clones cP3 to cP7 contain repetitive regions in which BstNI sites occur repeatedly; they code for precursors of basic and glycosylated PRPs. The clones cP3, cP4, and cP5 are identical except that cP4 and cP5 are missing 399 and 459 base pairs, respectively, from the repetitive region of cP3. The sequences at these deletion end points are homologous to the consensus sequences of RNA splicing donor and acceptor sites. This strongly suggests that all three cDNAs are derived from the transcript of a single gene via differential RNA splicing. All of the precursor proteins share a feature--the N-terminal region, following the signal peptide, is acidic, while the remainder of the molecule, made of proline-rich repeats of about 21 amino acids, is basic. Each precursor can generate multiple PRPs by various post-translational cleavages on the carboxylic side of specific arginine residues. The data show how differential RNA splicing and post-translational cleavages could generate a large number of proteins, such as those found in saliva, from a much smaller number of genes."
https://openalex.org/W1516256265,"Canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is phosphorylated by an endogenous calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase on a 22,000 proteolipid, called phospholamban. Phosphorylation by the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is associated with stimulation of the initial rates of calcium transport (Davis, B. A., Schwartz, A., Samaha, F. J., and Kranias, E. G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13587-13591). The present study shows that protein phosphatase activity, associated with canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, can catalyze dephosphorylation of the calcium-calmodulin-dependent sites on phospholamban. The activity was maximally stimulated by manganese; fluoride was inhibitory, but its effect was reversible. Dephosphorylation of phospholamban, which was prephosphorylated by calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, resulted in a reduction of the stimulation on calcium transport rates, particularly at submaximal calcium concentrations. The decrease in calcium transport was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the apparent affinity (EC50) for calcium. Rephosphorylation of phospholamban by the endogenous calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase caused full recovery of the stimulation on calcium transport rates and reversal of the effects mediated by the protein phosphatase. Thus, the calcium pump in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum appears to be under reversible regulation mediated by endogenous calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein phosphatase. Such regulation may represent an important control mechanism for the myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W1610892577,"Binding sites in rabbit aorta membranes for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) have been specifically and covalently labeled by two methods. In the first, the photoreactive analog of ANF, 125I-azidobenzoyl-ANF, was synthesized and used to photoaffinity label ANF receptors. In the second, 125I-ANF was covalently attached to its binding site by treatment of the 125I-ANF-receptor complex with bifunctional cross-linking agents. Analysis of the labeled proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed that by both methods the same three protein bands were labeled. These bands had apparent molecular masses of 60,000, 70,000, and 120,000 daltons. With the photoaffinity label, half-maximal inhibition of labeling of each of these bands was achieved when approximately 200 pM of unlabeled ANF was included in the binding assay. These results suggest that these three different polypeptides are specific components of ANF receptors in rabbit aorta membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1512160880,"The three major proteins of mammalian neurofilaments of molecular weights 179,000 (NF1), 129,000 (NF2), and 66,500 (NF3) have been purified to homogeneity by multiple anion-exchange and hydroxylapatite absorption chromatography in 8 M urea. Silver staining of polyacrylamide gels of the purified proteins show single bands. In order to gain further insight into the molecular organization of the neurofilament triplet proteins, the molar stoichiometries and morphologies of native and reconstituted filaments and those isolated from developing brain were studied. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by quantitative dye-binding analysis shows that the molar ratio of the three components in neurofilaments isolated from bovine spinal cord myelinated nerve is 4:2:1 (NF3:NF2:NF1). Comparison of the molar ratios of each component in neurofilaments isolated from rat, bovine, and human brain shows a variation in the ratio of each of these polypeptides and raises questions about the physiological uniqueness of the molar composition of the neurofilament triplet. Reconstitution of the three bovine polypeptides into 10-nm filaments was accomplished under conditions in which the NF3 protein was limiting. Reassembly of 10-nm filaments with varying amounts of NF2 and NF1 indicate that the NF3 homopolymer has a limiting capacity to bind NF2 and NF1 and is saturated at a molar ratio of 2:2:1 (NF3:NF2:NF1). Isolation of the neurofilament complex at various stages of rat brain maturation indicates that NF3 and NF2 are integrated into the neurofilament complex as early as embryonic day 17, while NF1 copurifies with these proteins at postnatal day 16, eventually reaching a molar stoichiometry of 2:2:1 in the adult rat. The molecular stoichiometry of the neurofilament proteins, the differential integration of these proteins during brain development, and the variation of the molar composition between mammalian species suggest accessory roles for the NF2 and NF1 proteins in the neurofilament complex."

https://openalex.org/W1995005299,"To test the hypothesis that interfamily variability in Huntington's Disease (HD) is due to mutation at different loci, linkage analysis was undertaken in two large HD kindreds that differed in ethnicity, age-at-onset, and neurologic and psychiatric features. Both families showed linkage of the HD locus to the G8 probe. Several recombinants were documented in each family, and the best estimate of the recombination fraction for the two families was 6 percent with a 95 percent confidence interval of 0 to 12 percent. Although the data support the existence of a single HD locus, use of the G8 probe for presymptomatic testing in these kindreds would have resulted in a 12 percent error rate in genotype assignment at the HD locus."
https://openalex.org/W1496309518,"Calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase isolated from bovine brain consists of a catalytic subunit A (Mr = 60,000) and a regulatory subunit B (Mr = 19,000) present in equal molar ratios. The two subunits were dissociated by gel filtration in 6 M urea and reconstituted to investigate the role of calmodulin and subunit B in regulating the phosphatase activity of subunit A. The activity of subunit A was stimulated 2-fold by calmodulin, 13-fold by subunit B, and 21-fold by both, indicating that the effects of both were synergistic. Maximum stimulation by calmodulin was observed at a calmodulin to subunit A molar ratio of 2:1 in the presence or absence of subunit B, whereas that by subunit B was observed at a B to A molar ratio of 3:1 in the presence or absence of calmodulin. Calmodulin and subunit B increased the Vmax of subunit A 2- and 5-fold, respectively, but had little effect on the Km for casein. The specific activity of the phosphatase reconstituted from subunits A and B reached 86% that of the native enzyme, whereas that of the holoenzyme reached 90%. Subunit B, even though similar to calmodulin in many respects, did not stimulate the activity of native phosphatase, suggesting that it cannot substitute for calmodulin. Limited trypsinization of subunit A increased its catalytic activity to the level observed with calmodulin; and this activity was further stimulated by subunit B but not by calmodulin. These results indicate that subunit A of phosphatase contains one catalytic domain and two distinct regulatory domains, one for calmodulin, and another for subunit B, that these two proteins do not substitute for one another and that they stimulate subunit A synergistically."
https://openalex.org/W2063888147,"The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), causes mild encephalitis and chronic demyelination. Immunohistochemical techniques showed that MHV-A59-infected C57BL/6 mice contained dense deposits of viral antigen in the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra, with fewer signs of infection in other regions of the brain. The animals showed extra- and intracellular vacuolation, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the subthalamic-nigral region. Such localization is unprecedented among known viral encephalitides of humans and other species. This infection by a member of a viral class capable of causing both encephalitis and persistent infection in several species may be related to postencephalitic parkinsonism."
https://openalex.org/W2094823276,"Three sequence components direct high affinity binding of dimeric SV40 T antigen to SV40 origin region I. Two signals are encoded by two directly repeated 5′-GAGGC-3′ pentanucleotides. Approximately equal contributions to binding stability are made by each pentanucleotide, and both spacing and orientation of the pentanucleotides are important for binding affinity. The third vital component is contained in a 5′-TTTTTTG-3′ spacer sequence that separates the pentanucleotides. Sequence-specific features of the spacer stabilize binding to the adjacent pentanucleotides. The asymmetry of the spacer suggests that a novel binding mechanism is involved. Because the alignment of T antigen on mutant and wild-type DNAs is similar, we propose that any two of the three sequence signals are sufficient to determine the unique arrangement of a bound protein dimer."
https://openalex.org/W4471112,"A modified method for S1 nuclease assay has been developed to quantitate an amount of radioactive transcripts in the presence of unlabeled homologous RNA. Using this method, we have assayed in vitro transcription of fibroin gene on circular and linear templates. In a posterior silk gland cell extract, covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA forms the superhelical state and supports three to 10 times more transcription than nicked circular or linear DNA does. The efficient transcription on ccc template is also observed in a middle silk gland cell extract but never seen in a HeLa cell extract. When the posterior silk gland cell extract is first incubated with pBR322 DNA and then challenged for the fibroin gene transcription on ccc DNA, the pBR322 DNA of the ccc form, but not of the linear one, inhibits the reaction. A deletion mutant carrying only 44 base pairs of the 5'-flanking sequence reserves the preference of the ccc template, but seven single-point mutants at the TATA box and -20 region abolish it. These results suggest that some components in the silk gland extract supercoil ccc DNA and stimulate the fibroin gene transcription in the absence of the upstream enhancing sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1575373280,"Treatment of isolated fat cells with insulin produced increases of up to 4.8-fold in the incorporation of [3H]inositol into phosphatidylinositol. This effect of insulin was both time- and dose-dependent with half-maximal stimulation at 30 microunits/ml of insulin. Insulin increased the labeling of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate but not phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate in cells which had been preincubated with [3H]inositol for 90 min. Incubation of the cells in a Ca2+-free buffer increased the basal level of phosphatidylinositol labeling and enhanced the effect of insulin. Glucagon and isoprenaline, both of which stimulate lipolysis, had no effect on phosphatidylinositol labeling but did potentiate insulin-stimulated incorporation of [3H]inositol into phosphatidylinositol. Phosphoinositide breakdown was measured by the accumulation of inositol phosphates. Insulin did not increase the level of the inositol phosphates at all concentrations of the hormone tested. By comparison, phenylephrine and vasopressin were able to stimulate phosphoinositide breakdown. Pretreatment of the cells with insulin enhanced the effect of phenylephrine on inositol phosphates' accumulation, suggesting that insulin may potentiate phenylephrine-mediated phosphoinositide turnover. From these data we conclude that insulin stimulates the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, but has no effect on phosphoinositide breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W1540869004,"Adenosine modifies the catalytic activity of adenylate cyclase through both inhibitory (A1 or Ri) as well as stimulatory (A2 or Ra) cell surface receptors. We developed 125I-labeled N6-2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyladenosine as a selective ligand to probe the structure of A1 receptors. The binding of this radioligand to rat cerebral cortex or adipocyte membranes is saturable, reversible, and of high affinity (KD approximately 2 nM). A1 receptor agonists antagonize binding stereoselectivity and with a potency order appropriate for A1 receptors. The heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent N-succinimidyl-6-(4-azido-2-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate covalently couples the radioligand to a protein of Mr = 38,000 in both tissues as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Inhibition of covalent labeling by adenosine analogs exhibited the stereoselectivity and potency order typical of A1 receptor ligands. Guanine nucleotides reduced both specific binding and covalent incorporation of the radioligand, evidence that the radioligand is an A1 receptor agonist. These results suggest that the A1 receptor binding subunit of both brain and adipocytes resides on a protein of Mr = 38,000. The new radioligand should prove useful in studying the structure and regulation of A1 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W198282312,"The effect of decreasing the concentration of receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on the surface of cloned rat pituitary (GH3) cells on TRH-stimulated inositol trisphosphate (Ins-P3) formation was investigated. Incubation of cells with dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) for 16 h caused a decrease in [3H] TRH binding to intact cells to a minimum level 37 +/- 9.1% of control. Scatchard analysis of the concentration dependency of [3H]TRH binding showed that the effect of Bt2cAMP was to lower the receptor concentration without affecting its affinity for TRH. Similar decreases in [3H]TRH binding were found in cells incubated with 8-bromo-cAMP, cholera toxin, and sodium butyrate and, as shown previously, with TRH. In cells incubated with 1 mM Bt2cAMP for 16 h, but not for 1 h, the maximum TRH-induced increase in Ins-P3 was inhibited to 25 +/- 3.2% of that in control cells. Inhibition of TRH-induced Ins-P3 formation was also observed in cells treated with 8-bromo-cAMP, cholera toxin, and sodium butyrate for 16 h, and with TRH for 48 h. Inhibition of TRH-induced Ins-P3 formation and lowering of TRH receptor concentration caused by Bt2cAMP occurred in parallel with increasing doses of Bt2cAMP; at 16 h of exposure, half-maximal effects occurred with 0.3 mM Bt2cAMP. The concentration dependency of TRH-induced Ins-P3 formation was the same in control and Bt2cAMP-treated cells; half-maximal effects occurred with 10 nM TRH. These data demonstrate that decreases in TRH receptor concentration caused by several agents that act via different mechanisms are associated with reduced stimulation of Ins-P3 formation and suggest that the TRH receptor is tightly coupled to stimulation of hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by a phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1493092438,"The optical electron paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectral properties of the two iron-sulfur centers present in milk xanthine oxidase have been reexamined. It is found in the case of the optical spectral change observed on reduction of the enzyme that the two centers contribute approximately equally, with a ratio of spectral contributions for Fe/S I and Fe/S II of 0.55:0.45. This conclusion is based both on the behavior of the spectral change at wavelengths where only the two iron-sulfur centers contribute to the spectral change (under experimental conditions minimizing the effect of flavin semiquinone) during reductive titrations and a comparison of the spectra of 1- and 2-electron reduced enzyme under different conditions. This very similar spectral weighting for the two centers applies throughout the visible region. In the case of the EPR spectra, it is found from computer simulation of the signals observed under nonsaturating conditions that iron-sulfur center II exhibits g values of 1.902, 1.991, and 2.110 and does not exhibit two g values above that for the free electron, as has been reported (Lowe, J., Lynden-Bell, R.M., and Bray, R. C. (1972) Biochem. J. 130, 239-249). The g values for iron-sulfur center I obtained from the simulations are 1.894, 1.932, and 2.022. Finally, Mossbauer spectra of xanthine oxidase have been obtained, and it is found that while the two iron-sulfur centers are indistinguishable in the oxidized state, the ferrous iron in one of the reduced iron-sulfur centers exhibits an unusually large quadrupole coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1521500232,"Flagellar plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from sea urchin sperm using osmotic lysis. A membrane impermeant fluorescence pH indicator, pyranine, was incorporated into the vesicles as they resealed after lysis and was used to measure the intravesicular pH (pHi). Addition of Na+ rapidly alkalinized the pHi of vesicles prepared with an internal acidic pH gradient. The pHi increase showed ionic selectivity in the order of Na+ greater than Li+ much greater than K+ approximately equal to Cs+ approximately equal to O. Complete removal of monovalent anions such as Cl- and HCO3- did not affect the exchange, thus ruling out the participation of an anion carrier in the process. The optimal operation of the exchanger, however, required the presence of a transmembrane potential, which could be generated by the diffusion potential of either K+, a naturally permeant ion, or Cs+ which was artificially made permeant by the ionophore valinomycin. Depolarization inhibited the exchange in both the forward and the reverse directions, which is consistent with the voltage-gated electroneutral exchange mechanism proposed previously for this exchanger (Lee, H. C. J. Biol. Chem. (1984) 259, 15315-15319). The voltage sensitivity of the Na+/H+ exchanger was found to be modulated by the presence of Mg2+. A model involving the screening of the internal surface potential was proposed to account for the Mg2+ effect. The vesicle preparation used in this study allows complete control of the internal contents and represents a major simplification of the system as compared with the intact sperm and the isolated flagella used previously."
https://openalex.org/W1974457084,"We have identified a new gene, tnpM, in Tn21 that encodes the 12.6 kilodalton modulator protein. The Tn21 modulator enhances Tn21 transposition and suppresses resolution of cointegrate replicons in vivo. A putative binding site may be located in the N-terminal portion of the TnpR (resolvase) structural gene sequences. Tn501 transposition and cointegrate resolution can be regulated by the subcloned tnpM gene of Tn21 in trans-complementation experiments. Examination of the Tn501 DNA sequence also reveals a potential tnpM coding sequence upstream of the Tn501 resolvase gene. We conclude that Tn21 and Tn501 are different from Tn3 and Tn1000 both in genome organization and in regulation of transposition functions."
https://openalex.org/W4944205,"Human platelet agonists such as thrombin, ADP, and collagen stimulate the rapid expression of fibrinogen receptors. In other cell types, calcium-activated proteases have been suggested to participate in the mechanism of expression of cell surface receptors (Lynch, G., and Baudry, M. (1984) Science 224, 1057-1063). In platelets the majority of the neutral protease activity is calcium-activated protease. We examined the effects of leupeptin and antipain, two calcium-activated protease inhibitors, on the expression of platelet fibrinogen receptors. These inhibitors abolished thrombin and ADP-induced fibrinogen binding. This inhibition required the addition of leupeptin or antipain prior to the agonist and was not due to displacement of fibrinogen from its receptor or inhibition of agonist binding to platelets. Leupeptin and antipain also inhibited fibrinogen-independent thrombin-stimulated release of serotonin. These results are discussed in relation to the involvement of calcium-activated protease in early events of platelet activation."

In 4 of 30 pairs, stimulation of the caudal cell elicited a monosynaptic electrochemical excitatory postsynaptic potential in the rostral cell. Fifty percent of such pairs were synaptically linked in control lampreys without transections. These results show regeneration of functional synaptic connections between individual neurons in a vertebrate central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W217155132,"Electron paramagnetic resonance studies of Complex II from the mitochondrial respiratory chain and soluble preparations of succinate dehydrogenase have, for the first time, identified a signal arising from a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster, S2, in dithionite-reduced samples. Redox titrations, monitored by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that this signal appears at the same midpoint potential as the enhancement of the spin relaxation properties of the [2Fe-2S]1+ center, S1, in both Complex II and reconstitutively active soluble enzyme. The results complement recent magnetic circular dichroism studies of succinate dehydrogenase (Johnson, M. K., Morningstar, J. E., Bennett, D. E., Ackrell, B. A. C., and Kearney, E. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7368-7378) which assigned cluster S2 as a [4Fe-4S]2+,1+ center and provide evidence for spin interaction between the paramagnetic reduced forms of centers S1 and S2."
https://openalex.org/W1485414694,"Porcine luteal LH/hCG receptor (LH/hCG R) was solubilized with 70-80% recovery from the crude plasma membrane fraction by Triton X-100 in the presence of 25% glycerol and protease inhibitors. The solubilized receptor maintained 90% of original activity at -60 degrees C for 90 days. Equilibrium association constant (Ka) values of 1.92, 2.22, and 2.03 X 10(10) M-1 were observed for the whole homogenate, plasma membrane fraction, and solubilized LH/hCG R preparations, respectively. The specific binding capacity for the same fractions were 49, 70, 55 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Complexes of LH/hCG R and Triton X-100 were resolved into two components with approximate Mr = 2.7 X 10(5) and 5.4 X 10(5) by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B and two glycoprotein components by chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose. Solubilized porcine LH/hCG R was purified by two cycles of affinity chromatography on highly purified hCG-Sepharose with an overall recovery of 30-35% of the initial activity in the Triton extract. Purified porcine LH/hCG R had a specific binding capacity of 2300 pmol/mg protein and a Ka = 1.5 X 10(10) M-1. Silver staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels demonstrated that the major protein in porcine LH/hCG R preparations has Mr = 68,000. A weakly staining band at Mr = 45,000 was also observed in the purified receptor preparation. Analysis of iodinated purified LH/hCG R by autoradiography has confirmed these results. Porcine LH/hCG R was purified 40,000-fold by this method."
https://openalex.org/W1487647212,"The biosynthesis and post-translational processing of the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptor has been studied in H-35 hepatoma cells using a specific polyclonal anti-receptor immunoglobulin preparation. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine followed by incubation with excess unlabeled methionine (chase). Gel electrophoresis of the immunoadsorbed receptors shows that the receptor is first synthesized as a 245-kDa precursor which is transformed to the mature 250-kDa form with a half-time of about 2 h. The 245-kDa precursor could also be labeled biosynthetically with [3H]mannose, only one-half of which was ultimately found associated with the 250-kDa product. Neuraminidase converts the 250-kDa receptor species to a 245-kDa form. Whereas the 250-kDa receptor is insensitive to detectable cleavage by endoglycosidase H, digestion of the 245-kDa species with this enzyme produces a 232-kDa form. A similar 232-kDa receptor species accumulates in H-35 cells incubated with tunicamycin (2 micrograms/ml). This tunicamycin-induced aglyco-receptor is not further processed to the 250-kDa form. Monensin (50 nM) blocks receptor processing at the 245-kDa stage. Endoglycosidase H treatment of the monensin-induced 245-kDa species indicates that this is a mixture of partially processed precursors having equivalent Mr. No evidence was obtained for the presence of O-linked oligosaccharides on the IGF-II receptor. The IGF-II binding activity of the three different biosynthetic forms of the receptor was assessed by affinity cross-linking of 125I-IGF-II to the receptors using disuccinimidyl suberate. Both the mature 250-kDa receptor and the neuraminidase-digested 245-kDa form specifically bound 125-I-IGF-II. However, the 232-kDa aglyco-receptor had no detectable IGF-II binding activity using this method. In summary, these studies show: 1) that the H-35 cell IGF-II receptor is synthesized first as a 245-kDa precursor having 4-6 high-mannose oligosaccharide side chains, 2) processing of the receptor oligosaccharides by mannose removal and terminal sialylation converts the 245-kDa precursor to the 250-kDa mature product which has been previously identified as the functional receptor in the plasma membrane, 3) the apparent molecular mass of the receptor in the absence of N-glycosylation is 232-kDa, and 4) glycosylation of the IGF-II receptor is required for the acquisition of IGF-II binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1545939844,"Abstract A mechanism of activation of the ATP.Mg-dependent protein phosphatase (FC.M) has been proposed (Jurgensen, S., Shacter, E., Huang, C. Y., Chock, P. B., Yang, S.-D., Vandenheede, J. R., and Merlevede, W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5864-5870) in which a transient phosphorylation by the kinase FA of the modulator subunit (M) is the driving force for the transition of the inactive catalytic subunit (FC) into its active conformation. Incubation of FC.M with kinase FA and Mg2+ and adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate results in thiophosphorylation of M and also a conformational change in the phosphatase catalytic subunit; however, the enzyme remains inactive. Proteolysis of this inactive, thiophosphorylated complex causes proteolytic destruction of the modulator subunit and yields an active phosphorylase phosphatase species. Similar treatment of the native inactive enzyme does not yield active phosphatase. Evidence is presented, suggesting that a molecule of modulator is bound at an inhibitory site on the native enzyme. This modulator does not prevent the conformational change in the phosphatase catalytic subunit upon incubation with kinase FA and ATP.Mg but does partially inhibit the expression of the phosphorylase phosphatase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1599618000,"The anthracenedione antineoplastic agents mitoxantrone and ametantrone are potent inhibitors of basal and drug-stimulated lipid peroxidation in a variety of subcellular systems (Kharasch, E. D., and Novak, R. F. (1983) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 226, 500-506). The mechanism by which these compounds function as antioxidants has been investigated using enzymic and chemical systems. Mitoxantrone and ametantrone inhibited NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase- and xanthine oxidase-catalyzed conjugated diene formation from linoleic acid in a concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal inhibition achieved at approximately 0.5 microM anthracenedione. Inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation was not attributable to a decrease in P-450 reductase activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging, or iron chelation by the anthracenediones. Nonenzymic fatty acid peroxidation was also inhibited by the anthracenediones. Linoleic acid oxidation initiated by superoxide (ferrous iron autoxidation) or by hydroxyl radicals (Fenton's reagent) was diminished by mitoxantrone and ametantrone after a brief delay, suggesting an effect subsequent to activated oxygen-dependent initiation. In contrast, linoleic acid oxidation initiated by iron-dependent hydroperoxide decomposition was inhibited immediately. Reinitiation of linoleic acid oxidation in an anthracenedione-inhibited system was accomplished only by superoxide generation, but not by fatty acid hydroperoxide decomposition. These results suggest the anthracenediones diminished neither oxygen radical formation nor oxygen radical-dependent initiation of peroxidation. Rather, inhibition of fatty acid peroxidation by mitoxantrone and ametantrone results from the inhibition of hydroperoxide-dependent initiation and propagation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1609381319,"Previous studies showed that when the signal sequence plus 9 amino acid residues from the amino terminus of the major lipoprotein of Escherichia coli was fused to beta-lactamase, the resulting hybrid protein was modified, proteolytically processed, and assembled into the outer membrane as was the wild-type lipoprotein (Ghrayeb, J., and Inouye, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 463-467). We have constructed several hybrid proteins with mutations at the cleavage site of the prolipoprotein signal peptide. These mutations are known to block the lipid modification of the lipoprotein at the cysteine residue, resulting in the accumulation of unprocessed, unmodified prolipoprotein in the outer membrane. The mutations blocked the lipid modification of the hybrid protein. However, in contrast to the mutant lipoproteins, the cleavage of the signal peptides for the mutant hybrid proteins did occur, although less efficiently than the unaltered prolipo-beta-lactamase. The mutant prolipo-beta-lactamase proteins were cleaved at a site 5 amino acid residues downstream of the prolipoprotein signal peptide cleavage site. This new cleavage between alanine and lysine residues was resistant to globomycin, a specific inhibitor for signal peptidase II. This indicates that signal peptidase II, the signal peptidase which cleaves the unaltered prolipo-beta-lactamase, is not responsible for the new cleavage. The results demonstrate that the cleavage of the signal peptide is a flexible process that can occur by an alternative pathway when the normal processing pathway is blocked."
https://openalex.org/W1559478089,"The transverse distribution of the phospholipids in vesicular H+-translocating membranes prepared from pig gastric mucosa was investigated with the aid of phospholipase C, sphingomyelinase, and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The major part (80-90%) of the phosphatidylcholine and the phosphatidylethanolamine, 60% of the phosphatidylserine, and 45% of the sphingomyelin was located on the external, cytoplasmic side of the vesicle membranes. After treatment with phospholipase C the vesicles still behaved as osmometers and appeared as closed vesicles on the electron micrographs. 31P NMR indicated that the phospholipids in untreated vesicles as well as the unhydrolyzed phospholipids in phospholipase C-treated vesicles were arranged in lamellar structures. The 31P NMR spectrum of untreated vesicles to which Pr3+ ions had been added supported the conclusion that the major part of the membrane phospholipids was located on the external surface of the vesicles. A small fraction of the lipids, 3.6 mol %, was found to consist of glycosphingolipids which occurred at a concentration of 52 nmol/mg of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1646082574,"Radioimmunoassay and quantitative immunoblot analysis have been developed for quantitation of the iron-sulfur protein of cytochrome bc1 complex in order to compare its content in isolated cytochrome bc1 complex with that in electron transport particles. The result by radioimmunoassay indicated that the content of the iron-sulfur protein/mol of cytochrome b is higher by approximately 30%, on the average, in electron transport particles than in cytochrome bc1 complex. This observation was supported by the data of immunoblot analysis. Since approximately 1/3 of cytochrome b in electron transport particles is not attributed to cytochrome bc1 complex, but to succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (Davis, K.A., Hatefi, Y., Poff, K. L., and Butler, W. L. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 325, 341-356), the ratio of the iron-sulfur protein detectable by radioimmunoassay in electron transport particles to that in cytochrome bc1 complex is calculated to be approximately 2 on the basis of the content of 2 mol of b-type heme/mol of the complex. Therefore, it appears that the mitochondrial inner membrane contains approximately two times as much of the immunoreactive iron-sulfur protein as what is expected from the stoichiometry of one iron-sulfur center and two b-type hemes for cytochrome bc1 complex. This finding affords an interesting aspect in the study of biogenesis of cytochrome bc1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1661345441,"Abstract Guanine nucleotide-dependent modulation of agonist binding to the beta-receptor reflects coupling of the receptor to the nucleotide regulatory protein. Similarly, guanine nucleotide-dependent stimulation of adenylate cyclase can be used as an index of coupling between the regulatory protein and the catalytic unit of the cyclase. Using both approaches we have studied coupling in the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system in rabbit liver during neonatal development. With [3H]dihydroalprenolol as ligand, the Bmax was relatively unchanged (200-300 fmol/mg of protein) between birth and end of day 1 and was similar to adult values. Guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate-dependent shift in agonist (l-isoproterenol) competition curves was biphasic, decreasing from 10-fold in membranes isolated from animals at term to about 6-fold in membranes from 6-h-old neonates, and increasing progressively in older animals to a maximal measurable value of 42-fold in the adult. The ability of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, GTP, GTP plus isoproterenol, NaF, or forskolin to activate adenylate cyclase was also biphasic and age-dependent. With Mn2+ the measured activity was not at any time greater than the activity at term. Pretreatment of membranes with cholera toxin resulted in differential levels of enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity wherein much lower enhancement was observed in membranes from neonatal animals. With [32P]NAD as substrate, cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of membranes indicated development-dependent accumulation of Ns peptides. From these results we suggest that there is a decreased efficiency in the coupling of the beta-adrenergic receptor to hepatic adenylate cyclase in early neonatal life. The molecular basis for the biphasic nature of the coupling is presently unclear."

We have now synthesized the radiolabeled C-IVDU analogue, C-[125I]IVDU, and determined its metabolism by HSV-infected and mock-infected Vero cells. C-[125I]IVDU was effectively phosphorylated by HSV-1-infected cells and, to a lesser extent, HSV-2-infected cells. C-[125I]IVDU was not phosphorylated to an appreciable extent by either mock-infected cells or cells that had been infected with a thymidine kinase-deficient mutant of HSV-1. Furthermore, C-[125I]IVDU was incorporated into both viral and cellular DNA of HSV-1-infected Vero cells. This finding represents the first demonstration of the incorporation of a cyclopentylpyrimidine into DNA."
