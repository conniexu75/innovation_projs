https://openalex.org/W3036298167,"The rapid increase in telemedicine coupled with recent advances in diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) create the imperative to consider the opportunities and risks of inserting AI-based support into new paradigms of care. Here we build on recent achievements in the accuracy of image-based AI for skin cancer diagnosis to address the effects of varied representations of AI-based support across different levels of clinical expertise and multiple clinical workflows. We find that good quality AI-based support of clinical decision-making improves diagnostic accuracy over that of either AI or physicians alone, and that the least experienced clinicians gain the most from AI-based support. We further find that AI-based multiclass probabilities outperformed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) representations of AI in the mobile technology environment, and AI-based support had utility in simulations of second opinions and of telemedicine triage. In addition to demonstrating the potential benefits associated with good quality AI in the hands of non-expert clinicians, we find that faulty AI can mislead the entire spectrum of clinicians, including experts. Lastly, we show that insights derived from AI class-activation maps can inform improvements in human diagnosis. Together, our approach and findings offer a framework for future studies across the spectrum of image-based diagnostics to improve human–computer collaboration in clinical practice. A systematic evaluation of the value of AI-based decision support in skin tumor diagnosis demonstrates the superiority of human–computer collaboration over each individual approach and supports the potential of automated approaches in diagnostic medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3036895040,"Malignant abdominal fluid (ascites) frequently develops in women with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and is associated with drug resistance and a poor prognosis1. To comprehensively characterize the HGSOC ascites ecosystem, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile ~11,000 cells from 22 ascites specimens from 11 patients with HGSOC. We found significant inter-patient variability in the composition and functional programs of ascites cells, including immunomodulatory fibroblast sub-populations and dichotomous macrophage populations. We found that the previously described immunoreactive and mesenchymal subtypes of HGSOC, which have prognostic implications, reflect the abundance of immune infiltrates and fibroblasts rather than distinct subsets of malignant cells2. Malignant cell variability was partly explained by heterogeneous copy number alteration patterns or expression of a stemness program. Malignant cells shared expression of inflammatory programs that were largely recapitulated in single-cell RNA sequencing of ~35,000 cells from additionally collected samples, including three ascites, two primary HGSOC tumors and three patient ascites-derived xenograft models. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway, which was expressed in both malignant cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, had potent anti-tumor activity in primary short-term cultures and patient-derived xenograft models. Our work contributes to resolving the HSGOC landscape3-5 and provides a resource for the development of novel therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3035823399,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes unrelenting, progressive cognitive impairments, but its course is heterogeneous, with a broad range of rates of cognitive decline1. The spread of tau aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles) across the cerebral cortex parallels symptom severity2,3. We hypothesized that the kinetics of tau spread may vary if the properties of the propagating tau proteins vary across individuals. We carried out biochemical, biophysical, MS and both cell- and animal-based-bioactivity assays to characterize tau in 32 patients with AD. We found striking patient-to-patient heterogeneity in the hyperphosphorylated species of soluble, oligomeric, seed-competent tau. Tau seeding activity correlates with the aggressiveness of the clinical disease, and some post-translational modification (PTM) sites appear to be associated with both enhanced seeding activity and worse clinical outcomes, whereas others are not. These data suggest that different individuals with 'typical' AD may have distinct biochemical features of tau. These data are consistent with the possibility that individuals with AD, much like people with cancer, may have multiple molecular drivers of an otherwise common phenotype, and emphasize the potential for personalized therapeutic approaches for slowing clinical progression of AD."
https://openalex.org/W3036708569,"Background Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late 2019, communities have been required to rapidly adopt community mitigation strategies rarely used before, or only in limited settings. This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. Methods A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Findings The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would ‘somewhat’ affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84·9% had performed ≥1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93·4% performed ≥1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 6.0, 95% CI 2.6–11·0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4·0, 95% CI: 1·8–8·7), higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 5.0, 95% CI: 1·5–9.3), higher trust in government (aOR: 6.0, 95% CI: 2.6–11.0) and higher level of concern if self-isolated (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1–3.0). Interpretation In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3036877126,"Definitive diagnosis of intracranial tumors relies on tissue specimens obtained by invasive surgery. Noninvasive diagnostic approaches provide an opportunity to avoid surgery and mitigate unnecessary risk to patients. In the present study, we show that DNA-methylation profiles from plasma reveal highly specific signatures to detect and accurately discriminate common primary intracranial tumors that share cell-of-origin lineages and can be challenging to distinguish using standard-of-care imaging."
https://openalex.org/W3036473409,Improving early cancer detection has the potential to substantially reduce cancer-related mortality. Cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq) is a highly sensitive assay capable of detecting early-stage tumors. We report accurate classification of patients across all stages of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in plasma (area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.99) and demonstrate the validity of this assay to identify patients with RCC using urine cell-free DNA (cfDNA; AUROC of 0.86).
https://openalex.org/W3036274064,"Persistent neuronal spiking has long been considered the mechanism underlying working memory, but recent proposals argue for alternative ‘activity-silent’ substrates. Using monkey and human electrophysiology data, we show here that attractor dynamics that control neural spiking during mnemonic periods interact with activity-silent mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This interaction allows memory reactivations, which enhance serial biases in spatial working memory. Stimulus information was not decodable between trials, but remained present in activity-silent traces inferred from spiking synchrony in the PFC. Just before the new stimulus, this latent trace was reignited into activity that recapitulated the previous stimulus representation. Importantly, the reactivation strength correlated with the strength of serial biases in both monkeys and humans, as predicted by a computational model that integrates activity-based and activity-silent mechanisms. Finally, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the human PFC between successive trials enhanced serial biases, thus demonstrating the causal role of prefrontal reactivations in determining working-memory behavior. Barbosa, Stein et al. show that rather than operating independently, PFC persistent activity and ‘activity-silent’ mechanisms interact dynamically to produce serial effects in working memory, consistent with attractor models with synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3035891096,"The human genome can be segmented into topologically associating domains (TADs), which have been proposed to spatially sequester genes and regulatory elements through chromatin looping. Interactions between TADs have also been suggested, presumably because of variable boundary positions across individual cells. However, the nature, extent and consequence of these dynamic boundaries remain unclear. Here, we combine high-resolution imaging with Oligopaint technology to quantify the interaction frequencies across both weak and strong boundaries. We find that chromatin intermingling across population-defined boundaries is widespread but that the extent of permissibility is locus-specific. Cohesin depletion, which abolishes domain formation at the population level, does not induce ectopic interactions but instead reduces interactions across all boundaries tested. In contrast, WAPL or CTCF depletion increases inter-domain contacts in a cohesin-dependent manner. Reduced chromatin intermingling due to cohesin loss affects the topology and transcriptional bursting frequencies of genes near boundaries. We propose that cohesin occasionally bypasses boundaries to promote incorporation of boundary-proximal genes into neighboring domains. A combination of super-resolution microscopy and Oligopaint technology shows that TAD boundaries are variable at the single-cell level. Loss of cohesin, in contrast to WAPL or CTCF depletion, reduces interactions across boundaries and alters transcriptional bursting of genes near boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W3036135201,"Molecular glues are an intriguing therapeutic modality that harness small molecules to induce interactions between proteins that typically do not interact. However, such molecules are rare and have been discovered fortuitously, thus limiting their potential as a general strategy for therapeutic intervention. We postulated that natural products bearing one or more electrophilic sites may be an unexplored source of new molecular glues, potentially acting through multicovalent attachment. Using chemoproteomic platforms, we show that members of the manumycin family of polyketides, which bear multiple potentially reactive sites, target C374 of the putative E3 ligase UBR7 in breast cancer cells, and engage in molecular glue interactions with the neosubstrate tumor-suppressor TP53, leading to p53 transcriptional activation and cell death. Our results reveal an anticancer mechanism of this natural product family, and highlight the potential for combining chemoproteomics and multicovalent natural products for the discovery of new molecular glues. Manumycin natural products were found to target the E3 ligase UBR7 and engage in molecular glue interactions with p53, leading to the activation of p53 and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W3036678901,"The hypothalamus is composed of many neuropeptidergic cell populations and directs multiple survival behaviors, including defensive responses to threats. However, the relationship between the peptidergic identity of neurons and their roles in behavior remains unclear. Here, we address this issue by studying the function of multiple neuronal populations in the zebrafish hypothalamus during defensive responses to a variety of homeostatic threats. Cellular registration of large-scale neural activity imaging to multiplexed in situ gene expression revealed that neuronal populations encoding behavioral features encompass multiple overlapping sets of neuropeptidergic cell classes. Manipulations of different cell populations showed that multiple sets of peptidergic neurons play similar behavioral roles in this fast-timescale behavior through glutamate co-release and convergent output to spinal-projecting premotor neurons in the brainstem. Our findings demonstrate that homeostatic threats recruit neurons across multiple hypothalamic cell populations, which cooperatively drive robust defensive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3036009707,"Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) modulate synaptic plasticity, cortical processing, brain states and oscillations. However, whether distinct types of BFCNs support different functions remains unclear. Therefore, we recorded BFCNs in vivo, to examine their behavioral functions, and in vitro, to study their intrinsic properties. We identified two distinct types of BFCNs that differ in their firing modes, synchronization properties and behavioral correlates. Bursting cholinergic neurons (Burst-BFCNs) fired synchronously, phase-locked to cortical theta activity and fired precisely timed bursts after reward and punishment. Regular-firing cholinergic neurons (Reg-BFCNs) were found predominantly in the posterior basal forebrain, displayed strong theta rhythmicity and responded with precise single spikes after behavioral outcomes. In an auditory detection task, synchronization of Burst-BFCNs to the auditory cortex predicted the timing of behavioral responses, whereas tone-evoked cortical coupling of Reg-BFCNs predicted correct detections. We propose that differential recruitment of two basal forebrain cholinergic neuron types generates behavior-specific cortical activation."
https://openalex.org/W3038130579,"In palynology, the visual classification of pollen grains from different species is a hard task which is usually tackled by human operators using microscopes. Many industries, including medical and pharmaceutical, rely on the accuracy of this manual classification process, which is reported to be around 67%. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically classify pollen grains using deep learning techniques that improve the correct classification rates in images not previously seen by the models. Our proposal manages to properly classify up to 98% of the examples from a dataset with 46 different classes of pollen grains, produced by the Classifynder classification system. This is an unprecedented result which surpasses all previous attempts both in accuracy and number and difficulty of taxa under consideration, which include types previously considered as indistinguishable."
https://openalex.org/W3037294239,"We present performance results concerning the validation for anxiety level detection based on trained mathematical models using supervised machine learning techniques. The model training is based on biosignals acquired in a randomized controlled trial. Wearable sensors were used to collect electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, and respiration from spider-fearful individuals. We designed and applied ten approaches for data labeling considering individual biosignals as well as subjective ratings. Performance results revealed a selection of trained models adapted for two-level (low and high) and three-level (low, medium and high) classification of anxiety using a minimal set of six features. We obtained a remarkable accuracy of 89.8% for the two-level classification and of 74.4% for the three-level classification using a short time window length of ten seconds when applying the approach that uses subjective ratings for data labeling. Bagged Trees proved to be the most suitable classifier type among the classification models studied. The trained models will have a practical impact on the feasibility study of an augmented reality exposure therapy based on a therapeutic game for the treatment of arachnophobia."
https://openalex.org/W3035843337,"Caenorhabditis elegans serves as a model for understanding adiposity and its connections to aging. Current methodologies do not distinguish between fats serving the energy needs of the parent, akin to mammalian adiposity, from those that are distributed to the progeny, making it difficult to accurately interpret the physiological implications of fat content changes induced by external perturbations. Using spectroscopic coherent Raman imaging, we determine the protein content, chemical profiles and dynamics of lipid particles in live animals. We find fat particles in the adult intestine to be diverse, with most destined for the developing progeny. In contrast, the skin-like epidermis contains fats that are the least heterogeneous, the least dynamic and have high triglyceride content. These attributes are most consistent with stored somatic energy reservoirs. These results challenge the prevailing practice of assessing C. elegans adiposity by measurements that are dominated by the intestinal fat content."
https://openalex.org/W3036941273,"The β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) inserts outer membrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In Enterobacteriacea, BAM also mediates export of the stress sensor lipoprotein RcsF to the cell surface by assembling RcsF–OMP complexes. Here, we report the crystal structure of the key BAM component BamA in complex with RcsF. BamA adopts an inward-open conformation, with the lateral gate to the membrane closed. RcsF is lodged deep within the lumen of the BamA barrel, binding regions proposed to undergo outward and lateral opening during OMP insertion. On the basis of our structural and biochemical data, we propose a push-and-pull model for RcsF export following conformational cycling of BamA, and provide a mechanistic explanation for how RcsF uses its interaction with BamA to detect envelope stress. Our data also suggest that the flux of incoming OMP substrates is involved in the control of BAM activity. A structural and biochemical study of bacterial β-barrel assembly machinery component BamA with transport substrate RcsF shows an inward-open conformation with RcsF trapped inside the β-barrel lumen and suggests a push–pull substrate export mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3038092594,"TUM-ParticleTyper is a novel program for the automated detection, quantification and morphological characterization of fragments, including particles and fibers, in images from optical, fluorescence and electron microscopy (SEM). It can be used to automatically select targets for subsequent chemical analysis, e.g., Raman microscopy, or any other single particle identification method. The program was specifically developed and validated for the analysis of microplastic particles on gold coated polycarbonate filters. Our method development was supported by the design of a filter holder that minimizes filter roughness and facilitates enhanced focusing for better images and Raman measurements. The TUM-ParticleTyper software is tunable to the user's specific sample demands and can extract the morphological characteristics of detected objects (coordinates, Feret's diameter min / max, area and shape). Results are saved in csv-format and contours of detected objects are displayed as an overlay on the original image. Additionally, the program can stitch a set of images to create a full image out of several smaller ones. An additional useful feature is the inclusion of a statistical process to calculate the minimum number of particles that must be chemically identified to be representative of all particles localized on the substrate. The program performance was evaluated on genuine microplastic samples. The TUM-ParticleTyper software localizes particles using an adaptive threshold with results comparable to the ""gold standard"" method (manual localization by an expert) and surpasses the commonly used Otsu thresholding by doubling the rate of true positive localizations. This enables the analysis of a statistically significant number of particles on the filter selected by random sampling, measured via single point approach. This extreme reduction in measurement points was validated by comparison to chemical imaging, applying both procedures to the same area at comparable processing times. The single point approach was both faster and more accurate proving the applicability of the presented program."
https://openalex.org/W3035974693,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China and has spread through other provinces and countries through infected travelers. On January 23rd, 2020, China issued a quarantine and travel ban on Wuhan because travelers from Wuhan were thought to account for the majority of exported COVID-19 cases to other countries. Additionally, countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan after institution of the travel ban. Together, these two populations account for the vast majority of the “total cases with travel history to China” as designated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The current study aims to assess the prevalence and risk of COVID-19 among international travelers and evacuees of Wuhan. We first used case reports from Japan, Singapore, and Korea to investigate the date of flights of infected travelers. We then used airline traveler data and the number of infected exported cases to correlate the cases with the number of travelers for multiple countries. Our findings suggest that the risk of COVID-19 infection is highest among Wuhan travelers between January 19th and 22nd, 2020, with an approximate infection rate of up to 1.3% among international travelers. We also observed that evacuee infection rates varied heavily between countries and propose that the timing of the evacuation and COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic evacuees played significant roles in the infection rates among evacuees. These findings suggest COVID-19 cases and infectivity are much higher than previous estimates, including numbers from the WHO and the literature, and that some estimates of the infectivity of COVID-19 may need re-assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3036384943,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has devastated health infrastructure around the world. Both ACE2 (an entry receptor) and TMPRSS2 (used by the virus for spike protein priming) are key proteins to SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, enabling progression to COVID-19 in humans. Comparative genomic research into critical ACE2 binding sites, associated with the spike receptor binding domain, has suggested that African and Asian primates may also be susceptible to disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Savanna monkeys (Chlorocebus spp.) are a widespread non-human primate with well-established potential as a bi-directional zoonotic/anthroponotic agent due to high levels of human interaction throughout their range in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. To characterize potential functional variation in savanna monkey ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we inspected recently published genomic data from 245 savanna monkeys, including 163 wild monkeys from Africa and the Caribbean and 82 captive monkeys from the Vervet Research Colony (VRC). We found several missense variants. One missense variant in ACE2 (X:14,077,550; Asp30Gly), common in Ch. sabaeus, causes a change in amino acid residue that has been inferred to reduce binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility. The remaining populations appear as susceptible as humans, based on these criteria for receptor usage. All missense variants observed in wild Ch. sabaeus populations are also present in the VRC, along with two splice acceptor variants (at X:14,065,076) not observed in the wild sample that are potentially disruptive to ACE2 function. The presence of these variants in the VRC suggests a promising model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine and therapy development. In keeping with a One Health approach, characterizing actual susceptibility and potential for bi-directional zoonotic/anthroponotic transfer in savanna monkey populations may be an important consideration for controlling COVID-19 epidemics in communities with frequent human/non-human primate interactions that, in many cases, may have limited health infrastructure."

https://openalex.org/W3037279738,"Failure to attend hospital appointments has a detrimental impact on care quality. Documented efforts to address this challenge have only modestly decreased no-show rates. Behavioral economics theory has suggested that more effective messages may lead to increased responsiveness. In complex, real-world settings, it has proven difficult to predict the optimal message composition. In this study, we aimed to systematically compare the effects of several pre-appointment message formats on no-show rates. We randomly assigned members from Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest payer-provider healthcare organization in Israel, who had scheduled outpatient clinic appointments in 14 CHS hospitals, to one of nine groups. Each individual received a pre-appointment SMS text reminder five days before the appointment, which differed by group. No-show and advanced cancellation rates were compared between the eight alternative messages, with the previously used generic message serving as the control. There were 161,587 CHS members who received pre-appointment reminder messages who were included in this study. Five message frames significantly differed from the control group. Members who received a reminder designed to evoke emotional guilt had a no-show rates of 14.2%, compared with 21.1% in the control group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67, 0.76), and an advanced cancellation rate of 26.3% compared with 17.2% in the control group (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.21). Four additional reminder formats demonstrated significantly improved impact on no-show rates, compared to the control, though not as effective as the best performing message format. Carefully selecting the narrative of pre-appointment SMS reminders can lead to a marked decrease in no-show rates. The process of a/b testing, selecting, and adopting optimal messages is a practical example of implementing the learning healthcare system paradigm, which could prevent up to one-third of the 352,000 annually unattended appointments in Israel."
https://openalex.org/W3036322628,"Objectives The Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 was an unprecedented act of terrorism that killed 13 people and sickened more than 6,000. The long-term somatic and psychological effects on its victims remain unknown. Methods We conducted analyses on the self-rating questionnaire collected annually by the Recovery Support Center (RSC) during the period from 2000 to 2009. The RSC is the only organization that has large-scale follow-up data about sarin attack victims. The prevalence of self-reported symptoms was calculated over 10 years. We also evaluated the prevalence of posttraumatic stress response (PTSR), defined as a score ≥ 25 on the Japanese-language version of the Impact of Event Scale–Revised. The multivariate Poisson regression model was applied to estimate the risk ratios of age, gender, and year factor on the prevalence of PTSR. Results Subjects were 747 survivors (12% of the total) who responded to the annual questionnaire once or more during the study period. The prevalence of somatic symptoms, especially eye symptoms, was 60–80% and has not decreased. PTSR prevalence was 35.1%, and again there was no change with time. The multivariate Poisson regression model results revealed “old age” and “female” as independent risk factors, but the passage of time did not decrease the risk of PTSR. Conclusions Although symptoms in most victims of the Tokyo subway sarin were transient, this large-scale follow-up data analysis revealed that survivors have been suffering from somatic and psychological long-term effects."
https://openalex.org/W3037635257,"Thorny-headed worms (Acanthocephala) are endoparasites exploiting Mandibulata (Arthropoda) and Gnathostomata (Vertebrata). Despite their world-wide occurrence and economic relevance as a pest, genome and transcriptome assemblies have not been published before. However, such data might hold clues for a sustainable control of acanthocephalans in animal production. For this reason, we present the first draft of an acanthocephalan nuclear genome, besides the mitochondrial one, using the fish parasite Pomphorhynchus laevis (Palaeacanthocephala) as a model. Additionally, we have assembled and annotated the transcriptome of this species and the proteins encoded. A hybrid assembly of long and short reads resulted in a near-complete P. laevis draft genome of ca. 260 Mb, comprising a large repetitive portion of ca. 63%. Numbers of transcripts and translated proteins (35,683) were within the range of other members of the Rotifera-Acanthocephala clade. Our data additionally demonstrate a significant reorganization of the acanthocephalan gene repertoire. Thus, more than 20% of the usually conserved metazoan genes were lacking in P. laevis. Ontology analysis of the retained genes revealed many connections to the incorporation of carotinoids. These are probably taken up via the surface together with lipids, thus accounting for the orange coloration of P. laevis. Furthermore, we found transcripts and protein sequences to be more derived in P. laevis than in rotifers from Monogononta and Bdelloidea. This was especially the case in genes involved in energy metabolism, which might reflect the acanthocephalan ability to use the scarce oxygen in the host intestine for respiration and simultaneously carry out fermentation. Increased plasticity of the gene repertoire through the integration of foreign DNA into the nuclear genome seems to be another underpinning factor of the evolutionary success of acanthocephalans. In any case, energy-related genes and their proteins may be considered as candidate targets for the acanthocephalan control."

Objective To study whether changes in glucose and lipid metabolism during pregnancy differ between women with normal weight and overweight/obesity, and investigate which of these metabolic factors are associated with birthweight. Design Prospective, longitudinal study. Setting Department of Obstetrics, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet. Population 1031 healthy pregnant women with singleton pregnancies. Methods Blood samples from early and late pregnancy were analyzed for fasting glucose, insulin and lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides). Associations between metabolic factors and birthweight (z-scores) were explored by linear regression models. Main Outcome Measures: Group-dependent longitudinal changes in glucose and lipids and their association with birthweight (z-scores). Results Compared to women with normal weight (BMI < 25), women with overweight (BMI 25–29.9) and obesity (BMI > 30) had significantly higher fasting glucose (4.54, 4.68 and 4.84 mmol/l), insulin (23, 33 and 50 pmol/l), total cholesterol (4.85, 4.99 and 5.14 mmol/l), LDL-C (2.49, 2.66 and 2.88 mmol/l) and triglycerides (1.10, 1.28 and 1.57 mmol/l), but lower HDL-C (1.86, 1.75 and 1.55 mmol/l). BMI (B 0.05, 95% CI 0.03–0.06, p<0.001), gestational weight gain (GWG) (B 0.06, 0.05–0.08, p<0.001) and an increase in fasting glucose (B 0.30, 0.16–0.43, p<0.001) were positively associated with birthweight, whereas a decrease in HDL-C (B -0.72, -0.96- -0.53, p<0.001) had a negative association with birthweight. Conclusions Overweight/obesity was associated with an unfavorable metabolic profile in early pregnancy which was associated with increased birthweight. However, modifiable factors like gestational weight gain and an increase in fasting glucose were identified and can be targeted for interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3036433337,"Background Adolescent overweight and obesity is a global public health problem, associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Recently, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) has been suggested as a screening tool to identify overweight and obesity among school-age children and early adolescents (5–14 years). However, little is known about the potential use of MUAC in the late adolescence period (15–19 years). Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the performance of MUAC to identify overweight (including obesity) in the late adolescence period in Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 851 adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. We collected anthropometric data including MUAC, weight and height with the help of trained field workers. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to examine the validity of MUAC compared to BMI Z score in identifying adolescents with overweight or obesity. Furthermore, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), proportion of correctly classified, positive, and negative likelihood ratio for the proposed optimal cut-offs. Results MUAC was strongly correlated with BMI Z score with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.81 (95% CI; 0.79–0.84). The optimal MUAC cut-off for identifying adolescents with overweight or obesity was 27.7 cm for males and 27.9 cm for females. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.96 (95% CI; 0.93–0.98) for males and 0.96 (95% CI; 0.94–0.98) for females. The accuracy level of MUAC to identify adolescents with overweight (including obesity) was high for both sexes (overall a sensitivity of 91.1% and a specificity of 90.3%). Conclusions MUAC has relatively equivalent accuracy with BMI Z score to identify overweight and obesity in adolescents. Hence, MUAC could be used as an alternative tool for surveillance and screening of overweight in adolescents aged 15–19 years."
https://openalex.org/W3035798931,"Nursing and weaning periods are poorly understood in cetaceans due to the difficulty of assessing underwater behaviour in the wild. However, the onset and completion of weaning are critical turning points for individual development and survival, with implications for a species' life history including reproductive potential. δ15N and δ13C deposited in odontocete teeth annuli provide a lifetime record of diet, offering an opportunity to investigate variation and trends in fundamental biology. While available reproductive parameters for beaked whales have largely been inferred from single records of stranded or hunted animals and extrapolated across species, here we examine the weaning strategy and nursing duration in northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus) by measuring stable isotopes deposited in dentine growth layer groups (GLGs). Using a collection of H. ampullatus teeth taken from whales killed during the whaling era (N = 48) and from two stranded specimens, we compared ontogenetic variation of δ15N and δ13C found in annual GLGs across all individuals, by sex and by region. We detected age-based trends in both δ15N and δ13C that are consistent across regions and males and females, and indicate that nursing is prolonged and weaning does not conclude until whales are 3-4 years old, substantially later than previous estimates of 1 year. Incorporating a prolonged period of maternal care into H. ampullatus life history significantly reduces their reproductive potential, with broad implications for models of beaked whale life history, energetics and the species' recovery from whaling."

As a preventative measure prophylactic antibiotic administration is common in pregnant women colonised with GBS, but antibiotic-resistance and adverse effects on neonatal microbiomes may result. Use of bacteriophages (phages) is one option for targeted therapy. To this end, four phages (LF1 –LF4) were isolated from wastewater. They displayed lytic activity in vitro against S. agalactiae isolates collected from pregnant women and neonates, with 190/246 isolates (77.2%) and 10/10 (100%) isolates susceptible to at least one phage, respectively. Phage genomes ranged from 32,205–44,768 bp and all phages were members of the Siphoviridae family. High nucleotide identity (99.9%) was observed between LF1 and LF4, which were closely related to a putative prophage of S. agalactiae. The genome organisation of LF2 differed, and it showed similarity to a different S. agalactiae prophage, while LF3 was more closely related to a Streptococcus pyogenes phage. Lysogenic gene presence (integrase, repressor and regulatory modules), was suggestive of temperate phages. In a therapeutic context, temperate phages are not ideal candidates, however, the broad host range activity of these phages observed on clinical isolates in vitro is promising for future therapeutic approaches including bioengineered phage or lysin applications."
https://openalex.org/W3037239648,"Sustained inflation (SI) during chest compression (CC = CC+SI) has been recently shown as an alternative method during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in neonates. However, the optimal peak inflation pressure (PIP) of SI during CC+SI to improve ROSC and hemodynamic recovery is unknown.To examine if different PIPs of SI during CC+SI will improve ROSC and hemodynamic recovery in severely asphyxiated piglets.Twenty-nine newborn piglets (1-3 days old) were anesthetized, intubated, instrumented and exposed to 30-min normocapnic hypoxia followed by asphyxia. Piglets were randomized into four groups: CC+SI with a PIP of 10 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_10, n = 8), a PIP of 20 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_20, n = 8), a PIP of 30 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_30, n = 8), and a sham-operated control group (n = 5). Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, carotid blood flow, cerebral oxygenation, and respiratory parameters were continuously recorded throughout the experiment.Baseline parameters were similar between all groups. There was no difference in asphyxiation (duration and degree) between intervention groups. PIP correlated positively with tidal volume (VT) and inversely with exhaled CO2 during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Time to ROSC and rate of ROSC were similar between piglets resuscitated with CC+SI_PIP_10, CC+SI_PIP_20, and CC+SI_PIP_30 cmH2O: median (IQR) 75 (63-193) sec, 94 (78-210) sec, and 85 (70-90) sec; 5/8 (63%), 7/8 (88%), and 3/8 (38%) (p = 0.56 and p = 0.12, respectively). All piglets that achieved ROSC survived to four hours post-resuscitation. Piglets resuscitated with CC+SI_PIP_30 cmH2O exhibited increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α in the frontoparietal cerebral cortex (both p<0.05 vs. sham-operated controls).In asphyxiated term newborn piglets resuscitated by CC+SI, the use of different PIPs resulted in similar time to ROSC, but PIP at 30 cmH2O showed a larger VT delivery, lower exhaled CO2 and increased tissue inflammatory markers in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3036219706,"Although studies have demonstrated the association of hyperuricemia with cardiovascular (CV) diseases, few have explored the effect of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) on the incidence of CV diseases. Therefore, we compared the risks of hospitalized coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, heart failure (HF), and all-cause mortality between ULT users and nonusers among patients with gout.We performed this retrospective cohort study using Taiwan's population-based National Health Insurance Research Database. In total, 5218 patients with gout were included from 2000 to 2012. We compared the incidence rates (IRs) of hospitalized CAD, stroke, HF, and all-cause mortality between ULT users and matched nonusers.The IRs of hospitalized stroke were 0.6 and 1.0 per 100 person-years for ULT users and nonusers, respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, residence, comorbidities, and medications. ULT users showed lower adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for hospitalized stroke (aHR: 0.52, p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (aHR: 0.6, p = 0.02) than nonusers. Subgroup analyses revealed that uricosuric agents and xanthine oxidase inhibitors were significantly associated with lower risks of hospitalized stroke and all-cause mortality, respectively. The effect of uricosuric agents on the decrease in hospitalized stroke risk indicated a dose-response relationship.Our study showed lower risks of hospitalized stroke and all-cause mortality in ULT users than in nonusers among patients with gout. Therefore, patients with gout may receive ULT to mitigate the risks of hospitalized stroke and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3038021529,"The transcriptional regulatory machinery in mitochondrial bioenergetics is complex and is still not completely understood. We previously demonstrated that the histone methyltransferase Smyd1 regulates mitochondrial energetics. Here, we identified Perm1 (PPARGC-1 and ESRR-induced regulator, muscle specific 1) as a downstream target of Smyd1 through RNA-seq. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that Smyd1 directly interacts with the promoter of Perm1 in the mouse heart, and this interaction was significantly reduced in mouse hearts failing due to pressure overload for 4 weeks, where Perm1 was downregulated (24.4 ± 5.9% of sham, p<0.05). Similarly, the Perm1 protein level was significantly decreased in patients with advanced heart failure (55.2 ± 13.1% of donors, p<0.05). Phenylephrine (PE)-induced hypertrophic stress in cardiomyocytes also led to downregulation of Perm1 (55.7 ± 5.7% of control, p<0.05), and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Perm1 rescued PE-induced downregulation of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), a key transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial energetics, and its target gene, Ndufv1 (Complex I). Pathway enrichment analysis of cardiomyocytes in which Perm1 was knocked-down by siRNA (siPerm1), revealed that the most downregulated pathway was metabolism. Cell stress tests using the Seahorse XF analyzer showed that basal respiration and ATP production were significantly reduced in siPerm1 cardiomyocytes (40.7% and 23.6% of scrambled-siRNA, respectively, both p<0.05). Luciferase reporter gene assay further revealed that Perm1 dose-dependently increased the promoter activity of the ERRα gene and known target of ERRα, Ndufv1 (Complex I). Overall, our study demonstrates that Perm1 is an essential regulator of cardiac energetics through ERRα, as part of the Smyd1 regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W3037562632,"Objective Descriptions of maternity waiting homes (MWHs) as an intervention to increase facility delivery for women living in remote geographic areas dates back to the 1950s, yet there is limited information on the scale-up and sustainability of MWHs. The objective of this study was to describe the evolutionary scale-up of MWHs as a component of health system strengthening efforts and document the successes, challenges, and barriers to sustainability in Liberia. Methods Data were collected from a national sample of 119 MWHs in Liberia established between 2010–2018. The study used a mixed method design that included focus group discussions, individual interviews, logbook reviews, and geographic information systems. Qualitative data were grouped into themes using Glaser’s constant comparative method. Quantitative data were analyzed using negative binomial regression to measure the differences in the counts of monthly stays at facilities with different funding sources and presence of advisory committee. Additionally, each MWH was geo-located for purposes of geo-visualization. Results In the years since the original construction of five MWHs, an additional 114 MWHs were constructed in 14 of the 15 counties in Liberia. Monthly stays at facilities funded by community were 2·5 times those funded by NGOs (IRR, 2·46, 95% CI 1·33–4·54). Attributes of sustainability included strong local leadership/active community engagement and community ownership and governance. Conclusion Success factors for scale-up and sustainability included strong government support through development of public policy, local and county leadership, early and sustained engagement with communities, and self-governance. A multi-pronged approach with strong community engagement is key to the scale-up and sustainability of MWHs as an intervention to increase facility delivery for women living the farthest from a healthcare facility."
https://openalex.org/W3037940129,"Proteases play an essential role in living organisms and represent one of the largest groups of industrial enzymes. The aim of this work was recombinant production and characterization of a newly identified thermostable protease 1147 from thermophilum indigenous Cohnella sp. A01. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that protease 1147 is closely related to the cysteine proteases from DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily, with the conserved catalytic tetrad. Structural prediction using MODELLER 9v7 indicated that protease 1147 has an overall α/β sandwich tertiary structure. The gene of protease 1147 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21. The recombinant protease 1147 appeared as a homogenous band of 18 kDa in SDS-PAGE, which was verified by western blot and zymography. The recombinant protein was purified with a yield of approximately 88% in a single step using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Furthermore, a rapid one-step thermal shock procedure was successfully implemented to purify the protein with a yield of 73%. Using casein as the substrate, Km, and kcat, kcat/Km values of 13.72 mM, 3.143 × 10-3 (s-1), and 0.381 (M-1 S-1) were obtained, respectively. The maximum protease activity was detected at pH = 7 and 60°C with the inactivation rate constant (kin) of 2.10 × 10-3 (m-1), and half-life (t1/2) of 330.07 min. Protease 1147 exhibited excellent stability to organic solvent, metal ions, and 1% SDS. The protease activity was significantly enhanced by Tween 20 and Tween 80 and suppressed by cysteine protease specific inhibitors. Docking results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed that Tween 20 interacted with protease 1147 via hydrogen bonds and made the structure more stable. CD and fluorescence spectra indicated structural changes taking place at 100°C, very basic and acidic pH, and in the presence of Tween 20. These properties make this newly characterized protease a potential candidate for various biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W3036505103,"As loss of contractile function in heart disease could often be mitigated by increased cardiomyocyte number, expansion of cardiomyocyte endowment paired with increased vascular supply is a desirable therapeutic goal. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) administration increases fetal cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart mass, but how fetal IGF-1 treatment affects coronary growth and function is unknown. Near-term fetal sheep underwent surgical instrumentation and were studied from 127 to 134 d gestation (term = 147 d), receiving either IGF-1 LR3 or vehicle. Coronary growth and function were interrogated using pressure-flow relationships, an episode of acute hypoxia with progressive blockade of adenosine receptors and nitric oxide synthase, and by modeling the determinants of coronary flow. The main findings were that coronary conductance was preserved on a per-gram basis following IGF-1 treatment, adenosine and nitric oxide contributed to hypoxia-mediated coronary vasodilation similarly in IGF-1-treated and Control fetuses, and the relationships between coronary flow and blood oxygen contents were similar between groups. We conclude that IGF-1-stimulated fetal myocardial growth is accompanied by appropriate expansion and function of the coronary vasculature. These findings support IGF-1 as a potential strategy to increase cardiac myocyte and coronary vascular endowment at birth."
https://openalex.org/W3037535711,"Background Modular stems are widely used in revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) with aseptic loosening being a common reason for revision. Despite the good results reported on the use of modular stem designs, there are only few studies focusing on aseptic revisions and few studies on a hexagonal stem design. The goal of this study is to determine stem survival, clinical and functional outcome along with possible risk factors for implant failure in aseptic revision THA. Methods We retrospectively identified 53 patients with aseptic THA revision using a modular hexagonal stem with a minimum follow-up of two years. Femoral bone loss, radiographic and clinical outcomes as well as function measured using the Harris Hip Score (HHS) was assessed. Patients’ previous medical history was analyzed for comorbidities and the body mass index. Stem survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Possible risk factors for implant failure were analyzed using the log-rank test. The median age at revision was 69 (IQR 62–73) with a median follow up of 74 months. Results Implant survival rates amounted to 90.4% at 3 and 5 years. The median HHS improved by 47 points (34 (IQR 22–47) vs 81 (IQR 59–90) p<0.001). There was a reduced implant survival after 5 years when the revision stem was used following a previous cemented stem (83.4% vs 100%, p = 0.04). Conclusion A modular, hexagonal stem can be successfully used in aseptic revision THA with remarkable functional results and excellent survivorship. Revision of a cemented stem using this implant might result in reduced survival which must be considered when planning treatment."

On the other hand, no information occurs on the influence of the parasite on the hindgut microbiome of the host. We evaluated the impact of Haemonchus contortus on the fecal microbial community of the experimentally infected lambs treated with a mixture of medicinal herbs to ameliorate the haemonchosis. Twenty-four female lambs were divided into four groups: infected animals (Inf), infected animals supplemented with a blend of medicinal herbs (Inf+Herb), uninfected control animals (Control), and uninfected animals supplemented with medicinal herbs (C+Herb). Inf and Inf+Herb lambs were infected orally with approximately 5000 L3 larvae of a strain of H. contortus susceptible to anthelmintics (MHco1). Herb blend (Herbmix) consisted of dry medicinal plants of Althaea officinalis, Petasites hybridus, Inula helenium, Malva sylvestris, Chamomilla recutita, Plantago lanceolata, Rosmarinus officinalis, Solidago virgaurea, Fumaria officinalis, Hyssopus officinalis, Melisa officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, and Artemisia absinthium. Each animal was fed meadow hay and a commercial concentrate (600 + 350 g DM/d). Inf+Herb and C+Herb lambs were fed Herbmix (100 g DM/d and animal). Treatment lasted for 50 days. The fecal microbial fermentation parameters (short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and pH) were evaluated at intervals of 0, 20, 32, and 50 days. The fecal eubacterial populations were evaluated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) at day 32 when H. contortus infection was the highest. No substantial effects of the H. contortus infection and the herbal treatment on fecal microbial fermentation parameters and fecal eubacterial populations were observed. Evaluation of DGGE patterns by Principal component analysis pointed to the tendency to branch the C+Herb group from the other experimental groups on Day 32. The results indicate that hindgut microbial activity was not disturbed by H. contortus infection and herbal treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3037629782,"Marmoset wasting syndrome (MWS) is clinically characterized by progressive weight loss. Although morbidity and mortality of MWS are relatively high in captive marmosets, its causes remain unknown. Lipid mediators are bioactive metabolites which are produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid. These lipid metabolites regulate a wide range of inflammatory responses and they are excreted into the urine. As urinary lipid profiles reflect systemic inflammatory conditions, we comprehensively measured the levels of 141 types of lipid metabolites in the urines obtained from healthy common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) (N = 7) or marmosets with MWS (N = 7). We found that 41 types of metabolites were detected in all urine samples of both groups. Among them, AA-derived metabolites accounted for 63% (26/41 types) of all detected metabolites. Notably, the levels of AA-derived prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2α, thromboxane (TX) B2 and F2-isoprostanes significantly increased in the urine samples of marmosets with MWS. In this study, we found some urinary lipid metabolites which may be involved in the development of MWS. Although the cause of MWS remains unclear, our findings may provide some insight into understanding the mechanisms of development of MWS."

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) and fibrotic gene expression was examined through immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, zymography, and modified scratch assay in vitro. In vivo, 0.1 mL of MMC or normal saline was injected to Tenon's capsule before trabeculectomy in a rabbit model. SA-β-gal expression, apoptotic cell death, and collagen deposition in sites treated and not treated with MMC were evaluated using terminal dUTP nick end labeling assay and histochemical staining. Bleb function and intraocular pressure (IOP) levels were examined 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days after trabeculectomy.In vitro, human Tenon's fibroblast (HTF) senescence was confirmed by observing cell morphologic change, SA-β-gal accumulation, formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin, increased p16INK4a and p21CIP1/WAF1 expression, lower percentage of Ki-67-positive cells, and decreased COL1A1 release. Increased expression of α-SMA, COL1A1, and Smad2 signaling in TGF-β1-induced stress fibers were passivated in senescent HTFs. In addition, cellular migration enhanced by TGF-β1was inactivated. In vivo, histological examination indicated increased SA-β-gal accumulation, lower apoptosis ratios, and looser collagen deposition in sites treated with 0.2 μM MMC. Low-dose MMC-induced cellular senescence prolonged trabeculectomy bleb survival and reduced IOP levels in a rabbit model.Low-dose MMC-induced cellular senescence is involved in the antifibrotic mechanism of trabeculectomy wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W3036652713,"Background To support effective antibiotic selection in empirical treatments, infection control interventions, and antimicrobial resistance containment strategies, many medical institutions collect antimicrobial susceptibility test data conducted at their facilities to prepare cumulative antibiograms. Aim To evaluate how the setpoints of duplicate isolate removal period and data collection period affect the calculated susceptibility rates in antibiograms. Methods The Sakai City Medical Center is a regional core hospital for tertiary emergency medical care with 480 beds for general clinical care. In this study, all the Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected at the Sakai City Medical Center Clinical Laboratory between July 2013 and December 2018 were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the resulting data was analyzed. Findings The longer the duplicate isolate removal period, the fewer the isolates are available for every bacterial species. Differences in the length of the duplicate isolate removal period affected P. aeruginosa susceptibility rates to β-lactam antibiotics by up to 10.8%. The setpoint of the data collection period affected the antimicrobial susceptibility rates by up to 7.3%. We found that a significant change in susceptibility could be missed depending on the setting of the data collection period, in preparing antibiogram of β-lactam antibiotics for P. aeruginosa. Conclusions When referring to antibiograms, medical professionals involved in infectious disease treatment should be aware that the parameter values, such as the duplicate isolate removal period and the data collection period, affect P. aeruginosa susceptibility rates especially to β-lactam antibiotics. And antibiogram should be updated within the shortest time period that is practically possible, taking into account restrictions such as numbers of specimen."
https://openalex.org/W3037280674,"In the BACHD mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD), deletion of the N17 domain of the Huntingtin gene (BACHDΔN17, Q97) has been reported to lead to nuclear accumulation of mHTT and exacerbation of motor deficits, neuroinflammation and striatal atrophy (Gu et al., 2015). Here we characterized the effect of N17 deletion on dorsolateral striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in BACHDΔN17 (Q97) and BACWTΔN17 (Q31) mice by comparing them to MSNs in wildtype (WT) mice. Mice were characterized on a series of motor tasks and subsequently whole cell patch clamp recordings with simultaneous biocytin filling of MSNs in in vitro striatal slices from these mice were used to comprehensively assess their physiological and morphological features. Key findings include that: Q97 mice exhibit impaired gait and righting reflexes but normal tail suspension reflexes and normal coats while Q31 mice do not differ from WT; intrinsic membrane and action potential properties are altered -but differentially so- in MSNs from Q97 and from Q31 mice; excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents exhibit higher amplitudes in Q31 but not Q97 MSNs, while excitatory synaptic currents occur at lower frequency in Q97 than in WT and Q31 MSNs; there is a reduced total dendritic length in Q31 -but not Q97- MSNs compared to WT, while spine density and number did not differ in MSNs in the three groups. The findings that Q31 MSNs differed from Q97 and WT neurons with regard to some physiological features and structurally suggest a novel role of the N17 domain in the function of WT Htt. The motor phenotype seen in Q97 mice was less robust than that reported in an earlier study (Gu et al., 2015), and the alterations to MSN physiological properties were largely consistent with changes reported previously in a number of other mouse models of HD. Together this study indicates that N17 plays a role in the modulation of the properties of MSNs in both mHtt and WT-Htt mice, but does not markedly exacerbate HD-like pathogenesis in the BACHD model."
https://openalex.org/W3037855613,"Chondrocytes, comparable to many cells from the connective tissue, dedifferentiate and end up in a similar fibroblastoid cell type, marked by the loss of the specific expression pattern. Here, chondrocytes isolated from osteoarthritic (OA) patients were investigated. The OA chondrocytes used in this work were not affected by the loss of specific gene expression upon cell culture. The mRNA levels of known cartilage markers, such as SOX5, SOX6, SOX9, aggrecan and proteoglycan 4, remained unchanged. Since chondrocytes from OA and healthy tissue show different DNA methylation patterns, the underlying mechanisms of cartilage marker maintenance were investigated with a focus on the epigenetic modification by DNA methylation. The treatment of dedifferentiated chondrocytes with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2´-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) displayed no considerable impact on the maintenance of marker gene expression observed in the dedifferentiated state, while the chondrogenic differentiation capacity was compromised. On the other hand, the pre-cultivation with 5-aza-dC improved the osteogenesis and adipogenesis of OA chondrocytes. Contradictory to these effects, the DNA methylation levels were not reduced after treatment for four weeks with 1 μM 5-aza-dC. In conclusion, 5-aza-dC affects the differentiation capacity of OA chondrocytes, while the global DNA methylation level remains stable. Furthermore, dedifferentiated chondrocytes isolated from late-stage OA patients represent a reliable cell source for in vitro studies and disease models without the need for additional alterations."

However, there are limited studies on psychosocial factors that are associated with safe sex intentions among this population. Self-efficacy has been established as an important correlate of behavioral intentions and the actual behavior. The objective of this research was to examine how key psychosocial factors such as social support, parental monitoring, and future orientation influence perceived safe sex self-efficacy among in-school adolescent girls in Nigeria. Furthermore, we assessed the associations between these psychosocial factors and HIV-related knowledge and safe sex self-efficacy.A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 426 adolescent girls attending public and private school systems in Lagos, Nigeria. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the influence of psychosocial and demographic factors on safe sex self-efficacy. Further, stratified analysis was conducted to compare the estimates between participants attending public schools (n = 272) and those attending private schools (n = 154).Results from the study show that future orientation (β = 0.17; p < 0.05), participants age (β = 0.14; p < 0.05), and HIV knowledge accuracy (β = 0.17; p < 0.05) were associated with safe sex self-efficacy. Future orientation remained statistically significant in the sub-group analysis among participants attending public (β = 0.13; p < 0.05) and private schools (β = 0.24; p < 0.05). Among participants attending public schools, HIV accuracy (β = 0.2; p < 0.05) remained a significant correlate of safe sex self-efficacy while this association dissipated among private school attendees.These findings point to the importance of including future orientation strategies in interventions developed for in-school adolescent girls in Nigeria. School-based interventions that increase positive future orientation outcomes may be beneficial to improve safe sex intentions among adolescent girls in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W3036052381,"Imaging techniques have proved to be crucial for diagnosis in reptile species. The topography of the internal organs of bearded dragons has been described in recent studies as meeting the small animal practitioners´ demand for knowledge concerning their anatomy. However, the nomenclature in the respective literature is not uniform, which could lead to misunderstandings concerning the respective and/or affected parts of the alimentary canal. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide clear information on anatomy and histology of the alimentary canal of bearded dragons including supplying blood vessels. For the dissection of the alimentary canal, 11 Inland Bearded Dragons (Pogona vitticeps) were used (five males, six females), which had been euthanised for clinical reasons other than those concerning the digestive tract or had died spontaneously. The supplying arteries were demonstrated by injecting red latex into the aorta, while the intestinal veins were filled with blue latex via the portal vein. Microscopic examination was carried out on specimens of seven additional bearded dragons using routine histologic procedures. Macroscopically, the sections of the alimentary canal from oral to aboral were distinguished into oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, colic ampulla, colic isthmus, rectum and cloaca. Differentiation of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum was only possible when considering the bile duct, the vasculature and the histology of the organ wall. Arteries supplying the oesophagus and the final straight part of the large intestine originated from the aorta in a segmental manner. Between these, three unpaired arteries arose from the aorta. Their branches supplied stomach and intestine excluding its last part. Based on the findings of the present study, a nomenclature for the different parts of the alimentary canal and the supplying blood vessels of bearded dragons is suggested which is well understandable for veterinary practitioners and is based on zoological knowledge of reptiles."

https://openalex.org/W3037913702,"Male circumcision (MC) reduces acquisition of HIV-1 in heterosexual men by at least 60%, but the biological mechanism for this protection is incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that a larger foreskin size, increased abundance of anaerobic bacteria in the sub-preputial space, and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the penis are all prospectively associated with risk of HIV-1 acquisition. Since coverage of the glans on the non-erect penis is dependent on foreskin size, a larger foreskin could result in a less aerobic environment that might preferentially support anaerobic bacterial growth and induce inflammation. We therefore assessed the relationship between foreskin size, penile microbiome composition and local inflammation.This is a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of 82 HIV-uninfected men who participated in a randomized trial of MC for HIV-1 prevention in Rakai, Uganda between 2003-2006. Sub-preputial swabs were collected prior to MC and assessed for cytokines (multiplexed immunosorbent assay) and bacterial load (qPCR) and taxon abundance (sequencing). Foreskin size was measured immediately after MC.Foreskin surface area did not correlate with total bacterial load (rho = 0.05) nor the abundance of key taxa of bacteria previously associated with HIV-1 risk (rho = 0.04-0.25). Foreskin surface area also did not correlate with sub-preputial cytokine concentrations previously associated with HIV-1 risk (IL-8 rho = 0.05).Larger foreskin size is not associated with either increased penile anaerobes or pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that foreskin size does not increase HIV-1 risk through changes in penile microbiome composition or penile inflammation."

Despite advances in endoscopic technology, recommendations on diagnosis and management for jejunoileal diverticular haemorrhage have remained unchanged and these new options have not been compared against traditional surgical management.We retrospectively reviewed the diagnosis, management, and outcome for jejunoileal diverticular haemorrhage cases at our institution over the past 20 years. Data were organized and analysed by chi-square test, student t-test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.The most utilised diagnostic procedure was computed tomography, followed by enteroscopy, angiography, small bowel flow-through and surgery. Primary treatments included, in a decreasing order, medical therapy, surgery, endoscopy and radiology. Surgical treatment was not associated with rebleeding, but it did result in longer hospital stays and larger blood transfusions than non-surgical treatments. The bleeding-related mortality rate was very low. Notably, there was also little change in the diagnosis and treatment between decades.We presented our experience with the diagnosis and management of jejunoileal diverticular haemorrhage, as well as long-term follow-up after treatments that have not been reported previously. Surgical treatment continues to dominate management for jejunoileal diverticular haemorrhage, but we support increasing the role of endoscopy for select patient groups."

Dynamic polarization curves and morphological characterization were obtained at the center and near the edge zones under the electrolyte layer. The influence of the gas/liquid/solid three-phase boundary zone (TPB) on the corrosion behavior of the AZ91D magnesium alloy was discussed. The corrosion rate changed more significantly near the TPB zone than that at the other zones. The AZ91D alloy exhibited the characteristics of filiform corrosion together with shallow pitting corrosion. Different from the randomly distributed shallow pits, the filiform corrosion preferred to initiate near the TPB region and then progressively expanded adjacent to the edge of the electrolyte layer. The TPB zone played a vital role in determining the corrosion location, the corrosion morphologies and the corrosion rate of the magnesium alloy by influencing the mass transport process of carbon dioxide."

In Ghana, high prevalence of HAIs in relation to non-surgical (also called contaminated wounds) and surgical wounds (also called sterile wounds) is largely attributed to poor adherence to policy protocols for wound management by frontline clinical staff especially nurses.Investigate the extent to which nursing staff adhere to the policy protocol for management of non-surgical and surgical wounds in selected public health facilities in Ghana.This is an analytic case study among nursing staff (n = 140) in three government facilities in the Volta region of Ghana. Subjective and objective performance scores of staff on adherence proxies were compared using the Wilcoxon Signed-rank test, and univariate ordered logistic regression analysis used to predict staff likelihood of adherence to policy protocols on non-surgical and surgical wound management.Overall, staff self-rated themselves higher on subjective performance proxies relative to their objective scores (p<0.05). Staff with more years of work experience did not translate into a higher likelihood of adhering to standard protocol on wound management (Coef. = -0.49, CI = -0.93-0.05, p = 0.036). Being a senior nursing officer relative to lower nursing ranks increased staff likelihood of complying particularly with standard policy protocol for management of non-surgical wounds (Coef. 5.27, CI = 0.59 9.95, p = 0.027).There is the need for accelerated in-service training for staff on standard protocols for wound management coupled with supportive supervisions. Staff adherence to standard quality care protocols should be a pre-requisite for licensing of health facilities by regulatory bodies like Health Facilities Regulatory Agency and National Health Insurance Authority."
https://openalex.org/W3038036401,"Plant-soil feedback studies attempt to understand the interplay between composition of plant and soil microbial communities. A growing body of literature suggests that plant species can coexist when they interact with a subset of the soil microbial community that impacts plant performance. Most studies focus on the microbial community in the soil rhizosphere; therefore, the degree to which the bacterial community within plant roots (root-endophytic compartment) influences plant-microbe interactions remains relatively unknown. To determine if there is an interaction between conspecific vs heterospecific soil microbes and plant performance, we sequenced root-endophytic bacterial communities of five tallgrass-prairie plant species, each reciprocally grown with soil microbes from each hosts' soil rhizosphere. We found evidence of plant-soil feedbacks for some pairs of plant hosts; however, the strength and direction of feedbacks varied substantially across plant species pairs-from positive to negative feedbacks. Additionally, each plant species harbored a unique subset of root-endophytic bacteria. Conspecifics that hosted similar bacterial communities were more similar in biomass than individuals that hosted different bacterial communities, suggesting an important functional link between root-endophytic bacterial community composition and plant fitness. Our findings suggest a connection between an understudied component of the root-endophytic microbiome and plant performance, which may have important implications in understanding plant community composition and coexistence."
