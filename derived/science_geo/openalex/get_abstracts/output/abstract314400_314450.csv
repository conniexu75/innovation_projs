https://openalex.org/W2028566348,"A transmissible agent or factor has been found to be associated with all transplanted and spontaneous experimental tumors examined. This observation was made possible by utilization of a biochemical response of normal animals when inoculated with plasma or organ extracts from tumor-bearing hosts. This transmissible enzymic ""lesion"" is expressed by a five- to tenfold increase in the plasma lactic dehydrogenase activity of the injected normal test animals. The factor is heat labile, passes through bacteria-retaining filters, but is nondialyzable. It is partially sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000g for 1 hour."
https://openalex.org/W1985493295,"The causes of extreme differences in radiosensitivities of different plant (or animal) species have long puzzled radiobiologists. Our investigations show that, for diploid species, the larger the nuclear volume, the more radiosensitive the organism. Correspondingly, species with large nuclei have more deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) per nucleus than those possessing small nuclei. Our data now make it possible to predict fairly accurately the tolerance of plant species to ionizing radiation on the basis of average nuclear volume and DNA content. The same correlations are expected to hold for some microorganisms and for animals and may explain differences in sensitivities of different cell types in many living organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1989734882,"Imipramine augmented and prolonged methamphetamine-induced increases in the rate of responding of rats working for ""rewarding"" hypothalamic and midbrain stimulation. In contrast, chlorpromazine antagonized the effects of methamphetamine on self-stimulation. These opposite psychopharmacological effects are consistent with the different clinical effects of these drugs and suggest a mechanism for the antidepressive action of imipramine."
