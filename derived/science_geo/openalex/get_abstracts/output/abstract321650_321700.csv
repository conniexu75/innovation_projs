https://openalex.org/W2036444100,"Lead isotope data from Quaternary andesitic lavas of the Arequipa and Barroso groups of southern Peru and from regional Precambrian granulitic gneisses reveal a lead component in the lavas from the gneisses. The lava leads can be accounted for by two-component mixtures of lead from mantle and lower crustal sources, although the mixing process need not have occurred in the lower crust."
https://openalex.org/W2012000341,"Application of nonhydrostatic stress to rock induces velocity anisotropy, causing the S wave to split into two components traveling with somewhat different velocities. Large premonitory changes in the extent of S-wave splitting have been observed for two earthquakes in Nevada. Observations of the difference between the two S-wave velocities may provide a simple method for predicting earthquakes."

https://openalex.org/W2002078900,"It is proposed that the visible cloud deck on Venus is composed of droplets of sulfuric acid. These are formed by the very rapid photooxidation of carbonyl sulfide in the upper atmosphere. The clouds are best described as an extensive haze since the predicted particulate scale height probably exceeds the gas scale height within the layer. The predicted mixing ratio for water is 10-6 (lower limit), and for both carbonyl sulfide and sulfur dioxide it is 10-7 (upper limit); these are in good agreement with observations. Gaps in the layer are not possible unless the planetary scale dynamics produce cloud turnover times of less than a few days. Under these conditions the water mixing ratio could approach 10-4 and the formation of a thin hydrochloric acid haze at high altitude above the main cloud is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2020618644,"Newly emerged, juvenile wolf spiders do not settle on clothed or shaved areas of their mother's abdomen until after a period of days. Spiny, knobbed hairs, peculiar to adult female lycosids, apparently provide the stimulus and means for attachment by the inner layer of spiderlings. Innervated long, smooth hairs are mechanoreceptors which probably serve in other aspects of brood care."
https://openalex.org/W2033156284,Seismological investigations show that the Point Mugu earthquake involved north-south crustal shortening deep within the complex fault zone that marks the southern front of the Transverse Ranges province. This earthquake sequence results from the same stress system responsible for the deformation in this province in the Pliocene through Holocene and draws attention to the significant earthquake hazard that the southern frontal fault system poses to the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
https://openalex.org/W1993193279,"Solar eclipses were observed from locations near both edges of the paths of totality in England in 1715, in Australia in 1976, and in North America in 1979. Analysis of these observations shows that the solar radius has contracted by 0.34 +/- 0.2 arc second in 264 years."
