https://openalex.org/W1978813493,Arylsulfatase A and B have been demonstrated in preparations of human leukocytes. The level of activity of arylsulfatase A is markedly decreased in the preparations from patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy. Acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase B activities were normal. The assay of arylsulfatase A in leukocyte preparations can be useful in the diagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy while obviating the difficulties of current methods.

https://openalex.org/W2082036265,"Rats with hypertrophic smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and increased activities of the drug-handling enzymes induced by dieldrin were stressed with larger doses of the pesticide. The activity of the drug-handling enzymes was thus reduced, but liver weight, smooth ER, and P-450 hemoprotein remained elevated. While no changes were apparent by light microscopy, the hypertrophic, hypoactive smooth ER was recognized as tight clusters of tubular membranes associated with abnormalities of the mitochondrial membrane. Similar but not identical morphologic changes were noted in human liver diseases associated with hepatic insufficiency. Hypertrophic, hypoactive smooth ER may indicate transition from adaptation of injury, and can be used as a sensitive parameter of toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1981510247,"REPORTS on insect attractants are numerous, but few actually reveal the structure of a compound which is active outside the laboratory. We have identified the sex pheromone of the red-banded leaf roller moth, Argyrotaenia velutinana (Walker), to be cis-11-tetradecenyl acetate (I). This compound, synthesized in two independent ways, was found to be highly attractive in apple orchards to male moths of the same species."

https://openalex.org/W2086220971,"Transmission studies carried out in the laboratory incriminated Phlebotomus vexator occidentis as a vector of a species of trypanosome that infects Bufo boreas halophilus. Toads free of parasites contracted the trypanosome after eating infected flies and after intraperitoneal inoculation of flagellates cultured from the hindgut of flies that had fed on infected toads. Discovery of this vectorhost-parasite system in the Americas, and the localization of promastigote flagellates (leptomonads) in the hindgut of the vector, should assist in clarifying interpretative problems associated with infection of wild-caught flies in studies on leishmaniasis in the Americas and elsewhere."

The suspension was injected into a buffered 30 percent Ficoll, 58 percent sucrose discontinuous gradient previously loaded in the B XlV zonal rotor spinning at 3500 revolutions per minute. Intact neuronal perikarya were recovered as a discrete band in the dense sucrose zone of the gradient after centrifugation at 35,000 revolutions per minute for 45 minutes."

https://openalex.org/W2017694958,"INFESTATION by insect pests of stored grains is one of the principal causes of food losses in developing countries1. Fumigation and treatment with conventional organic insecticides are handicapped by the problems of residual toxicity and the development of resistant strains of insects. Williams2,3 has pointed out that juvenile hormone or its chemical analogues could be used as insecticides free from such disadvantages. We have explored the possibility of using a chemical analogue of juvenile hormone—methyl 3,7,11-trimethyl-7,11-dichloro-2-dodecenoate4 (MTDD)—in controlling the multiplication of stored grain pests and the preliminary results are reported in this communication."

https://openalex.org/W1985687385,"MAMMALIAN β-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase is known to be firmly bound to the outer membrane of mitochondria and can be extracted by the neutral detergent ‘Triton X-100’1. In the investigation reported here the same enzyme was shown—by a similar extraction procedure—to be present in the mitochondria of the protozoan Paramecium aurelia. Extracts were made from a number of clones isolated from a natural population of P. aurelia (syngen 9), collected near Edinburgh and examined by starch gel electrophoresis. Two electrophoretically distinct forms of the enzyme were found in different clones and have been designated HBD-1 and HBD-2 respectively (Fig. 1a)."

https://openalex.org/W2037764025,"Cessation of movement (stop response) is used as a criterion for light reception by the dinoflagellate Gyrodinium dorsum Kofoid. Brief irradiation (2 seconds at 470 nanometers) elicits a stop response in cells any time during the 6-minute interval after removal from growth lights. This stop response is inactivated by exposure for 4 minutes to 470-nanometer light prior to stimulation. Red light (620 nanometers) reactivates this stop response, and far-red light (700 nanometers) reverses this reactivation. This red-far-red photo reversibility is taken as evidence for phytochrome involvement."

In contrast, marked changes were produced by penicillamine although the degree of copperdeficiency induced by the drug was less. Large additions of copper to the diet failed to prevent the penicillamine-induced collagen defect when the drug was given parenterally. The effect of penicillamine on soft-tissue collagen appears to be unrelated to its copper-chelating properties."

Immunological response to infection can be measured by a variety of serological procedures5–7. Of these, complement fixation and indirect haemagglutination are most useful for the required differential diagnosis from viral infection, and for epidemiological studies. Both procedures have the disadvantage of requiring considerable time and the preparation of several reagents. The applicability of the indirect haemagglutination test would be greatly extended and the test made very simple if a source of antigen-coated cells were available."

The heterozygotes have been found in remarkably uniform frequencies, about 3 to 6 per cent, in Caucasians from Europe and North America3,8–11, and also in Australian aborigines12 and Mexican Indians13, but are relatively rare among Negroes11 and Mongoloids10,11,14."

https://openalex.org/W1986456160,"A THREE-dimensional model of the ES-complex formed between a chito-oligosaccharide and hen egg white lyso-zyme was presented by Blake et al. as a result of X-ray crystallographic investigations1. We reported that partially O-carboxymethylated chitin, which had satisfactory solubility, was highly susceptible to the action of lysozyme2 where the contents of the carboxymethyl groups were very roughly 0.3 mole/mole of N-acetoglucosamine residue. It is to be expected that the fairly bulky O-substituents will not permit such a free binding as that between unsubstituted chito-oligosaccharides and the enzyme, but will force the enzyme to select some suitable portions of the substrate molecules for making the ES-complex. Although it is impossible to know the exact location of the O-substituents on the high molecular substrate, the location of those on the enzymatic reaction products—which are low molecular compounds—can be determined. The orientation of the O-substituents in the product molecules must be reflexions of the conformation of the binding sub-sites in the ES-complex, because those suitable portions of the substrate molecule must have been fitted in the sub-sites before being released as low molecular saccharides."
