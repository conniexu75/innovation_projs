https://openalex.org/W2158265014,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies are common disorders of the peripheral nervous system caused by demyelination or axonal degeneration, or a combination of both features. We previously assigned the locus for autosomal dominant intermediate CMT neuropathy type C (DI-CMTC) to chromosome 1p34-p35. Here we identify two heterozygous missense mutations (G41R and E196K) and one de novo deletion (153-156delVKQV) in tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS) in three unrelated families affected with DI-CMTC. Biochemical experiments and genetic complementation in yeast show partial loss of aminoacylation activity of the mutant proteins, and mutations in YARS, or in its yeast ortholog TYS1, reduce yeast growth. YARS localizes to axonal termini in differentiating primary motor neuron and neuroblastoma cultures. This specific distribution is significantly reduced in cells expressing mutant YARS proteins. YARS is the second aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase found to be involved in CMT, thereby linking protein-synthesizing complexes with neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2006460442,"The initial differential treatment of the two X chromosomes during X-chromosome inactivation is controlled by the X-inactivation centre (Xic). This locus determines how many X chromosomes are present in a cell ('counting') and which X chromosome will be inactivated in female cells ('choice'). Critical control sequences in the Xic include the non-coding RNAs Xist and Tsix, and long-range chromatin elements. However, little is known about the process that ensures that X inactivation is triggered appropriately when more than one Xic is present in a cell. Using three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, we showed that the two Xics transiently colocalize, just before X inactivation, in differentiating female embryonic stem cells. Using Xic transgenes capable of imprinted but not random X inactivation, and Xic deletions that disrupt random X inactivation, we demonstrated that Xic colocalization is linked to Xic function in random X inactivation. Both long-range sequences and the Tsix element, which generates the antisense transcript to Xist, are required for the transient interaction of Xics. We propose that transient colocalization of Xics may be necessary for a cell to determine Xic number and to ensure the correct initiation of X inactivation."

To test this hypothesis, we generated adiponectin knock-out (adipo-/-) ob/ob mice with a C57B/6 background. After 14 days of 10 mg/kg pioglitazone, the insulin resistance and diabetes of ob/ob mice were significantly improved in association with significant up-regulation of serum adiponectin levels. Amelioration of insulin resistance in ob/ob mice was attributed to decreased glucose production and increased AMP-activated protein kinase in the liver but not to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. In contrast, insulin resistance and diabetes were not improved in adipo-/-ob/ob mice. After 14 days of 30 mg/kg pioglitazone, insulin resistance and diabetes of ob/ob mice were again significantly ameliorated, which was attributed not only to decreased glucose production in the liver but also to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, adipo-/-ob/ob mice also displayed significant amelioration of insulin resistance and diabetes, which was attributed to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle but not to decreased glucose production in the liver. The serum-free fatty acid and triglyceride levels as well as adipocyte sizes in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice were unchanged after 10 mg/kg pioglitazone but were significantly reduced to a similar degree after 30 mg/kg pioglitazone. Moreover, the expressions of TNFα and resistin in adipose tissues of ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice were unchanged after 10 mg/kg pioglitazone but were decreased after 30 mg/kg pioglitazone. Thus, pioglitazone-induced amelioration of insulin resistance and diabetes may occur adiponectin dependently in the liver and adiponectin independently in skeletal muscle. *Thiazolidinediones have been shown to up-regulate adiponectin expression in white adipose tissue and plasma adiponectin levels, and these up-regulations have been proposed to be a major mechanism of the thiazolidinedione-induced amelioration of insulin resistance linked to obesity.

Independently, administration of adiponectin has been reported to decrease plasma glucose levels by suppressing hepatic glucose production (21Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat.

TZDs increase plasma adiponectin levels in animal models of obesity and diabetes, nondiabetic subjects, and patients with type 2 diabetes, and the improvement in insulin sensitivity in response to TZD administration is associated with an increase in circulating adiponectin (20Yamauchi T.

Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that the action whereby TZDs increase insulin sensitivity is mediated, at least in part, by increased adiponectin. However, whether the TZD-induced increase in plasma adiponectin is causally involved in TZD-mediated insulin-sensitizing effects has not been addressed experimentally. To address this issue, in the present study, we used adipo-/-ob/ob mice with a C57Bl/6 background to investigate whether the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone is capable of ameliorating insulin resistance in the absence of adiponectin. The absence of adiponectin had no effect on either the obesity or the diabetic phenotype of these mice. We found that the insulin resistance and diabetes of ob/ob mice was significantly improved in association with significant up-regulation of serum adiponectin levels after 14 days of 10 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment. Amelioration of insulin resistance in ob/ob mice was attributed to decreased glucose production and increased AMPK in the liver but not to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. In contrast, insulin resistance and diabetes were not improved in adipo-/-ob/ob mice. After 14 days of 30 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment, insulin resistance and diabetes of ob/ob mice were again significantly ameliorated, which was attributed not only to decreased glucose production in the liver but also to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, adipo-/-ob/ob mice also displayed significant amelioration of insulin resistance and diabetes, which was attributed to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle but not to decreased glucose production in the liver. Thus, pioglitazone-induced amelioration of insulin resistance and diabetes is mediated via both adiponectin-dependent pathway in the liver and adiponectin-independent pathway in skeletal muscle. Mice were housed on a 12-h light-dark cycle and fed standard chow CE-2 (CLEA Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with the following composition: 25.6% (w/w) protein, 3.8% fiber, 6.9% ash, 50.5% carbohydrates, 4% fat, and 9.2% water. To rule out the potential impact of the expression cassettes for the selection of targeted ES cells in the targeted allele on the expression of genes surrounding the adiponectin locus, selection cassettes were deleted by the Cre-Pac method as described previously (36Taniguchi M. Sanbo M. Watanabe S. Naruse I. Mishina M. Yagi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), with some modification. We then backcrossed the original adipo-/- mice (C57Bl/6 and 129/sv background) (24Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Yamauchi T. Kubota T. Moroi M. Matsui J. Eto K. Yamashita T. Kamon J. Satoh H. Yano W.

All experiments in this study were conducted on male littermates. The animal care and procedures of the experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Tokyo. 10 mg/kg pioglitazone (AD-4833-HCl) or vehicle (0.25% carboxymethylcellulose) was adnimistered to ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice by oral gavage once daily for 14 consecutive days. 30 mg/kg pioglitazone or vehicle was also adnimistered to ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice by oral gavage once daily for 14 consecutive days. Pioglitazone was kindly provided by Takeda Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Clamp studies were carried out as described previously (37Suzuki R. Tobe K. Aoyama M. Inoue A. Sakamoto K.

In brief, 2-3 days before the study, an infusion catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein under general anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital. Studies were performed on mice under conscious and unstressed conditions after a 6-h fast. A primed continuous infusion of insulin (Humulin R, Lilly) was given (5.0 milliunits/kg/min), and the blood glucose concentration, monitored every 5 min, was maintained at ∼120 mg/dl by administration of glucose (5 g of glucose per 10 ml enriched to ∼20% with [6,6-2H2]glucose (Sigma)) for 120 min. Blood was sampled via tail tip bleeds at 90, 105, and 120 min for determination of the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd). Rd was calculated according to nonsteady-state equations (37Suzuki R.

Tissues were excised and homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were detected with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To examine AMPK phosphorylation and protein levels, hepatic lysates were blotted for anti-phosho-AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) and anti-AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) antibody. Mice were fasted for more than 16 h before the measurements. Serum adiponectin levels were determined with a mouse adiponectin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Serum triglyceride and free fatty acids (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were assayed by enzymatic methods. Glucose Tolerance Test—Mice were fasted for more than 16 h before the study and then orally loaded with glucose, 1.5 mg/g body weight. Blood samples were collected from the orbital sinus at different times, and glucose was measured with an automatic glucometer (Glutest Ace, Sanwa Chemical Co., Nagoya, Japan). Whole blood was collected and centrifuged in heparinized tubes, and the plasma was stored at -20 °C. Insulin levels were determined with an insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Biotrak, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) with rat insulin as the standard (38Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K.

They were intraperitoneally challenged with human insulin, 0.75 milliunits/g of body weight (Humulin R), and venous blood samples were drawn at different times (38Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K.

Epididymal white adipose tissue was routinely processed for paraffin embedding, and 2-μm sections were cut and mounted on silanized slides. The adipose tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and total adipocyte area was manually traced and analyzed with Win ROOF software (Mitani Co. Ltd., Chiba, Japan). White adipocyte area was measured in 200 or more cells per mouse in each group according to methods described previously (39Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Nakano R.

Total RNA was prepared from adipose tissue with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Co., Düsseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA levels in white adipose tissue were quantitatively analyzed by fluorescence-based reverse transcriptase-PCR. The reverse transcription mixture was amplified with specific primers, using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector equipped with a thermocycler. The primers used for β-actin were as described previously (40Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Tobe K. Yano W. Suzuki R. Ueki K. Takamoto I. Satoh H. Maki T. Kubota T. Moroi M. Okada-Iwabu M. Ezaki O. Nagai R. Ueta Y. Kadowaki T. Noda T. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The primers used for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), TNFα, and resistin were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Relative expression levels were compared after normalization to β-actin. Absence of Adiponectin Had No Effects on Obesity, Fasting Hyperglycemia, or Fasting Hyperinsulinemia—The ob/ob mice and adipo-/-ob/ob mice on a standard diet gained total body weight at comparable rates (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice showed comparable fasting hyperglycemia (Fig. 1B) and comparable fasting hyperinsulinemia (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that the absence of adiponectin had no effect on either the obesity or the diabetic phenotype of these mice. 10 mg/kg Pioglitazone for 14 Days Improved Diabetes in ob/ob Mice but Not in adipo-/-ob/ob Mice—Ob/ob mice showed diabetic glucose tolerance (Fig. 2A). 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days significantly increased serum adiponectin levels in the ob/ob mice (Fig. 2A, inset). After 14 days of 10 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed that the blood glucose level of pioglitazone-treated ob/ob mice 15 min after glucose loading was significantly lower than that of untreated ob/ob mice (Fig. 2A). Adipo-/-ob/ob mice showed comparable diabetic glucose tolerance to ob/ob mice (Fig. 2B). Serum adiponectin levels were not detectable in adipo-/-ob/ob mice before and after 14 days of 10 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment (Fig. 2B, inset). Unlike ob/ob mice, the blood glucose levels before and after glucose loading were indistinguishable between untreated and treated adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 2B). We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) during the OGTT to quantitate glucose intolerance. Before pioglitazone treatment, the AUCs were indistinguishable between ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 2C). The AUCs became significantly smaller after pioglitazone treatment in the ob/ob/mice but not in the adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 2C). Both ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice showed hyperinsulinemia before and after glucose loading; however, the plasma insulin levels 15 min after glucose loading tended to be reduced in the adipo-/-ob/ob mice as compared with ob/ob mice (p = 0.11), as we reported previously in the adipo-/- mice as compared with wild-type mice (24Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Yamauchi T. Kubota T. Moroi M. Matsui J. Eto K. Yamashita T. Kamon J. Satoh H. Yano W. Froguel P. Nagai R. Kimura S. Kadowaki T. Noda T. J. Biol.

The plasma insulin levels of pioglitazone-treated ob/ob mice before and after glucose loading were significantly lower than those of untreated ob/ob mice (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the plasma insulin levels before and after glucose loading were indistinguishable between untreated and treated adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 2D). These findings indicate that pioglitazone ameliorates diabetes in mice with an ob/ob background in an adiponectin-dependent manner. 10 mg/kg Pioglitazone for 14 Days Improved Insulin Resistance in the Liver of ob/ob Mice but Not of adipo-/-ob/ob Mice—We next carried out hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice to investigate the effect of pioglitazone on amelioration of insulin resistance in the liver and skeletal muscle. Before pioglitazone treatment, GIR were comparable in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 3A). After 14 days of 10 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment, the GIR of pioglitazone-treated ob/ob mice was significantly higher than that of untreated ob/ob mice, indicating insulin resistance in ob/ob mice to be improved (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the GIR were indistinguishable between untreated and pioglitazone-treated adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 3A). The amelioration of insulin resistance in ob/ob mice was, at least in part, due to decreased EGP (Fig. 3B). Rates of Rd were indistinguishable between ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice, and 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days had no effect on these levels in either genotype (Fig. 3C). PEPCK expression levels in the liver were comparable in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice before pioglitazone treatment (Fig. 3D). 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days significantly decreased PEPCK expression in ob/ob, but not adipo-/-ob/ob, mice (Fig. 3D). AMPK expression levels in the liver did not differ significantly between ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice before or after pioglitazone treatment (Fig. 3E). AMPK activities before pioglitazone treatment were comparable in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 3E). AMPK phosphorylation in ob/ob mice was significantly increased after 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days but was unchanged in adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 3E). These findings indicate that pioglitazone ameliorates hepatic, but not muscle, insulin resistance in mice with an ob/ob background in an adiponectin-dependent manner via, at least in part, decreased gluconeogenesis and increased AMPK activation. 30 mg/kg Pioglitazone for 14 Days Improved Diabetes to a Similar Degree in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob Mice—We next administered 30 mg/kg pioglitazone to ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice for 14 days. 30 mg/kg pioglitazone also significantly increased serum adiponectin levels in the ob/ob mice (Fig. 4A, inset), but the serum adiponectin levels after 30 mg/ml pioglitazone were not significantly different from those after 10 mg/kg pioglitazone (Fig. 2A, inset, and Fig. 4A, inset). The blood glucose levels of pioglitazone-treated ob/ob mice before and after glucose loading were significantly lower than those of untreated ob/ob mice (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the blood glucose levels of pioglitazone-treated adipo-/-ob/ob mice before and after glucose loading became significantly lower than those of untreated adipo-/-ob/ob mice, being similar to the levels seen in ob/ob/mice (Fig. 4B). The AUCs during the OGTT of both groups became smaller after pioglitazone treatment, but they were indistinguishable between the ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 4C). The plasma insulin levels of pioglitazone-treated ob/ob mice before and after glucose loading were significantly lower than those of untreated ob/ob mice (Fig. 4D). Similarly, the plasma insulin levels before glucose loading of pioglitazone-treated adipo-/-ob/ob mice also became significantly lower than those of untreated adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 4E). 30 mg/kg Pioglitazone for 14 Days Improved Insulin Resistance in the Liver and Skeletal Muscle of ob/ob Mice but Only in Skeletal Muscle of adipo-/-ob/ob Mice—We next carried out hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice to investigate the effect of 30 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment on amelioration of insulin resistance in the liver and skeletal muscle. After 14 days of 30 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment, the GIR of pioglitazone-treated ob/ob mice was significantly higher than that of untreated ob/ob mice (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the GIR of pioglitazone-treated adipo-/-ob/ob mice was also significantly higher than that of untreated adipo-/-ob/ob mice, indicating insulin resistance in adipo-/-ob/ob mice to be improved (Fig. 5A). The EGP was significantly decreased in ob/ob mice after 30 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment but not in adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the Rd was significantly increased in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice to a similar degree after 30 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment (Fig. 5C). 30 mg/kg pioglitazone significantly decreased PEPCK expression in ob/ob mice but not in adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 5D). AMPK phosphorylation in ob/ob mice was significantly increased after 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days but was unchanged in adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 5E). These findings suggest that the amelioration of insulin resistance in adipo-/-ob/ob mice was, at least in part, due to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. 30 mg/kg Pioglitazone for 14 Days, but Not 10 mg/kg for 14 Days, Ameliorated Adipocyte Hypertrophy in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob Mice—We previously demonstrated that TZDs increased the number of small adipocytes and decreased the number of large adipocytes, thereby ameliorating insulin resistance (6Okuno A. Tamemoto H. Tobe K. Ueki K. Mori Y. Iwamoto K. Umesono K. Akanuma Y. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). To determine whether the presence of adiponectin is required for the reduction of average adipocyte size induced by TZDs to occur, we histologically analyzed epididymal fat pads after fixation and quantitation of adipocyte size. The adipocyte sizes of ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice were indistinguishable and were not changed by 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days (Fig. 6, A and B). 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days, however, significantly reduced adipocyte sizes of ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice to a similar degree (Fig. 6, C and D). These results suggest that pioglitazone can induce a reduction in adipocyte size in the absence of adiponectin or leptin or the absence of both. 30 mg/kg Pioglitazone, but Not 10 mg/kg, Significantly Decreased Serum Triglyceride and Free Fatty Acid Levels in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob Mice—In addition to improving insulin resistance, TZDs reportedly reduce serum triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels (6Okuno A.

However, since the possible involvement of adiponectin in this action of TZDs remains unclear, we investigated the effects of pioglitazone treatment on serum lipid levels. The serum TG levels of the ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice were essentially the same (Fig. 7A), and 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days did not change the serum TG levels in either genotype (Fig. 7A). Serum FFA levels were also indistinguishable between ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 7B), and 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days again had no effect on these levels in either group of mice (Fig. 7B). However, 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days significantly decreased serum TG levels, to a similar degree, in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 7C). 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days also lowered FFA levels in both genotypes, and the serum FFA levels of ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice became similar after pioglitazone treatment (Fig. 7D). 30 mg/kg Pioglitazone, but Not 10 mg/kg, Reduced TNFα and Resistin Expressions in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob Mice—TNFα and resistin have been shown to be important mediators of insulin resistance linked to obesity (13Hotamisligil G.S.

TNFα expression tended to be higher in the adipo-/-ob/ob mice than in the ob/ob mice (Fig. 8A). After 14 days of 10 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment, TNFα expression was not significantly changed in either ob/ob or adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 8A). Resistin expressions were indistinguishable between ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice before and after 14 days of 10 mg/kg pioglitazone (Fig. 8B). After 14 days of 30 mg/kg pioglitazone, however, TNFα expressions were significantly decreased in both ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice (Fig. 8C), and resistin expressions tended to be lower in both pioglitazone-treated groups than in the untreated groups (Fig. 8D). TZDs have been reported to alleviate insulin resistance in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver (5Yki-Jarvinen H. N. Engl. J.

However, since PPARγ, which is bound and activated by TZDs, is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, it is reasonable to speculate that the effect of TZDs on insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and the liver is mediated largely via the effects of TZDs on adipose tissue including alterations of adipokine expression and secretion by adipocytes (5Yki-Jarvinen H.

Adiponectin has been proposed to be a major insulin-sensitizing adipokine (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O.

Med. 2002; 8: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar) and is a plausible candidate for one of the adipokines that may mediate the TZD-induced amelioration of insulin resistance. Therefore, in this study, we used obesity models, ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice, to investigate whether the TZD-induced increase in plasma adiponectin is causally involved in TZD-mediated insulin-sensitizing effects. Insulin resistance and diabetes improved significantly in ob/ob mice in association with significant up-regulation of serum adiponectin levels with 14 days of 10 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment. Amelioration of insulin resistance in ob/ob mice was attributed to improvement of hepatic, but not muscle, insulin resistance. These improvements by pioglitazone were significantly obliterated in adipo-/-ob/ob mice, indicating that adiponectin is causally involved in the 10 mg/kg pioglitazone-mediated amelioration of hepatic insulin resistance and diabetes. In fact, while PEPCK expression levels were significantly decreased and AMPK activity was significantly increased in the livers of ob/ob mice, these changes were not seen in mice without adiponectin. Interestingly, 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days failed to improve adipocyte hypertrophy, or the elevations of TG and FFA in serum and TNFα and resistin in white adipose tissue, despite elevated serum adiponectin concentrations in ob/ob mice. This suggests that adiponectin-dependent amelioration of hepatic insulin resistance and diabetes occurs independently of adipocyte size, serum TG, and FFA levels or TNFα and resistin levels in adipose tissue. On the other hand, 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days unexpectedly ameliorated insulin resistance and diabetes both in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice. Although the hepatic insulin resistance was not improved in adipo-/-ob/ob mice as seen after 10 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment, muscle insulin resistance was alleviated in adipo-/-ob/ob mice to a similar degree in ob/ob mice after 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days. This suggests that 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days can ameliorate muscle insulin resistance and diabetes via mechanisms which do not require the presence of adiponectin. We previously reported that TZD treatment resulted in smaller adipocytes and a decreased number of large adipocytes, both of which were accompanied by decreases in TNFα, resistin, and FFA and an increase in adiponectin (6Okuno A. Tamemoto H. Tobe K. Ueki K. Mori Y. Iwamoto K. Umesono K. Akanuma Y. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Clin.

Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4074) Google Scholar). In fact, 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days, but not 10 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days, significantly reduced adipocyte size in ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice to a similar degree. Moreover, insulin resistance-causing adipokines, such as TNFα, resistin, and FFA, were similarly reduced by 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days in adipo-/-ob/ob mice as well as ob/ob mice. Thus, adiponectin was not absolutely required for 30 mg/kg pioglitazone-induced reductions in TNFα, resistin, or FFA. The smaller adipocytes, as well as the decreases in TNFα, resistin, and FFA, may have played a role in the amelioration of muscle insulin resistance and diabetes produced by 30 mg/kg pioglitazone for 14 days. Recently, Wellen et al. (41Wellen K.E. Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S. Yang Q. Chen H. Hotamisligil G.S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2214-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) investigated whether the ability of TZDs to block TNFα action may be relevant to its ability to improve insulin action and the metabolism of lipids such as serum TG and FFA, using obese ob/ob mice lacking TNFα function. TZDs significantly ameliorated blood glucose and lipid levels in mice with and without TNFα function. This suggests that TZDs can improve blood glucose and lipid levels in a TNFα-independent manner. Therefore, resistin, FFA, and/or other cytokine(s), but perhaps not TNFα, may play roles in TZD-induced amelioration of insulin resistance and diabetes. Although both low (10 mg/kg) and high (30 mg/kg) doses of pioglitazone ameliorated insulin resistance and diabetes, the underlying mechanisms may be different. The low dose of pioglitazone may be largely dependent on the adiponectin pathway, while the high dose of pioglitazone also improves adiponectin-independent pathways. High dose pioglitazone treatment in this study showed no significant difference in the ability to ameliorate insulin resistance and diabetes between ob/ob and adipo-/-ob/ob mice, but the presence of adiponectin might have affected insulin resistance and diabetes in these mouse models, if the duration of 30 mg/kg pioglitazone treatment had been longer. The degree to which the adiponectin-dependent pathway is involved in TZD-induced amelioration of insulin resistance and diabetes merits further study in murine models and eventually in humans. In this study, we addressed the important question of whether TZD-induced up-regulation of plasma adiponectin levels is causally involved in the insulin sensitizing actions of TZDs and demonstrated that TZD-induced amelioration of insulin resistance and diabetes may occur adiponectin-dependently in the liver and adiponectin-independently in skeletal muscle.

https://openalex.org/W2084745121,"The ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinases are crucial regulatory proteins in genotoxic stress response pathways that pause the cell cycle to permit DNA repair. Here we show that Chk1 phosphorylation in response to hydroxyurea and ultraviolet radiation is ATR-dependent and ATM- and Mre11-independent. In contrast, Chk1 phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation (IR) is dependent on ATR, ATM, and Mre11. The ATR and ATM/Mre11 pathways are generally thought to be separate with ATM activation occurring early and ATR activation occurring as a late response to double strand breaks. However, we demonstrate that ATR is activated rapidly by IR, and ATM and Mre11 enhance ATR signaling. ATR-ATR-interacting protein recruitment to double strand breaks is less efficient in the absence of ATM and Mre11. Furthermore, IR-induced replication protein A foci formation is defective in ATM- and Mre11-deficient cells. Thus, ATM and Mre11 may stimulate the ATR signaling pathway by converting DNA damage generated by IR into structures that recruit and activate ATR."

Found in all multicellular eukaryotes, RBCC proteins are involved in a vast array of intracellular functions; but as a general rule, they appear to function as part of large protein complexes and possess ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity. Those members characterized to date have diverse C-terminal domain compositions and equally diverse subcellular localizations and functions. Using a bioinformatics approach, we have identified some new RBCC proteins that help define a subfamily that shares an identical domain arrangement (MID1, MID2, TRIM9, TNL, TRIM36, and TRIFIC). Significantly, we show that all analyzed members of this subfamily associate with the microtubule cytoskeleton, suggesting that subcellular compartmentalization is determined by the unique domain architecture, which may in turn reflect basic functional similarities. We also report a new motif called the COS box, which is found within these proteins, the MURF family, and a distantly related non-RBCC microtubule-binding protein. Notably, we demonstrate that mutations in the COS box abolish microtubule binding ability, whereas its incorporation into a nonmicrotubule-binding RBCC protein redirects it to microtubule structures. Further bioinformatics investigation permitted subclassification of the entire human RBCC complement into nine subfamilies based on their varied C-terminal domain compositions.

Members of the RBCC (N-terminal RING finger/B-box/coiled coil) or TRIM (tripartite motif) family of proteins perform a diverse array of cellular roles, yet are believed to share some functional properties: 1) act as a scaffold for the assembly of larger multiprotein complexes and 2) possess RING-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity (1Henry J.

We have previously identified and characterized two RBCC proteins, MID1 and its closely related homolog, MID2. MID1 and MID2 contain a B30.2-like domain at their C terminus and a single fibronectin type III (FN3) 2The abbreviations used are: FN3, fibronectin type III; EST, expressed sequence tag; HMM, hidden Markov model; MSAs, multiple sequence alignments; GFP, green fluorescent protein; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. motif between it and their N-terminal RBCC domain (8Perry J. Short K.M. Romer J.T. Swift S. Cox T.C. Ashworth A. Genomics. 1999; 62: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both proteins have been shown to associate with microtubules (8Perry J.

BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consistent with their high level of sequence and structural similarity, MID1 and MID2 can even interact with some of the same proteins (5Short K.M. Hopwood B. Yi Z. Cox T.C. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and both likely possess ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity (10Trockenbacher A. Suckow V. Foerster J. Winter J. Krauss S. Ropers H.H. Schneider R. Schweiger S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Mutations in MID1 have been identified in patients with Opitz syndrome, a disorder recognized by a combination of congenital anomalies that includes cleft lip and palate as well as heart and anogenital defects. Although mutations have been found in most domains of MID1, mutations in the C-terminal domain predominate and result in significantly altered cellular localization of the protein (4Cox T.C.

Ropers H.H. Schneider R. Schweiger S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). At the time of their identification, MID1 and MID2 represented the only known RBCC superfamily members with an FN3 motif. A third mammalian protein (Spring/TRIM9) that shares the same domain organization as MID1 and MID2 was subsequently discovered (12Li Y. Chin L.S. Weigel C. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40824-40833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Berti C. Messali S. Ballabio A. Reymond A. Meroni G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 113: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This protein is specifically expressed in neural tissue and appears to play a regulatory role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis (12Li Y. Chin L.S. Weigel C. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40824-40833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To identify additional proteins with a similar domain arrangement, we undertook an analysis of public expressed sequence tag (EST) and genomic data, which indicated that other related proteins may indeed be encoded by the human genome. Support for this notion came recently from the report of Haprin, a new testis-specific FN3 motif- and B30.2-like domain-containing RBCC protein that is clearly the murine ortholog of a sequence identified in our screen. Functional data suggest that Haprin plays a regulatory role in exocytosis of the sperm vesicle (14Kitamura K. Tanaka H. Nishimune Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44417-44423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification of two novel proteins, TRIFIC and TNL, which share the same overall domain organization as MID1, MID2, TRIM9 (the human ortholog of rat Spring), and TRIM36 (the human ortholog of mouse Haprin), and show for the first time that all analyzed members of this RBCC subfamily associate with the microtubule cytoskeleton. We also describe a novel amino acid signature adjacent to the coiled coil (named the COS box) that, when mutated at key conserved residues, results in a complete loss of microtubule localization, but not dimerization ability. Additionally, a fusion protein generated from a C terminus containing a COS box from a microtubule-associated protein and an RBCC/TRIM domain from a non-cytoskeleton-associated protein redirects localization to microtubule structures. We subsequently reanalyzed the entire human RBCC family, enabling classification into nine subgroups based on a consensus C-terminal domain organization provided by Pfam, SMART, PRINTS, PROFILE, and PATTERN analyses. The implications of this subclassification in understanding the broader function of RBCC proteins are discussed. Alignment and Phylogenetic and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Analysis—General amino acid and nucleotide sequence handling was aided by Vector NTI Suite (version 7.01, Invitrogen, Mulgrave, New South Wales, Australia), and multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were post-processed for publication using CHROMA, removing regions of low homology across the family and producing an 85% consensus according to convention (15Goodstadt L. Ponting C.P. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 845-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). MSAs were generated using a combination of manual, ClustalX (16Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M.

Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar) alignments using a best fit approach. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on MSA data using PHYLIP Version 3.62 (20Felsenstein J. PHYLIP Version 3.62. Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA2004Google Scholar). Human sequences were used together with Drosophila melanogaster TRIM9 as a representative of an ancestral RBCC/FN3/B30.2-like subfamily member. A maximum likelihood approach was used to infer phylogeny using the SEQBOOT, ProML, CONSENSE, and DRAWTREE programs, with 100 bootstrap resample data sets being used to test inferred phylogeny vigor. Bootstrap consensus figures were placed on the tree with post-processing using Adobe Illustrator Version 10 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). HMM analysis used pre- and post-processing Perl scripts 3Modified Perl scripts used for large-scale GenBank™ HMM scanning (which conserve disk space) can be requested from the authors, as can a Cygwin-packaged version to run the analysis on a Windows PC running Cygwin (Redhat) with Perl Version 5.8. for the handling of MSA data and HMMER execution (21Truong K. Ikura M. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Two Sun Blade 100 workstations and an Apple G5 dual CPU workstation were used for data generation, and all HMMs were created using Sun Solaris Version 6.0 and G5 Altivec optimized versions of HMMER Version 2.3.2 (22Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Microsoft Excel was used for converting post-processed HMMER data to a graphical output format using in-built pivot table functions. CHROMA-processed MSAs, the phylogenetic tree, and HMMER graphical output was presented using Adobe Illustrator Version 10. Plasmid Constructions—MID1 and MID2 cDNAs and fusions were already cloned and available (4Cox T.C. Allen L.R. Cox L.L. Hopwood B. Goodwin B. Haan E. Suthers G.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2553-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Short K.M. Hopwood B. Yi Z. Cox T.C. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Perry J. Short K.M. Romer J.T. Swift S. Cox T.C. Ashworth A. Genomics. 1999; 62: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Human full-length cDNA clones from the IMAGE collection were identified for TRIM9 (IMAGE clone 5243288) and TRIM36 (IMAGE clone 4826462), but not for TRIFIC. Instead, a murine full-length Trific cDNA (IMAGE clone 3813814) that encodes a protein with 98% amino acid identity to human TRIFIC was identified. A full-length cDNA clone was not available for either human TNL or mouse Tnl at the time of this study. Full-length cDNAs were amplified for the purpose of recloning using the following sequence-specific primer pairs: hTRIM9-dTop (5′-CACCATGGAGGAGATGGAAGAGGAG-3′) and hTRIM9-rEco (5′-GGAATTCTTAGGCTATTGATGCTCTGCTG-3′); hTRIM36-dTop (5′-CACCATGGAGGGCGATGGCTCAGATTCG-3′) and hTRIM36-rNot (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCTACATGTCCTCTTGGTATTCCAG-3′); and mTrific-dTop (5′-CACCATGGGTGGTGCCCTTGAAATAAATGC-3′) and mTrific-rEco (5′-GGAATTCTCAGTCCAGTTTGGCAAAGCCC-3′). All cDNA sequences were verified by alignment with publicly available genomic data. Of note, IMAGE clone 5243288 contains a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid alteration in the B30.2-like domain. This change was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers fTRIM9-1959C→ A (5′-GGGTCCTCCTCGACTTAAATAGAAAAAAC-3′) and rTrim9-1959C→ A(5′-GTTTTTTCTATTTAAGTCGAGGAGGACCC-3′). IMAGE clone 4826462 contains a large insertion of bacterial sequence within the cDNA, which was corrected using a high fidelity PCR approach with cloning primers in combination with specifically designed primers T36EST-fixFor (5′-CCACCGTGTAACCACCGTGTAACCACTATGAGCAGTGCCTACAAAACCTTAAAGGAAAAG-3′) and T36EST-fixRev (5′-GCTTTTCCTTTAAGGTTTTGTAGGCACTGCTCATAGTGGTTACACGGTG-3′). Sequence-verified cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector pcDNA-DEST53 and the yeast two-hybrid Gal4 activation domain (pDEST-22) and DNA-binding domain (pDEST-32) vectors using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). Mutations were introduced into the GFP-MID1 construct to study COS box function and were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using primers fMIDcosFLQ→ AAA (5′-GGAGAATGATCATGCGCGTGCGGCCGCTACTGCTAAGAATATCACCGAG-3′), rMidcosFLQ→ AAA (5′-CTCGGTGATATTCTTAGCAGTAGCGGCCGCACGCGCATGATCATTCTCC-3′), fMIDcosLDY→AAA (5′-GAAGAAACTGCTAGAATGTGCGGCCGCCCTTACAGCTCCCAACCCTC-3′), and rMidcosLDY→ AAA (5′-GAGGGTTGGGAGCTGTAAGGGCGGCCGCACATTCTAGCAGTTTCTTC-3′). All introduced mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing. Fusions of the TRIM37 tripartite domain with the COS box or C-terminal domains (including the COS box) were generated by PCR amplification of TRIM37D cDNA (kindly supplied by Anna-Elina Lehesjoki, Neuroscience Center and Folkhälsan Institute of Genetics, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland) using primers TRIMD-F (5′-CACCATGGATGAACAGAGCGTGGAGAGC-3′) and TRIMD-R (5′-CCGCTTGGGAGATGAGTGATGCATGAACTTGCTGAAACATCATAAGGATCTCTG-3′), which contain extensions that overlap the fusion region from the MID1 C-terminal fragments. The MID1 fragments were amplified with forward primer COS-F (5′-CCTTATGATGTTTCAGCAAGTTCATGCATCACTCATCTCCCAAGCGG-3′) and reverse primer M1FN3-R (5′-GTTTGTCTTCAACTTCCCAGG-3′), from a mutated MID1 cDNA template (containing an introduced TGA codon at position 380) for the COS box fusion, or with M1SPRY-R (5′-TCACGGCAGCTGCTCTGTGCAGTC-3′), from a wild-type MID1 cDNA for the full C-terminal domain fusion. Products from the TRIMD reaction were pooled with either COS box or C-terminal reactions, and extension of the annealed overlapping regions was completed with a secondary round of PCR. The full-length fragments were purified and cloned into pENTR-D/TOPO (Invitrogen), and positives were subcloned into vector pcDNA-DEST53 using the Gateway cloning system. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with qualified heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection of plasmid DNA was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Castle Hill, New South Wales). Transfected cells were grown on coverslips for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and then fixed as described previously (4Cox T.C. Allen L.R. Cox L.L. Hopwood B. Goodwin B. Haan E. Suthers G.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2553-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Microtubule staining was performed post-fixation using an anti-α-tubulin primary antibody and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Fused Myc tag was detected using mouse anti-Myc antibody 9E10, and the same mouse secondary antibody was used as per tubulin. Nuclei were visualized using the DNA-specific Hoechst stain (Sigma, Sydney, New South Wales). GFP and Texas Red fluorescence was detected at appropriate wavelength light using an Olympus AX70 microscope. Images were captured using a Photometrics CE200A camera electronics unit and processed using Photoshop Version 7 software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The ProQuest yeast two-hybrid system (Invitrogen) was employed to assess interactions between MID1, MID2, and other subfamily members. All yeast two-hybrid fusion constructs were transfected into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MaV203 yeast strain (MATα, leu2-3,112, trp1-901, his3Δ200, ade2-101, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, SPAL10::URA3, GAL1::lacZ, LYS2::PHIS3UASGAL1-HIS3, can1R, cyh2R) by polyethylene glycol/LiAc/Tris-EDTA transfection (23Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The HIS3 reporter was used to determine the level of self-activation of the fusions based on the level of 3-aminotriazole resistance of the transformed yeast. 50 mm 3-aminotriazole was found to be an adequate level for the assay of all generated fusions. Transfections were plated on selective synthetic complete medium lacking Leu and Trp, from which colonies were picked, and cultures were established and grown for 24 h at 30 °C in selective medium. Normalized diluted cultures (10 μl at 0.1 A600) were then spotted onto interaction-selective synthetic complete medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His and containing 50 mm 3-aminotriazole and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. For X-gal assays, spots of selectively cultured transfected yeast were placed on nitrocellulose Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Castle Hill) overlaid on complete medium and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 48 h. X-gal assays were performed as reported previously (24Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and all post-assay plates and filters were scanned using a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet scanner with Adobe Photoshop. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Preparations of the various GFP- and Myc-tagged expression constructs were made using a DNA plasmid midi kit (Promega Corp., Annandale, New South Wales). 6 pmol (∼3 μg) of each construct were transfected into 1 × 107 COS-1 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After a 24-h incubation, cells were scraped from the culture dish and lysed on ice for 30 min in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1.0% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 16,000 × g, and protein extract was recovered as the supernatant. After preclearing 200 μl of protein extract with 10 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose bead slurry (Sigma), extracts were incubated with 1 μg of antibody for 2 h at 4°C and then for another 2 h with 20 μl of fresh 50% protein G-Sepharose bead slurry. The beads were washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and protein was eluted from the beads by boiling in 2× SDS loading buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Owl Separation Systems, Portsmouth, NH). Membranes were blocked, incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, washed, incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and washed again according to established methods (43Morgan K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2005: 6.0.1-6.1.34Google Scholar). Detection was carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The antibodies used in immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis included rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (gift from Pam Silver, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston), mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (gift from Stephen Dalton, University of Adelaide), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of New RBCC/FN3/B30.2 Proteins—To identify additional RBCC/FN3/B30.2-like proteins, we performed separate BlastX and PSI-BLAST searches on both the publicly available human genome and EST data bases using the full-length sequences of the three reported human FN3 motif-containing RBCC proteins (MID1, MID2, and TRIM9) as well as their individual RBCC, FN3, and B30.2-like sequences. Included in this analysis were all previously identified human full-length RBCC sequences (Fig. 1A), excluding those TRIM proteins that were not of human origin or that were missing part or all of the RBCC domain components (see Fig. 1 legend). All RBCC sequences to be analyzed were retrieved and further scrutinized using InterPro (25Mulder N.J. Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Barrell D. Bateman A. Binns D. Biswas M. Bradley P. Bork P.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). These programs were chosen because they use a range of analyses to determine sequence domain similarity by comparison with domain data bases from HMM to PROFILE and pattern matching methods as well as primary sequence analysis. The data provided by these searches allowed the thorough identification of particular subgroups of RBCC proteins based on the presence or absence of currently identified domain families in the Pfam Database (Version 16), PROSITE PROFILE Database (Version 18.37), and MultiCoil when no coil was detected using domain search tools (Fig. 1, A and B). These analyses identified two human RBCC proteins with significant matches to the FN3 consensus: TRIM36 (14Kitamura K. Tanaka H. Nishimune Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44417-44423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Balint I. Muller A. Nagy A. Kovacs G. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 332: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and FLJ23229 (TRIM46). Although Pfam and SMART Database scores were not significant for a SPRY domain (a submotif of the B30.2-like domain) match over the C terminus of each of these proteins, both were shown to have significant scores for B30.2-like domains using a PROFILE search (available at PROSITE), which is the only tool available to detect complete B30.2-like domains. To provide a similar comparison, the B30.2-like profile matrix (PS50188) was converted to a HMMER data base using ptoh (32Bucher P. Karplus K. Moeri N. Hofmann K. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Results of scans performed against the identified RBCC/FN3/B30.2-like proteins were also significant matches, similar to the PROFILE scan. Using the domains from homologous proteins as a guide, available EST data and genomic sequence representing FLJ23229/TRIM46 were assembled to build a predicted cDNA, which was assisted with predictions available from the GenBank™ Data Bank. From this, we identified that the putative protein contained the same domain architecture as the other identified proteins, and we hereafter refer to this novel protein as TRIFIC (tripartite, fibronectin type III, and C-terminal B30.2-like motif; human GenBank™ accession number AY251386 (nucleotide) and NCBI accession number AAP51206 (protein) and mouse GenBank™ accession number AY251388 (nucleotide) and NCBI accession number AAP51208 (protein). Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis of the RBCC/FN3/B30.2 Proteins—Protein MSA indicated a similar motif arrangement in each of the human FN3 motif-containing RBCC sequences (supplemental Fig. 1), with the most notable differences being within the core of the C3HC4 RING finger domain, which is the most variable part of all RING fingers (refer to Pfam accession number zf-C3HC4 and SMART accession number SM00184). The alignment also reiterated the similarity across the B30.2-like region for the entire subfamily and significantly identified regions of high homology not previously associated with domains or protein function. MSA was used as the basis to perform a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis to determine the relative interrelationships between MID1, MID2, TRIM36, TRIFIC, TRIM9, and a novel TRIM9 homolog (TNL; discussed below). All human sequences and the D. melanogaster TRIM9 sequence were used as the basis for a maximum likelihood analysis, and an unrooted phylogenetic tree was plotted (Fig. 2). The tree shows the relationship between the RBCC/FN3/B30.2-like human sequences and MID1 and MID2, TRIFIC and TRIM36, and TRIM9 and TNL forming paired groups, indicating they are the result of progressive gene duplication events. When murine and chick sequences were added to the analysis (data not shown), the orthologous sequences formed monophyletic groups to the exclusion of paralogs, indicating that the gene duplication events predated the speciation of humans, mice, and chicks. HMMER-based Analysis of the RBCC Superfamily—Verification that we had identified all members containing the FN3 motif came with the reanalysis of each of the 51 human full-length RBCC proteins using HMMER (22Eddy S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2125841023,"Quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum ensures that only properly folded proteins are retained in the cell through mechanisms that recognize and discard misfolded or unassembled proteins in a process called endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). We previously cloned EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) and showed that it accelerates ERAD of misfolded glycoproteins. We now cloned mouse EDEM3, a soluble homolog of EDEM. EDEM3 consists of 931 amino acids and has all the signature motifs of Class I α-mannosidases (glycosyl hydrolase family 47) in its N-terminal domain and a protease-associated motif in its C-terminal region. EDEM3 accelerates glycoprotein ERAD in transfected HEK293 cells, as shown by increased degradation of misfolded α1-antitrypsin variant (null (Hong Kong)) and of TCRα. Overexpression of EDEM3 also greatly stimulates mannose trimming not only from misfolded α1-AT null (Hong Kong) but also from total glycoproteins, in contrast to EDEM, which has no apparent α1,2-mannosidase activity. Furthermore, overexpression of the E147Q EDEM3 mutant, which has the mutation in one of the conserved acidic residues essential for enzyme activity of α1,2-mannosidases, abolishes the stimulation of mannose trimming and greatly decreases the stimulation of ERAD by EDEM3. These results show that EDEM3 has α1,2-mannosidase activity in vivo, suggesting that the mechanism whereby EDEM3 accelerates glycoprotein ERAD is different from that of EDEM.

During this process, proteins that fail to attain their native conformation due to mutations of the polypeptides or to ER stress conditions adverse for protein folding as well as orphan subunits are degraded in a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (3Fewell S.W.

The recognition of misfolded proteins for ERAD is still poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence for a role of mannose trimming in the targeting of glycoproteins for ERAD (8Cabral C.M.

These observations suggested that Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B, the major product of the ER α1,2-mannosidase, is a recognition marker for ERAD of glycoproteins, but this view is being challenged, since there is increasing evidence that trimming to smaller oligosaccharides occurs on ERAD substrates (10Hosokawa N.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 565-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We previously cloned mouse EDEM (ER degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) as a cDNA whose expression is up-regulated by ER stress and showed that EDEM accelerates glycoprotein ERAD (20Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). EDEM is an integral ER membrane protein that has all the signature motifs of Class I α1,2-mannosidases (glycosylhydrolase family 47) but no detectable enzyme activity as a processing α-mannosidase in vivo or in vitro. Recently, it was found that EDEM extracts terminally misfolded glycoproteins from the calnexin cycle (21Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 22Oda Y. Hosokawa N. Wada I. Nagata K. Science. 2003; 299: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the ER α1,2-mannosidase as well as Htm1p/Mnl1p belonging to the same protein family are also involved in ERAD, since disruption of the genes delays the ERAD of glycoproteins (23Jakob C.A. Bodmer D. Spirig U. Battig P. Marcil A. Dignard D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Aebi M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Nakatsukasa K. Nishikawa S. Hosokawa N.

Although EDEM and Htm1p/Mnl1p were postulated to be lectins involved in targeting misfolded glycoproteins for ERAD, the precise mechanisms whereby EDEM and Htm1p/Mnl1p recognize and sort misfolded glycoproteins for degradation are still unclear, and their role as lectins has not been established directly. While this manuscript was in preparation, EDEM2 was reported to stimulate ERAD of misfolded glycoproteins without affecting mannose trimming (25Mast S.W. Diekman K. Karaveg K. Davis A. Sifers R.N. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Olivari S. Galli C. Alanen H. Ruddock L. Molinari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here, we show that EDEM3 is a soluble EDEM homolog located in the ER of transfected mammalian cells that accelerates ERAD of misfolded glycoproteins through a mechanism likely to be different from that of EDEM or EDEM2, since EDEM3 greatly stimulates mannose trimming in vivo. Cloning of Mouse EDEM Homolog—Five expressed sequence tag clones were sequenced, and one clone (G431003D06), which was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Hayashizaki (RIKEN, Japan) (27Carninci P. Waki K. Shiraki T. Konno H. Shibata K. Itoh M. Aizawa K. Arakawa T. Ishii Y. Sasaki D. Bono H. Kondo S. Sugahara Y. Saito R. Osato N. Fukuda S. Sato K. Watahiki A. Hirozane-Kishikawa T. Nakamura M.

Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1273-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), contained the entire EDEM3 cDNA. Sequencing was performed by the PCR-based dideoxy termination method using BigDye version 3 (ABI) and PCR 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then analyzed with the ABI 3100 capillary sequencer. Plasmid Construction—The coding region of EDEM3 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ by PCR, and the HA tag was introduced prior to the -KDEL ER retrieval signal (EDEM3-HA). The null Hong Kong (NHK)-QQQ mutant was created by replacing Asn residues of NHK glycosylation sites with Gln, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The EDEM3 E147Q mutant was constructed by the same method. FLAG-tagged TCRα was kindly provided by Dr. F. Tokunaga (Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine). In Vitro Translation and Translocation—EDEM3-HA cDNA was linearized with EcoRI, and transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). The transcript was then translated in vitro in the reticulocyte lysate (Flexi-lysate; Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine with and without canine pancreas microsomes. The localization of the EDEM3 product was determined by the alkali floatation method (28Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), monitored by 10% SDS-PAGE. Mouse EDEM tagged with HA was used as a control ER membrane protein (20Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and HSP47 was used as a control ER luminal protein (29Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293, BALB/c3T3, COS7, and HeLa S3 cells (provided by Japan Health Science Research Resources Bank) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 ng/ml streptomycin) in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PC12h cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. HepG2 cells stably overexpressing the EDEM3 were established using the pCX4bsr plasmid, which has a retrovirus long terminal repeat (30Akagi T. Shishido T. Murata K. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7290-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and selected in the presence of 30 μg/ml blasticidin (Funakoshi, Japan). Plasmids were purified with a Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen) and transfected using the FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (10Hosokawa N. Tremblay L.O. You Z. Herscovics A. Wada I. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26287-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen). After separation on formaldehyde-denatured gel, RNAs were blotted onto a nylon membrane (Gene-Screen plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then were hybridized with 32 P-labeled probes for 2-16 h in PerfectHyb™ (TOYOBO, Japan) hybridization solution. An MTN™ blot membrane (Clontech) was used to examine mouse tissue distribution. Probes for EDEM, BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein), β-actin, and HSP70 were labeled by the multiprimed labeling method (Roche Applied Science). To detect EDEM3 mRNA, probes were labeled by unidirectional PCR, using the 571-bp fragment of the EDEM3 cDNA near its translational termination site, to increase the specific activity of the probe and to avoid cross-reactivity with EDEM. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE—Metabolic labeling, cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE were carried out as previously described (10Hosokawa N. Tremblay L.O. You Z. Herscovics A. Wada I. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26287-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), except that Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking both methionine and cysteine was used instead of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine. Antibodies—Antibodies against α1-AT were purchased from DAKO (rabbit polyclonal). Polyclonal antibodies against the HA tag were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG M2 antibody (mouse monoclonal) was from Stratagene, and mouse monoclonal antibody against protein-disulfide isomerase was purchased from StressGen. Reagents—Lactacystin was purchased from Kyowa Medics (Japan), and kifunensine was a generous gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Endo H and N-glycanase F (PNGase F) were purchased from Roche Applied Science or New England Biolabs. Immunocytochemistry—COS7 cells were plated on a coverglass placed in a 3.5-cm diameter dish ∼24 h prior to transfection. Twentyfour h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and incubated with anti-HA tag antibodies (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibody (mouse monoclonal) for 1 h and then with an Alexa546-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and an Alexa488-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h. Samples were examined by confocal microscopy (LSM 510 META; Zeiss). Oligosaccharide Analysis of NHK and Total Cellular Glycoproteins—Oligosaccharide analysis of [3H]mannose-labeled NHK by HPLC was performed as described previously (10Hosokawa N. Tremblay L.O. You Z. Herscovics A. Wada I. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26287-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Romero P.A. Saunier B. Herscovics A. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For oligosaccharide analysis of total glycoproteins in HepG2 and cell lines stably overexpressing EDEM3, N-glycans were released by hydrazinolysis, fluorescently labeled using 2-aminopyridine, and were fractionated by size on an NH2-P HPLC column (Shodex Asahipak NH2P50, 0.46 × 15 cm; Showa Denko, Japan) as described previously (32Hase S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were loaded onto the column, and the oligosaccharides were eluted at 0.5 ml/min by a linear gradient of solvent A (acetonitrile) and solvent B (50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0) from 4:1 (v/v) to 3:7 (v/v) for 50 min. Oligosaccharides eluted in each peak were identified by reverse phase HPLC. Cloning of EDEM3, a Soluble Homolog of EDEM—A transcript named C1orf22 was recently mapped in a region susceptible to human hereditary prostate cancer (33Sood R. Bonner T.I. Makalowska I. Stephan D.A. Robbins C.M. Connors T.D. Morgenbesser S.D. Su K. Faruque M.U. Pinkett H. Graham C. Baxevanis A.D. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Trent J.M. Carpten J.D. Genomics. 2001; 73: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The predicted open reading frame of C1orf22 has a sequence similar to Class I α1,2-mannosidases (glycosylhydrolase family 47) and shows highest homology to the KIAA0212 gene product (34Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3 (341-354): 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Since KIAA0212 is the human ortholog of the mouse EDEM gene (20Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), we searched the mouse expressed sequence tag data base for the C1orf22 homolog. Sequencing of expressed sequence tag clones revealed a mouse cDNA of 6,349 bases (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession number AB188342), encoding a protein of 931 amino acids (Fig. 1A). This open reading frame consists of a region (amino acids 60-499) similar to Class I α1,2-mannosidases (glycosylhydrolase family 47), followed by a C-terminal region containing a protease-associated motif (amino acids 686-780) (35Luo X. Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 147-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that is lacking in EDEM and in all Class I α1,2-mannosidases studied so far. It has a putative signal sequence at the N terminus as well as an ER-retrieval signal (-KDEL) at its C terminus. The mouse EDEM3 cDNA sequence exhibits 90% identity with its human ortholog C1orf22 in the coding region and 76% overall identity. The mouse and human orthologs are 91% identical in amino acid sequence. The mouse EDEM3 has 44 additional amino acids at the N terminus compared with the C1orf22 translation product. The α-mannosidase domain shows 44 and 30% amino acid identity between EDEM3 and EDEM and between EDEM3 and ER α-mannosidase I (ER ManI), respectively. All nine acidic amino acids that are essential for α-1,2 mannosidase activity (36Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) are conserved between these three proteins (Fig. 1A), although the two Cys residues important for activity of the yeast ER α1,2-mannosidase (37Lipari F. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27615-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are not conserved in either EDEM3 or EDEM. The protease-associated motif is a consensus sequence found in several proteases (35Luo X. Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 147-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the significance of which in EDEM3 is currently unknown. Expression of EDEM3 and Effects of ER Stress—Northern blotting shows a major EDEM3 transcript of ∼6.5 kb in all mouse tissues, as expected from the cloned cDNA, with relatively high levels in liver, heart, and kidney (Fig. 2A), as reported for the human homolog C1orf22 (33Sood R. Bonner T.I. Makalowska I. Stephan D.A. Robbins C.M. Connors T.D. Morgenbesser S.D. Su K. Faruque M.U. Pinkett H. Graham C. Baxevanis A.D. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Trent J.M. Carpten J.D. Genomics. 2001; 73: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). EDEM mRNA is highly expressed in liver and moderately in kidney, whereas the expression is low in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2A). We examined whether EDEM3 mRNA expression is regulated by ER stress, as previously shown for EDEM (20Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 38Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The addition of tunicamycin, which induces ER stress by inhibiting N-glycosylation of proteins, causes a mild induction of EDEM3 mRNA, depending on the cell lines (Fig. 2B). The EDEM3 transcript is increased about 1.5-2-fold in BALB/c 3T3, 293, and PC12h cells, whereas no induction is observed in COS7 and in HeLa S3 cells. EDEM3 mRNA is also up-regulated by treating cells with the glucose analogue (2-deoxyglucose) or the calcium ionophore A23187 (ER stress), but the level of EDEM3 mRNA does not change in cells exposed to cytosolic stress that greatly stimulates HSP70 expression (Fig. 2C). EDEM3 Is Localized in the ER Lumen—To establish whether the hydrophobic region near the N terminus acts as a cleavable signal sequence upon co-translational translocation into the ER or whether it serves as a transmembrane region, we separated integral membrane proteins from soluble proteins by alkali floatation. When EDEM3 RNA is translated in vitro, most of the radioactive EDEM3 is recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3A). We observed a shift in the size by SDS-PAGE of 110 kDa to 120 kDa when EDEM3 was translocated into microsomes (data not shown). Treatment with Endo H or PNGase F shows the removal of high mannose type N-glycans from EDEM3 (Fig. 3B), as predicted from the sequence (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined the intracellular localization of EDEM3 by transfecting HA-tagged EDEM3 transiently into COS7 cells. Indirect immunofluorescence shows a fine reticular network pattern around the nucleus that colocalizes with the ER-resident protein, protein-disulfide isomerase (Fig. 3C). EDEM3 is not secreted into the medium in pulse-chase experiments of transiently transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that EDEM3 is an ER luminal protein. EDEM3 Accelerates Glycoprotein ERAD—We then investigated whether EDEM3 affects glycoprotein ERAD. We used the α1-antitrypsin genetic variant NHK as a soluble ERAD substrate (13Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection of EDEM3 enhances the ERAD of NHK (Fig. 4, A and B). Co-immunoprecipitation of EDEM3 with NHK was observed using antibodies to either α1-AT or HA-tag (Fig. 4A), indicating that EDEM3 interacts with NHK in the cells. Co-immunoprecipitation was most prominent after 1 and 2 h of chase. At these times, the shift in mobility of NHK indicates additional trimming of the oligosaccharides. This observation suggests that the interaction between EDEM3 and NHK is stronger with increased mannose trimming from NHK (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4, and compare lanes 8 and 9 with lane 7). NHK degradation is inhibited by lactacystin in the presence of cotransfected EDEM3, showing that EDEM3 accelerates glycoprotein ERAD by proteasomes (Fig. 4C). The mobility shift of NHK after chase periods was consistently larger in cells co-transfected with EDEM3 than in cells co-transfected with mock vector (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 4-6 with lanes 1-3). The electrophoretic mobility shift of NHK in EDEM3-overexpressing cells is compared with that of deglycosylated NHK prepared by PNGase F digestion (Fig. 4D). The addition of the α1,2-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine greatly inhibits NHK degradation in cells overexpressing EDEM3 and reduces the mobility of NHK on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4E). This suggests that the mobility shift of NHK in cells co-transfected with EDEM3 is caused by the mannose trimming from the N-linked oligosaccharides. Since different mechanisms for ERAD of soluble and transmembrane proteins have been proposed (40Caldwell S.R. Hill K.J. Cooper A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23296-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 41Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 42Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38369-38378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of EDEM3 on a FLAG-tagged TCRα, a glycosylated transmembrane ERAD substrate (43Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Co-expression of EDEM3 enhances the degradation of TCRα-FLAG (Fig. 5, A and B), which is partly inhibited by kifunensine treatment (Fig. 5A). However, EDEM3 does not affect the degradation of NHK lacking all three N-glycosylation sites (NHK-QQQ), demonstrating its specificity for glycoproteins (Fig. 5, C and D). NHK-QQQ is degraded faster than NHK that bears the three N-glycans, and we have confirmed that NHK-QQQ was also degraded by ERAD (data not shown). These data indicate that the acceleration of glycoprotein ERAD by EDEM3 depends on mannose trimming from the N-glycans. Effect of EDEM3 on Mannose Trimming from N-Glycans of NHK and of Total Glycoproteins—Since the results in Fig. 4 suggested that overexpression of EDEM3 stimulates mannose trimming from N-glycans on NHK, the oligosaccharides were examined after labeling 293 cells with [3H]mannose. The N-glycans released from NHK by Endo H were analyzed by HPLC. Overexpression of EDEM3 greatly stimulates trimming of N-glycans from NHK to Man7GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2 (Fig. 6, A and B), but there is relatively little Man8GlcNAc2 found on NHK in cells overexpressing EDEM3 compared with mock-transfected cells. At 0 h of chase, there is only a trace amount of Man6GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2 on NHK from mock-transfected cells, whereas significant labeled Man6GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2 are observed in cells transfected with EDEM3. The relative amount of Man6GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2 increases with time of chase in EDEM3-transfected cells and is greater at 1 h chase than the proportion of Man6GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2 in mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, at all time points the percentage of labeled Man6GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2 is much greater in EDEM3-transfected cells than in the control. In contrast, the percentage of radioactivity in Man8GlcNAc2 is always much lower in the presence of EDEM3. This pattern of oligosaccharides indicates that overexpression of EDEM3 stimulates mannose trimming from NHK. To determine whether the increased mannose trimming is due to intrinsic mannosidase activity of EDEM3, the effects of the E147Q mutant on NHK oligosaccharides were studied. Glu147 is a conserved residue that corresponds to Glu132 and to Glu330 in the active site of yeast and human ER α1,2-mannosidases, respectively (44Vallée F. Karaveg K. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41287-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 45Vallée F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is essential for enzyme activity, since mutation of this residue abolishes α1,2-mannosidase activity (36Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The pattern of oligosaccharides on NHK obtained from cells overexpressing E147Q is identical to that of mock-transfected cells. And the relative amounts of Man6GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2 are the same as in control cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Stimulation of mannose trimming by EDEM3 was also demonstrated by analyzing N-glycans of total glycoproteins from HepG2 cells stably overex-pressing EDEM3 (Fig. 6C). There is a large increase of Man6GlcNAc2 concomitant with a relative decrease of Man7-8GlcNAc2, compared with the parental HepG2 cells. All of these results demonstrate that EDEM3 has α1,2-mannosidase activity in vivo. Following labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine, NHK degradation was greatly reduced in 293 cells overexpressing the E147Q mutant compared with wild-type EDEM3 (Fig. 6D), indicating that the mannosidase activity of EDEM3 is important for its effect on ERAD of NHK. The present work shows that EDEM3 is a soluble homolog of EDEM that accelerates ERAD of both soluble NHK and membrane-bound TCRα in an N-glycan-dependent manner. The extent of ERAD stimulation on NHK degradation is similar to that previously reported following overexpression of EDEM and of ER ManI (10Hosokawa N. Tremblay L.O. You Z. Herscovics A. Wada I.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, the role of EDEM3 in ERAD of NHK is likely to be different from that of EDEM, since EDEM3 overexpression greatly stimulates mannose trimming of N-glycans from NHK, whereas overexpression of EDEM does not (10Hosokawa N. Tremblay L.O. You Z. Herscovics A. Wada I. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26287-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when EDEM3 is overexpressed, the pattern of oligosaccharides released from NHK is very different from that observed on NHK isolated from ER ManI-transfected cells. In cells overexpressing EDEM3, there is extensive trimming of N-glycans to Man6-7GlcNAc2 with relatively little Man8GlcNAc2 (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas in cells overexpressing ER ManI, there is increased accumulation of Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 concomitant with increased trimming to smaller oligosaccharides (10Hosokawa N.

Importantly, the effect of EDEM3 on the trimming of N-glycans is abolished by mutating the essential acidic residue Glu147 to Gln (Fig. 6, A and B, E147Q), and the increased ERAD of NHK due to EDEM3 overexpression is greatly reduced by this mutation (Fig. 6D). This residue is found in the active site of processing Class I α-mannosidases by x-ray crystallography (44Vallée F. Karaveg K. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although these results strongly indicate that EDEM3 stimulation of NHK ERAD is caused by its α1,2-mannosidase activity, an alternative less likely interpretation is that the mutation of Glu147 to Gln affects the conformation of EDEM3 and thus abolishes the effect on NHK degradation independently of enzyme activity. Since overexpression of EDEM3 stimulates mannose trimming from total glycoproteins as well as from the misfolded glycoprotein NHK (Fig. 6), EDEM3 is most likely acting as a processing α1,2-mannosidase in vivo, accelerating trimming of Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides to Man6-7 GlcNAc2. Its specificity appears to be different from that of ER ManI that greatly stimulates trimming to Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 (10Hosokawa N. Tremblay L.O. You Z. Herscovics A. Wada I. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26287-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that Man8GlcNAc2 is not an exclusive targeting signal for ERAD of glycoproteins and that smaller oligosaccharides (Man5-7GlcNAc2) attached to misfolded glycoproteins participate in this recognition, in agreement with other studies (10Hosokawa N.

While this manuscript was in preparation, two groups reported studies on another EDEM homolog, which they named EDEM2 (25Mast S.W. Diekman K. Karaveg K. Davis A. Sifers R.N. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Olivari S. Galli C. Alanen H. Ruddock L. Molinari M. J. Biol.

Although EDEM2 stimulates glycoprotein ERAD, it has no effect on mannose trimming from misfolded glycoproteins, indicating that its mechanism of action is different from that of EDEM3 described in the present work. In both manuscripts, the existence of EDEM3 is mentioned, but its function is not further analyzed. The mechanisms involved in ERAD is an area of active investigation at the present time, not only for fundamental cell biology but also for clinical applications, because ERAD is important in the pathogenesis of a large number of genetic diseases caused by protein misfolding. However, the mechanisms whereby the cell recognizes misfolded proteins and targets them to ERAD are not fully understood. Since earlier studies showed that ER ManI and EDEM both stimulate ERAD of glycoproteins, a relatively simple mechanism has been proposed whereby targeting of misfolded glycoproteins depends on Man8B formed by ERManI, which is then recognized by EDEM. However, it is clear from more recent studies and from the work presented here that the targeting for ERAD is far more complicated, since there are two additional EDEM proteins implicated, and trimming of oligosaccharides on misfolded glycoproteins to species smaller than Man8 occurs. Thus, the cloning and characterization of EDEM3 makes a novel contribution to the understanding of the quality control of misfolded proteins. We thank Dr. Y. Hayashizaki (RIKEN, Japan) for the cDNA clones, Dr. F. Tokunaga (Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine) for the FLAG-tagged TCRα plasmid, and K. Kanamori for technical assistance."

Other investigations have established a role for C/EBPα as well as PPARγ in orchestrating the complex program of adipogenic gene expression during terminal preadipocyte differentiation. Consequently, it is important to identify factors regulating transcription of the C/ebpα gene. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of PPARγ activity by exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to a potent and selective PPARγ antagonist inhibits adipogenesis but also blocks the activation of C/EBPα expression at the onset of differentiation. Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ in Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Swiss-LAP cells) induces PPARγ expression without any significant enhancement of C/EBPα expression. Treatment of Swiss-LAP cells with a PPARγ agonist induces adipogenesis, which includes activation of C/EBPα expression. To further establish a role for PPARγ in regulating C/EBPα expression, we expressed C/EBPβ in PPARγ-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). The data show that C/EBPβ is capable of inducing PPARγ in Pparγ+/- MEFs, which leads to activation of adipogenesis, including C/EBPα expression following exposure to a PPARγ ligand. In contrast, C/EBPβ is not able to induce C/EBPα expression or adipogenesis in Pparγ-/- MEFs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that C/EBPβ is bound to the minimal promoter of the C/ebpα gene in association with HDAC1 in unstimulated Swiss-LAP cells. Exposure of the cells to a PPARγ ligand dislodges HDAC1 from the proximal promoter of the C/ebpα gene, which involves degradation of HDAC1 in the 26 S proteasome. These data suggest that C/EBPβ activates a single unified pathway of adipogenesis involving its stimulation of PPARγ expression, which then activates C/EBPα expression by dislodging HDAC1 from the promoter for degradation in the proteasome. Studies have shown that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) can stimulate adipogenesis in noncommitted fibroblasts by activating expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ).

The differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes is regulated by an elaborate network of transcription factors that control expression of many hundreds of proteins responsible for establishing the mature fat cell phenotype (1Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most notable among these factors are members of the C/EBP 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; LAP, liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein; MIX, isobutylmethylxanthine; DEX, dexamethasone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HDAC, histone deacetylase; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TET, tetracycline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; pol, polymerase. and PPAR families of transcription factors. In fact, it is now well accepted that both PPARγ and C/EBPα function as critical regulators of adipogenesis because deficiency of either of these proteins prevents the development of white adipose tissue in the mouse (2Linhart H.G.

Studies performed in cell culture have positioned PPARγ and C/EBPα in the center of this network of factors where they orchestrate the many functions associated with the mature adipocyte (1Rosen E.D.

Some functions appear to be governed exclusively by PPARγ such as lipogenesis, whereas others such as insulin-dependent glucose transport and adiponectin expression are dependent on simultaneous expression of both proteins (6El-Jack A.K.

Consequently, in our efforts to gain a complete understanding of the processes regulating the function of adipocytes, it is important to identify the mechanisms regulating transcription of both PPARγ and C/EBPα. Several investigators have demonstrated a direct role for C/EBPβ along with C/EBPδ in inducing expression of PPARγ2 through association with C/EBP regulatory elements in the Pparγ2 gene promoter (9Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L.

A similar role for these C/EBPs in inducing transcription of the C/ebpα gene has not been established. It is generally assumed, however, that C/EBPβ does induce C/EBPα based on data from in vitro assays showing transactivation of a C/ebpα minimal promoter reporter gene in different cell types by C/EBPβ (13Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Earlier studies aimed at characterizing the importance of C/EBPβ in inducing adipogenesis failed to demonstrate induction of C/EBPα expression because the NIH-3T3 fibroblasts used in the experiments do not express C/EBPα (10Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 16Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In those studies, however, ectopic expression of C/EBPβ was capable of inducing PPARγ2 expression, and following exposure to appropriate ligands the NIH-3T3 cells underwent conversion into lipid-laden adipocytes that were unresponsive to insulin because they lacked C/EBPα (6El-Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Other studies performed in cells capable of expressing C/EBPα have demonstrated that PPARγ can activate transcription of the C/ebpα gene in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis (17Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), suggesting that the transcriptional cascade responsible for initiating terminal adipogenesis involves induction of PPARγ2 by C/EBPβ, and PPARγ2 then is responsible for inducing C/ebpα along with other adipogenic genes. Activation of gene expression involves a complex multistep process that includes docking of select transcription factors on regulatory elements within the promoter and/or enhancers of the target genes, which initiates recruitment of a variety of nuclear factors involved in reorganization of surrounding chromatin as well as assembly of the transcriptional machinery at the promoter. It also appears that in some cases transcription factors can dock on various genes without initiating transcription. These factors appear to recruit corepressors and associated proteins to the gene that suppress transcription until an effector(s) dislodges the repressors to facilitate recruitment of appropriate coactivators. In the case of C/EBPβ, there is evidence to suggest that it can dock on the promoters of C/ebpα and Pparγ genes prior to their activation during the early phase of adipogenesis. Adipogenic effectors then facilitate association of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF with C/EBPβ on the Pparγ gene (18Salma N. Xiao H. Mueller E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4651-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas glucocorticoids are responsible for dislodging an mSin3a-HDAC1 complex from the C/EBPβ site on the C/ebpα gene (15Wiper-Bergeron N. Wu D. Pope L. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the role of PPARγ along with C/EBPβ in regulating C/EBPα expression during adipogenesis, we ectopically expressed each of the proteins in nonadipogenic fibroblasts and analyzed adipogenic gene expression. The data demonstrate that C/EBPβ is capable of docking on the C/ebpα gene promoter but is incapable of inducing C/EBPα transcription in the absence of PPARγ. Furthermore, treatment of cells expressing C/EBPβ with glucocorticoids is not capable of inhibiting HDAC1 activity at the C/ebpα gene, whereas activation of PPARγ facilitates targeting of the HDAC1 that is associated with the C/ebpα gene to the proteasome and thereby inducing transcription. Expression Vectors and Cell Lines—The p34C/EBPβ(LAP)-pBI-G plasmid and pBabe-Puro-LAP and pRevTRE-C/EBPα-Myc-His retroviral vectors were produced as described previously (8Park B.-H. Qiang L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8671-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol.

The LAP-pBI-G vector was transfected into Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts constitutively expressing the Tet-Off activator protein (Swiss Tet-Off cells; Clontech) along with a puromycin selection plasmid (pBabe-puro). Colonies of cells resistant to 3 μg/ml puromycin were selected and analyzed for expression of the pBI-G vector on the basis of tetracycline-responsive β-galactosidase production. The initial selection gave rise to several nonhomogeneous colonies because only 10–20% of the cells expressed β-galactosidase activity. Therefore, one of these colonies was subjected to serial dilution single cell cloning. A colony (LAP-A cells) was selected in which almost the entire population of cells expressed β-galactosidase activity in a tetracycline-responsive manner. To establish retrovirus-producing cell lines, human embryonic kidney 293T cells were seeded at 80% confluence in a 60-mm diameter dish on the day of transfection. Individual cultures of cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 2 μg of either the pRevTRE-C/EBPα-Myc-His or pBabe-Puro-LAP vector along with 2 μg each of vesicular stomatitis virus G and GP expression plasmids (pVpack; Stratagene). Two days after transfection, culture medium containing high titer virus was harvested and filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter. The viral filtrate supernatant was used to infect Pparγ+/- or Pparγ-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (20Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in a 60-mm dish at 25% confluence on the day of infection and incubated with retrovirus overnight in the presence of 4 μg of Polybrene/ml (Sigma), and the infection was allowed to proceed for an additional 2 days in fresh growth medium. At this stage, 100 μg of hygromycin and/or 2 μg/ml puromycin was added to facilitate selection of stable cell lines, which required culture for 2–3 weeks in the presence of the antibiotic. Cell Culture—For experiments, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Induction of differentiation was achieved by treatment of post-confluent cells with dexamethasone (DEX, 1 μm), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX, 0.5 mm), and insulin (1.67 μm). The Swiss-LAP A cells and the other cell lines were differentiated by the same method as for 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (8Park B.-H. Qiang L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8671-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and maintained in the presence or absence of 5 μm troglitazone (Parke-Davis) or 1 μm GW7845 (a highly selective PPARγ agonist) obtained from GlaxoSmithKline. To block PPARγ activity, cells were exposed to T0070907 (a selective PPARγ antagonist) as described previously (21Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K. Nakamura M. Miao S.

Cells were refed every 2 days. Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis of Proteins—Isolation and Western blot analysis of whole-cell proteins was performed as described previously (8Park B.-H. Qiang L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8671-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Antibodies employed in the analysis were as follows: anti-C/EBPα, anti-C/EBPβ, anti-PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-HDAC1–3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-Acrp30/adiponectin (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO); and anti-perilipin (Dr. Andy Greenberg, New England Medical Center, Tufts University, Boston). Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts prepared as described previously (8Park B.-H. Qiang L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8671-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3–5 μg of the antibody or the same amount of a nonspecific mouse or rabbit IgG. The following day, 30-μl protein-G beads were added, and extracts were incubated with rotation for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and antigens were eluted by incubation with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer with or without 50 mm dithiothreitol. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After quantification, 20–25 μg from each RNA sample was subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (17Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells were fixed by addition of 37% formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde and incubation at room temperature for 10 min. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were then trypsinized, scraped, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and swelled in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were pelleted by microcentrifugation and lysed by incubation in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) on ice for 10 min. The resulting chromatin solution was sonicated with three 30-s pulses at maximum power. After microcentrifugation, the supernatant was pre-cleared with blocked protein A-agarose beads. The chromatin fractions were then immunoprecipitated with 1–2μg of the following antibodies: anti-C/EBPβ, anti-C/EBPα, anti-acetylated histone H3, anti-acetylated histone H4, anti-HDAC1, anti-RNA polymerase II, or IgG (anti-acetyl-histone H3, anti-acetyl-histone H4, anti-RNA polymerase II, and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). After incubation at 4 °C overnight, the DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose. After washing the DNA-protein complexes, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, redissolved, and used as templates for PCR. Different PCR cycles (ranging from 24 to 32) were used to evaluate each assay, and the lowest possible cycle was chosen for presentation. Input and antibody controls were performed at the same number of PCR cycles as the immunoprecipitated complexes. The primers used for the PCR correspond to regions flanking the C/EBP-binding site within the C/ebpα gene promoter and are as follows: sense, 5′-CTG GAA GTG GGT GAC TTA GAG G-3′; antisense, 5′-GAG TGG GGA GCA TAG TGC TAG-3′. Oil Red O Staining—The cells were seeded in 35-mm plates, and at the specified stage of differentiation they were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin in PBS for 15 min. After two washes in PBS, cells were stained for at least 1 h in freshly diluted Oil Red O solution (6 parts Oil Red O stock solution and 4 parts H2O; Oil Red O stock solution is 0.5% Oil Red O in isopropyl alcohol). The stain was then removed, and cells were washed twice with water, with or without counterstain (0.25% Giemsa for 15 min), and then photographed. To determine whether activation of C/EBPα expression during the early phase of adipogenesis requires PPARγ activity, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with T0070907 (a selective and potent antagonist of PPARγ activity) at day 1 following exposure of the confluent cells to the adipogenic inducers DEX, MIX, insulin, and 10% FBS. Fig. 1 shows a Western blot analysis of total proteins extracted from the cells at the indicated days following exposure to the antagonist. It is quite apparent that the PPARγ antagonist completely blocks expression of perilipin (Fig. 1, compare lane 9 with lane 10), a known downstream target of PPARγ (22Arimura N. Horiba T. Imagawa M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10070-10076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Nagai S. Shimizu C. Umetsu M. Taniguchi S. Endo M. Miyoshi H.

Auwerx J. Nebb H.I. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and also inhibits differentiation into mature adipocytes (data not shown). More important is the observation that blocking PPARγ activity also leads to a significant attenuation of C/EBPα expression. In fact, the antagonist appears to prevent the activation of C/EBPα during the initial 3 days of adipogenesis (Fig. 1, compare lane 5 with lane 6) prior to the expression of the terminal genes such as perilipin. It is interesting that the antagonist also attenuates expression of PPARγ2. This is likely because of the fact that C/EBPα normally feeds back on the Pparγ2 gene (7Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmont G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). There appears to be minimal effect of the PPARγ antagonist on C/EBPβ expression. The fact that T0070907 is a specific inhibitor of PPARγ activity suggests that PPARγ contributes to the initial activation of C/EBPα during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Because our previous studies had shown that inhibition of C/EBPβ activity by ectopic expression of a dominant negative C/EBPβ protein (LIP) blocks both C/EBPα and PPARγ expression (17Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we next addressed the role of C/EBPβ in regulating C/EBPα expression. Earlier studies have demonstrated that C/EBPβ is capable of inducing expression of PPARγ2 in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (9Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, it was not possible to assess the role of C/EBPβ in activating C/EBPα expression because the NIH-3T3 cells do not transcribe the C/ebpα gene (10Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 16Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of both C/EBPβ and PPARγ to the induction of C/EBPα during adipogenesis, we ectopically expressed C/EBPβ in Swiss mouse fibroblasts using the Tet-Off conditional expression system (Swiss-LAP A cells). The Swiss-LAP A cells were cultured for several days in the absence of tetracycline in order to stimulate expression of the ectopic C/EBPβ protein. At confluence, the cells were exposed to medium containing 10% FBS and various combinations of the adipogenic inducers, DEX, MIX, or insulin, in the presence or absence of a potent PPARγ agonist (GW7845) for 2 days at which time the cells were maintained in medium containing 10% FBS, insulin, and the corresponding quantity of the PPARγ agonist for an additional 3 days. Fig. 2 shows abundant expression of the ectopic C/EBPβ protein, which results in activation of PPARγ2 expression under all conditions except when cells were cultured in tetracycline to suppress the C/ebpβ gene (Fig. 2, lanes 17 and 18). The ectopic C/EBPβ, in addition to activating PPARγ2, was also capable of inducing perilipin expression (marker of adipogenesis) in response to exposure of these Swiss fibroblasts to DEX (Fig. 2, lanes 4, 10, 12, and 16). Exposure to insulin and/or MIX failed to activate the perilipin gene to any significant extent (Fig. 2, lanes 6, 8, and 14). Of interest is the observation that C/EBPβ did not stimulate expression of C/EBPα in the presence of any of these inducers (Fig. 2, lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16). Importantly, activation of PPARγ2 activity by treatment with the PPARγ agonist (GW7468) induces expression of C/EBPα as well as perilipin to levels normally expressed in mature adipocytes (data not shown) regardless of the presence of the other effectors (DEX, MIX, or insulin). Fig. 2 also demonstrates the reciprocal relationship between β-catenin and adipogenesis in these fibroblasts as observed previously (19Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 25Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 26Liu J. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that activation of PPARγ2 expression only requires C/EBPβ, whereas expression of C/EBPα requires ligand-dependent activation of PPARγ along with C/EBPβ. To substantiate further the importance of PPARγ in regulating C/EBPα expression, we stably expressed the p34 LAP isoform of C/EBPβ in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking a functional Pparγ gene (Pγ-/- MEFs) and in a corresponding population of heterozygous (Pγ+/-) MEFs. The cell lines (Pγ+/- and Pγ-/-) were exposed to DEX, MIX, and insulin in the presence or absence of troglitazone for 2 days and were then cultured for an additional 3 days in the presence or absence of troglitazone. The cells were either stained with Oil Red O for morphological analysis or harvested for Western blot analysis of total cellular proteins. Fig. 3, A and B, demonstrates that ectopic expression of C/EBPβ induces some lipid accumulation in the MEFs that contain one functional allele of PPARγ (Pγ+/- cells) following exposure to DEX, MIX, and insulin, and this effect is enhanced manyfold in the presence of the troglitazone. As expected, C/EBPβ failed to induce any lipid accumulation in the PPARγ-deficient cells (Pγ-/-) with or without troglitazone. The absence of adipogenesis in the Pγ-/- cells did not necessarily mean that C/EBPβ was not capable of inducing expression of C/EBPα in these cells because other studies have shown that C/EBPα is incapable of inducing lipid accumulation in the absence of PPARγ (20Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Consequently, we analyzed expression of C/EBPα in response to C/EBPβ in both Pγ+/- and Pγ-/- cells. Fig. 4A shows abundant expression of the ectopic C/EBPβ in both cell lines. Treatment of the Pγ+/- cells with DEX, MIX, and insulin induces a low but detectable level of PPARγ, C/EBPα, perilipin, and adiponectin expression (Fig. 4A, lane 3), and exposure to the PPARγ agonist enhances expression of all four proteins to the abundant levels (lane 4) normally expressed in mature adipocytes. Most importantly, exposure of the PPARγ-deficient cells to DEX, MIX, and insulin with or without PPARγ ligand was incapable of stimulating C/EBPα, perilipin, or adiponectin even though the cells produced abundant quantities of the ectopic C/EBPβ protein (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). The Northern blot analysis of these cells demonstrate that the absence of C/EBPα expression in Pparγ-/- MEFs is because of a lack of expression of the corresponding mRNA (Fig. 4B, compare lane 2 with lane 4). These data support the notion that C/EBPβ activates a single unified pathway of adipogenesis (20Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) involving its induction of PPARγ, which then activates C/EBPα expression along with other terminal adipogenic programs. To confirm that the only defect in the Pparγ-/- MEFs was the lack of PPARγ, we retrovirally expressed PPARγ2 in these cells that already expressed the ectopic C/EBPβ and showed that its expression facilitated induction of C/EBPα along with the other markers of the adipogenic program (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4C/EBPβ induces C/ebpα gene expression in Pγ+/- MEFs, but not in Pγ-/- MEFs. Pγ+/- and Pγ-/- MEFs expressing an ectopic C/EBPβ were induced to differentiate for 6 days as described in Fig. 3. At this time, cells were harvested for either total proteins or RNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, equal amounts of total cellular protein were subjected to Western blot analysis of C/EBPβ, PPARγ, C/EBPα, perilipin, and adiponectin. B, equal amounts of total RNA were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using cDNA probes corresponding to PPARγ and C/EBPα. The membrane was also stained with methylene blue to visualize the rRNA species and verify the presence of equal amounts of RNA. C, ectopic PPARγ2 rescues expression of C/EBPα in Pγ-/- cells expressing C/EBPβ. Pparγ-/- MEFs expressing an ectopic C/EBPβ (LAP) were infected with retrovirus vector containing PPARγ2 cDNA (pBabe-Pγ) or the empty vector (pBabe). The cell lines were cultured in growth medium for 3 days until confluent and were then induced to differentiate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At day 5, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis of C/EBPβ, PPARγ, C/EBPα, perilipin, aP2, and adiponectin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Other studies have"

In many coronaviruses, the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression although the mechanism behind this is poorly understood. The N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bears signature motifs for binding to cyclin and phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and has recently been reported by us to get phosphorylated by the cyclin-CDK complex (Surjit, M., Kumar, R., Mishra, R. N., Reddy, M. K., Chow, V. T., and Lal, S. K. (2005) J. Virol. 79, 11476–11486). In the present study, we prove that the N protein of SARS-CoV can inhibit S phase progression in mammalian cell lines. N protein expression was found to directly inhibit the activity of the cyclin-CDK complex, resulting in hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein with a concomitant down-regulation in E2F1-mediated transactivation. Coexpression of E2F1 under such conditions could restore the expression of S phase genes. Analysis of RXL and CDK phosphorylation mutant N protein identified the mechanism of inhibition of CDK4 and CDK2 activity to be different. Whereas N protein could directly bind to cyclin D and inhibit the activity of CDK4-cyclin D complex; inhibition of CDK2 activity appeared to be achieved in two different ways: indirectly by down-regulation of protein levels of CDK2, cyclin E, and cyclin A and by direct binding of N protein to CDK2-cyclin complex. Down-regulation of E2F1 targets was also observed in SARS-CoV-infected VeroE6 cells. These data suggest that the S phase inhibitory activity of the N protein may have major significance during viral pathogenesis.

Mitotic cells undergo repeated cycles of division in order to produce daughter cells, a process essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Different steps of a cell division event typically include the G1 phase (preparation for DNA synthesis), followed by the S phase (genome replication), the G2 phase (preparation for cell division), and the M phase (mitosis). One of the most critical phases during cell cycle progression is the S phase, since it involves precise duplication of the whole genome, which carries all genetic messages for the next generation. Any abnormality during the replication step or thereafter would be disastrous for the organism. Hence, cells employ multiple strategies to ensure accurate and error-free genome replication. First, cells synthesize adequate amounts of raw materials that would be utilized during the S phase; second, cells strategically employ multiple check points (in the form of inhibitory factors) to block the S phase progression should there be a hostile environment arising due to any intracellular or extracellular factors. The majority of the events during cell cycle progression are driven by enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; N protein, nucleocapsid protein; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; CoV, coronavirus; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine, Rb, retinoblastoma, FBS, fetal bovine serum; HA, hemagglutinin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CKI, CDK inhibitor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. which are dependent on a series of cyclins to remain catalytically active. Regulating the activity of these cyclin-CDK complexes constitutes the crux of cell cycle regulation, which remains under the scrutiny of inhibitors of CDK. On the other hand, this regulatory network has been an attractive target for pathogens to exploit the cellular machinery toward their benefit. For example, herpes simplex virus gene products ICP0 (1Hobbs II, W.E. DeLuca N.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8245-8255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lomonte P. Everett R.D. J.

Virology. 2001; 290: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, IE2 (4Wiebusch L. Hagemeier C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9274-9283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and UL69 (5Lu M. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 676-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of cytomegalovirus, Zta of Epstein-Barr virus (6Cayrol C. Flemington E.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2748-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), p28 of mouse hepatitis virus (7Chen C.J. Sugiyama K. Kubo H. Huang C. Makino S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10410-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and K-bZIP of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (8Izumiya Y. Lin S.F. Ellison T.J. Levy A.M. Mayeur G.L. Izumiya C. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9652-9661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have been shown to arrest cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. It has been postulated that imposing a G1 block may help these pathogens in utilizing the cellular raw materials to replicate their own genome or provide them shelter for a longer duration to complete their life cycle and bud off. The mechanisms of virus-induced cell cycle arrest differ from one virus to the other. Both Epstein-Barr virus Zta and IE2 of cytomegalovirus bind to and stabilize p53 (3Song B. Yeh K.C. Liu J. Knipe D.M. Virology. 2001; 290: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Flemington E.K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4475-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Q. Gutsch D. Kenney S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which in turn up-regulates the expression of p21, leading to the inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4 activity, whereas the K-bZIP gene product of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus directly associates with and inhibits the activity of the cyclin-CDK2 complex (8Izumiya Y. Lin S.F. Ellison T.J. Levy A.M. Mayeur G.L. Izumiya C. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9652-9661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Among the coronaviruses, the p28 protein of mouse hepatitis virus has been shown to accumulate hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb), stabilize p53, and up-regulate the levels of p21, thus inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (7Chen C.J. Sugiyama K. Kubo H. Huang C. Makino S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10410-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently discovered coronavirus, which shares significant homology with the mouse hepatitis virus. However, no information exists regarding the involvement of this virus in host cell cycle modulation. We have recently shown that the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the SARS-CoV localizes to the nucleus as well as cytoplasm and bears signature motifs for binding to the cyclin box and phosphorylation by the CDK, and we have experimentally demonstrated it to be a substrate of the cyclin-CDK complex (11Surjit M. Kumar R. Mishra R.N. Reddy M.K. Chow V.T. Lal S.K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11476-11486Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, its involvement in modulation of the host cell cycle remains unknown. In this report, we provide substantial evidence that the N protein of the SARS-CoV binds to and inhibits the activity of the cyclin-CDK complex, resulting in down-regulation of the S phase gene products and subsequent inhibition of S phase progression. Mutational analysis identified the mechanism of inhibition to be different for G1 and late G1/S phase cyclins. In addition, expression of the S phase gene products were found to be down-regulated in SARS-CoV-infected cells, further supporting the above data. The possible significance of this phenomenon during the natural course of SARS-CoV infection is discussed. Plasmids and Reagents—pCDNA3.1N has been described earlier (12Surjit M. Liu B. Jameel S.

Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine or Fugene 6 reagent (Invitrogen or Roche Applied Science, respectively) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Mock-transfected cells were transfected with the empty vector. For synchronization experiments, 24 h postseeding, cells were starved for 34 h in serum-free medium followed by stimulation with 10% serum-containing medium for the indicated time periods. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—FACS analysis of cell cycle progression was done as described by Krishan (16Krishan A. J.

Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Forty hours post-transfection, cells were starved for 1 h in cysteine/methionine-deficient medium and then labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]Cys/Met promix for 4 h. After labeling, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4) with protease inhibitor mixture. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of protein were incubated overnight with 1 μg of the corresponding antibody. This was followed by a 1-h incubation with 100 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose suspension. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and the protein was eluted by boiling the samples in 2× SDS dye. Proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE. Data obtained are representative of three independent sets of experiments conducted. Results were quantified, and normalized values were calculated using the NIH Image version 1.32 program.

Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer into nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with respective antibodies. Protein bands were developed by the enhanced chemiluminiscence method using a commercially available kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Virus Infection and Lysate Preparation—Vero E6 cells (ATCC number CRL-1586) were cultured in M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. When cells reached ∼90% confluence, one batch of Vero E6 cells that served as the control was mock-infected with sterile medium (18Kramer M.F. Cook W.J. Roth F.P. Zhu J. Holman H. Knipe D.M. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9533-9541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Munir S. Kapur V. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4899-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Another batch was infected with SARS-CoV (strain 2003VA2774 isolated from a SARS patient in Singapore) at a multiplicity of infection of 1 (20Ng M.L. Tan S.H. See E.E. Ooi E.E. Ling A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3291-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with a virus inoculum volume of 0.75 ml diluted with 1.25 ml of maintenance medium with only 3% fetal calf serum. After adsorption for 1 h, the inoculum was removed, and 20 ml of maintenance medium was added. At 12 h postinfection, cytopathic effects were observed in infected cells. Following incubation at 37 °C for 12 h, both uninfected and infected Vero E6 cells were treated with 0.2 ml of 5% formalin (Merck) and then incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The formalin-treated cells were further subjected to heat at 60 °C for 30 min and UV for 5 min to ensure complete inactivation. Finally, 2 ml of 10% Triton X-100 was added to both mock-infected and SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells and stored at –80 °C until further use. Lysate was prepared from these samples as described by Ikeda et al. (21Ikeda K. Monden T. Kanoh T. Tsujie M. Izawa H. Haba A. Ohnishi T. Sekimoto M. Tomita N. Shiozaki H. Monden M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly 200 μl of sample was mixed with 50 μl of 5× sample buffer (1× sample buffer: 1 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 10 mm disodium hydrogen phosphate, 154 mm sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 12 mm sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% sodium azide, 0.95 mm fluoride, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm leupeptin, 2% SDS, pH 7.6), and the contents were incubated under different conditions as follows: at 0 °C for 2 h, at 37 °C for 2 h, at 60 °C for 2 h, and at 100 °C for 20 min, followed by incubation at 60 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the tissue lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were equalized for protein content, boiled for 5 min in 6× SDS dye, and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by Western immunoblotting. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Cyclin-CDK Complex—Bacterial expressed cyclin-CDK complex was reconstituted as described earlier by Wohlschlegel et al. (14Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Takeda D.Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation Assay—Cells seeded on the coverslip were transfected with respective pCDNA3.1N plasmid. 34 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 10% FBS for 14 h and further incubated for 1 h in the presence of 10 mm BrdUrd. The medium was then aspirated, and cells were fixed with ice-cold fix (70 ml of ethanol plus 30 ml of glycine, pH 2.0) for 30 min at –20 °C. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and an immunofluorescence assay was conducted as described earlier (12Surjit M. Liu B. Jameel S. Chow V.T. Lal S.K. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). BrdUrd staining was observed using anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:100 dilution), and N protein expression was checked using anti-Myc antibody (1:100 dilution). Nucleus was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. BrdUrd-positive cells were counted by using a Nikon TE 2000U immunofluorescence microscope. Exogenous Expression of the N Protein Inhibits the Activity of Cyclin-CDK Complex—Earlier experiments done in our laboratory have demonstrated that the N protein bears the structural motif necessary for cyclin binding and phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases. Accordingly, the N protein was found to be a substrate of the cyclin-CDK complex (11Surjit M. Kumar R. Mishra R.N. Reddy M.K. Chow V.T. Lal S.K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11476-11486Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether the possession of signature motifs and phosphorylation by the CDK is a strategy employed by the N protein to manipulate the host cell cycle machinery toward its benefit by acting as a competitive inhibitor to in vivo substrates of the cyclin-CDK complex. Hence, experiments were designed to check the effect of N protein expression on the kinase activity of different cyclin-CDK complex. Initially, control experiments were done to check the temporal profile of different phases of cell cycle in COS7 (African green monkey kidney) and Huh7 (human hepatoma) cells. For this, cells were maintained in the absence of growth factors for different time periods to arrest majority of the cell population at the G0 phase and then stimulated with 10% FBS to allow reentry into the cell cycle. Poststimulation, cells were harvested at every 3-h interval up to 30 h and the total cell lysate was immunoblotted to check the expression profile of different factors like cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin A, cyclin B, p27, P-p27, CDK2, and CDK1. Also, aliquots of the lysate were used for FACS analysis to check percentage distribution of different phases of cell cycle and for in vitro phosphorylation assay to check the activity profile of cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin B, whose activities start at early G1,G1/S, S, and M phase, respectively. Approximately 30–48-h starvation (without FBS) was sufficient for arresting the majority of the Huh7 cells at the G0 phase, since no cyclin E, cyclin A, or cyclin B activity was observed. However, some level of cyclin D activity was observed during starvation too. In COS7 cells, all cyclins demonstrated basal activity at the same time period, which may be attributed to the presence of large T antigen in those cells. After the addition of 10% FBS, activity of G1 and S phase cyclins peaked at 6–9 and 12–15 h, respectively (data not shown). These experiments gave us a rough idea regarding the cell cycle profile of COS7 and Huh7 cells, and the same experimental condition was followed in all of the subsequent experiments. Based on the above observations, Huh7 cells were transfected with empty vector only (mock) or with pCDNA3.1N (N). Post-transfection, cells were starved for 34 h and then stimulated for different time periods in order to harvest different cyclin-CDK complexes during the peak of their activity. An in vitro phosphorylation assay using histone H1 as a substrate was used to check the activity of the holoenzyme. First we tested the activity of CDK4-cyclin D complex. Its activity was found to be significantly inhibited in N protein-expressing cells (Fig. 1A, first and second panels) at all three time points chosen. To ensure that an equal amount of protein was used in each reaction, aliquots of the lysate were immunoblotted with CDK4 antibody (third panel). The graph represents a quantitative estimation of the normalized band intensities with reference to loading control. As a control, a parallel experiment was conducted to check the CDK4 activity in enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing cells. There was no difference in CDK4 activity of enhanced green fluorescent protein-transfected cells in comparison with mock-transfected cells (data not shown), thus ruling out the possibility that the observed CDK4 inhibitory activity of the N protein is an artifact of the transient transfection method. Similarly, we checked the activity of CDK6. The inhibitory effect of the N protein on CDK6 kinase activity appeared to be less intense as compared with that of CDK4 (fourth panel). The fifth panel shows the protein level of CDK6 as a loading control. Aliquots of the lysate were immunoblotted with anti-Myc (9E10) antibody to confirm the expression of N protein (sixth panel). The bottom panel shows schematics of cell cycle distribution at the respective time points as judged by subjecting control cells to fluorescence-assisted cell sorting analysis. A similar set of experiment was performed using COS7 cells, which showed similar results (data not shown).FIGURE 1N protein expression down-regulates cyclin-CDK activity. A, Huh7 cells transfected with pCDN3.1 (M) or pCDNA3.1N (N) plasmid were starved for 34 h followed by stimulation with 10% bovine serum for the indicated time periods.

The p27 blot was stripped and reprobed with cyclin D antibody (first panel). A fraction of the total cell lysate was immunoblotted with total ERK antibody to check equal loading (fourth panel). C, cells maintained as described above were harvested at the indicated time periods, and in vitro phosphorylation was done using CDK2 (first panel), cyclin E (second panel), and cyclin A (third panel) antibody. Aliquots of the total cell lysate were immunoblotted with CDK4 (fourth panel) or anti-Myc (sixth panel) antibody.

As shown in Fig. 1B, immunoprecipitation of mock- or N protein-expressing cell lysate with cyclin D antibody and immunoblotting with CDK4 or p27 antibody revealed that there was no interference in the assembly of cyclin D-CDK4-p27 complex in N protein-expressing cells as compared with mock-transfected cells. Aliquots of total cell lysate were immunoblotted with total ERK antibody to ensure that equal amounts of lysate were used for each immunoprecipitation reaction (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Having observed that N protein expression could down-regulate CDK4 activity without destabilizing the formation of the CDK4-cyclin D complex, we next investigated whether N protein expression inhibited CDK2 activity as well. An in vitro phosphorylation assay using CDK2, cyclin E, and cyclin A antibodies clearly indicated that the N protein could effectively inhibit CDK2 activity as well (Fig. 1C, first, second, and third panels and accompanying graph). The fourth panel shows an immunoblot of the total CDK4 protein, used as a loading control for this set of experiments. Aliquots of the lysate were also immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody to check the expression of N protein (fifth panel).

https://openalex.org/W2170548956,"The enzymatic degradation of plant cell wall xylan requires the concerted action of a diverse enzymatic syndicate. Among these enzymes are xylan esterases, which hydrolyze the O-acetyl substituents, primarily at the O-2 position of the xylan backbone. All acetylxylan esterase structures described previously display a α/β hydrolase fold with a “Ser-His-Asp” catalytic triad. Here we report the structures of two distinct acetylxylan esterases, those from Streptomyces lividans and Clostridium thermocellum, in native and complex forms, with x-ray data to between 1.6 and 1.0 Å resolution. We show, using a novel linked assay system with PNP-2-O-acetylxyloside and a β-xylosidase, that the enzymes are sugar-specific and metal ion-dependent and possess a single metal center with a chemical preference for Co2+. Asp and His side chains complete the catalytic machinery. Different metal ion preferences for the two enzymes may reflect the surprising diversity with which the metal ion coordinates residues and ligands in the active center environment of the S. lividans and C. thermocellum enzymes. These “CE4” esterases involved in plant cell wall degradation are shown to be closely related to the de-N-acetylases involved in chitin and peptidoglycan degradation (Blair, D. E., Schuettelkopf, A. W., MacRae, J. I., and Aalten, D. M. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A., 102, 15429-15434), which form the NodB deacetylase “superfamily.” Many plant cell wall polysaccharides, including xylan, mannan, and pectin are present in acetylated forms. Acetylation not only modifies the physicochemical properties of polysaccharides, notably increasing the solubility for matrix applications, but also means they are less readily attacked by phytopathogen-derived cell wall-degrading endoglycosidases. To overcome the steric problems provided by acetyl substituents, plant cell wall degrading microorganisms have developed a host of acetyl esterases whose function is to deacetylate the polysaccharides prior to, or concomitant with, its complete hydrolysis by a consortium of exo- and endo-acting glycoside hydrolases. Such microbial esterases have, unsurprisingly, found widespread industrial application in both biomass conversion and for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of diverse esters (see for example Refs. 1Kosugi A.

This family is notable, not merely for its size, but also as many CE4 members have been reported to be metal ion-dependent. Furthermore, family CE4 contains members with both classical de-O-acetylase activity, such as the acetylxylan esterases described here, but also de-N-acetylases, such as the “NodB superfamily” involved in the degradation and/or remodeling of diverse N-acetylglucosamine-based substrates (Fig. 1B) including chitin (17Hekmat O.

These enzymes possess a single divalent (typically Zn2+ or Co2+) metal ion at the active center, similar to that observed for many Zn2+ hydrolases (reviewed in Ref. 21Hernick M. Fierke C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The metal ion gives Lewis-acid assistance to nucleophilic attack by water, with two histidines and an aspartate completing the metal ion coordination. Here we present the first structures for two distinct de-O-acetylases from family CE4, the Clostridium thermocellum (CtCE4) and Streptomyces lividans (SlCE4) acetylxylan esterases. We show, using a novel linked assay system (Fig. 1C) (22Biely P. Mastihubova M. la Grange D.C. van Zyl W.H. Prior B.A. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 332: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), that these enzymes are both metal ion-dependent. Although both show a “chemical” preference for Co2+, the C. thermocellum enzyme displays distinctly different ligand coordination to the metal ion, utilizing an aspartate, a histidine, and four water molecules, as opposed to the more classical His-His-Asp family 4 “consensus” displayed by the S. lividans enzyme. The C. thermocellum enzyme also displays a modified metal ion specificity compared with the S. lividans esterase and the recently described peptidoglycan deacetylases (19Blair D.E. Schuettelkopf A.W.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 570: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); CtCE4 is much more active with Ni2+ than is observed for enzymes with the classical His-His-Asp “Zn2+” coordination. Protein Expression and Purification—The cloning and expression of the gene fragment encoding the CE4 domain of the S. lividans acetylxylan esterase has been described previously (23Caufrier F. Martinou A. Dupont C. Bouriotis V. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins contained in the supernatant derived from S. lividans overexpressing the truncated SlCE4 gene (23Caufrier F. Martinou A. Dupont C. Bouriotis V. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were concentrated by ultrafiltration with a 3-kDa cut-off membrane (Omega). Approximately 200 mg of protein was dialyzed against 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) and applied to a CM-Sepharose AP2 column (Waters, 20 × 100 mm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl, and the active fractions were collected and pooled. Following this the active fraction was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex HR75 beaded column with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, as buffer. Fractions containing pure enzyme were pooled, dialyzed against water, and freeze-dried. The gene encoding the CE4 domain from the bifunctional cellulosomal xylanase U, Xyn11A, from C. thermocellum (designated CtXyn11A-Axe4A) was expressed in Escherichia coli. CtXyn11A-Axe4A was amplified from C. thermocellum YS genomic DNA using the thermostable DNA polymerase pFU Turbo (Stratagene). The primers used, 5′-CTC-CATATGCCAAATGCGAAACTGGTGGC-3′ and 5′-CACCTCGAGCGGTACAGAGTTATACATTC-3′, incorporated NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, which are depicted in bold. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega) and sequenced to ensure that no mutations had occurred during the PCR. The recombinant pGEM T-easy derivative was digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the excised CtCE4-encoding gene was cloned into the similarly restricted expression vector pET21a to generate pZC1. pZC1 encodes CtCE4 with a C-terminal His6-tag. BL21 cells were transformed by the recombinant plasmid, which were subsequently cultured in LB containing 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin at 37 °C to midexponential phase (A550 0.6 absorbance units). At this point isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was incubated for a further 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Na-HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. Recombinant CtCE4 was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The enzyme was buffer exchanged, using a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 M gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), into 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl (Buffer A) and concentrated to 20 mg ml-1 with an Amicon 10-kDa molecular weight centrifugation membrane. Gel filtration using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) was performed, and the protein eluted at 1 ml min-1 in Buffer A. The purified enzyme was concentrated as described above and washed three times with water using the same centrifugal membranes. The final protein concentration was adjusted to 40 mg ml-1. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution of C. thermocellum CE4—Crystals of CtCE4 were grown by vapor-phase diffusion using the hanging drop method with an equal volume (1 μl) of protein (40 mg ml-1 in water) and reservoir solution (0.2 m MgCl2 and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 with a final pH ∼5.8). Crystals were harvested in rayon fiber loops, bathed in Paratone N (Hampton Research) as a cryoprotectant prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Metal ion complexes were obtained by soaking crystals in 1-μl drops of mother liquor, supplemented with either CdCl2 or CoCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. CdCl2 data were collected using an in-house Xcalibur™ PX Ultra system, consisting of an Enhance Ultra sealed tube x-ray source (Oxford Diffraction, Oxford, UK) with an Onyx CCD detector, to a resolution of 2.3 Å. All other data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. Images were processed and integrated using MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G.W.

Phasing information was thus obtained using single wavelength anomalous dispersion with in-house Cd2+ derivative data. Heavy atom sites were determined using SHELXD (27Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), and initial phases were calculated using SHELXE (28Uson I. Sheldrick G.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The space group was determined to be P41212, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Subsequently phases were recalculated using MLPHARE. Phase improvement and extension including the higher resolution CtCE4 data (containing Mg2+, CtCE4-Mg2+) were performed using DM (29Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The initial structure was built using ARP/wARP (30Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) in conjunction with REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Five percent of the observations were set aside for cross-validation and used to monitor the refinement progress and for appropriate weighting of geometrical and temperature factor restraints. COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) was used to make manual corrections to the model between further cycles of refinement using REFMAC. The CtCE4-Mg2+ structure was used as the starting model for refinement of the CtCE4 data containing Co2+ (CtCE4-Co2+). The Co2+ complex data were handled in the same way as the native Mg2+ data, with the same reflections maintained for cross-validation. The structures were validated using PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Final data and refinement statistics for the CtCE4 structures are shown in Table 1. Crystallization and Data Collection of S. lividans CE4—Crystals of SlCE4 were grown by vapor-phase diffusion using the hanging drop method with an equal volume (1 μl) of protein (∼20 mg ml-1) and reservoir solution (7-13% w/v polyethylene glycol 20,000, 0.2 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Na-acetate, pH 4.5). At this pH the enzyme retains ∼10% of maximal activity. Data were collected on beamline ID29 at the ESRF at a wavelength of 1.0047 Å. Data were integrated to 1.8 Å resolution. Images were indexed using DENZO (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Examination of systematic absences confirmed the space group to be P21 (SlCE4 crystal form I). The data were scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Data processing statistics are given in Table 1. A second crystal form (SlCE4 crystal form II) was obtained from 7-13% w/v polyethylene glycol 20,000, 0.2 m KBr, 0.1 m Na-acetate, pH 4.5, with protein at ∼20 mg ml-1. Crystals were mounted and collected to 1.6 Å on beamline ID29 at the ESRF, at a wavelength of 0.979 Å. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK, as described above. In this case space group identification was ambiguous, as systematic absences along all three crystal axes suggested the space group to be P212121, but a strong non-origin peak in the native Patterson indicated two molecules of similar orientation separated by a vector of 0.0 0.5 0.37 (fractional coordinates). The presence of this translational vector made assignment of the space group ambiguous in terms of the presence of the screw axis along the b axis, which was subsequently only resolved during molecular replacement. Molecular Replacement and Structure Solution of SlCE4—A partially refined model of CtCE4 was taken as a starting model for structure solution of crystal form I of SlCE4 by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (26Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit was most likely to contain two molecules, giving a Matthews coefficient of 2.5 Å3 Da-1 and corresponding to a solvent content of ∼50%. The best two-molecule solution was used as the starting model for refinement and remodeling using ARP/wARP (30Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) in conjunction with REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The standard ARP/wARP protocol “automated model building starting from existing model” as implemented in the CCP4 interface failed to refine this model, and no peptides were built automatically into the map. As an alternative approach the initial model was used in an extensive RESOLVE/REFMAC protocol as distributed by the program author as RESOLVE_ BUILD (34Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar, 35Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This built a partial model consisting of 1939 protein atoms, which was input into ARP/wARP and resulted in a model consisting of 2782 protein atoms and 450 “dummy” solvent molecules. Refinement was completed using REFMAC interspersed with manual model building using COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). SlCE4 crystal form II was solved using the model derived from crystal form I using the program MOLREP (36Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite. Molecular replacement confirmed the space group as P212121 with two similarly orientated molecules separated by a translation-only vector, as described above. Refinement was performed using REFMAC interspersed with manual model building in COOT. In both crystal forms of SlCE4 a single metal ion was identified in the active center, which was modeled as Zn2+ (following metal ion identification by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, data not shown) with 0.5 occupancy. A single acetate molecule coordinated to the metal ion was readily identified in both crystal forms. Final data and refinement statistics for SlCE4 are shown in Table 1. Kinetics—To probe metal ion dependence, the catalytic activity of the CE4 enzymes from S. lividans and C. thermocellum was determined using an enzyme-coupled assay, Fig. 1C, with 2-O-acetyl-4-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside as substrate. Reactions were performed at pH 5.5 in 0.1 m Na-phosphate buffer. In this assay, acetate release results in the formation of PNP-β-d-xylopyranoside, which is a viable substrate for the cleaving enzyme β-xylosidase (22Biely P. Mastihubova M. la Grange D.C. van Zyl W.H. Prior B.A. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 332: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Substrate concentrations from 0.1 to 3 times the Km were used for determination of the catalytic constants of SlCE4. For CtCE4, the Km was too high to permit saturation, and the kinetics represent kcat/Km only. Metal ion dependence was performed in two ways, either by incubating the enzyme with 1 mm EDTA and metals subsequently added to a final concentration of 2 mm, or by first dialyzing the enzymes against 4 mm EDTA three times, washing in double-distilled water, and determining kinetics with and without a range of metal ions. Protein concentrations were ∼105-fold below the concentration of the added metal. Preliminary experiments with the β-xylosidase alone showed that enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by Hg2+ and Sn2+, and these metals were omitted from subsequent experiments with the acetylxylan esterases. Ni2+ partially inhibits the xylosidase, and this was considered when assaying the esterases. Acetylxylan esterase domains are frequently found in multimodular plant cell wall-degrading enzyme systems. The mature S. lividans CE4 comprises residues 42-233 of a twin domain enzyme whose C terminus encodes a family CBM2 carbohydrate binding module (the first 41 residues encodes a cleaved signal peptide) (Fig. 2). CtCE4 is derived from the xylanase Xyn11A of C. thermocellum whose full-length protein (37Fernandes A.C. Fontes C. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Fernandes T.H. Ferreira L.M.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) comprises an N-terminal family GH11 glycoside hydrolase (endoxylanase) catalytic domain followed by a family CBM6 carbohydrate binding module, a dockerin domain, which directs the whole enzyme to the cellulosome machinery (38Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M.V. Prates J.A.M. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Romão M.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal family 4 carbohydrate esterase (CtCE4) (Fig. 2). The esterase domains of both enzymes were cloned and expressed as discrete entities for this study. Three-dimensional Structure of the Acetylxylan Esterase from S. lividans, SlCE4—The structure of the C. thermocellum CE4 was solved through the use of an isomorphous Cd2+ derivative using data from an in-house sealed tube CuKα source and CCD detector in harness with 1.05 Å resolution synchrotron data. The subsequent map interpretation was trivial, with the majority of the chain traced automatically. The CtCE4 structure was used as a molecular replacement model to solve the structure of the acetate complex of the S. lividans CE4 enzyme (the enzymes have 32% sequence identity). The structure of both esterases are best described as displaying greatly distorted (β/α)8 barrel folds. The structure of SlCE4 can be traced from residues 2-192 (numbered from the start of the full-length protein lacking its signal peptide) with no breaks. The enzyme forms a dimer, related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis of symmetry, Fig. 3A, with a buried surface area of ∼2400 Å2. A single metal ion, modeled as a partially occupied Zn2+, lies on the N-terminal face of the barrel in a shallow surface groove. Crystallographic estimations of its occupancy, based upon density levels and refined temperature factor, suggest ∼50% occupancy, with a resultant atomic B value of 12 Å2, which is consistent with that of the protein atoms involved in its coordination. The metal ion in both crystal forms of SlCE4 is coordinated by two histidine residues (His-62 and His-66), Asp-13, a single water molecule, and an acetate molecule (Figs. 3B and 7A). The metal ion coordinates in a distorted octahedral arrangement in which the acetate ion makes a bidentate, but asymmetric, coordination to the metal with oxygen to metal distances of 2.0 and 2.5 Å. This arrangement of two histidines and an aspartate is a “classical” coordination for bivalent metal ion-dependent hydrolases (reviewed in Ref. 21Hernick M. Fierke C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) in which the metal ion gives Lewis-acid assistance to nucleophilic attack (described below).FIGURE 7Active site interactions and catalysis in family CE4 acetylxylan esterases.

https://openalex.org/W2015808797,"The survival motor neuron (SMN) protein is the product of the spinal muscular atrophy disease gene. SMN and Gemin2-7 proteins form a large macromolecular complex that localizes in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleoplasm and in nuclear Gems. The SMN complex interacts with several additional proteins and likely functions in multiple cellular pathways. In the cytoplasm, a subset of SMN complexes containing unrip and Sm proteins mediates the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Here, by mass spectrometry analysis of SMN complexes purified from HeLa cells, we identified a novel protein that is evolutionarily conserved in metazoans, and we named it Gemin8. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments demonstrated that Gemin8 is associated with the SMN complex and is localized in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, where it is highly concentrated in Gems. Gemin8 interacts directly with the Gemin6-Gemin7 heterodimer and, together with unrip, these proteins form a heteromeric subunit of the SMN complex. Gemin8 is also associated with Sm proteins, and Gemin8-containing SMN complexes are competent to carry out snRNP assembly. Importantly, RNA interference experiments indicate that Gemin8 knock-down impairs snRNP assembly, and Gemin8 expression is down-regulated in cells with low levels of SMN. These results demonstrate that Gemin8 is a novel integral component of the SMN complex and extend the repertoire of cellular proteins involved in the pathway of snRNP biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2083644948,"A previous exposure to a non-harmful ischemic insult (preconditioning) protects the brain against subsequent harmful ischemia (ischemic tolerance). In contrast to delayed gene-mediated ischemic tolerance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate rapid ischemic tolerance, which occurs within 1 h following preconditioning. Here we have investigated the degradation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim as a mechanism of rapid ischemic tolerance. Bim protein levels were reduced 1 h following preconditioning and occurred concurrent with an increase in Bim ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by the proteasome, and inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) prevented Bim degradation and blocked rapid ischemic tolerance. Inhibition of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by U0126 reduced Bim ubiquitination and Bim degradation and blocked rapid ischemic tolerance. Finally, inhibition of Bim expression using antisense oligonucleotides also reduced cell death following ischemic challenge. Our results suggest that following preconditioning ischemia, Bim is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, resulting in rapid ischemic tolerance. This suggests that the rapid degradation of cell death-promoting proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce cell damage following neuropathological insults, e.g. stroke.

The above suggests that different molecular mechanisms contribute to each type of tolerance. The Bcl-2 family of genes regulates cell death processes and consists of two groups, the pro-cell death family members, for example Bax, and the pro-survival members, for example, Bcl-2 (21Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The ratio between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family determines the fate of the cell (22Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 23Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Bim (also called Bod) is a member of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family that contains only a BH3 domain (e.g. Bim, Bad, and Bid) (24O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Bim is expressed as at least three isoforms (BimEL, BimL, BimS) that determine its cell death potency (24O'Connor L.

Because Bim is an important mediator of neuronal cell death, we investigated the regulation of Bim protein levels via the ubiquitin-proteasome system in an in vitro model of rapid ischemic tolerance. Materials and Methods—The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO) was purchased from Calbiochem; cycloheximide, U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(o-aminophenylmercapto) butadiene), and PD98059 (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) from Sigma; anti-caspase 3, anti-cleaved caspase 3, antiphosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK, and native p42/p44 MAPK from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); anti-Bim from Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada); anti-Bid from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); anti-Bax and anti-α-tubulin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and p62 UBA agarose beads from Affiniti (Exeter, UK). Antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys. Cortical Cell Culture—Sprague-Dawley rat pups were used to prepare cortical neuronal cultures as previously described (12Stenzel-Poore M.P. Stevens S.L. Xiong Z. Lessov N.S. Harrington C.A. Mori M. Meller R. Rosenzweig H.L. Tobar E. Shaw T.E. Chu X. Simon R.P. Lancet. 2003; 362: 1028-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were dissected from 10–12 rat pups (P1–2) and enzymatically dissociated with papain (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ). Cells were plated out at a density of 400,000 cells/coverslip for cell viability assays or 5,000,000 cells/10-cm culture dish (Primara; BD Biosciences) for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation in Neurobasal-A/B27 medium (Invitrogen) for 7–10 days. Ischemic Tolerance—Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (NaCl (1.37 mm), KCl (2.7 mm), Na2HPO4 (10 mm), KH2PO4 (1.7 mm), pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2 and placing culture dishes in an anaerobic chamber for 30 or 120 min (Forma Scientific, Marjetta, OH) (85% N2,5%H2, 10% CO2; 35 °C) as previously described (34Meller R. Minami M. Cameron J.A. Impey S. Chen D. Lan J.Q. Henshall D.C. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2005; 25: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 35Meller R. Stevens S.L. Minami M.

Anaerobic conditions in the chamber were monitored using Gaspack anaerobic indicator strips (BD Biosciences). OGD was terminated by removing cells from the anoxia chamber, replenishing with Neurobasal A medium, and replacing them in the normoxic incubator. Cultured cells were subjected to the following treatments. 1) Control cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in Neurobasal A medium (without B27 supplement). 2) Some cells were preconditioned with 30 min of OGD and then recovered for 24 h in Neurobasal A medium. 3) Some cells were subjected to 120 min of OGD (harmful ischemia) followed by 24 h of recovery in Neurobasal A medium. 4) Some cells were preconditioned with 30 min of OGD and recovered for 1 h before being subjected to a harmful 120 min of OGD ischemia. Cell death analysis was performed 24 h following the final OGD challenge. In preliminary experiments the time interval between preconditioning ischemia and harmful ischemia varied from 1–24 h (see Fig. 1a). For rapid tolerance experiments the interval between preconditioning and harmful ischemia was 1 h. Cell Death Assay (Propidium Iodide Staining)—For cell death assays, coverslips containing cortical cells were incubated with propidium iodide (1.5 μg/ml) for 2 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Cell death was determined as the ratio of propidium iodide-stained cells to the total number of DAPI-stained cells visualized using a fluorescence microscope. Immunocytochemistry and TUNEL—Cultured cells on coverslips were permeabilized with 3% Triton X-100. The samples were preblocked with 2% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight (anti-caspase 3 from Cell Signaling). The samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at 37°C (Jackson Labs). Slides were washed and mounted in a medium containing 4′,6 diamino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Immunolabeling was studied using a Leica microscope under excitation/emission wavelengths of 340/425 nm (blue), 500/550 nm (green), and 580/630 nm (red). Images were collected using an Optronics DEI-750 3-chip camera equipped with a BQ 8000 sVGA frame grabber and analyzed using Bioquant (Nashville, TN). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (36Meller R. Skradski S.L. Simon R.P. Henshall D.C. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 324: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Tissue samples were lysed in a nondenaturing buffer containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), NaF (50 mm), Na3VO4 (2 mm), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent spectrophotometrically at A595. Protein samples (50 μg) were denatured in a gel-loading buffer at 100 °C for 5 min and then loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then exposed to Kodak film (Biomax). Images were captured using a Dage 72 camera. Ubiquitin Pulldown Assay—Cells were plated out on 10-cm dishes at 5,000,000/dish. Cell lysates were prepared in a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Tris (10 mm, pH 8.0), NaCl (140 mm), glycerol (5%), sodium deoxycholate (0.1%), SDS (0.1%), Triton X-100 (1%), protease inhibitors with EDTA (Roche Complete™; Roche Applied Science)). Total protein (0.8 mg) was cleared and then incubated with 30 μl of P62 UBA agarose beads (Affiniti, Exeter, UK) at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were washed using an immunoprecipitation kit (IP50; Sigma). The protein/bead mixture was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and then loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Blots were subjected to immunoblotting as above. Ubiquitin pulldown was verified by re-probing blots with antiubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz). Bim Antisense—Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the bim cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF136927) were identified and synthesized by Sigma Genosys (AS 1 5′-CAGAAGGTTGCTTGGCCA-3′, AS 2 5′-CCACCTTCTCTGTCACAC-3′, AS 3 5′-CCTCCTGAGACTGCCTTA-3′, AS 4 5′-CTCTCAGCAGGCTGCAAT-3′). Sense oligonucleotides identical to the coding cDNA sequence were (S1 5′-TGGCCAAGCAACCTTCTG-3′, S2 5′-GTGTGACAGAGAAGGTGG-3′, S3 TAAGGCAGTCTCAGGAGG-3′, S4 5′-ATTGCAGCCTGCTGAGAG-3′). Oligonucleotides were phosphothioate modified on the first and last 3 linkages to reduce degradation. Cortical neuronal cultures were incubated for 48 h with a mixture of antisense (4 × 1 μm of each oligo), sense (4 × 1 μm of each oligo), or scrambled sequence (5′-TCGGCTAGACACCATCGT-3′, 4 μm). Cultures were replenished with oligonucleotides every 24 h. Cultures were subjected to 120 min of OGD and cell death assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Some cultures were incubated with Bim antisense, sense, or scrambled control and then subjected to immunoblotting for Bim, Bid, and α-tubulin as above. Data Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of n determinations. Data from cell death assays were analyzed using repeated measures of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's post-hoc test (GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Significance was accepted at p <0.05. An in Vitro Model of Rapid Ischemic Tolerance—We investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in rapid ischemic tolerance using an in vitro model of oxygen and glucose deprivation. When cells were subjected to 120 min of OGD we observed ∼50–60% increase in PI-positive staining of cells, which we interpret as an increase in cell death (Fig. 1, b and c). In previous studies ∼60% of these cells had features of apoptosis (TUNEL positive) (Fig. 2C) (35Meller R. Stevens S.L. Minami M. Cameron J.A. King S. Rosenzweig H. Doyle K. Lessov N.S. Simon R.P. Stenzel-Poore M.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2005; 25: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous study of long-term tolerance (34Meller R. Minami M. Cameron J.A. Impey S. Chen D. Lan J.Q. Henshall D.C. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2005; 25: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), when the cultures were preconditioned with 30 min of OGD 24 h prior to a harmful dose of 120 min of OGD, PI staining (cell death) was reduced (Fig. 1b). When the interval between preconditioning and harmful ischemia was reduced to 4 h, the protective effect of preconditioning was lost (Fig. 1b). However, when the interval between preconditioning and harmful ischemia was reduced to 1 h, we also observed a decrease in PI-positive cells, which we interpret as less cell death (rapid/short-term ischemic tolerance) (Fig. 1, b and c). The total number of cells in the cultures was not affected by either harmful 120-min ischemia or 30-min preconditioning ischemia (see supplemental Fig. S1; also see Ref. 34Meller R. Minami M. Cameron J.A. Impey S. Chen D. Lan J.Q. Henshall D.C. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2005; 25: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Long-term ischemic tolerance requires new protein synthesis and is blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors (10Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Feldman A.B. Klesse L.J. Kalb R.G. Dillman J.F. Parada L.F. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34Meller R. Minami M. Cameron J.A. Impey S. Chen D. Lan J.Q. Henshall D.C. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2005; 25: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The protective effect of rapid ischemic preconditioning was not reduced when the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added to the cells for 1 h between OGD treatments (Fig. 1d). In contrast, the protective effect of delayed ischemic tolerance was reduced when cells were incubated with cycloheximide for 24 h following preconditioning, which is consistent with previous reports (10Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Feldman A.B. Klesse L.J. Kalb R.G. Dillman J.F. Parada L.F. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34Meller R. Minami M.

These data suggest that rapid ischemic tolerance does not require the synthesis of new proteins. Reduced Cleavage of an Executioner Caspase in Rapid Ischemic Tolerance—It has been suggested that following preconditioning the activation of cell death pathways is reduced (4Dave K.R. Saul I. Busto R. Ginsberg M.D. Sick T.J. Perez-Pinzon M.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Qi S. Zhan R.Z. Wu C. Fujihara H. Yamakura T. Baba H. Taga K. Shimoji K. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 315: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated the cleavage of the quintessential cell death protease, caspase 3. Caspase 3 requires proteolytic cleavage for activation (37Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 cleavage was increased 3-fold 24 h following 120 min of OGD, compared with control cells (Fig. 2, a and b). However, in cells preconditioned with 30 min of OGD, 1 h prior to 120 min of OGD, caspase 3 cleavage was reduced (Fig. 2, a and b). These data suggest that preconditioning reduces caspase 3-mediated cell death pathways following harmful ischemia. To further examine the location of caspase 3 in tolerant cells we visualized full-length caspase 3 expression using immunocytochemistry. Caspase 3 appeared as a cytosolic staining pattern in control cortical cell cultures (Fig. 2c). The staining was stronger in the nucleus following 120 min of OGD as well as being denser in the cytosol (Fig. 2c). In contrast, few cells stained positive for caspase 3 following preconditioning; however, a small number did show the more dense staining pattern of injured cells (Fig. 2c). Taken together these data suggest that preconditioning ischemia reduces the activation of caspase 3 following a subsequent injurious ischemic insult. Decreased Levels of the Pro-apoptotic Protein Bim following Preconditioning—We investigated the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim following preconditioning. Bim has been shown to play a prominent role in neuronal cell death pathways (27Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 28Strasser A. Puthalakath H. Bouillet P. Huang D.C. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Cullen L. Cory S.

Henshall D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Bim protein was expressed as a 26-kDa protein in control cells (Fig. 3a). Bim protein levels were decreased in cortical cultures 1 h following 30 min of OGD (preconditioning) but recovered to normal levels at 4 h (Fig. 3, a and b). In contrast, the expression of the pro-apoptotic cell death proteins Bid and Bax did not change (Fig. 3a). To test whether changes in Bim expression were due to a blockade in translation, we incubated cells with a high concentration of cycloheximide (10 μm) for 1–24 h and then measured Bim protein levels by immunoblot. As can be seen in Fig. 3c, the resulting decrease in Bim expression was slower than that following preconditioning ischemia. We also analyzed the density of the Bim signal and determined that the half-life of Bim in neuronal cultures following cycloheximide treatment was 2.8 h (Fig. 3c), similar to its half-life (∼4 h) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (32Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). These data suggest that the decrease in Bim levels following preconditioning is not due to decreased translation rates of the protein but that Bim is actively degraded. Bim Ubiquitination and Proteasomal Degradation following Preconditioning Ischemia—Bim protein levels are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (31Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 32Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Howes E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar); hence, we investigated whether Bim was ubiquitinated following 30 min of OGD preconditioning. Our initial experiments attempted to replicate the Bim ubiquitin immunoprecipitation shown by Akiyama (39Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U.I. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); however, we were unable to precipitate Bim using their suggested antibody or a Stressgen antibody (not shown). This result may be because of differences in cell types used in these experiments; their experiments were performed in mouse cells, whereas ours used rat cortical cells. Hence, we sought an alternative approach. It has been shown that the P62 protein (sequestome-1) binds ubiquitinated proteins and shuttles them to the proteasome for degradation (40Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 41Vadlamudi R.K. Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Conjugation of the ubiquitin-binding domain (UBA) of P62 to agarose beads has been shown to precipitate/pull down ubiquitinated tau (40Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We applied a similar approach using a commercially available P62 UBA protein conjugated to agarose (Affiniti). Using these P62 UBA beads we performed pulldown assays to determine whether preconditioning increases the association of P62 to Bim. In control untreated cells, we observed variable amounts of Bim pulled down by these beads (Figs. 4a and 5e). Following 30 min of OGD and 1 h of recovery, there was an increase in Bim pulled down by P62 UBA beads, which appeared in a ladder pattern with a higher molecular weight than native Bim (Fig. 4a). Although not direct evidence of Bim ubiquitination, these data are consistent with Bim being ubiquitinated following preconditioning ischemia (30 min of OGD).FIGURE 5p42/p44 MAPK regulates Bim degradation following preconditioning. a, cells were preconditioned with 30 min of OGD and then incubated for 1 h with U0126 (10 μm).

https://openalex.org/W1981293839,"The canonical pathway of Notch signaling is mediated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). In the pathway, ligand binding results in sequential proteolysis of the Notch receptor, and presenilin (PS)-dependent intramembrane proteolysis at the interface between the membrane and cytosol liberates the Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD), a transcription modifier. Because the degradation of the Notch-1 transmembrane domain is thought to require an additional cleavage near the middle of the transmembrane domain, extracellular small peptides (Notch-1 Aβ-like peptide (Nβ)) should be produced. Here we showed that Nβ species are indeed secreted during the process of Notch signaling. We identified mainly two distinct molecular species of novel Nβ, Nβ21 and C-terminally elongated Nβ25, which were produced in an ∼5:1 ratio. This process is reminiscent of the production of Alzheimer disease-associated Aβ. PS pathogenic mutants increased the production of the longer species of Aβ (Aβ42) from β-amyloid protein precursor. We revealed that several Alzheimer disease mutants also cause a parallel increase in the secretion of the longer form of Nβ. Strikingly, chemicals that modify the Aβ42 level caused parallel changes in the Nβ25 level. These results demonstrated that the characteristics of C-terminal elongation of Nβ and Aβ are almost identical. In addition, because many other type 1 membrane-bound receptors release intracellular domains by PS-dependent intramembrane proteolysis, we suspect that the release of Aβ- or Nβ-like peptides is a common feature of the proteolysis during RIP signaling. We anticipate that this study will open the door to searches for markers of RIP signaling and surrogate markers for Aβ42 production.

The canonical pathway for Notch signaling is mediated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) 2The abbreviations used are: RIP, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; Aβ, amyloid-β peptide; AD, Alzheimer disease; βAPP, β-amyloid protein precursor; HFIP, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol; N1CS, Notch-1 Lin/Notch Repeat CC > SS; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; NICD, Notch-1 intracellular cytoplasmic domains; MS, mass spectroscopy; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; Nβ, Notch-1 Aβ-like peptide; PS, presenilin; compound W, 3,5-bis(4-nitrophenoxy)benzoic acid; sw, Swedish; WT, wild type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; CW, Compound W; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-(S)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester. 2The abbreviations used are: RIP, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; Aβ, amyloid-β peptide; AD, Alzheimer disease; βAPP, β-amyloid protein precursor; HFIP, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol; N1CS, Notch-1 Lin/Notch Repeat CC > SS; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; NICD, Notch-1 intracellular cytoplasmic domains; MS, mass spectroscopy; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; Nβ, Notch-1 Aβ-like peptide; PS, presenilin; compound W, 3,5-bis(4-nitrophenoxy)benzoic acid; sw, Swedish; WT, wild type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; CW, Compound W; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-(S)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester. (2Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In classical signaling, ligand binding to receptors induces downstream intracellular signals, such as Ca 2+ influx and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. However, RIP signaling is distinct; the receptor is cleaved, liberating an intracellular fragment from the membrane that translocates to the nucleus where it modifies the transcription of target genes (3Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 4Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In general, because both the ligand and the receptor for Notch signaling are transmembrane proteins, and signaling occurs only between neighboring cells, a process also called “local cell signaling” (5Le Borgne R. Bardin A. Schweisguth F. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 6Schweisguth F. Curr.

Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Thus, although connections between Notch signaling and tumorigenesis have been reported (8Ellisen L.W. Bird J. West D.C.

Science. 2004; 306: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar), studies to identify secreted molecules that reflect the level of Notch signaling have not been carried out. As a result, the only widely used method for measuring Notch signaling in living cells has been to employ intracellular reporter plasmids (10Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon synthesis, the Notch-1 receptor undergoes furin-like cleavage at site (S) 1, forming a heterodimer that is expressed on the plasma membrane with the cleaved fragments (12Blaumueller C.M. Qi H.

Israel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The binding of ligands, such as DSL family proteins, at the plasma membrane induces endoproteolysis of Notch-1 by the ADAM/TACE/Kuzbanian family (14Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This cleavage occurs at S2 within the extracellular juxtamembrane region and results in shedding of the heterodimerized Notch receptor (14Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X.

The resulting transmembrane fragment, referred to as Notch extracellular truncation, undergoes constitutive presenilin (PS)-dependent intramembrane proteolysis at S3 and S4, which we refer to as “dual-intramembrane proteolysis” (17Schroeter E.H.

The S3 cleavage occurs at the interface between the membrane and cytosol, thus determining the N terminus of NICD (17Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R.

Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) suggests that a putative Notch-1 fragment (Nβ) is produced during the sequential proteolysis of Notch receptors. However, amino acid sequences of these Notch peptides and the composition of their molecular species remain unknown. Moreover, whether they are secreted during Notch signaling has not been determined. Like Notch receptors, β-amyloid protein precursor (βAPP) undergoes PS-dependent “dual-intramembrane proteolysis” at γ and ϵ sites (21Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). γ-Cleavage, which corresponds to S4 cleavage in Notch-1, results in the secretion of Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated Aβ (22Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar), whereas ϵ-cleavage, corresponding to the S3 cleavage site in Notch-1, releases the βAPP intracellular domain, which has been suggested to regulate transcription (21Haass C.

In PS-dependent proteolysis, there is some diversity in the specific sites of cleavage (19Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 22Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar, 25Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N.

Okochi, manuscript in preparation. This is an important aspect of PS-dependent proteolysis because the pathological molecule Aβ42 is generated by cleavage of βAPP at γ42, a variant of the γ-cleavage site (22Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar). Generally, Aβ42 accounts for ∼10% of Aβ production, and most familial AD-associated PS1/2 or βAPP mutants show an increase in Aβ42 production, a peptide that plays an causative role in AD pathology (22Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar). Although Aβ42 induces the formation of senile plaque both in familial and sporadic AD brains, the high degree of Aβ42 aggregation makes it difficult to determine whether Aβ42 generation is enhanced in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. Therefore, a surrogate marker that precisely reflects the level of Aβ42 generation could be useful. Elucidation of the mechanism of Aβ42 generation, i.e. how the γ-cleavage diversity occurs, is essential because a small change in the precision of γ-cleavage is sufficient to lead to AD pathology. PS-mediated intramembrane proteolysis is known to occur in many other type 1 transmembrane receptors at a site near the cytosolic interface of the transmembrane domains, corresponding to S3/ϵ cleavage (26Xia W. Wolfe M.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2839-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Koo E.H. Kopan R. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S26-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Also, cleavage corresponding to the S4/γ site, which lies in the middle of the transmembrane domain, has been proposed for Notch-1, βAPP, and CD44 (19Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 28Lammich S. Okochi M. Takeda M. Kaether C. Capell A. Zimmer A.K. Edbauer D. Walter J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44754-44759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether γ-like cleavage occurs in all the substrates or whether there is any diversity among cleavage sites remains unknown. Also, certain chemicals, such as some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), affect the precision of γ-cleavage, increasing or decreasing the generation of Aβ42 (29Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H.

Med. 2005; 11: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), but whether this effect is specific to βAPP or is shared by other substrates has not been determined. To investigate the mechanism of Nβ secretion during Notch signaling, we utilized mouse Notch-1 and its derivatives as substrates. We found that upon ligand binding full-length Notch-1 undergoes endoproteolysis, which transmits Notch signaling and simultaneously secrets untagged Nβ species. These Nβ species shared a common N terminus (derived from S2 cleavage) but had distinct C termini (derived from S4 cleavage). Interestingly, in many cases, when the relative level of pathological Aβ42 was altered by expression of PS mutants or addition of certain chemicals, the relative level of Nβ25, a major species of longer Nβ, changed concomitantly. These results suggested that Nβ is secreted during Notch signaling and that the proteolytic processes determining the C termini of Nβ and Aβ are very similar. Antibodies and Reagents—The polyclonal antibody 6521 and the rat monoclonal antibody 5E9 were raised against a synthetic peptide (VKSEPVEPPLPSQ) corresponding to the N terminus of Notch extracellular truncation using methods described previously (31Okochi M.

Upon use, the peptides in HFIP were dried using a SpeedVac and dissolved in the appropriate solution. S2474 was synthesized by Shionogi and Co. Ltd. The γ-secretase inhibitors (L685,458 and DAPT), PMA, NSAIDs (sulindac sulfide, indomethacin, and naproxen), fenofibrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt, and Compound W (CW), 3,5-bis-(4-nitrophenoxy)benzoic acid were purchased. cDNA Constructs—The pCS2 vector containing the cDNA for mouse Jagged-1 (kind gift from Dr. Rafael Kopan) (33Lindsell C.E.

Cells stably expressing βAPP sw, PS derivatives, or both were maintained in media supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418, 200 μg/ml Zeocin, or both. Cells stably expressing Jagged-1, Notch-1, or N1CS were selected with 100 μg/ml hygromycin. cDNA Transfection and Reporter Assay—To investigate the formation and function of Nβ, we stably transfected HeLa, CHO, or HEK293 cells with Jagged-1, N1CS, and Notch-1 cDNA constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To study the release of Nβ during Notch signaling, HeLa or K293 cells in 8-cm dishes were transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmids encoding Notch ligands and/or receptors, 5 μg of plasmids encoding the firefly luciferase reporter (HES-1-luc or pGa981–6), and 50 ng of the control Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK. The next day, the media were replaced, and the cells were lysed with 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (500 μl) (Promega) and freeze-thaw treatment. The pulse-chase experiment to detect the Nβ level was carried out at the same time. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in the lysates were measured with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Pulse-Chase Experiment—The cells were treated for 2 h with 1 μm L685,458 or 1 μm DAPT to inhibit γ-secretase activity or 20 ng/ml PMA to increase the efficiency of S2 cleavage. Next, following starvation in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium, the cells were metabolically labeled overnight with 450 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Redivue Promix; Amersham Biosciences) containing 5% dialyzed (i.e. amino acid-free) fetal calf serum and γ-secretase inhibitors or PMA. NSAIDs, compound W, fenofibrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt were added to the media throughout the pulse periods. Immunoprecipitation/Immunoblotting or Immunoprecipitation/Autoradiography—Collected conditioned media were adjusted to 50 mm Tris (from a stock solution of 1 m Tris, pH 7.4), 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 5 mm EDTA (from a stock solution of 500 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Next, the media were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies 6521 or 4G8 for Nβ and Aβ, respectively (19Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T.

Proteins were separated by Tris-glycine (Invitrogen), Tris-Tricine (Invitrogen), or Tris-Bicine SDS-PAGE as described previously (38Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid or 50% methanol, 5% glutaraldehyde (for Nβ). For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with the indicated antibodies (39Okochi M. Eimer S. Bottcher A. Baumeister R.

For autoradiography, the gels were dried and analyzed by fluorography (19Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation/MALDI-TOF MS—Immunoprecipitation followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis was carried out as described previously (19Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lines were grown to confluence in 8-cm dishes. The culture media were replaced with media with or without 20 ng/ml PMA. After 6 h, the media were collected and immunoprecipitated by incubation for 8 h at 4°C with antibody 6521. Following washing, immunoprecipitated peptides were eluted and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Molecular masses and heights of the MS peaks were calibrated with angiotensin (Sigma), bovine insulin β-chain (Sigma), or both. Notch-1 Peptides Are Secreted Extracellularly during Notch Signaling—Notch ligand binding to Notch receptors results in sequential proteolysis of the receptor, and PS-dependent intramembrane proteolysis at the interface between the membrane and cytosol (S3) liberates NICD that modifies the transcription of target genes (1Selkoe D. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Although it was shown that degradation of Notch-1 transmembrane domain requires additional proteolysis near the middle of the transmembrane domain (S4, dual cleavage) (19Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), secretion of extracellular small peptides (Notch-1 Aβ-like peptide; Nβ) during Notch signaling has not been determined (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we first examined whether sequential endoproteolysis of Notch receptors induced upon binding of Notch ligands (1Selkoe D. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) results in the secretion of Notch peptides. The full-length Notch-1 receptor does not undergo sequential endoproteolysis in the absence of ligand binding, because the S2 cleavage site is masked in the Notch-1 heterodimer formed by S1-cleaved Notch-1 fragments (1Selkoe D. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In contrast, Notch-1 LNR CC > SS (N1CS) (Fig. 1B) inhibits heterodimerization of S1-cleaved Notch-1 (14Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol.

Thus, we expect that NICS shows constitutive consecutive S1, S2, S3, and S4 cleavage of Notch-1 that usually occurs depending on ligand binding (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1A). To determine whether Notch-1 peptides are secreted, we metabolically labeled HEK293 cells stably expressing Notch-1 or N1CS with [35S]methionine and then performed immunoprecipitation using antibody 6521, which binds to an epitope downstream of S2 (Fig. 1B). Most strikingly, autoradiography shows that N1CS-expressing cells secrete Notch-1 peptides of ∼3 and 6 kDa, although they were present in different amounts (Fig. 1, C, upper and lower panels, and D). The Notch-1-expressing cells, however, produced only trace amounts of these peptides (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Moreover, addition of PMA to enhance the cleavage at S2 by matrix metalloproteases increased the level of released Notch-1 peptides by 4.73 ± 0.01-fold (Fig. 1, C and D). On the other hand, addition of γ-secretase inhibitors (L685,458 or DAPT) to inhibit dual-intramembrane proteolysis at S3 and S4 by PS-dependent endoproteolysis greatly reduced the amount of secreted Notch-1 peptide (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 1B). These results indicated that the Notch-1 peptides are secreted in conjunction with the sequential proteolysis of the Notch-1 receptor and that the production of the Notch-1 peptides is associated with the efficiency of cleavage at S2 and S3/S4 by metalloproteases and PS-dependent proteases, respectively. We next investigated whether the Notch-1 peptides are secreted during Notch signaling (Fig. 1E). Instead of N1CS, we used Notch-1 without any extracellular truncation and mutations (Fig. 1B) and observed Notch signaling mediated by Jagged-1 (a Notch ligand). We simultaneously measured the level of Notch signaling and analyzed whether Notch-1 peptides are secreted from cells expressing Jagged-1, Notch-1, or both (Fig. 1E). To determine the level of Notch signaling, we measured luciferase reporter activity in cells expressing HES-1-luc (10Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) (3rd panel in Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. 2). We also examined the conditioned media for the presence of secreted Notch-1 peptides, as described in Fig. 1, C and D. We found that cotransfection with Jagged-1 and Notch-1 greatly increased the reporter activity (3rd panel of Fig. 1E), indicating substantial enhancement of transcription via the HES-1 promoter. Most surprisingly, the secretion of Notch-1 peptides was also greatly enhanced in cells expressing both Jagged-1 and Notch-1, but it was hardly detectable in cells expressing either Jagge"

Limited data suggest that Syk plays alternate roles in carcinogenesis under different circumstances. In breast cancer, Syk has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor. In contrast, Syk is essential for murine mammary tumor virus-mediated transformation. However, the roles of Syk in tumor migration are still largely unknown. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, an unusually highly metastatic tumor, expresses Epstein-Barr virus LMP2A (latent membrane protein 2A) in most clinical specimens. Previously, we demonstrated LMP2A triggers epithelial cell migration. LMP2A contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, which is important for Syk kinase activation in B cells. In this study, we explored whether Syk is important for LMP2A-mediated epithelial cell migration. We demonstrate that LMP2A expression can activate endogenous Syk activity. The activation requires the tyrosine residues in LMP2A ITAM but not YEEA motif, which is important for Syk activation by Lyn in B cells. LMP2A interacts with Syk as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. Furthermore, LMP2A-induced cell migration is inhibited by a Syk inhibitor and short interfering RNA. Tyrosines 74 and 85 in the LMP2A immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif are essential for both Syk activation and LMP2A-mediated cell migration, indicating the involvement of Syk in LMP2A-triggered cell migration. The LMP2A-Syk pathway may provide suitable drug targets for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Wienands J. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Structurally, Syk contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a C-terminal kinase domain joined by a linker region (2Sada K. Takano T. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). With the distinct tandem SH2 motif, Syk can interact selectively in immune cells with proteins containing a phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (YXX(L/I)(X6-8)YXX(L/I)) (3Futterer K. Wong J. Grucza R.A. Chan A.C. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The understanding of the linkage of Syk to ITAMs comes from studies of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). BCR activation is triggered by antigen stimulation, which results in clustering of the BCR leading to the activation of Lyn kinase through the BCR YEEA motif (4Burkhardt A.L. Brunswick M. Bolen J.B. Mond J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 5Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated Lyn phosphorylates the ITAM within the BCR, which acts as a docking site for Syk, and then triggers the autophosphorylation and the activation of Syk kinase (6Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Both Syk and Lyn are important for BCR signaling (7Harnett M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Chan V.W. Meng F. Soriano P. DeFranco A.L. Lowell C.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The BCR-Lyn-Syk pathway leads to many downstream events such as the recruitment and activation of kinases, hydrolysis of phospholipids, activation of protein kinase C, and mobilization of intracellular calcium (1Tsubata T. Wienands J. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These signals stimulate B cells to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells or memory cells (1Tsubata T. Wienands J. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, additional studies in nonhematopoietic cells have shown that Syk also plays important roles in epithelial cells, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and neuronal cells (9Yanagi S. Inatome R. Takano T. Yamamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The role of Syk in the carcinogenesis of epithelial cells was first suggested in breast cancer, where Syk functions as a tumor suppressor gene (10Coopman P.J. Do M.T. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In contrast, Syk and the ITAM of murine mammary tumor virus env gene are both required for cell transformation (11Katz E. Lareef M.H. Rassa J.C. Grande S.M. King L.B. Russo J. Ross S.R. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The involvement of Syk in the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells implicates a potential role of Syk in the reorganization of vascular endothelial cells during angiogenesis (12Inatome R. Yanagi S. Takano T. Yamamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Yanagi S. Inatome R. Ding J. Kitaguchi H. Tybulewicz V.L. Yamamura H. Blood. 2001; 98: 2869-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, Syk might have varied roles in oncogenic transformation. One cancer that Syk may be involved with is nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). NPC is characterized by being highly metastatic and having a strong association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (14Gustafson R.O. Neel III, H.B. Myers E.N. Suen J.Y. Cancer of the Head and Neck. 2nd Ed. Churchill Livingstone, New York1989: 495-508Google Scholar, 15Hsu J.L. Glaser S.L. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 34: 27-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). EBV infects B cells and epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo (16Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Knipe D.M. Holley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamp M.A. Martin R.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. 2. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Hagerstown, MD2001: 2575-2627Google Scholar). Among EBV gene products, LMP2A (latent membrane protein 2A) is the only EBV protein containing an ITAM and is detected in almost all NPC biopsies (17Brooks L. Yao Q.Y. Rickinson A.B. Young L.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2689-2697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Busson P. McCoy R. Sadler R. Gilligan K. Tursz T. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3257-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, there is a specific elevation of LMP2A antibody titers in NPC patients (19Lennette E.T. Winberg G. Yadav M. Enblad G. Klein G. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The roles of LMP2A in carcinogenesis are supported by the oncogenicity of LMP2A-expressing cells in nude mice (20Scholle F. Bendt K.M. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10681-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These tumors displayed NPC-like features, including a high rate of metastasis, and are poorly differentiated (20Scholle F. Bendt K.M. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10681-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In vitro, LMP2A stabilizes β-catenin to inhibit cellular differentiation (21Morrison J.A. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, LMP2A induces cell migration of epithelial cells through ERK kinase (22Chen S.Y. Lu J. Shih Y.C. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism of how LMP2A transmits signals from cell membrane to induce cell motility is unclear. In EBV-immortalized B cells, LMP2A blocks B cell activation by binding Lyn and Syk (23Miller C.L. Burkhardt A.L. Lee J.H. Stealey B. Longnecker R. Bolen J.B. Kieff E. Immunity. 1995; 2: 155-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 24Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Longnecker R. Infect. Agents Dis. 1994; 3: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar). The binding occurs via YEEA and ITAM motifs within the LMP2A N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (25Fruehling S. Longnecker R. Virology. 1997; 235: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Fruehling S. Swart R. Dolwick K.M. Kremmer E. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7796-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a transgenic mouse model, LMP2A enhances the survival of immunoglobulin-negative B cells in peripheral lymphoid organ indicating that LMP2A generates a constitutive differentiation and survival signal in B cells (27Caldwell R.G. Wilson J.B. Anderson S.J. Longnecker R. Immunity. 1998; 9: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Therefore, LMP2A has dual functions in B cells (25Fruehling S. Longnecker R. Virology. 1997; 235: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Caldwell R.G. Wilson J.B. Anderson S.J. Longnecker R. Immunity. 1998; 9: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). LMP2A can substitute for normal BCR function in B cell development but can also alter normal BCR-mediated signals. In comparison to B cells, LMP2A has been shown to possess different signals and functions in epithelial cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation status of LMP2A has been evaluated in LMP2A-expressing B cells and epithelial cells (26Fruehling S. Swart R. Dolwick K.M. Kremmer E. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7796-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Longnecker R. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 79: 175-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Scholle F. Longnecker R. Raab-Traub N. Virology. 2001; 291: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In B cells, Lyn is essential for LMP2A phosphorylation (26Fruehling S. Swart R. Dolwick K.M. Kremmer E. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7796-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, the phosphorylation of LMP2A is dependent on the stimulation of extracellular matrix and Csk kinase but not on Src kinases, including Lyn kinase (30Scholle F. Longnecker R. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4767-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the signaling cascade of LMP2A in epithelial cells appears to be different from that in B cells. LMP2A can induce cell migration and harbors an ITAM, the interaction motif of LMP2A with Syk in B cells (22Chen S.Y. Lu J. Shih Y.C. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Fruehling S. Longnecker R. Virology. 1997; 235: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, Syk is a prime candidate for mediating LMP2A-induced cell motility in epithelial cells. In this study, we demonstrate that Syk regulates LMP2A-induced cell motility in epithelial cells. Cell Culture—The human epithelial cell lines, 293 (31Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3504) Google Scholar) and HaCaT (32Boukamp P.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Tzuu-Shuh Jou, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Plasmid Construction—pRc/CMV-LMP2A is an LMP2A expression plasmid driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (22Chen S.Y. Lu J. Shih Y.C. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Wild type LMP2A plasmid and plasmids with deletions in LMP2A coding sequences for amino acids 21-64 (Δ21-64), 21-85 (Δ21-85), and 80-112 (Δ80-112) or point mutation of tyrosine codons 31 (Y31F), 74 (Y74F), 85 (Y85F), 101 (Y101F), and 112 (Y112F) to phenylalanine were described by Fruehling et al. (26Fruehling S. Swart R. Dolwick K.M. Kremmer E. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7796-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LMP2A was tagged with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the C terminus. The tyrosine codon 74 was also mutated to phenylalanine in the LMP2A deletion mutant 80-112 (Δ80-112). Cell Transfection and LMP2A-expressing Stable Clones Establishment—Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions or by a modified calcium phosphate method, as described previously (33Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of plasmid DNA in 360 μl of ice-cold H2O was mixed with 40 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 and 0.4 ml of 2× BBS (50 mm N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.95) and incubated for 10-20 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to 50% confluent cells, which were then incubated for 18 h at 35 °C under 3% CO2. Following a media change, the transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transient transfections, cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection. To establish LMP2A-expressing stable clones and vector control lines, cells transfected with pRc/CMV-LMP2A or vector alone were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml neomycin. For siRNA transfection, cells with 90% confluence were transfected with control or Syk siRNA purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Pooled siRNA duplexes for Syk or control nonspecific RNA (1 μl, 20 μm) were incubated with 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of DMEM at room temperature for 20 min. After incubation, the RNA/liposome mixtures were added to one 12-well plate containing 500 μl of 10% fetal calf serum/DMEM. After 48 and 96 h, the transfected cells were harvested for three-dimensional collagen gel assay and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Twenty μg of extracted protein was denatured at 100 °C for 5 min and resolved on SDS-8% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the blot was blocked in washing buffer containing 4% skim milk and then incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Syk antibody (4D10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Syk antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), anti-LMP2A antibody (22Chen S.Y. Lu J. Shih Y.C. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), anti-HA antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA), or anti-actin antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the blot was incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (The Jackson Laboratory, West Grove, PA). Finally, bands were visualized using the Renaissance kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation—Nonidet P-40-solubilized cell lysates (125 μg) were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C, and samples were incubated overnight with 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), rabbit anti-Syk antibody (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-LMP2A antibody (22Chen S.Y. Lu J. Shih Y.C. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), mouse immunoglobulin (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), or rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako) at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then precipitated by protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h and washed four times with PBS or 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Finally, the immunoprecipitates were resolved on an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analysis was carried out as described above. Immunohistochemical Assay—LMP2A monoclonal antibody was generated using a standard protocol (34Tsai C.H. Liu M.T. Chen M.R. Lu J. Yang H.L. Chen J.Y. Yang C.S. J. Biomed. Sci. 1997; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sections of NPC biopsies, vector, and LMP2A stable clones were fixed in methanol and acetone (1:1) at -20 °C for 10 min. The slides were subsequently treated with 3% H2O2, avidin, and biotin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 10 min. Between each step, the slides were washed with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, three times. After blocking with 10% goat serum for 20 min, anti-LMP2A antibody (1:4) or mouse immunoglobulin (Dako) were incubated with the slides overnight at 4 °C. The slides were incubated with avidin-biotin complex (Dako), developed with diaminobenzidine (Dako), and counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin. In Vitro Tyrosine Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 μm Na3VO4) and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 μm Na3VO4, 50 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of the immunoprecipitate to a reaction mixture containing kinase buffer with or without 10 μm ATP, for 10 min at 30 °C (9Yanagi S. Inatome R. Takano T. Yamamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After the addition of 6× SDS sample buffer to stop the reaction, the samples were denatured by boiling for 5 min and subjected to Western blotting using anti-phospho-Syk or anti-Syk antibody. Confocal Spectral Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed to the slides with acetone at room temperature for 10 min. As described previously (35Lu J. Chen S.Y. Chua H.H. Liu Y.S. Huang Y.T. Chang Y. Chen J.Y. Sheen T.S. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7391-7399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), cells were incubated with mouse anti-LMP2A monoclonal antibody (1:50), rabbit anti-Syk antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or control antibody for 1 h at 37°C. The cell smears were then washed with PBS and incubated with 100-fold diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antiserum or Rhodamine Red™-X AffiniPure goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antiserum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at 37°C. After washing with PBS, the cells were examined using a confocal spectral fluorescence microscope (TCS SP2, Leica). Three-dimensional Collagen Gel Assay—8 × 103 cells were resuspended in collagen gel mixture (70 μl of 3 mg/ml rat tail collagen I, 9 μl of 10× DMEM, 2 μl of 0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.3, 5 μl of H2O, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 n NaOH) (36Lu J. Chua H.H. Chen S.Y. Chen J.Y. Tsai C.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 256-262PubMed Google Scholar). The mixtures were then seeded into a 96-well microtiter plate, and the gel was solidified for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. 100 μl of DMEM containing 2.5 or 1% fetal bovine serum was then added. For Syk inhibition assays, 10 μm Syk inhibitor (piceatannol; Calbiochem) was added to both the collagen gel and the culture medium. After 7-14 days of incubation, the effects on the cell spreading phenotype was observed and photographed using an inverted photomicroscope (Axiovert 10, Zeiss, Germany). Transwell Assay—Cell motility assay was performed using the QCM™-Collagen I kit, and all steps were performed according to the manufacturer's procedure with little modification (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Briefly, cells (3 × 104) in serum-free medium were seeded into the Boyden chambers having 8-μm pore size and coated with type I collagen on the underside only. For inhibition assays, 10 μm of Syk inhibitor (piceatannol) was added to both sides of the chamber. After incubating for 24 h, nonmigrating cells were removed with a flattened swab, and migrating cells on the underside of the chamber were stained, and the extent of migration was determined by counting stained cells. Activation of Syk in LMP2A-expressing Epithelial Cells—To test whether Syk participates in LMP2A-triggered cell migration, the expression of endogenous Syk in epithelial cell lines was investigated. By Western blot analysis, Syk was detected in 293 and HaCaT cell lines (data not shown). The activation of the Syk kinase requires tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (2Sada K. Takano T. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To determine whether LMP2A can regulate endogenous Syk in epithelial cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation status of Syk was examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Anti-Syk, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, or immunoglobulin controls were used in immunoprecipitation experiments with LMP2A-expressing stable clones or transient transfectants (22Chen S.Y. Lu J. Shih Y.C. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Syk antibodies. The results indicate that Syk was tyrosine-phosphorylated in both transient and stable LMP2A-expressing cells but not in the vector control cells (Fig. 1A). Syk contains at least 10 tyrosine residues that are putative autophosphorylation sites (37Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H. Ashendel C.L. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Among them, two tyrosine residues, amino acids 525 and 526, are essential for the activation of Syk (6Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 38Zhang J. Billingsley M.L. Kincaid R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35442-35447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To confirm that Syk is phosphorylated at these sites, Western blot analysis was performed with antibody against phosphorylated tyrosine residues 525 and 526 of Syk (Fig. 1B). The expression of LMP2A and Syk in LMP2A stable clones and transient transfectants was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). The results clearly demonstrate that Syk is phosphorylated within the Syk activation loop in LMP2A-expressing cells and not in vector control cells (Fig. 1B). Additionally, Syk phosphorylation correlates well with the amount of LMP2A protein expressed (Fig. 1B). Actin serves as an internal control for the quantity of protein in each lane. To confirm the activated Syk has kinase activity in LMP2A-expressing cells, an in vitro tyrosine kinase assay was performed (Fig. 1C). Syk autophosphorylation activity was detected in LMP2A-expressing cells but not in vector control cells (Fig. 1C). The kinase activity of Syk in EBV-immortalized B cell lines was also examined as a positive control in this assay (data not shown). To gauge the level of LMP2A expression in the LMP2A stable clones in comparison to NPC tumor biopsies, immunohistochemistry was performed with NPC biopsies. A total of 68 NPC biopsies was studied in parallel with the LMP2A-3 cell line that expressed the highest levels of LMP2A (Fig. 1B). Of the 68 NPC biopsies examined, 28 cases exhibited greater staining than the LMP2A-3 cell line, whereas 36 had staining equal to or less than the LMP2A-3 cell line (representative data are shown in Fig. 1D and data not shown). No LMP2A staining was detected in vector control cells and four of the NPC biopsies (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Therefore, the expression of LMP2A and the subsequent activation of Syk would appear to be a result of physiological levels of LMP2A expression, which is similar to levels of LMP2A expression observed in NPC biopsies. Identification of Essential Tyrosine Residues in LMP2A for Activation of Syk—LMP2A has eight tyrosine residues within its N-terminal region that could be sites for phosphorylation (39Longnecker R. Miller C.L. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These phosphorylated tyrosine residues are part of potential binding motifs for a variety of cellular signaling proteins (28Longnecker R. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 79: 175-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the region of LMP2A that mediates Syk activity, LMP2A deletion mutant constructs (Δ21-64, Δ21-85, and Δ80-112) (Fig. 2A) and point mutants constructs (Y31F, Y74F, Y85F, Y101F, and Y112F) were transfected into cells individually. By Western blot analysis, amino acids 65-112 are essential for endogenous Syk activation (Fig. 2B). The contribution of specific LMP2A tyrosine residues for Syk phosphorylation was also tested. Tyrosine residues 74 and 85 but not 31, 101, and 112 of LMP2A were required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (Fig. 2B). Expression of LMP2A and endogenous Syk was confirmed by Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 2B. Actin was used as a loading control for each sample. These data indicated that the LMP2A Tyr-74 and Tyr-85 residues, which constitute an ITAM, are crucial for Syk phosphorylation. A similar result was obtained when HaCaT cells were transfected with the LMP2A mutants (Fig. 2C). HaCaT is a spontaneously immortalized and nontumorigenic human epithelial cell line (32Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Because the endogenous Syk content in HaCaT cells was lower than 293 cells, Syk phosphorylation was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with anti-Syk, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, or immunoglobulin controls. Immunoprecipitations were then probed with anti-phospho-Syk antibody by Western blot. Similar to the results with 293 cells shown in Fig. 2B, the LMP2A ITAM was essential for Syk activation in HaCaT cells. Interaction of Syk with LMP2A—To determine whether LMP2A could interact with endogenous Syk in vivo, coimmunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Syk and anti-LMP2A antibodies. In LMP2A-expressing stable clones, LMP2A interacted with Syk (Fig. 3A). The immunoglobulin control did not immunoprecipitate LMP2A or Syk verifying the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. To further investigate the interaction of LMP2A with Syk, colocalization of Syk and LMP2A was examined by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3B, the majority of LMP2A was colocalized with Syk in three LMP2A stable clones and transient transfectants (Fig. 3B and data not shown). No signal was detected when the LMP2A antibody was used with vector control cells or control immunoglobulin with LMP2A-expressing cells (data not shown). Mapping the Interacting Regions of LMP2A with Syk—To delineate the region of LMP2A required for interaction with Syk, the LMP2A mutants were transfected into HaCaT and 293 cells followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-Syk antibody, anti-LMP2A antibody, and control immunoglob"

GEC1-(38–117) did not interact with the C-tail of the μ or δ opioid receptors. GEC1, a 117-amino acid protein (Pellerin, I., Vuillermoz, C., Jouvenot, M., Ordener, C., Royez, M., and Adessi, G. L.

In pull-down assays, GST-GEC1 interacted directly with the hKOR C-tail, full-length hKOR, and tubulin. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, GEC1 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-hKOR. Expression of GEC1 greatly increased total and cell-surface KOR but not μ or δ opioid receptors. GEC1 expression slightly reduced U50,488H-promoted down-regulation, without affecting ligand binding affinity, receptor-G protein coupling, or U50,488H-induced desensitization and internalization. HA-GEC1 expressed in CHO cells was localized in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When cells were pulsed with [35S]Met/Cys, GEC1 expression enhanced the level of the mature form (55-kDa band) of FLAG-hKOR at 4, 8, and 22 h after pulse without affecting the precursors (39- and 45-kDa bands), indicating that GEC1 facilitates trafficking of FLAG-hKOR from the ER/Golgi to plasma membranes. GEC1 interacted with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) in pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitated with NSF in rat brain extracts. The interaction with NSF may contribute to GEC1 effects. This is the first report on biological functions of GEC1 and the first demonstration that a GPCR interacts with a protein of the MAP family.

Activation of κ opioid receptors in vivo produces many effects, including antinociception (1VonVoigtlander P.F. Lahti R.A. Ludens J.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

At the cellular level, κ opioid receptors are coupled through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins to affect a variety of effectors, which include adenylate cyclase, potassium, and calcium channel and the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (for a review, see Ref. 5Law P.-Y.

Following cloning of the δ opioid receptor, the κ opioid receptor has been cloned from several species (for a review, see Ref. 6Knapp R.J. Malatynska E. Collins N. Fang L. Wang J.Y. Hruby V.J.

In recent years, GPCRs have been found to interact with many proteins besides G proteins, and such non-G protein interactions are unique to individual receptors and have been shown to play significant roles in signal transduction, receptor regulation, or receptor biogenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 7Bockaert J.

In this study, we identified proteins interacting with the human κ opioid receptor (hKOR) by yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library using the cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) as the bait. In contrast to the first, second, and third intracellular loops of the hKOR, which are short and homologous to those of μ and δ opioid receptors, the C-tail of the hKOR is highly divergent (11Zhu J. Chen C. Xue J.-C. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Life Sci. 1995; 56: PL201-PL207Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and thus was used as the bait. GEC1, an early estrogen-regulated gene (12Pellerin I. Vuillermoz C. Jouvenot M. Ordener C. Royez M. Adessi G.L. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1993; 90: R17-R21Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was one of the proteins identified in the screening.

GEC1 belongs to a family of microtubules-associated proteins (MAPs) that includes, in addition, GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (15Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE-16) (also named GABARAPL2) (16Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). All four members are 117-amino acid proteins, and their amino acid sequence comparison is shown in Fig. 1. Light chain 3 of microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1-LC3) is a less similar member of the family (18Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y.

Apg8/Aut7, GATE-16, and GABARAP have been shown to be involved in membrane fusion processes and in intracellular trafficking and membrane targeting of proteins (15Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J.

Apg8/Aut7 is essential for vesicle formation in autophagy and cytoplasm to vacuole targeting, which are processes that in yeast are used to degrade intracellular organelles when starved (22Kirisako T.

GABARAP interacts with the γ2 subunit of the GABAA receptor (15Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), promotes clustering of the GABAA receptor, modulates the binding affinity of GABA, and alters the kinetics of desensitization and inactivation of the receptor (23Chen L.

Following cloning of the guinea pig GEC1 (1VonVoigtlander P.F. Lahti R.A. Ludens J.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 224: 7-12PubMed Google Scholar), GEC1 has been cloned from several species (13Xin Y. Yu L. Chen Z. Zheng L. Fu Q. Jiang J. Zhang P. Gong R. Zhao S.

The amino acid sequences are identical across the species cloned to date, including frog (AAH72921), mouse (NP_065615), guinea pig (AAL32264), and human (Q9H0R8), indicating that GEC1 is highly conserved in evolution. GEC1 mRNA is widely distributed in mouse and human tissues, with the expression levels being very high in the brain, heart, peripheral blood leukocytes, liver, kidney, placenta, and skeletal muscle (1VonVoigtlander P.F.

The wide distribution of this family of proteins suggests that they have important biological functions in cells. We hypothesized that GEC1 played an important role in the trafficking of the κ opioid receptor. In this study, we characterized the interaction between GEC1 and the hKOR and investigated the functional significance of this interaction on expression, signal transduction, and regulation of the receptor. Yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted with the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-hybrid System 3 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The DNA fragment encoding amino acids 334–380 of the hKOR C-terminal domain (DENFKRCFRDFCFPLKMRMERQSTSRVRNTVQDPAYLRDIDGMNKPV) was inserted into pGBKT7, the GAL4 binding domain plasmid (bait). The bait construct was transformed into AH109 yeast strain, and the transformants were selected on SD/-Trp plates. A human brain cDNA library constructed in the GAL4 activation domain vector pACT2 and pretransformed into yeast host strain Y187 (prey) was purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The AH109 bait transformant and the Y187 library host were mated in 2× YPDA medium (2% yeast extract, 4% peptone, 4% glucose, 0.006% adenine) for 24 h to give rise to diploids containing both bait and library constructs. The mating efficiency was measured at ∼20%, which translated into ∼2 million clones screened. The complete mating culture was plated on 150-mm plates containing three drop-out medium (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His, TDO) and four drop-out medium (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade, QDO). The positive clones were restreaked twice on four drop-out media with X-α-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) added to test for α-galactosidase expression. The cDNAs from clones selected were isolated using the QIAamp DNA miniprep kit (Qiagen Co., Valencia, CA). The library vectors were rescued by transforming into Escherichia coli, and the isolated DNAs were used to co-transform with bait DNA into AH109 for further verification of protein-protein interaction. The library inserts in positive clones were amplified by PCR, and the fragments were sequenced, analyzed, and searched against GenBank™ entries (non-redundant, expressed sequence tags, and genome survey sequence data bases). The inserts from selected positive clones were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV containing the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope for transfection into CHO cells stably expressing FLAG-hKOR. Similar to the hKOR C-tail construction, the C-tails of human μ, δ, and rat κ opioid receptors (hMOR, hDOR, and rKOR, Fig. 1B) and the truncated form hKOR Ct-345 were inserted into pGBKT7 and transformed into the AH109 strain to generate bait clones. The GABARAP cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Olsen of UCLA. GABARAP-(38–117) was cloned into pGADT7 and transformed into Y187. The bait transformants were mated with transformants of GEC1-(38–117) or GABARAP-(38–117). The mating cultures were plated on SD/-Trp/-Leu, SD/TDO, and SD/QDO plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 7 days before the colony numbers were counted. The interaction strengths were evaluated and presented as the percentage of the colony forming units (CFU) on TDO or QDO plates over those on -Trp/-Leu plates (percentage of total CFU, Fig. 1B). cDNA Construction and Generation of GST Fusion Proteins—The full-length cDNA of GEC1 was obtained from total RNA of HEK293 cells by reverse transcription-PCR. Three GST fusion proteins were used in the studies: GST-GEC1, the GST receptor C-tails of hKOR and hDOR. The cDNA constructs of the GST fusion proteins of receptor C-tails and GEC1 were generated in the pGEX-4T-1 bacterial expression system (Amersham Biosciences), transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). GST receptor C-tails, GST-GEC1, or GST proteins were adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline for pull-down analysis. cDNA Construction and Purification of His6 /S Tag-GEC1—The full-length cDNA of GEC1 was cloned into the pET-30a(+) bacterial expression vector (Novagen Co., Madison, WI), which carries an N-terminal His6 tag and an S-tag. The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the protein was adsorbed onto ProBond™ nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen). The His6 tag fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with 0.5 m imidazole/500 mm NaCl/50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 20 min. Imidazole was removed via multiple rounds of concentration and dilution using Microcon™ centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with TBS-T buffer (25 mm Tris/150 mm NaCl/0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Interaction of Receptor-C-tails with Purified GEC1—GST receptor C-tail fusion proteins or GST (control) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (∼20 μg of protein/20 μl of resin) were incubated with purified His6/S-tag-GEC1 (20 μg) in 1 ml of TBS-T buffer (25 mm Tris/150 mm NaCl/0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with ice-cold 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T buffer and three times with TBS-T buffer to remove nonspecific binding. The beads were then incubated with 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH6.8) to dissociate proteins from beads and centrifuged to remove beads. The supernatants (20 μl each) were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon™-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), which was rinsed three times with TBS-T buffer and blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer. The His6/S-tag-GEC1 was detected by blotting with S-protein horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Novagen) at 1:5000 dilution, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). The membranes was also stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid to reveal the relative loading amounts of the GST (26 kDa) and GST receptor C-tails (34–35 kDa). Interaction of GEC1 with Tubulin—GST or GST-GEC1 fusion protein was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with soluble tubulin (PC-tubulin, Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% nonfat milk) at room temperature for 1 h or overnight. Beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunostaining with monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:1000 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (21Wang H. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 644-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CHO cells stably expressing FLAG-hKOR, HA-rMOR, FLAG-mDOR, hKOR, and rKOR were established previously (28Li J. Li J.-G. Chen C. Zhang F. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The truncated form, FLAG-hKOR-Ct-345 (with a 35-amino acid deletion from the C-terminal domain, Fig. 1B), was stably transfected into CHO cells similarly. These cells were designated as CHO-sFLAG-hKOR, CHO-HA-rMOR, CHO-sFLAG-mDOR, CHO-hKOR, CHO-rKOR, and CHO-sFLAG-hKOR Ct345, respectively. The sFLAG-hKOR and sFLAG-mDOR constructs have a signal peptide preceding the FLAG epitope tag at N terminus, which is cleaved off N-terminal to the FLAG epitope by ER processing. The signal peptide has been shown to enhance expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor (29Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CHO receptor cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 HAM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. These stable cell lines were used throughout this study in all experiments involved GEC1 transfection. Full-length GEC1 cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the vector pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) with HA epitope added 5′ to the initiation codon of GEC1 for expression of HA-GEC1. Untagged wild-type GEC1 cDNA was also inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro. CHO-sFLAG-hKOR cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg/100-mm dish of HA-GEC1 or GEC1, HA-GEC1-(38–117) cDNA constructs or the vector pcDNA3 (control) by use of Lipofectamine (40 μl, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. About 40 h after transfection, cells were used for experiments. GST or GST-GEC1 fusion protein was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as described above. A 100-mm dish of CHO-sFLAG-hKOR cells at 90% confluent were harvested and solubilized in 1 ml of TTSEC buffer (2% Triton X-100/50 mm Tris HCl/150 mm NaCl/5 mm EDTA/mixture tablet of protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) (1 tablet/10 ml), pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. An aliquot of 500-μl supernatant was incubated with GST-GEC1 or GST pre-loaded glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads on an end-to-end rocker for 1 h at 4°C, washed, and SDS-PAGE was performed. Immunoblotting was performed with mouse anti-NSF antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Inc., San Diego, CA) for NSF and rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (F7425, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) for FLAG-hKOR. This was performed according to our published procedure (30Li J.-G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-sFLAG-hKOR, CHO-sFLAG-mDOR, or CHO cells transiently transfected with GEC1 or HA-GEC1 were solubilized with TTSEC buffer for 1 h at 4 °Cand centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with agarose beads conjugated with M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2-Agarose, Sigma-Aldrich). The immunoprecipitated materials were washed three times with TTSEC and dissociated in 2× Laemmli sample buffer with 100 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon membranes. Membranes were treated with blocking solution, blotted with a rabbit antibody against GEC1 (PA629p) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). FLAG-hKOR was blotted with rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (F7425, Sigma-Aldrich) after stripping of the same Immobilon membranes. Immunoblotting was performed to examine the expression of FLAG-hKOR, FLAG-mDOR, and HA-rMOR proteins as described previously (28Li J. Li J.-G. Chen C. Zhang F. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CHO-sFLAG-hKOR, CHO-sFLAG-mDOR, and CHO-HA-rMOR cells were solubilized with 2× Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon membranes. Membranes were treated with blocking solution, incubated with a rabbit antibody against FLAG (F7425) for FLAG receptors and a monoclonal antibody against HA (HA.11, Covance, Princeton, NJ) for HA-rMOR followed by goat anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and then by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Images were captured by FUJIFILM LAS1000 plus system and quantitated using the ImageGauge software (version 4.1, Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.). HA-GEC1, HA-GEC1-(38–117), or the vector were transiently transfected into CHO-sFLAG-hKOR cells, transferred into 12-well plates 24 h after transfection, and cultured overnight. Cells were treated with or without 1 mm U50,488H at 37 °C for 4 h, and immunoblotting was performed as described above (31Wang Y. Tang K. Inan S. Siebert D. Holzgrabe U. Lee D.Y. Huang P. Li J.G.

Receptor binding to FLAG-hKOR, FLAG-mDOR, HA-rMOR, and FLAG-hKOR Ct-345 expressed in CHO cells was conducted in intact cells as we described previously (32Li J.-G. Luo L.Y. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L.

Binding was conducted with 1 nm [3H]diprenorphine in Kreb's buffer at 25 °C for 60 min in duplicate in a volume of 1 ml with 2 × 105 cells. Naloxone (10 μm) was used to define nonspecific binding. Membrane preparations and [35S]GTPγS binding were performed according to Li et al. (28Li J. Li J.-G. Chen C. Zhang F. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). About 10 μg of membrane protein was incubated with 15 μm GDP and 0.2 nm [35S]GTPγS in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH7.4) with or without different concentrations of U50,488H, in a final volume of 0.5 ml at 30 °C for 60 min. For desensitization experiments, cells were treated with or without 1 mm U50,488H for 60 min and, after extensive washing, membranes were prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride and 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate) (33Zhu J. Luo L.Y. Mao G.F. Ashby B. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). CHO receptor cells transiently transfected with HA-GEC1, GEC1, HA-GEC1-(38–117), or the vector were transferred into 12-well plates ∼20 h after transfection and cultured overnight. For internalization, CHO-sFLAG-hKOR cells were treated with vehicle or 1 μm U50,488H for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and lifted off plates. Cell-surface FLAG-hKOR, FLAG-mDOR, and FLAG-hKOR Ct-345 were labeled with M1 anti-FLAG antibody (1 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), and HA-rMOR was labeled with HA.11 anti-HA antibody followed by Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml, Molecular Probes). Immunoreactivity of cell-surface receptor was quantitated by fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to our published procedure (34Li J.G. Zhang F. Jin X.L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This experiment was performed according to a procedure modified from that of Petäjä-Repo et al. (35Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

Briefly, the CHO-sFLAG-hKOR cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, sonicated, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min. Pelleted crude membranes were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer/1 mm EGTA/10 mm leupeptin (pH7.4) and stored at -80 °C. Thawed membranes were washed with lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm 1,10-phenantroline, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamidine) and pelleted by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 0.5% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (w/v) at 1 mg of membrane protein/ml for 60 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with Endo H (Roche Applied Science) at a final concentration of 100 milliunits/ml at 37 °C for 16 h, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting of FLAG-hKOR was performed as described above. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-sFLAG-hKOR cells in growth phase were subcultured into 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well and allowed to grow in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mg of G418/ml) for 24 h.

https://openalex.org/W2062173898,"Recombinant human βig-h3 was found to bind 125I-labeled small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs), biglycan, and decorin, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In each instance the binding could be blocked by an excess of the unlabeled proteoglycan, confirming the specificity of the interaction. Scatchard analysis showed that biglycan bound βig-h3 more avidly than decorin with Kd values estimated as 5.88 × 10–8 and 1.02 × 10–7 m, respectively. In reciprocal blocking experiments both proteoglycans inhibited the others binding to βig-h3 indicating that they may share the same binding site or that the two binding sites are in close proximity on the βig-h3 molecule. Since βig-h3 and the SLRPs are known to be associated with the amino-terminal region of collagen VI in tissue microfibrils, the effects of including collagen VI in the incubations were investigated. Co-immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled biglycan incubated with equimolar mixtures of βig-h3 and pepsin-collagen VI was increased 6-fold over βig-h3 alone and 3-fold over collagen VI alone. Similar increases were also observed for decorin. The findings indicate that βig-h3 participates in a ternary complex with collagen VI and SLRPs. Static light scattering techniques were used to show that βig-h3 rapidly forms very high molecular weight complexes with both native and pepsin-collagen VI, either alone or with the SLRPs. Indeed βig-h3 was shown to form a complex with collagen VI and biglycan, which appeared to be much more extensive than that formed by βig-h3 with collagen VI and decorin or those formed between the collagen and βig-h3, biglycan, or decorin alone. Biglycan core protein was shown to inhibit the extent of complexing of βig-h3 with native and pepsin-collagen VI suggesting that the glycosaminoglycan side chains of the proteoglycan were important for the formation of the large ternary complexes. Further studies showed that the direct interaction between βig-h3 and biglycan and between biglycan and collagen VI were also important for the formation of these complexes. The globular domains of collagen VI also appeared to have an influence on the interaction of the three components. Overall the results indicate that βig-h3 can differentially modulate the aggregation of collagen VI with biglycan and decorin. Thus this interplay is likely to be important in tissues such as cornea where such complexes are considered to occur.

To elucidate the function of βig-h3 within the extracellular matrix, studies in our laboratory have focused on the localization, molecular forms, and matrix interactions of βig-h3 within various tissues.

Birk D. Mecham R.P. Academic Press, New York1994: 207-242Crossref Google Scholar). In some tissues collagen VI appears to form additional structures including thicker cross-banded fibrils and hexagonal networks (28Bruns R.R. Press W. Engvall E. Timpl R. Gross J. J.

The precise functions of collagen VI are unclear but the protein is considered to be important for tissue architecture, interlinking structural components of the matrix, and for cell-matrix interactions (27Timpl R. Chu M-L. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure.in: Yurchenko P.D. Birk D. Mecham R.P. Academic Press, New York1994: 207-242Crossref Google Scholar). Mutations in collagen VI genes (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) have recently been linked to the muscle wasting diseases, Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich dystrophy (30Jobsis G.J. Keizers H.

To define the relationship of βig-h3 with collagen VI we have isolated collagen VI microfibrils from collagenase-treated nuchal ligament and demonstrated that βig-h3 is covalently attached to collagen VI at regular intervals along at least some of the microfibrils (32Hanssen E. Reinboth B. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24334-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The binding site is located close to the amino-terminal end of the collagen VI molecule. Additional binding assays have demonstrated that βig-h3 binds in vitro to collagen VI, but in a non-covalent manner (32Hanssen E. Reinboth B. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24334-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The βig-h3 attachment site on collagen VI appears to be close to those documented for the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRP), decorin and biglycan, and matrilins (33Wiberg C. Hedbom E.

SLRPs, in particular biglycan, have been shown to influence the aggregation and organization of collagen VI into networks in vitro, mimicking those found in some tissues, particularly cornea (28Bruns R.R. Press W. Engvall E. Timpl R. Gross J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 34Wiberg C. Heinegard D. Wenglen C. Timpl R. Morgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49120-49126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the influence of rβig-h3 on collagen VI aggregation and its interactions with decorin and biglycan in vitro. We have shown that rβig-h3 directly binds to biglycan and decorin and in turn forms ternary complexes with collagen VI and these SLRPs. Furthermore, rβig-h3 promotes the rapid aggregation of collagen VI tetramers into very large assemblies in vitro and differentially influences the aggregation of the collagen with the two SLRPs. The findings indicate that βig-h3 is likely to be involved in the modulation of collagen VI-proteoglycan interactions during development of a range of tissues including cornea. It is possible that disruption of the normal interactions of βig-h3 with collagen VI and/or SLRPs may be important for the development of βig-h3-linked corneal dystrophies. Materials—Biglycan and decorin were purified from the nuchal ligaments of 230-day-old fetal calves as described previously (36Reinboth B. Hanssen E. Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3950-3957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Human rβig-h3 and pepsin-treated collagen VI were prepared and purified as described previously (32Hanssen E. Reinboth B. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24334-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11149-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified rβig-h3 was stored at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl to prevent self-aggregation prior to aggregation experiments. Native collagen VI was purified from fetal bovine skeletal muscle. The frozen tissue was crushed and extracted at 4 °C for 18 h in 5 volumes of TBS, pH 7.4, containing proteinase inhibitors and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The non-solubilized material was then extracted extensively over 48 h with 0.6 m KCl, containing inhibitors (5 × 10 volumes) to solubilize cytoskeletal proteins. The residue was rinsed with collagenase buffer (32Hanssen E. Reinboth B. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24334-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and digested sequentially with highly purified bacterial collagenase (7500 units/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h and then hyaluronidase (200 units/ml) for a further 24 h. The supernatant was subjected at 4 °C to CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation at 30,000 rpm (g = 193,000), with initial density of 1.325 g/ml, for 72 h in a fixed angle head (70.1 Ti) in a Beckman L7-55 ultracentrifuge. The fractions containing collagen VI microfibrils were pooled and purified further on a second CsCl gradient with initial density of 1.27 g/ml. Fractions containing collagen VI microfibrils were dialyzed into TBS, pH 7.4, containing 400 mm NaCl, and final purification was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 6 column (1.5 × 25 cm). Proteinase inhibitors were included throughout the purification process. Purified native and pepsin-collagen VI were depolymerized by dialysis into 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0 (34Wiberg C. Heinegard D. Wenglen C. Timpl R. Morgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49120-49126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Any remaining aggregates were removed from the tetramers by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies to βig-h3 and type VI collagen have been described previously (32Hanssen E. Reinboth B. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24334-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11149-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-His5 antibody was purchased from Qiagen. Chondroitinase ABC was purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Iodination of Biglycan and Decorin—Biglycan and decorin (100 μg) were radiolabeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce). Each proteoglycan was reacted with an IODO-BEAD and 0.75 mCi of 125I for 5 min in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m guanidinium chloride. Bound and free radiolabels were separated by gel filtration through Sephadex G-10. The specific activities of biglycan and decorin were both 3.4 × 106 dpm/μg of core protein unless stated otherwise. Core proteins of biglycan and decorin were prepared by digestion of the 125I-labeled proteoglycans with chondroitinase ABC as described previously (36Reinboth B. Hanssen E. Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3950-3957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (35Wiberg C. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Paulsson M. Bateman J.F. Heinegard D. Morgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37698-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, the test protein (1 μg of rβig-h3 or 2 μg of collagen VI) was incubated with 7 × 104 dpm of 125I-labeled biglycan or decorin for 4 h at 37°C in 50 μl of TBS (10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and protease inhibitors, EDTA (2 mm), benzamidine (1 mm), ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid (1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm)) containing 2 μg of BSA. Control incubations contained no test protein. Specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum (10 μl) raised to the test protein was then added and incubation was continued for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. To ensure full recovery of the immunoprecipitate, protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) was added and incubation was continued for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The immunoprecipitate-protein A-Sepharose complex was recovered by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in 100 μl of TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The complex was washed by centrifugation three times through 200 μl of 1 m sucrose in TBS/Tween. The bound 125I-proteoglycan was eluted from the complex by resuspension in non-reduced electrophoresis buffer (30 μl) and heating to 100 °C for 2 min. Each sample was centrifuged to remove the Sepharose beads and then β-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 2%. The samples were reheated for 2 min to reduce disulfide bonds and then analyzed for 125I-labeled proteoglycan content by γ counting and SDS-PAGE/autoradiography as described previously (36Reinboth B. Hanssen E. Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3950-3957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Each co-immunoprecipitation was performed in triplicate. The protocol was slightly modified for estimation of Kd values, see Fig. 2 for details. Static Light Scattering Analysis of Collagen VI Aggregation—An argon laser (Lexel model 95, Lexel Laser Inc.) was operated at a wavelength of 488 nm with an output power of 300 milliwatts. Light was focused into a sample cell containing a solution of the test macromolecules. The sample cell was maintained at 15 °C by a temperature controller (Endocal model RTE-5DD, Neslab Instruments). The light scattered by the sample was detected at a scattering angle of 90°. Scattered light was detected by the single photon-counting photomultiplier tube (model EMI 9863B/350) with an aperture setting of 800 μm. The output pulses from the photomultiplier were passed through an amplifier discriminator to a digital correlator (model BI-2030AT, Brookhaven Instruments Inc.). The correlator was set to run continuously with a sample time of 1 μs and displayed the average count rate that was recorded every 30 s. Each experiment was commenced by mixing native or pepsin-collagen VI tetramers (120 nm) with rβig-h3 (120 nm) and/or a proteoglycan (biglycan or decorin (480 nm)) in TBS, directly in the cell. Analysis of Collagen VI-containing Aggregates by SDS-PAGE—Pepsin-treated and native collagen VI samples were incubated in TBS containing ovalbumin (120 nm) at 4 °C for 4 h with rβig-h3 only or with rβig-h3 plus biglycan or decorin at the concentrations indicated above. The samples were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatants were removed. The pellets were rinsed with TBS and dissolved in electrophoresis buffer. The proteins in the supernatants were recovered by acetone precipitation and dissolved in electrophoresis buffer using previously described methods (37Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11149-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitated and non-precipitated protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and Coomassie Blue staining. βig-h3 Binds to Biglycan and Decorin via Their Core Proteins—Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using 125I-labeled biglycan and decorin to determine whether βig-h3 directly binds one or both of these proteoglycans. Both biglycan and decorin were found to specifically co-precipitate with rβig-h3 indicating molecular interactions with the protein (Fig. 1). When the binding experiments were repeated with isolated core proteins from the two proteoglycans, each core protein co-precipitated showing that the βig-h3 binding sites were contained within the core proteins and not in the GAG side chains. Gel and autoradiographic analysis of the co-precipitates confirmed that the precipitated radioactivity was associated with intact proteoglycans or, where appropriate, the isolated cores. Because the specific activities of the two proteoglycans and their cores were matched, comparison between the relative extent of binding could be made. Biglycan was precipitated to a greater extent than decorin suggesting that the former may have a higher affinity for βig-h3. In contrast, the two core proteins were precipitated to an equal extent suggesting that their affinities for βig-h3 were of similar magnitude. Because both cores were precipitated to a greater extent than the intact proteoglycans the results suggest that the interactions were inhibited to some degree by the GAG side chains. However, this could not explain the differences in the extent of βig-h3 binding between the intact proteoglycans, because biglycan has a greater glycosaminoglycan content with two GAG side chains compared with one in decorin. Further immunoprecipitation experiments were performed over a range of proteoglycan concentrations that allowed Kd values to be estimated for the interactions of βig-h3 with decorin and biglycan (Fig. 2). Scatchard analyses estimated the Kd values for βig-h3 binding to decorin and biglycan as 1.02 × 10–7 and 5.88 × 10–8 m, respectively. This result confirms that biglycan binds βig-h3 more strongly than decorin. Blocking experiments were performed to confirm the specificity of the interactions and to determine whether the two proteoglycans compete for binding to βig-h3 (Fig. 3, A and B). Preincubation of rβig-h3 with excess unlabeled biglycan completely blocked the subsequent binding of radiolabeled biglycan and decorin. Similarly unlabeled decorin blocked the binding of radiolabeled decorin and biglycan to the rβig-h3. The result indicates that biglycan and decorin either share the same binding site on βig-h3 or that the sites are in close proximity such that the binding of one proteoglycan prevents the subsequent binding of the other. The binding activities were also completely blocked by both biglycan and decorin core proteins, indicating that the GAG side chains of the proteoglycans did not contribute measurably to the interaction of the intact proteoglycans with βig-h3 (Fig. 3, C and D). βig-h3 Enhances the Binding of Biglycan and Decorin to Collagen VI—The co-immunoprecipitation experiments were extended to include collagen VI in its subunit tetrameric form (27Timpl R. Chu M-L. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure.in: Yurchenko P.D. Birk D. Mecham R.P. Academic Press, New York1994: 207-242Crossref Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 4. The co-immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled biglycan in the presence of equimolar mixtures of rβig-h3 and collagen VI was increased 6-fold over rβig-h3 alone (Fig. 4A) and 3-fold over collagen VI alone (Fig. 4B). Similarly co-immunoprecipitation of decorin with the rβig-h3/collagen VI mixture was increased 5-fold over rβig-h3 alone (Fig. 4C) and 3-fold over collagen VI alone (Fig. 4D). The amount of each proteoglycan precipitated with the rβig-h3/collagen VI mixture was similar when either anti-βig-h3 antibody and or anti-collagen VI antibody was used. Thus it appears that βig-h3 enhances the complexing of both proteoglycans to collagen VI and that it participates in a ternary complex in which it interacts directly with both the collagen VI and proteoglycan molecules. βig-h3 Rapidly Complexes with Collagen VI Tetramers in Vitro to Form Very Large Aggregates—Since βig-h3 was found to enhance the interaction of collagen VI with biglycan and decorin, its effect on collagen VI aggregation was investigated in the absence and presence of each proteoglycan. The process of collagen VI aggregation was measured by static light scattering experiments. The direct effect of βig-h3 on aggregation of collagen VI tetrameric subunits is shown in Fig. 5. βig-h3 was shown to cause the rapid aggregation of the pepsin-collagen VI tetramers into very high molecular weight complexes (Fig. 5A). As measured by the light scattering, the process appeared to be ess"

The use of regulatory systems to sense and respond to changing environmental conditions is an intrinsic feature that enables bacteria to survive and adapt to a variety of external challenges. Two-component signaling (TCS) 2The abbreviations used are: TCS, two-component signaling; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SAXS, small x-ray angle scattering; r.m.s., root mean square; r.m.s.d., r.m.s. deviation. 2The abbreviations used are: TCS, two-component signaling; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SAXS, small x-ray angle scattering; r.m.s., root mean square; r.m.s.d., r.m.s. deviation. systems are the principle mechanism used by bacteria to perform this task (1Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). A typical TCS consists of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator (RR). Histidine kinases are usually membrane-anchored proteins with a characteristic core consisting of a histidine-containing dimerization domain and a catalytic domain. In response to extracellular, and in a few cases, intracellular, conditions, the histidine kinase autophosphorylates at a histidine residue, usually in the dimerization domain, by phosphotransfer from the catalytic (ATPase) domain of the adjacent protomer. It then acts as a phosphodonor to a universally conserved aspartic acid residue in the response regulator. RRs typically consist of two domains with the N-terminal (receiver) domain being the phosphoacceptor domain and the C-terminal domain being the effector. The effector domain is, in most cases, DNA binding and is involved in transcriptional regulation of the genes necessary to respond to the sensed environment. Phosphorylation of the aspartic acid residue located in the receiver domain activates the effector domain in a manner that is still incompletely understood, not least because there is little structural information on full-length response regulators and no structural information on activated full-length (i.e. multidomain) response regulators. TCSs have been identified as potential antibacterial targets because they play a key role in controlling cellular processes (2Barret J.F. Hoch J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1529-1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of these systems in higher eukaryotes makes them potentially selective and unique antibacterial drug targets, There is, however, little biochemical information available on the TCSs of pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtB). The H37Rv strain of MtB has 12 putative TCSs including the recently discovered Rv3220-Rv1626 pair (3Morth J.P. Gosmann S. Nowak E. Tucker P.A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4145-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as well as five putative orphan response regulator and sensor kinase proteins. The PrrA-PrrB pair (Genome locii Rv0903c-Rv0902c) is one of five TCS gene pairs conserved in all mycobacterial species (4Tyaga J.S. Sharma D. Curr. Sci. (Bangalore). 2004; 86: 93-102Google Scholar) and can consequently be assumed to play (a) fundamental role(s) in mycobacteria. The function and signals sensed by TCS proteins in M. tuberculosis are still poorly characterized despite their apparent importance, although some initial findings have been made (5Betts J.C. Lukey P.T. Robb L.C. McAdam R.A. Duncan K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 6Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K.

The PrrA-PrrB TCS has been implicated in the early intracellular multiplication of M. tuberculosis (9Ewann F. Jackson M. Pethe K. Cooper A. Mielcarek N. Ensergueix D. Gicquel B. Locht C. Supply P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2256-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Ewann F. Locht C. Supply P. Microbiology (Reading). 2004; 150: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cDNAs corresponding to co-transcripts from the PrrA-PrrB locus have been recovered from MtB cultured in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages but not from cells cultured in standard laboratory medium, indicating that the genes are transcribed in response to host-cell interaction (11Graham E.J. Clark-Curtiss E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11554-11559Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus the ability to survive within a host cell makes these TCS proteins prime targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. Response regulators all contain structurally similar N-terminal domains with a β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-α3-β4-α4-β5-α5 topology that contains the conserved phosphorylation site. They can be subdivided into families depending upon the expected structure of the C-terminal, or effector, domain. The three families, which can also have subdivisions, are named after representative proteins, namely OmpR/PhoB, NarL/FixJ, and NtrC/DctD. The first two classes are σ70-dependent activators, whereas the last family consist of σ54-dependent activators and contains an additional central ATPase domain necessary for open complex formation of the RNA polymerase. The RR studied here (PrrA) belongs to the OmpR/PhoB family. OmpR and PhoB are members of the wingedhelix-turn-helix family of DNA-binding proteins (12Brennan R.G. Cell. 1993; 74: 773-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). There are, however, important structural differences between OmpR and PhoB, for example, in the length of interdomain linker and in the transactivation loop that proceeds the DNA recognition helix (13Okamura H. Hanaoka S. Nagadoi A. Makino K. Nishimura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Structural studies investigating individual receiver domains of response regulators in their active and inactive forms provide some information about conformational changes occurring upon phosphorylation, but how this change is transmitted to activate the C-terminal effector domain is, in most cases, still a mystery. This is because structural information is much more limited in the case of intact proteins and totally absent on full-length proteins in the activated form. Consequently, there is a paucity of knowledge about interactions between the regulatory and effector domains. At the time of writing, there are only five structures available on full-length RRs in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Two of them, DrrB (14Robinson V.L. Wu T. Stock A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4186-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and DrrD (15Buckler D.R. Zhou Y. Stock A.M. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), belong to the OmpR/PhoB subfamily and were crystallized from Thermatoga maritima. Although it is often the case that proteins from thermophilic bacteria are more amenable to crystallization than their mesophilic counterparts (15Buckler D.R. Zhou Y. Stock A.M. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we present here the structure of PrrA from M. tuberculosis. We show that although in the crystal it exhibits a compact conformation, inhibitory for DNA binding, in solution, there is probably a percentage of a more open conformation that would be more favorable for DNA binding. The PrrA gene (genomic location tag Rv0903c) was cloned by PCR from genomic M. tuberculosis (H37Rv strain) DNA. DNA flanking primers 5′-TATACCATGGGCGGCATGGACACTGGTGTG-3′ and 5′-GATTATCACTGCA TACGCAGCACGAATCCG-3′were engineered to provide melting temperatures of ∼65 °C with extensions encoding NcoI and XhoI restriction sites and ligated with T4 DNA ligase into a pETM11 (EMBL) expression vector with an N-terminal His6 tag and a recognition sequence for tobacco etch virus protease. Following sequence confirmation, the plasmid was transformed into Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.7 and grown for 5 h at 25 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5 (buffer A), and two protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was spun down and loaded onto a 5-ml nickel (HiTrap) column equilibrated in buffer A. The protein was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 10-300 mm imidazole in buffer A. The fractions containing PrrA were pooled and diluted to a final imidazole concentration of 50 mm. The protein was then mixed with tobacco etch virus protease in a 1:20 ratio and left at 4 °C overnight to cleave the His6 tag. The digested protein (which has an additional Gly and Ala at the N terminus resulting from the cloning procedure) was applied to the HiTrap column equilibrated in buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. The flow-through fractions were collected, concentrated to a final volume of 5 ml, and further purified on HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 equilibrated in 20 mm Tris·HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5 (buffer B). The peak fractions were concentrated using a 10-kDa cut-off centricon (Vivaspin) to a concentration of 12 mg/ml as measured by Bradford's assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal.

Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Initial crystallization conditions were identified using the sparse matrix Cryo screen from Hampton Research. Following optimization, the best crystals were obtained after 1 week by hanging drop vapor diffusion, in which 2 μl of protein were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir buffer, containing 130 mm calcium acetate, 15% polyethylene glycol 8000, 20% glycerol, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate at pH 6.5. To obtain crystals containing Mg2+ in the active site, we substituted calcium acetate by magnesium acetate in the crystallization buffer. The crystals grew as intertwined clusters, making it necessary to break them to obtain single crystal fragments. For data collection, crystals were directly transferred from the drop and flashed-cooled to 100 K in the cold gas stream. Measurements were carried out on the X11 and X13 EMBL beam lines at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) Hamburg using a MAR165 mm CCD detector. Diffraction images were processed using DENZO, and the intensities were scaled and reduced using SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The sequence with accession code Q10531 was used for homology modeling with the SWISS-PROT server, which is based on an automated comparative protein modeling (19Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). The resulting model was derived from the PDB entries 1KGS (15Buckler D.R. Zhou Y. Stock A.M. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), 1MVO (20Birck C. Chen Y. Hulett F.M. Samama J-P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), 1NXW, 1NXV, and 1NXP (21Bent C.J. Isaacs N.W. Mitchell T.J. Riboldi-Tunnicliffe A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2872-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains of the homology model were placed in two coordinate files containing residues 7-119 and 138-223, respectively. Residues 120-137 were omitted on the assumption that the interdomain linker would be flexible. The model of the N-terminal domain was used initially as the search model for molecular replacement, with data in the range 10-4 Å used in the rotation and translation function searches. Two molecules per asymmetric unit were expected on the basis of the Matthews parameter (22Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar), and consequently, a multiple copy search for the domain was performed using the program MOLREP (23Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar). The R-factor and correlation coefficient for the first domain were 0.56 and 0.20, respectively, which became 0.55 and 0.22, respectively, upon location of the domain in the second molecule. The resultant model containing both N-terminal domains was then fixed, and the C-terminal domain was used as a search model. Again, a multiple copy search was performed for two domains; however, only one was easily found dropping the R-factor to 0.49 and increasing the correlation coefficient 0.43. The C-terminal domain of the second molecule was created based on the relative orientations of the N- and C-terminal domains of the first molecule and the complete solution was checked in molecular modeling program O (24Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) for good packing contacts before proceeding to refinement. The model was then subjected for rigid body refinement in CNS (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), considering each domain as a separate entity. Further positional and B-factor refinement were performed using CNS when the R-factor and Rfree (26Brünger A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 366-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) dropped to 0.43 and 0.47, respectively. At this stage, sigmaa-weighted maps were calculated using the program SIGMAA (27Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), and careful examination of the maps allowed corrections to be incorporated into the model. Finally, the model was used as an initial model for automated model building using the program ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar) against the 1.77 Å data. 96% of the model was correctly built in 10 building cycles. Further refinement was continued using REFMAC5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). The model was iteratively improved by combination of refinement and manual building using Coot (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). In the final stages of refinement, a bulk solvent correction, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, and anisotropic scaling were used in REFMAC. The refinement was monitored throughout using the R-free, which was calculated using 5% of the unique reflections. In the final model of PrrA, complexed with either Ca2+ or Mg2+, two N-terminal residues (Gly and Ala) introduced during the cloning procedure together with the first six residues of the protein are not visible in the electron density and, because they extend into the solvent region, are assumed to be disordered. Other regions with uninterpretable electron density are residues 87-90 of molecule A (PrrA-Ca and PrrA-Mg), Arg-88 of the molecule B (PrrA-Ca and PrrA-Mg), residues Gly-214 and Gly-215 of molecule A (PrrA-Ca), and Gly-215 and Ser-128 of molecule B (PrrA-Mg). The overall geometric quality of the model was assessed using PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). 89.6% and 90.4% of the amino acid residues, for PrrA-Ca and Prra-Mg, respectively, were found in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot with one residue (Val-63) in the disallowed region. The refined coordinates and the structure factors for the PrrA structure complexed with Ca2+ and Mg2+ have been deposited with the RCSB (PDB ID: 1YS6 and 1YS7, respectively). The figures have been produced with Molscript (32Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), CCP4MG, and WebLab Viewer 2.0. SAXS Experiments and Data Analysis—The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected on the X33 camera (33Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instr. and Meth. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 34Boulin C.J. Kempf R Gabriel A. Koch M.H.J. Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A. 1998; 269: 312-320Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) of the EMBL (on the DORIS III storage ring at DESY). Solutions of PrrA were measured at several protein concentrations (from 2 to 13 mg/ml using a MAR345 two-dimensional image plate detector (Marr Research), in the range 0.12 < s < 4.5 nm-1. To check for radiation damage, two successive 2-min exposures were compared, but no radiation effects were observed. The data were averaged after normalization to the intensity of the incident beam, corrected for the detector response, and the scattering of the buffer was subtracted. The difference data were extrapolated to zero solute concentration following standard procedures. The PrrBdependent activation was studied in solutions containing 4 mg/ml PrrA and 0.1 mg/ml PrrBHCD(see Ref. 35Nowak E. Panjikar S. Morth J.P. Jordanova R. Svergun D.I. Tucker P.A. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 14: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar for the nomenclature) with 5 mm Mg2+ and 10 mm ATP. The scattering from the PrrBHCD/Mg2+/ATP solution was then subtracted as background. All data manipulations were performed using the program package PRIMUS (36Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration Rg were evaluated by the Guinier approximation (37Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-231Google Scholar) and by using the indirect transform package GNOM (38Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2875) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the solutes were evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (molecular mass = 66 kDa) and were compatible with monomeric PrrA in solution. The scattering from the high resolution models was calculated using the program CRYSOL (39Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2688) Google Scholar) Given the atomic coordinates, the program fits the experimental intensity I(s) by adjusting the excluded volume of the particle and the contrast of the hydration layer surrounding the particle in solution to minimize the discrepancy χ2=1N-1∑jIexp(sj)-clcalc(sj)σ(sj)2(Eq. 1) where N is the number of experimental points, Iexp(s), Icalc(s), and σ(sj) are the experimental and calculated intensity and the experimental error at the momentum transfer sj, respectively, and c is a scaling factor. Rigid body modeling of PrrA was done by freely rotating its C-terminal domain around the residue Ser-128 and computing the fits to the experimental data with CRYSOL. The volume fractions of the component in the mixtures best fitting the small x-ray angle scattering (SAXS) data from inactivated and activated PrrA were evaluated using the computed scattering curves from crystallographic models of PrrA, DrrB, and DrrD by the program OLIGOMER (36Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). PrrA crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the protein was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 1.77 Å resolution when complexed with Ca2+(referred to as PrrA-Ca) and at 1.58 Å resolution when complexed with Mg2+ (referred to as PrrA-Mg). The structure of molecule B from PrrA-Mg is shown in Fig. 1, which shows the N-terminal receiver domain and C-terminal effector domain connected by a linker region. The receiver domain has the expected (α/β)5 topology, with five parallel strands β2-β1-β3-β4-β5 forming the hydrophobic core surrounded by two helices (α1 and α5) on one side and three (α2-α4) on the other. The C-terminal domain has a wingedhelix fold and is composed of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet followed by a three-helix bundle and a C-terminal β-hairpin. The two domains are connected by a long, well ordered linker between α5 and β6 and pack together, forming an extensive buried interface. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.56 Å (for 204 Cα atoms). The largest difference is observed in the linker region (Fig. 2) and the region containing the α4 helix, which have r.m.s.d. values of 8.0 and 8.8 Å, respectively.FIGURE 2A stereo schematic showing the superimposition of the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of PrrA-Ca. Molecule A is colored red, and molecule B is colored blue. Differences between the calcium- and magnesium-bound structures are small, and details are described under “Results and Discussion.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Receiver Domain—The active site of PrrA is defined by a crevice formed by loops β1-α1 and β3-α3 and contains all residues essential for phosphorylation. These are Asp-14, Asp-15, Asp-58, and Lys-108 (Fig. 3). In some response regulators, Asp-14 is replaced by glutamate. Bacterial response regulators are phosphorylated by the cognate sensor kinase in a divalent cation-dependent reaction, and divalent ions are usually observed in the catalytic site. Ca2+ and Mg2+ metal (depending on crystallization conditions) ions were found in the Asp-15/Asp-58 pocket (Fig. 3B). Both ions exhibit octahedral coordination, interacting in the same way with the carboxylate groups of Asp-15 and Asp-58 as well as the carbonyl oxygen of Asn-60. The three remaining coordination sites are occupied by water molecules. The distances between Ca2+ and Mg2+ and their coordinating atoms lie in the ranges 2.20-2.54 and 1.96-2.14 Å, respectively, in good agreement with equivalent distances in other protein structures (40Gouet P. Fabry B. Guillet. V. Brick C. Mourey L. Kahn D. Samama J.P. Structure (Camb.). 1999; 7: 1517-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The amino group of conserved Lys-108 forms a salt bridge to the carboxylate groups of Asp-58 (2.9-3.1 Å) and Asp-14 (2.6-2.8 Å). Asp-14 is not directly involved in coordinating the metal ion but forms a strong hydrogen bond to a water molecule of the octahedral metal coordination sphere. Similar coordination of the metal ion has been observed for CheY (41Bellsolell L. Prieto J. Serrano L. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The electron density for the region of the protein surrounding the metal coordination site is mostly well defined, in contrast to the case in DivK (42Guillet V. Ohta N. Cabantous S. Newton A. Samama J-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42003-42010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), where a destabilizing effect on the protein structure was observed due to metal binding, which resulted in the disordering of the α4-β4 region. The absence of electron density for residues 87-90 in molecule A of the PrrA-Ca structure is unlikely to result from metal binding because the same region in molecule B with metal bound in the active site is well ordered. Ser-86 is one of the residues known to be crucial in signal transduction (43Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although in the other response regulators of the OmpR/PhoB family, it is normally threonine (Fig. 4). This residue has a slightly different environment in each of the crystallographically independent molecules of PrrA, and this environment also differs slightly when comparing the Mg2+ - and Ca2+-containing structures. In molecule A, the carbonyl group of Ser-86 forms a water-mediated interaction with the main chain nitrogen of Lys-108, whereas in molecule B, the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-86 and main chain nitrogen of Lys-108 are directly hydrogen-bonded (2.7 Å). In addition, for molecule B, the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-86 makes a salt-bridge interaction with the side chain of Arg-94 in both PrrA-Mg and PrrA-Ca. In molecule A of PrrA-Mg, the serine hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Ala-96, whereas the region around Ser-86 in molecule A of PrrA-Ca is not well ordered and is not discussed further. The side chain of the highly conserved Tyr-105, which is another key residue in signal transduction (44Zhu X. Rebello J. Matsumura P. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5000-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), forms a very strong hydrogen bond with the side-chain oxygen of Asn-198 (2.2-2.5 Å) in molecule A of PrrA-Ca and PrrA-Mg, as well as in molecule B of PrrA-Ca. The hydroxyl group of Tyr-105 for molecule B of PrrA-Mg hydrogen-bonds the main-chain nitrogen of Asn-198 and the amino group of a Tris molecule. One noticeable difference between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is the length of helix α4, which is"
https://openalex.org/W2060917353,"We have demonstrated previously that phospholemman (PLM), a 15-kDa integral sarcolemmal phosphoprotein, inhibits the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1). In addition, protein kinase A phosphorylates serine 68, whereas protein kinase C phosphorylates both serine 63 and serine 68 of PLM. Using human embryonic kidney 293 cells that are devoid of both endogenous PLM and NCX1, we first demonstrated that the exogenous NCX1 current (INaCa) was increased by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) but not by forskolin. When co-expressed with NCX1, PLM resulted in: (i) decreases in INaCa, (ii) attenuation of the increase in INaCa by PMA, and (iii) additional reduction in INaCa in cells treated with forskolin. Mutating serine 63 to alanine (S63A) preserved the sensitivity of PLM to forskolin in terms of suppression of INaCa, whereas mutating serine 68 to alanine (S68A) abolished the inhibitory effect of PLM on INaCa. Mutating serine 68 to glutamic acid (phosphomimetic) resulted in additional suppression of INaCa as compared with wild-type PLM. These results suggest that PLM phosphorylated at serine 68 inhibited INaCa. The physiological significance of inhibition of NCX1 by phosphorylated PLM was evaluated in PLM-knock-out (KO) mice. When compared with wild-type myocytes, INaCa was significant larger in PLM-KO myocytes. In addition, the PMA-induced increase in INaCa was significantly higher in PLM-KO myocytes. By contrast, forskolin had no effect on INaCa in wild-type myocytes. We conclude that PLM, when phosphorylated at serine 68, inhibits Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the heart.

With the exception of the γ-subunit of Na+-K+-ATPase (FXYD2), all other known members of the FXYD gene family have at least one serine or threonine within the cytoplasmic tail (2Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), indicating potential phosphorylation sites. In particular, PLM (FXYD1) is the only FXYD family member to have a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by PKA (RRXS), PKC (RXXSXR), and NIMA (never in mitosis A) kinase (FRX(S/T)). Indeed PLM has been shown to be phosphorylated by PKA at serine 68 and PKC at both serine 63 and serine 68 (3Waalas S.I. Czernik A.J. Olstad O.K. Sletten K. Walaas O. Biochem.

On phosphorylation of PLM, inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase is relieved. This hypothesis has been given strong support by the observation that the Vmax of sarcolemmal Na+-K+-ATPase is increased 3-fold after acute cardiac ischemia in association with increased PLM phosphorylation by >300% (5Fuller W. Eaton P. Bell J.R. Shattock M.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, Na+ pump current has been demonstrated to directly increase in association with PLM phosphorylation in response to forskolin (6Silverman B.Z. Fuller W. Eaton P. Deng J. Moorman J.R. Cheung J.Y. James A.F. Shattock M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). More recently, comparison of β-adrenergic effects on Na+ pump function between wild-type and PLM-knock-out (KO) myocytes supports the notion that the inhibitory effects of PLM on Na+-K+-ATPase are relieved by phosphorylation (8Despa S.

It is at present not clear whether dissociation of the phosphorylated PLM from Na+-K+-ATPase is required to relieve its inhibition on the Na+ pump (5Fuller W. Eaton P. Bell J.R. Shattock M.J.

With respect to the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of PLM inhibits Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity (9Zhang X.Q. Qureshi A. Song J. Carl L.L. Tian Q.

Ahlers B.A. Qureshi A. Carl L.L. Song J. Tucker A.L. Mounsey J.P. Moorman J.R. Rothblum L.I. Zhang T.S. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1322-H1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The importance of PLM phosphorylation in mediating its modulatory effects on NCX1 was not addressed in these early studies except that serine 68 in PLM was found to be important (15Song J. Zhang X.Q. Ahlers B.A. Carl L.L. Wang J. Rothblum L.I. Stahl R.C. Mounsey J.P. Tucker A.L. Moorman J.R. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2342-H2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that PKC but not PKA activation enhanced INaCa when NCX1 was expressed alone in HEK293 cells. Co-expression of PLM with NCX1 resulted in decreased INaCa in the basal state, an additional decrease in INaCa when stimulated with forskolin, and attenuation of the magnitude of increase in INaCa by PKC activation. Mutating serine 68 to glutamic acid (S68E) enhanced whereas substituting serine 68 with alanine (S68A) abolished the inhibitory effect of PLM on INaCa. Mutating serine 63 to alanine (S63A) preserved the sensitivity of PLM to forskolin in terms of additional inhibition of INaCa. Using a fundamentally different model system of murine cardiac myocytes, we first showed that endogenous INaCa was larger in PLM-KO myocytes when compared with wild-type (WT) myocytes despite similar NCX1 protein levels. PKC but not PKA activation increased INaCa in WT myocytes. PLM-KO myocytes exhibited significantly larger increases in INaCa when stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as compared with WT myocytes. We conclude that PLM, when phosphorylated at serine 68, inhibits cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Construction of PLM Mutants and NCX1 Clones—PLM serine mutants (S63A, S68A, and S68E) were constructed with PLM in pAlter-1 using Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (15Song J. Zhang X.Q. Ahlers B.A. Carl L.L. Wang J. Rothblum L.I. Stahl R.C. Mounsey J.P. Tucker A.L. Moorman J.R. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2342-H2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PLM and its serine mutants were authenticated by DNA sequencing and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pAdTrack-CMV (16He T. Zhou S. da Costa L. Yu L. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). Rat cardiac NCX1 clone in pcDNA3.1(+) was a generous gift from Dr. J. Lytton and subcloned into pAdTrack-CMV as previously described (17Zhang X.Q. Song J. Rothblum L.I. Lun M. Wang X. Ding F. Dunn J. Lytton J. McDermott P.J. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2079-H2088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We chose the pAdTrack shuttle vector because it allowed us to identify successfully transfected HEK293 cells through a separate cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter present on the vector backbone that drives the expression of green fluorescent protein. Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) were cultured and transfected with various combinations of NCX1 and PLM or its mutant clones as described previously (10Ahlers B.A. Zhang X.Q.

Briefly cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. After 24 h, medium was changed, and cells were transfected with 25 μl of Lipofectamine and a total of 3 μg of plasmid DNA/dish: either pAdTrack-CMV alone (3μg), pAdTrack-CMV-NCX1 (1 μg) + pAdTrack-CMV (2 μg), pAdTrack-CMV-NCX1 (1 μg) + pAdTrack-CMV-PLM (1 μg) + pAdTrack-CMV (1 μg), or pAdTrack-CMV-NCX1 (1 μg) + pAdTrack-CMV-PLM serine mutant (1 μg) + pAdTrack-CMV (1 μg). The lipid-DNA complex was left on cells for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 + 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were cultured for an additional 48 h before experiments. For patch-clamp applications, cells were trypsinized at 24 h post-transfection using trypsin-EDTA, transferred to 35-mm dishes containing sterile glass coverslips, and incubated a further 24 h prior to experiments. Transfection according to this protocol routinely yielded 30–50% transfection efficiency. For brevity, HEK293 cells expressing NCX1 alone are referred in the text as NCX1 cells, whereas cells co-expressing NCX1 and PLM or its serine mutants are referred as PLM cells or SnnX cells (where nn is either 63 or 68, and X is either Ala or Glu). Na+/Ca2+ Exchange Current (INaCa) Measurements—Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were performed at 30 °C as described previously (10Ahlers B.A. Zhang X.Q. Moorman J.R. Rothblum L.I. Carl L.L. Song J.

Briefly fire-polished pipettes (tip diameter, 2–3 μm) were filled with a buffered Ca2+ solution containing 100 mm Cs+-glutamate, 7.25 mm Na+-HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 12.75 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm EGTA, and 6 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2. Free Ca2+ in the pipette solution was 205 nm, measured fluorometrically with fura 2. Cells were bathed in an external solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm Na+-HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Verapamil (1 μm), ouabain (1 mm), and niflumic acid (30 μm) were used to block Ca2+, Na+-K+-ATPase, and Cl– currents, respectively. K+ currents were minimized by Cs+ substitution for K+ in both pipette and external solutions. Only cells that fluoresced green (excitation, 380 nm; emission, 510 nm), indicating successful pAdTrack transfection, were selected for current measurements. Membrane potential (Em) was held at the calculated reversal potential of INaCa (–73 mV) for 5 min before stimulation. A descending voltage ramp (from +100 to –120 mV; 500 mV/s) was immediately followed by an ascending voltage ramp (from –120 to +100 mV; 500 mV/s) (Fig. 1A). Membrane currents were measured both before and after addition of 1 mm CdCl2 to the external solution (Fig. 1B). INaCa was defined as the difference current measured during the descending voltage ramp in the absence and presence of Cd2+ (Fig. 1C). To facilitate comparison of NCX1 currents, INaCa of each cell was divided by its whole cell membrane capacitance (Cm) to account for variations in cell sizes. Except as otherwise stated, all results were obtained using these standard solutions. When indicated, PMA (0.1 μm) or forskolin (1 μm) (both dissolved in Me2SO) was added to cells after base-line INaCa was obtained. Repeat INaCa was measured ∼3–5 min after drug addition. In a second series of experiments, the effects of PMA on INaCa were measured under Cl–-free conditions. Pipette solutions consisted of 100 mm Cs+-glutamate, 7.25 mm Na+-HEPES, 1 mm MgSO4, 12.75 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm EGTA, and 6 mm Ca(OH)2, pH 7.2. External solutions contained 130 mm Na+-aspartate, 5 mm Cs+-glutamate, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm Ca(OH)2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm Na+-HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Verapamil, ouabain, and niflumic acid were added to the bath as before. Holding potential was –73 mV. INaCa was defined as the difference current measured during the descending voltage ramp in the absence and presence of Cd2+ (1 mm) or Ni2+ (5 mm). In a third series of experiments, the effects of PMA on INaCa were measured under high [Na+]i conditions. Pipette solutions contained 60 mm Cs+-glutamate, 40 mm Na+-glutamate, 7.25 mm Na+-HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 12.75 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm EGTA, and 6 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2. External solution consisted of 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm Na+-HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and the usual inhibitors. [Ca2+]o was deliberately lowered to 0.2 mm so that the calculated reversal potential of INaCa (–103 mV), and thus the holding potential, was closer to the holding potential of –73 mV used in other experiments. Keeping [Ca2+]o at 5 mm would have resulted in a very negative holding potential of –188 mV. INaCa was defined as the difference current measured during the descending voltage ramp in the absence and presence of Ni2+ (5 mm). Generation of PLM-KO Mice—A mouse line deficient in PLM was generated by replacing exons 3–5 of the PLM gene with lacZ and neomycin resistance genes as described in detail previously (20Jia L.G. Donnet C. Bogaev R.C. Blatt R.J. McKinney C.E. Day K.H. Berr S.S. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. Sweadner K.J. Tucker A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H1982-H1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These mice grow to adulthood and are fertile. Studies were performed using mice backcrossed to a pure congenic C57BL/6 background. Homozygous adult littermates that were 3–6 months old were used in the experiments. Mice were housed in ventilated racks in a barrier facility supervised by the Department of Comparative Medicine at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Standard care was provided to all mice used for experiments. PLM, NCX1, and Calsequestrin Immunoblotting—Mouse left ventricles were excised, rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cut into small pieces. Approximately 60 mg of tissue were suspended in 700 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na+-orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. A Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) was also added to 10 ml of lysis buffer. The tissue was homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer (15–20 strokes) and placed on ice for 15 min before centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was snap frozen with dry ice-ethanol and stored at –80 °C. Proteins in heart homogenates were subjected to 7.5% (NCX1 and calsequestrin) or 12% (PLM) SDS-PAGE under either non-reducing (10 mm N-ethylmaleimide for NCX1 and calsequestrin) or reducing (5% β-mercaptoethanol for PLM) conditions. The fractionated proteins were transferred to ImmunBlot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Primary antibodies used were polyclonal antibody C2Ab (1:10,000) for PLM (21Song J. Zhang X. Carl L. Qureshi A. Rothblum L. Cheung J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H576-H583Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), polyclonal antibody π 11-13 (1:500; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) for NCX1, and rabbit anti-calsequestrin antibody (1:5,000; Swant). The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system. Protein band signal intensities were quantitated by scanning autoradiograms of the blots with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Because calsequestrin expression has been shown to be unchanged during ontogenic development, aging, cardiac hypertrophy, and failing human myocardium (22Hasenfuss G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 279-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used calsequestrin as an internal control for protein loading. Isolation of Murine Myocytes and Measurement of INaCa—Cardiac myocytes were isolated from the septum and left ventricular free wall of WT and PLM-KO mice (25–37 g) according to the protocol of Zhou et al. (23Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly mice were heparinized (1500 units/kg intraperitoneally) and anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The heart was excised, mounted on a steel cannula, and retrograde perfused (100 cm of H2O at 37 °C) with Ca2+-free bicarbonate buffer followed by enzymatic digestion (collagenases B and D and protease XIV) as described previously (23Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated myocytes were plated on laminin-coated glass coverslips in a Petri dish, and the Ca2+ concentration of the buffer was progressively increased from 0.05 to 0.125 to 0.25 to 0.5 mm in three steps (10-min interval for each). The 0.5 mm Ca2+ buffer was then aspirated and replaced with minimal essential medium (Sigma catalogue number M1018) containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (1% penicillin/streptomycin). After 1 h (in 5% CO2 at 37 °C), medium was replaced with fetal bovine serum-free minimal essential medium. Myocytes were used within 2–8 h of isolation. The protocol for heart excision for myocyte isolation was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee. INaCa was measured in isolated murine myocytes with the same protocol and standard solutions used for transfected HEK293 cells except that pipette tip diameter was increased to 4–6 μm, and niflumic acid was decreased to 10 μm. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as means ± S.E. For analysis of a parameter (e.g. INaCa) as a function of group (e.g. NCX1 versus PLM) and voltage, two-way analysis of variance was used to determine statistical significance. For analysis of Cm, Student's t test was used. A commercial software package (JMP, version 4.0.5; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used. In all analyses, p < 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. Effects of PMA or Forskolin on INaCa in HEK293 Cells Expressing NCX1 Alone—We have shown previously that HEK293 cells do not express NCX1 or demonstrate measurable INaCa or Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake (10Ahlers B.A. Zhang X.Q. Moorman J.R. Rothblum L.I. Carl L.L. Song J. Wang J. Geddis L.M. Tucker A.L. Mounsey J.P. Cheung J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19875-19882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When transfected with rat cardiac NCX1, HEK293 cells exhibited characteristic INaCa demonstrating both forward (inward current, 3 Na+ in:1 Ca2+ out) and reverse (outward current, 3 Na+ out:1 Ca2+ in) Na+/Ca2+ exchange (Fig. 2A). In addition, the reversal potential of INaCa was between –70 and –60 mV, close to its theoretical equilibrium potential of –73 mV under our experimental conditions (Fig. 2A). There were no significant (p < 0.76) differences in base-line INaCa measured with either Cd2+ or Ni2+ (data not shown). Treatment with PMA, which activates PKC, resulted in a large increase in INaCa in NCX1 cells (Fig. 2A; p < 0.0001). For example, at +100 mV, PKC stimulation resulted in an ∼120% increase in INaCa. Control experiments performed in Cl–-free solutions demonstrated that the PMA-induced current increase was not due to an increase in Cl– currents (Fig. 2B). In addition, PMA induced large increases in currents whether Cd2+ (∼122% at +100 mV) (Fig. 2B) or Ni2+ (∼81% at +100 mV) (data not shown) was used to define INaCa under Cl–-free conditions. To control for the possibility that the observed PMA-induced INaCa increase was due to small changes in [Na+]i rather than enhancing intrinsic NCX1 activity, experiments were performed in high [Na+]i conditions such that INaCa would not be so sensitive to small changes in [Na+]i. Fig. 2C shows that base-line INaCa was significantly (p < 0.0001) smaller in high [Na+]i and low [Ca2+]o (0.2 mm) when compared with normal [Na+]i and high [Ca2+]o (5 mm) conditions (Fig. 2A), likely due to the 25-fold reduction of [Ca2+]o. However, addition of PMA increased INaCa (∼84% at +100 mV) under high [Na+]i conditions, similar to the observations obtained under lower but more physiological [Na+]i conditions. In contrast to results obtained with PMA stimulation, forskolin treatment did not affect INaCa in NCX1-expressing cells (Fig. 3B; p < 0.64).FIGURE 3Effects of PMA and forskolin on INaCa in transfected HEK293 cells. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with either NCX1 alone (open circles, n = 14) or PLM + NCX1 (open diamonds, n = 15). At 48 h post-transfection, INaCa was measured at 5 mm [Ca2+]o and 30 °C as described in Fig. 1. After base-line INaCa was obtained, PMA (0.1 μm) was added to NCX1 (open squares, n = 8) and PLM + NCX1 (filled triangles, n = 9) cells. Measurement of INaCa was repeated ∼3–5 min after drug addition. B, HEK293 cells were transfected with either NCX1 alone (open circles, n = 14) or PLM + NCX1 (open diamonds, n = 15). At 48 h post-transfection, base-line INaCa was obtained. Forskolin (1 μm) was then added to NCX1 (open squares, n = 4) and PLM + NCX1 (open triangles, n = 7) cells.

PMA treatment of PLM cells resulted in a significant increase in INaCa when compared with unstimulated NCX1 or PLM cells (Fig. 3A; p < 0.0001). However, the magnitude of INaCa increase by PMA was much smaller in PLM cells when compared with NCX1 cells (39 versus 120% at +100 mV). Despite the absence of an effect of forskolin on INaCa in cells expressing NCX1 alone, PKA stimulation in PLM cells resulted in a significant decrease in INaCa compared with unstimulated PLM cells (Fig. 3B; p < 0.0001). For example, at +100 mV, forskolin effected an ∼49% decrease in INaCa in PLM cells (Fig. 3B). Effects of PLM Serine 68 Mutants on INaCa in Transfected HEK293 Cells—Because serine 68 in PLM is the common phosphorylation target for both PKA and PKC, we next investigated the effects of serine 68 mutants on INaCa in cells co-expressing NCX1 and PLM serine 68 mutants. Mutating serine 68 to alanine (S68A) resulted in abolition of the effect of WT PLM on INaCa (Fig. 4A; p < 0.08), consistent with our previous observations (10Ahlers B.A. Zhang X.Q. Moorman J.R.

Treating S68A cells with PMA, instead of increasing INaCa as observed in PLM cells (Fig. 3A), resulted in a modest but significant suppression of INaCa when compared with unstimulated NCX1 cells (Fig. 4A; p < 0.0004). Mutating serine 68 to glutamic acid (S68E) resulted in greater suppression of INaCa"
https://openalex.org/W2142797630,"GAP1IP4BP is a member of the GAP1 family of Ras GTPase-activating proteins (Ras GAPs) that includes GAP1m, CAPRI, and RASAL. Composed of a central Ras GAP domain, surrounded by amino-terminal C2 domains and a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology/Bruton's tyrosine kinase domain, GAP1IP4BP has previously been shown to possess an unexpected GAP activity on the Ras-related protein Rap, besides the predicted Ras GAP activity (Cullen, P. J., Hsuan, J. J., Truong, O., Letcher, A. J., Jackson, T. R., Dawson, A. P., and Irvine, R. F. (1995) Nature 376, 527–530). Here we have shown that GAP1IP4BP is indeed an efficient Ras/Rap GAP, having Kms of 213 and 42 μm and estimated kcats of 48 and 16 s–1 for Ras and Rap, respectively. For this dual activity, regions outside the Ras GAP domain are required, as the isolated domain (residues 291–569) retains a pronounced Ras GAP activity yet has very low activity toward Rap. Interestingly, mutagenesis of the Ras GAP arginine finger, and surrounding residues important in Ras binding, inhibit both Ras and Rap GAP activity of GAP1IP4BP. Although the precise details by which GAP1IP4BP can function as a Rap GAP remain to be determined, these data are consistent with Rap associating with GAP1IP4BP through the Ras-binding site within the Ras GAP domain. Finally, we have established that such dual Ras/Rap GAP activity is not restricted to GAP1IP4BP. Although GAP1m appears to constitute a specific Ras GAP, CAPRI and RASAL display dual activity. For CAPRI, its Rap GAP activity is modulated upon its Ca2+-induced association with the plasma membrane.

J., Hsuan, J. J., Truong, O., Letcher, A. J., Jackson, T. R., Dawson, A. P., and Irvine, R. F. (1995) Nature 376, 527–530). Here we have shown that GAP1IP4BP is indeed an efficient Ras/Rap GAP, having Kms of 213 and 42 μm and estimated kcats of 48 and 16 s–1 for Ras and Rap, respectively. For this dual activity, regions outside the Ras GAP domain are required, as the isolated domain (residues 291–569) retains a pronounced Ras GAP activity yet has very low activity toward Rap. Interestingly, mutagenesis of the Ras GAP arginine finger, and surrounding residues important in Ras binding, inhibit both Ras and Rap GAP activity of GAP1IP4BP. Although the precise details by which GAP1IP4BP can function as a Rap GAP remain to be determined, these data are consistent with Rap associating with GAP1IP4BP through the Ras-binding site within the Ras GAP domain. Finally, we have established that such dual Ras/Rap GAP activity is not restricted to GAP1IP4BP. Although GAP1m appears to constitute a specific Ras GAP, CAPRI and RASAL display dual activity. For CAPRI, its Rap GAP activity is modulated upon its Ca2+-induced association with the plasma membrane. The Ras-like family of small GTPases includes, in addition to the “classic” Ras proteins H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4A and 4B, the Rap proteins Rap1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B (1Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A.

These ubiquitously expressed, evolutionarily conserved proteins couple extracellular signals to various cellular responses through an ability to undergo conformational changes in response to the alternate binding of GDP and GTP. The GDP-bound “off” state and the GTP-bound “on” state recognize distinct effector proteins, thereby allowing these proteins to function as binary molecular switches (1Shields J.M. Pruitt K.

Although Ras is the best known and best studied member of the family, Rap1A and 1B have recently attracted considerable attention (3Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 4Stork P.J.S. Trends Biochem.

J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Rap1 was identified as a protein that could suppress the transformed phenotype of fibroblasts oncogenically transformed by one of the mutated Ras genes, K-ras (7Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). This coupled with Rap1 having an effector domain virtually identical to that of Ras led to a model in which Rap1 was considered to function as an antagonist of Ras by trapping Ras effectors in an inactive complex (4Stork P.J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, recent analysis has suggested that Rap1 may possess more complex biological functions. Active Rap1 has been implicated in several cellular processes, including superoxide formation, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced neurite outgrowth, cell proliferation, integrin-mediated cell adhesion, and secretion (3Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 4Stork P.J.S. Trends Biochem.

J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As with other small GTPases, the extent and duration of Ras and Rap1 signaling is controlled by the interplay between guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 3The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine-nucleotide exchange factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DTE, dithioerythritol; HA, hemagglutinin; EGF, epidermal growth factor. which induce activation by stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which modulate inactivation by enhancing the intrinsic GTPase activity. A wide range of GEFs and GAPs for these GTPases have been identified, and in a few instances the mechanisms by which signals originating from activated cell surface receptors converge on these proteins have been mapped. However, for most Ras-like GEFs and GAPs we have a poor understanding of their regulation (8Donovan S. Shannon K.M. Bollag G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 23-45PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Ras-specific GAPs include p120GAP, NF1, GAP1 proteins, and the SynGAPs (DAB2IP, nGAP, and Syn GAP). Rap1-specific GAPs comprise Rap GAPs I and II, the SPA-1 family (SPA-1, SPAR, SPAL, E6TP1), tuberin, and DOCK4 (Ref. 11Yajnik V. Paulding C. Sordella R. McClatchey A.I. Saito M. Wahrer D.C.R.

Although Rap1 is a close homologue of Ras it does not possess the catalytic glutamine residue that is critical for GTP hydrolysis in all other Ras-like GTPases. The mechanism by which Ras and Rap1 GAPs enhance the GTPase activity of their respective GTPase is therefore distinct. For Ras GAPs a catalytic arginine residue, the arginine finger, is supplied by the GAP molecule into the active site of Ras, thereby stabilizing the transition state of the GTPase reaction and increasing the reaction rate by >1,000-fold (12Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F.

Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Rap1 GAPs are not related to other GAPs and do not employ a catalytic arginine residue (15Brinkmann T. Daumke O. Herbrand U.

Weyand M. Chakrabarti P.P. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2004; 429: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the carboxamide side chain of the asparagine residue has a function similar to the glutamine residue in Ras-like GTPases in stabilizing the relative position of the nucleophilic water and γ-phosphate in the transition complex (17Daumke O. Weyand M. Chakrabarti P.P. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2004; 429: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The GAP1 family, which comprises GAP1m, GAP1IP4BP, CAPRI, and RASAL (18Maekawa M. Iwamatsu S.A. Morishita T. Yokota K. Imai Y. Kohsaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of the Ras GAP domain all of these proteins have been shown to function as Ras GAP, although each is differentially regulated following receptor stimulation (19Cullen P.J.

Surprisingly, however, given that these proteins contain no detectable sequence homology with any known Rap GAP, GAP1IP4BP is also capable of enhancing the GTPase activity of Rap (19Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This protein therefore has dual Ras and Rap GAP activity. In the current study we describe a kinetic characterization of this dual activity and have begun the process of dissecting out the mechanistic details of these activities. In addition, we address whether dual Ras/Rap GAP activity is restricted solely to GAP1IP4BP or is a function conserved within other members of the GAP1 family. Purification of GTP-binding Proteins—C-terminal-truncated Rap1B (Rap1B C′, residue 1–167) was purified from Escherichia coli strain CK600K using the ptac-expression system as described for Ras by Tucker et al. (26Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After lysis in 32 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, the supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 32 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTE. After washing with the same buffer, proteins were eluted using a salt gradient (0–300 mm NaCl) in 32 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTE. Fractions containing Rap1B C′ were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (3 m final concentration). The pellet was resuspended in 64 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTE, 200 μm GDP, 0.4 m NaCl and further purified on a Sephadex 75 gel filtration column. Fractions containing Rap1B C′ were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (10-kDa cut-off). Truncated H-Ras-(1–166) was purified as described before (26Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 27John J. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11792-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of GAP1IP4BP—For stability reasons, full-length wild-type GAP1IP4BP was purified as GST fusion protein GST-GAP1IP4BP, while the mutant full-length GST-GAP1IP4BP-(R371A) and the GAP domain construct GST-GAP1IP4BP-(291–569) was cleaved from GST. Freshly transformed E. coli Rosetta strain was grown in 5 liters of TB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. At A600 ∼0.8, expression was induced by addition of 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 18 °C. After lysis by micro-fluidizer (Microfluidics Corp.) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTE, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the extract was applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4-B (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTE, 50 mm NaCl. Following extensive washes, the protein was eluted with buffer containing 30 mm glutathione (pH 7.5). Protein was concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (30-kDa cut-off), and aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Cleavage of GAP1IP4BP-(R371A) and GAP1IP4BP-(291–569) from GST was performed on the glutathione-Sepharose column with 300–600 units of thrombin (Serva) overnight at 4 °C under continuous circulation (0.5 ml/min). Proteins were eluted with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTE, 50 mm NaCl. GAP1IP4BP-(291–569) was further purified on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTE, 50 mm NaCl. Proteins were concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (15 and 30-kDa cut-off), and aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Full-length constructs cannot be fully purified and contain additional lower molecular mass bands, most probably derived from proteolytic degradation. Nucleotide Exchange—200 μm Rap or Ras in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTE were incubated with 15 mm EDTA, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and 10 mm GTP (stock 100 mm nucleotide in 1 m Tris, pH 7.5) for 60 min at room temperature. Exchange was terminated by the addition of 25 mm MgCl2. The separation of unbound nucleotides and EDTA from Rap-GTP and Ras-GTP was carried out by washing the proteins several times with buffer using an Amicon concentrator (10-kDa cut-off) at 4 °C. Nucleotide exchange was controlled by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Radioactive [γ-32P]GTP-bound Rap1 and Ras were prepared by incubating 1.5 mm GTP-bound protein with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 12 mm EDTA for 30 min on ice. The exchange reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 mm MgCl2. GAP Assay—The GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis of Rap1 and H-Ras was assayed by measuring Pi release using the charcoal method. Briefly, increasing amounts of radioactively labeled Rap-GTP and Ras-GTP were added to fixed concentrations of GAP1IP4BP proteins at 25 °C in standard buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTE, 50 mm NaCl) as described before (15Brinkmann T. Daumke O. Herbrand U. Kuhlmann D. Stege P. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12525-12531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine end points of GTP hydrolysis, all Rap-GTP and Ras-GTP were hydrolyzed by addition of a highly concentrated GAP1IP4BP solution, and a last aliquot was taken. Initial GTP hydrolysis rates were evaluated by linear regression, and Km and kcat were determined by Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Grafit (Erithacus software). GAP Assays of GAP1IP4BP Site-directed Mutants—Full-length GAP1IP4BP mutants L484A, R485Q, K517E, and K534A were isolated as GST fusion proteins, and analysis of the GAP activities of these mutants was performed under first order kinetics as described by Bottomley et al. (28Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The particular GTP-binding protein was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (3000 Ci mmol–1; Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min at 25 °C. GTPase activity was assayed at 25 °C by addition of the various GAP proteins to the loaded GTP-binding protein. After 10 min, activity was stopped by addition of 5 mm silicotungstate, 1 mm H2SO4. The liberated [32P]Pi was extracted with isobutanol/toluene (1/1 v/v), 5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, 2 m H2SO4, and the upper phase was removed for scintillation counting. Ras Pulldown Assays—Glutathione S-transferase fusion of the Ras-GTP-binding domain from Raf-1 (GST-RBD) was purified from BL21(DE3) E. coli cells harboring the plasmid pGEX KG containing the Raf Ras-binding domain (amino acids 1–149). After induction of a bacterial culture (A600 between 0.4 and 0.6) for 3 h at 37°C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the resultant supernatant was stored in aliquots at –80 °C. On the required day, aliquots were thawed prior to incubation with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 before finally being suspended as a 1:1 slurry. This was used immediately in pulldown assays. Here, dishes (100 mm) of CHO-T cells (8 × 105 cells) were transiently transfected by lipofection (GeneJuice; Novagen) with 2.5 μg of H-Ras cDNA and 1 μg of vector control or vector encoding the particular GAP1 protein. The cells were serum starved for 2 h at 37 °Cin serum-free F-12 (HAM; Invitrogen) prior to the experimental procedures. On completion of the manipulation, cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml of benzamidine, 5 μg/ml of aprotinin, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, 5 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml of trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm MgCl2). Nuclear-free supernatants were incubated with GST-RBD on glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm MgCl2. Ras proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting on nitrocellulose filters using pan-Ras antibodies (F132; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were analyzed by volume integration using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (22Lockyer P.J. Kupzig S. Cullen P.J. Curr.

Rap1 Pulldown Assays—For the analysis of active Rap, a glutathione S-transferase fusion of the Rap-GTP-binding domain from RalGDS (GST-RalGDS) was used (29Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. . EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Dishes (100 mm) of CHO-T cells (8 × 105 cells) were transiently co-transfected by lipofection (GeneJuice; Novagen) with 2.5 μg of HA-tagged Rap1A cDNA and 1 μg of vector control or vector encoding the particular GAP1 protein. The cells were serum starved for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free F-12 (HAM) medium 24 h post-transfection prior to stimulation. Cell lysis and Rap1A-GTP pulldown were carried out as described above. Immobilized Rap1A was detected using the HA probe (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were analyzed by volume integration using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) (22Lockyer P.J.

Efficient Ras and Rap GAP Activity Requires Structural Elements beyond the Ras GAP Domain of GAP1IP4BP—To extend the published characterization of the Ras and Rap GAP activity of GAP1IP4BP (19Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 28Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we initially performed a detailed kinetic analysis (Fig. 1). Here, the GAP activity was monitored by following the production of Pi using the charcoal method (15Brinkmann T. Daumke O. Herbrand U. Kuhlmann D. Stege P. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12525-12531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The isolated GAP domain of GAP1IP4BP, residue 291–569, corresponding to the GAP constructs GAP334 and NF1–333 from p120GAP and neurofibromin, respectively, has pronounced Ras GAP activity that, in contrast to those other Ras GAPs, cannot be saturated under the conditions used (Fig. 1, A and B). Using 100 nm GAP1IP4BP-(291–569) and 800 μm Ras-GTP, the kcat of the reaction reaches a value of 8 s–1, which is in the range observed for other Ras GAPs (30Ahmadian M.R. Hoffmann U. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, no stimulation of the Rap GTPase was observed. In the presence of 20 μm GAP domain, however, Rap GAP activity was detected (Fig. 1, C and D) but reached a kcat of only 0.02 s–1 with 800 μm Rap-GTP, indicating that the apparent second order rate constant kcat/Km is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower for the Rap versus the Ras GTPase activation. Inefficient hydrolysis is at least partially due to the absence of a glutamine residue in Rap, because with the Rap-(T61Q) mutant, kcat reached 0.5 s–1, which is only 10-fold lower than that observed with Ras (Fig. 1, A and B).FIGURE 1Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the GAP domain of GAP1IP4BP. A, 100 nm GAP1IP4BP-(291–569) were incubated in standard buffer at 25 °C with increasing concentrations of H-Ras[γ-32P]GTP (•) and Rap1A[γ-32P]GTP (▪). The insert shows the reaction with mutant Rap-(T61Q) (▴) in comparison with wild-type Rap (▪). B, the data from panel A are plotted as kcat in panel B. C and D, 20 μm GAP1IP4BP-(291–569) were used to assay GTP hydrolysis with increasing concentrations of Rap1A[γ-32P]GTP. GTPase activity was monitored by measuring Pi release, and data were evaluated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are plotted as rates (C) or rate constants (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because robust Rap GAP activity has been observed before (19Cullen P.J.

Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and Ras GAP activity is apparently similar to values observed for other Ras GAPs, it became obvious that GAP1IP4BP requires additional domains for efficient Rap GAP activity. Indeed, when we used full-length GST-GAP1IP4BP enriched via GSH-Sepharose, we observed efficient Ras and Rap GAP activity (Fig. 2). Using 5 nm GAP1IP4BP we observed similar maximal rates of 0.24 μmol/s for Ras and only a 3-fold lower rate of 0.08 μmol/s for Rap (Fig. 2A). Although these rates cannot be converted to kcat values due to the degradation products present in the preparation of the full-length protein, kcat was estimated to be 48 s–1 for Ras and 16 s–1 for Rap, indicating very efficient catalysis for both GTPase reactions. Furthermore, full-length protein had a 5-fold lower Km for Rap (42 μm) versus Ras (213 μm). Thus the apparent second order rate constant kcat/Km for the GAP-mediated catalysis, estimated to be between 2.2 and 3.8 × 105 m–1 s–1, is, independent of the exact value, very similar for Ras and Rap. This indicates that the additional domain(s) not only affects the catalytic efficiency of the Rap GAP reaction but also dramatically enhances the affinity toward Rap-GTP. Thus, whereas the isolated Ras GAP domain of GAP1IP4BP is, like other Ras GAPs, sufficient to enhance the GTPase activity of Ras, other regions of the molecule such as the amino-terminal C2 domains and/or the carboxyl-terminal region including the pleckstrin homology/Bruton's tyrosine kinase domain are required for Rap GAP activity. For Ras GAPs it has been shown that the glutamine 61 residue of Ras and the arginine finger of Ras GAPs are the two crucial residues required for efficient GAP-mediated reaction (13Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 14Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Rap does not have a glutamine in position 61 and Rap GAP does not act via a catalytic arginine (17Daumke O. Weyand M. Chakrabarti P.P. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2004; 429: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), so the question arises as to how GAP1IP4BP-mediated Rap GAP activity is achieved. When we analyze the GTPase reaction using the arginine finger mutant of GAP1IP4BP, GAP1IP4BP-(R371A), the RapGAP (and RasGAP, not shown) activity was severely affected (Fig. 2A), arguing that the basic machinery for GAP activation seems to reside in the GAP domain. As with the GAP domain, catalysis is more efficient for the Rap mutant Rap-(T61Q), but the affinity is reduced because the reaction is no longer saturated with 800 μm Rap-GTP (Fig. 2B). Thus, the mechanism for GAP-mediated GTPase activity of GAP1IP4BP seems to be different from both the Ras GAP and the Rap GAP mechanisms. Further Mutations in the GAP1IP4BP GAP Domain—To extend this analysis we generated a series of site-directed mutants targeting residues that lie within the Ras-binding site of the Ras GAP domain and are known to be required for the Ras GAP activity of p120GAP and NF1. Arginine at position 485 in GAP1IP4BP is equivalent to arginine 903 and 1391 in p120GAP and NF-1, respectively, residues that by stabilizing the catalytic position of the arginine finger are vital for GTP hydrolysis on Ras (13Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The arginine finger is also stabilized by leucine 902 and 1390 in p120GAP and NF-1, respectively, equivalent to leucine 484 in GAP1IP4BP. Furthermore, lysine 949 in p120GAP resides within the variable loop that has been proposed to stabilize the α6c helix within the effector loop region of Ras-GTP. This residue is equivalent to lysine 534 of GAP1IP4BP. Finally, lysine 517 in GAP1IP4BP is equivalent to lysine 935, which has been proposed to stabilize the p120GAP/Ras-GTP complex. To examine the role of these residues in the Ras and Rap GAP activity, we introduced the following ind"

Here we report that YlqF participates in the late step of 50 S ribosomal subunit assembly. YlqF was co-fractionated with the 50 S subunit, depending on the presence of noncleavable GTP analog. Moreover, the GTPase activity of YlqF was stimulated specifically by the 50 S subunit in vitro. Dimethyl sulfate footprinting analysis disclosed that YlqF binds to a unique position in 23 S rRNA. Yeast two-hybrid data revealed interactions between YlqF and the B. subtilis L25 protein (Ctc). The interaction was confirmed by the pull-down assay of the purified proteins. Specifically, YlqF is positioned around the A-site and P-site on the 50 S subunit. Proteome analysis of the abnormal 50 S subunits that accumulated in YlqF-depleted cells showed that L16 and L27 proteins, located near the YlqF-binding domain, are missing. Our results collectively indicate that YlqF will organize the late step of 50 S ribosomal subunit assembly.

Our results collectively indicate that YlqF will organize the late step of 50 S ribosomal subunit assembly. The ribosome is the large RNA-protein complex composed of two subunits. In bacteria, the large 50 S subunit is composed of 23 S rRNA, 5 S rRNA, and some 30 additional proteins, whereas the small 30 S subunit is composed of 16 S rRNA and some 20 other proteins. Initially, each rRNA is synthesized as a single large precursor and matures through a series of steps, including endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavage into three rRNA precursors, sequential removal of additional sequences, and nucleotide modifications (1Srivastava A.K. Schlessinger D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 105-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins are assembled on rRNA in parallel with their synthesis and processing to yield the functional ribosomal subunits. In bacteria, functional subunits can be reconstituted from the isolated components in vitro (2Traub P. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 3Dohme K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, this process requires long incubation times, high temperatures, and high ionic conditions, compared with the in vivo situation, suggesting that assembling factors are required for ribosome assembly in vivo. In eukaryotes, more than 100 factors participate in the biogenesis of the ribosome (4Micheline F.R. Bruno S. Cosmin S. Franco F.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), compared with only a few factors identified in bacteria. Depletion of RNA helicases, CsdA and SrmB, leads to slow growth phenotype and accumulation of premature 50 S particles at low temperatures in Escherichia coli (7Charollais J. Pflieger D. Vinh J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2751-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The Obg/Era subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins has been suggested to participate in ribosomal biogenesis. This subfamily comprises a distinct group of small proteins originally characterized in bacteria but later identified in genomes of eukaryote and archea (9Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Many of the bacterial members investigated so far are essential for cell growth (10Lerner C.G. Inouye M. Mol.

Various phenotypic changes are observed in cells depleted of Obg or Era. However, numerous results suggest that the primary function of Obg/Era GTP-binding proteins is related to ribosome biogenesis or translation process, consistent with their evolutionary relationships with translation factors (16Caldon C.E. Yoong P. March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Obg and Era are the most extensively characterized bacterial small GTP-binding proteins belonging to this family. Obg interacts with the 50 S subunit in E. coli and Caulobacter crescentus (17Lin B. Thayer D.A. Maddock J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 186: 481-489Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Wout P. Pu K. Sullivan M. Reese V. Zhou S. Lin B. Maddock J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, Obg cofractionates with the 50 S subunit and specifically interacts with the ribosomal protein, L13 (19Scott J.M. Ju J. Mitchell T. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2771-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, E. coli Era interacts with the 30 S subunit (20Meier T.I. Peery R.B. Jaskunas S.R. Zhao G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5242-5249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sayed A. Matsuyam S. Inouye M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Hang J.Q. Zhao G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4164-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of Era and Obg results in abnormal ribosome profiles in E. coli and C. crescentus, respectively (15Czyz A. Wegrzyn G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2005; 52: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Inoue K. Alsina J. Chen J. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). E. coli Era functionally compensates for deletion of the gene encoding the cold shock adaptation protein RbfA (23Inoue K. Alsina J. Chen J. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is required for efficient processing of 16 S rRNA (24Dammel C.S. Noller H.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 626-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Another essential bacterial small GTP-binding protein, YjeQ, associates with the 30 S subunit in E. coli. Its GTPase activity is specifically enhanced in the presence of 30 S subunit (25Himeno H. Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Kimura T. Takagi K. Sugiyama W. Shirata S. Mikami T. Odagiri F. Osanai Y. Watanabe D.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1381-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the precise actions of GTP-binding proteins on the ribosome remain to be clarified. A recent three-dimensional cryoelectron microscopic map of the Thermus thermophilus 30 S-Era complex (27Sharma M.R. Barat C. Wilson D.N. Booth T.M. Kawazoe M. Hori-Takemoto C. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Fucini P. Agrawal R.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 29: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar) indicates that Era binds within the cleft between the head and platform of the 30 S subunit. The binding site of Era overlaps with that of S1 in E. coli. Moreover, Era binding on the 30 S subunit interferes with binding to the 50 S subunit, suggesting that dissociation of Era and incorporation of S1 comprise the final step of the 30 S subunit assembly and that Era inhibits formation of the translation initiation complex on prematurely assembled 30 S (27Sharma M.R. Barat C. Wilson D.N. Booth T.M. Kawazoe M. Hori-Takemoto C. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Fucini P. Agrawal R.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 29: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In an earlier report, we demonstrated that four additional GTP-binding proteins, YsxC, YlqF, YphC, and YqeH, are indispensable for B. subtilis growth (11Arigoni F. Talabot F. Peitsch M. Edgerton M.D. Meldrum E. Allet E. Fish R. Jamotte T. Curchod M.L. Loferer H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Here we show that B. subtilis YlqF binds to the 50 S subunit, and its GTPase activity in vitro is completely dependent on interactions with the mature 50 S subunit. Using DMS footprint analysis, we mapped the binding site of YlqF on helices 38, 81, and 85 of 23 S rRNA. Finally, L16 and L27, located near the YlqF-binding site on the 50 S subunit at the final stage of assembly, were not detectable in the premature 50 S subunit that accumulated in YlqF-depleted cells. The results collectively indicate that YlqF interacts with the premature 50 S subunit and monitors the completion of ribosomal subunit assembly. Strain—B. subtilis 168 was used as the wild-type strain throughout. B. subtilis TMO208, an IPTG 3The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. -dependent mutant, contains ylqF under the control of the IPTG-dependent spac promoter (11Arigoni F.

Buffer—The following buffers were employed: buffer A, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm (CH3COO)2Mg, 100 mm CH3COONH4, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm PMSF; buffer B, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 15 mm (CH3COO)2Mg, 1 m CH3COONH4, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm PMSF; buffer C, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm (CH3COO)2Mg, 100 mm CH3COONH4,6mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2mm PMSF; binding buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole; washing buffer, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; hybridization buffer, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 30 mm NaCl; PBS buffer, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, pH 7.3; GST elution buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione. Detection of GTP-binding Proteins on the Ribosome Profile—Wild-type B. subtilis cells (168 cells) were grown at 37 °C in LB medium and collected at the exponential phase (A600 = 0.6). The cells were resuspended in buffer A containing GTPγS or GTP or GDP and disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell at 8000 p.s.i. After the removal of cell debris, the supernatant was subjected to 10-40% sucrose density gradient centrifugation for 14 h at 90,000 × g. Sucrose gradients were separated into 18 fractions. During fractionation, absorbance at 254 nm was monitored. YlqF in each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-YlqF antibody, according to a previous method (11Arigoni F. Talabot F. Peitsch M. Edgerton M.D. Meldrum E. Allet E. Fish R. Jamotte T. Curchod M.L. Loferer H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Preparation of Crude Ribosome—B. subtilis 168 cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C, and collected at A600 of 0.6. The cells were resuspended in buffer A and disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell at 8000 p.s.i. After the removal of cell debris, the supernatant was centrifuged for 100 min at 240,000 × g. The precipitate was dissolved in buffer B and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Next, 2-ml aliquots of supernatant were layered onto 2 ml of buffer B containing a 30% (w/v) sucrose bed and centrifuged at 240,000 × g for 3.5 h. The precipitate of ribosome was resuspended in buffer A and stored at -80 °C until use. Preparation of 50 and 30 S Ribosomal Subunits—Crude ribosome was subjected to 10-40% sucrose density gradient centrifugation in buffer C at 90,000 × g for 14 h. Gradients were fractionated, and fractions containing the 50 and 30 S subunits were identified by peaks in absorbance at 260 nm. Magnesium acetate (1 m) was employed to increase the concentration of magnesium ions to 20 mm, and the solution mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol. After incubation for 1 h at -20 °C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of buffer A and stored at -80 °C until use. Purification of YlqF-His6—To express the YlqF with a histidine tag (His6) at the C terminus, the coding sequences of YlqF (from the initiation codon to the C-terminal amino acid codon, except the termination codon) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET29b plasmid (Novagen) to obtain pTM298. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS derivatives (Novagen) containing pTM298 were grown at 30 °C in 500 ml of LB medium, and the His-tagged YlqF was purified according to the pET system protocol (Novagen). When the culture reached A600 of 0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were grown 3 h more and then harvested by centrifugation. The collected cells were washed with binding buffer and resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer. The cells were broken by sonication on ice, and the lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was applied to a Ni2+-NTA resin column (Novagen), and the column was washed with 30 ml of binding buffer followed by 10 ml of washing buffer. YlqF-His6 in the column was eluted with 10 ml of binding buffer containing 60 mm imidazole and then was dialyzed against buffer A. Purified YlqF-His6 was stored at -80 °C after the addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol. Assay of GTPase Activity—The YlqF protein was purified using a procedure described in an earlier report (11Arigoni F. Talabot F. Peitsch M. Edgerton M.D. Meldrum E. Allet E. Fish R. Jamotte T. Curchod M.L. Loferer H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). All of the reactions for assay of GTPase activity were performed at 37 °C, and contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm CH3COONH4, 15 mm (CH3COO)2Mg, 100 μm [γ-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), YlqF, and ribosome and its subunit. The reactions were terminated by the addition of ice-cold water with 6% charcoal. Next, charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation at 10000 × g for 5 min, and the amount of free phosphate released by hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP was determined by Cerenkov counting of the supernatant. Binding of YlqF to the 50 S Ribosomal Subunit—Various concentrations of YlqF were incubated with 0.2 μm 50 S ribosomal subunit in buffer A containing 100 μm GTPγS at 30 °C for 10 min. The mixture was applied to Microcon 100 (Millipore) and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 × g. The microspin column was washed twice with the same buffer by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 12 min. Buffer was added to the filter, and the column was inverted after 1 min of incubation at room temperature. The 50 S subunit-bound YlqF was recovered by centrifugation (1 min, 3,000 × g) of the inverted column, and each concentration of YlqF and 50 S subunit was determined by immunoblotting with anti-YlqF and anti-L3 antibodies, respectively. DMS Modification—The 50 S subunit (8 pmol) was preincubated at 40 °C for 10 min in 25 μl of buffer A. The reaction mixture was added to YlqF (80 pmol) in 50 μl of buffer A containing 100 μm GTPγS and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Chemical modification was initiated by the addition of DMS (1 μl; 1:4 dilution in ethanol), followed by incubation at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were terminated using two volumes of cold ethanol, followed by rapid mixing. The modified 50 S subunit was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1 v/v/v). RNA was precipitated by the addition of 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol and resuspended in buffer A. The position and extent of chemical modification were analyzed by primer extension with reverse transcriptase, followed by gel electrophoresis. Primer Extension—The primers specified in Table 1 were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Bio Inc). Labeled DNA primer (1 μl) (∼0.2 pmol) was added to modified RNA (0.5 pmol) in 20 μl of hybridization buffer. The mixture was heated to 90 °C for 3 min and slowly cooled to 42 °C in 45 min. Reverse transcription was performed for 60 min at 42 °C using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase XL (Takara Bio Inc.). The cDNA product was separated with a sequencing gel (8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea, 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 24 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to an Imaging Plate (Fuji Film) for 16 h. The signals were detected using BAS2500 (Fuji Film).TABLE 1Primers used in primer extension analysisPrimerSequenceLocation in 23 S rRNA (rrnB) of B. subtilisrrnB–R1TTTCAGTTCCCCGGGTCTGCCTTCTC175–200rrnB–R2GAGAACGAAGTTTTGACTACAGGGCT375–400rrnB–R3CATCACCGTTAACGGGCTCTGACTAC575–600rrnB–R4CACTTTTCAACGTGCGTGGGTTCGGG775–800rrnB–R5CACTCGCAGTCTGACTCCCAAGGATA975–1000rrnB–R6TTCGGTGATACGTTTAGCCCCGGTAC1175–1200rrnB–R7GGCCTCGGCTTAGGTCCCGACTAACC1375–1400rrnB–R8ATCAGGAACTTCGCTACTATATTTCG1575–1600rrnB–R9TCGCCTGGGCCTATTCACTGCGGCTC1775–1800rrnB–R10CCTTTCGTGCGGGTCGGAACTTACCC1975–2000rrnB–R11TATCCCACCGATGCCTCCACCGAAGC2175–2200rrnB–R12TCCCTGCTCGACTTGTAGGTCTCGCA2375–2400rrnB–R13TACCGCTTTAATGGGCGAACAGCCCA2575–2600rrnB–R14GGGGGGCTTCATGCTTAGATGCTTTC2775–2800rrnB–R15ATGGTTAAGTCCTCGATCG2908–2927 Open table in a new tab Analysis of the Ribosome Profile in YlqF-depleted Cells—Wild-type cells (168 cells) were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. The cells were collected at the exponential and stationary phases, respectively. An IPTG-dependent mutant of YlqF (TMO208) was grown to the mid-exponential phase at 37 °C in LB with 5 μm IPTG. The cells were resuspended in buffer A and disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell (Aminco) at 8000 p.s.i. After the removal of cell debris, the supernatant was subjected to 10-40% sucrose density gradient centrifugation for 14 h at 90,000 × g. The ribosome profile was monitored with UV at 254 nm. Yeast Two-hybrid System—Yeast strains PJ69-4A (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112ura3-52, his-200, gal4D, gal80D, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, GAL2-ADE2, met2::GAL7-lacZ) and PJ69-4a (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112ura3-52, his-200, gal4D, gal80D, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, GAL2-ADE2, met2::GAL7-lacZ) were kindly provided by Philip James (28James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pGBT9(TRP1)-ylqF and pGAD424(LEU2) harboring genes encoding each ribosomal protein were introduced into PJ69-4A and PJ69-4a, respectively, essentially according to the instructions of Bongiorni (29Bongiorni C. Ishikawa S. Stephenson S. Ogasawara N. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4353-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transformants were mated in the appropriate liquid medium using flat bottom 96-well plates. After mating, the cultures were collected, washed with sterilized water, and spotted on synthetic complete agar plates lacking leucine and tryptophan for selection of LEU2 and TRP1 diploid cells. Next, the cells were cultured in liquid synthetic complete agar lacking leucine and tryptophan medium for 1 day, replicated on selection agar medium lacking histidine, and supplemented with 5 mm 3-aminotrizaole to inhibit autoactivation of the HIS3 reporter gene. Pull-down Assay—To express ribosome protein L25, designated Ctc in B. subtilis, with a histidine tag at the N terminus and YlqF with a GST tag at the N terminus, the coding sequences of Ctc and YlqF were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pDEST17 (Invitrogen) and pDEST15 (Invitrogen) using Gateway-Technology to obtain pD17C and pD15L, respectively. GST was expressed in E. coli using pGEX2T (Novagen). E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS derivatives (Novagen) containing pD17C, pD15L, or pGEX2T were grown at 30 °C in 500 ml of LB medium. His-tagged Ctc was purified using the procedure described in the section on purification of YlqF-His6. The cells expressing GST-YlqF or GST were broken in PBS buffer by sonication on ice, and the lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was applied to a glutathione resin column (Novagen), and the column was washed with 10 ml of PBS buffer. GST-YlqF or GST in the column was eluted with 1 ml of GST elution buffer, and purified GST-YlqF and GST were stored at -80 °C after the addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol. To detect interaction between YlqF and Ctc, purified GST-YlqF and His6-Ctc (1 μm each) were mixed in PBS buffer containing 250 μm GTP and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The mixture was applied to a glutathione resin column, and the column was washed with PBS buffer. The proteins retained in the column was eluted with GST elution buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% gel, followed by silver staining. YlqF Is Specifically Associated with the 50 S Ribosomal Subunit—Era, Obg, and YjeQ interact with ribosomal subunits in various bacteria (17Lin B. Thayer D.A. Maddock J.R. J.

Accordingly, we examined whether the essential GTP-binding proteins (Era, Obg, YsxC, YlqF, YphC, and YqeH) in B. subtilis are associated with the ribosome. The cell lysates were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and GTP-binding proteins in each fraction were identified by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Obg was detected in fractions containing the free 50 S subunit in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS (data not shown), as reported previously (17Lin B. Thayer D.A. Maddock J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 186: 481-489Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Wout P. Pu K. Sullivan M. Reese V. Zhou S. Lin B. Maddock J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition we newly found that YlqF stably co-sedimented with the free 50 S subunit in the presence of GTPγS, but not GTP or GDP (Fig. 1). GTPase Activity of YlqF Is Stimulated by the 50 S Ribosomal Subunit—The GTPase activities of small bacterial GTP-binding proteins may be modulated by interactions with the ribosomal subunit. Recent studies show that the GTPase activity of E. coli YjeQ, which associates with 30 S subunit, is enhanced in the presence of this subunit in vitro (25Himeno H. Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Kimura T. Takagi K. Sugiyama W. Shirata S. Mikami T. Odagiri F. Osanai Y. Watanabe D. Goto S. Kalachnyuk L. Ushida C. Muto A.

Because YlqF bound to the free 50 S subunit, but not 30 S subunit, we next examined the activation of GTPase activity of YlqF by the 50 S subunit. We prepared the 30 and 50 S subunits from B. subtilis cells by differential ultracentrifugation, as described in a previous report (30Nanamiya H. Akanuma G. Natori Y. Murayama R. Kosono S. Kudo T. Kobayashi K. Ogasawara N. Park S.M. Ochi K. Kawamura F. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). YlqF was fused to a histidine tag, expressed in E. coli and purified by the Ni2+-NTA resin column (Fig. 2A), as described in a previous report (11Arigoni F. Talabot F. Peitsch M. Edgerton M.D. Meldrum E. Allet E. Fish R. Jamotte T. Curchod M.L. Loferer H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Consistent with YlqF association with the 50 S subunit, GTPase activity was stimulated in the presence of 50 S subunit, but not 30 S subunit (Fig. 2B). No activity of YlqF with the 50 S subunit-treated RNaseA was observed (Fig. 2B). Our results indicate that 50 S is indispensable for the GTPase activity of YlqF. YlqF Binds Helices 38, 81, and 85 of 23 S rRNA and the L25 Protein on the 50 S Subunit—To further characterize the interaction between YlqF and the 50 S subunit in vitro, a filtration-based binding assay was performed to evaluate the stoichiometry of the YlqF-50 S subunit complex. Upon application to the Microcon 100 column, YlqF without the 50 S subunit passes straight through the filter (data not shown). In contrast, when YlqF was applied to the column in conjunction with the 50 S subunit, the protein was recovered from the reservoir of the column. Recovered YlqF was saturated following the addition of 2-fold excess protein to the 50 S subunit, indicating that two molecules of YlqF bind a 50 S subunit (Fig. 3). DMS footprint analysis was employed to determine the interaction site of YlqF and 23 S rRNA in the 50 S subunit (31Uchiumi T. Sato N. Wada A. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 681-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The 50 S subunit (8 pmol) and YlqF (80 pmol) were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and then chemical modification was initiated by the addition of DMS, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 15 min. Modifications within the whole 23 S rRNA sequence were investigated using a set of 15 DNA primers for extension with reverse transcriptase, as described in Table 1. Binding of YlqF led to protection of C928, C942, A2301, and A2354 (Fig. 4A). According to the three-dimensional structure of the Deinococcus radiodurans 50 S subunit (Protein Data Base code 1NKW) (34Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zaeivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), C928 and C942 in B. subtilis lie in helix 38 (Fig. 4B), which interacts with the elbow of tRNA in the A-site. A2301 and A2354 are present in helix 81 and 85, respectively (Fig. 4C). Helices 81 and 85 are positioned near the L5 protein. The β-hairpin loop of L5 interacts with the elbow of tRNA in the P-site (33Yusupova G.Z. Yusupov M.M. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Cell. 2001; 106: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 34Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zaeivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Based on the data, we propose that YlqF interacts with 23 S rRNA around the A-site and P-site. To examine the possibility of direct binding between YlqF and ribosomal proteins, we analyzed interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system. Fifty nine genes annotated as ribosomal protein gene in the B. subtilis genome sequence (BSORF; bacillus.genome.jp/) were cloned into pGAD424, and their interaction with YlqF cloned into pGBT9 was examined. The results revealed that YlqF interacts with ribosomal L25 protein (designated Ctc in B. subtilis; Fig. 5A), but not with other ribosomal proteins (date not shown). To further confirm the direct interaction between YlqF and L25 (Ctc), we attempted a pull-down assay. We constructed the plasmids expressing GST-YlqF, His6-Ctc, and GST in E. coli and purified them to near homogeneity (Fig. 5B). Then purified GST-YlqF and His6-Ctc were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and applied to a glutathione resin column. Although His6-Ctc itself did not bind to the column, it was retained in the column when incubated with GST-YlqF, but not with GST (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W1970598701,"Streptolysin O (SLO) is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by the important human pathogen, group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes or GAS). In addition to its cytolytic activity, SLO mediates the translocation of GAS NAD-glycohydrolase (NADase) into human epithelial cells in vitro. Production of both NADase and SLO is associated with augmented host cell injury beyond that produced by SLO alone, but the mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity is not known. We have now shown that expression of NADase together with SLO dramatically enhanced the lytic activity of GAS culture supernatants for erythrocytes but had no effect on SLO-mediated poration of synthetic cholesterolrich liposomes. This result revealed a previously unknown contribution of NADase to the cytolytic activity associated with GAS production of SLO. Purified recombinant SLO bound NADase in vitro, supporting a specific, physical interaction of the two proteins. Exposure of human keratinocytes to wild-type GAS, but not to a NADase-deficient mutant strain, resulted in profound depletion of cellular NAD+ and ATP. Furthermore, expression of recombinant GAS NADase in yeast, in the absence of SLO, induced growth arrest, depletion of NAD+ and ATP, and cell death. These findings have provided evidence that the augmentation of SLO-mediated cytotoxicity by NADase is a consequence of depletion of host cell energy stores through the enzymatic action of NADase. Together, the results have provided mechanistic insight into the cytotoxic effects of a unique bipartite bacterial toxin.

Among the secreted products of GAS are streptolysin O (SLO) and NAD-glycohydrolase (NADase). SLO is a member of the pore-forming cytolysin family known as cholesterol-dependent cytolysins due to their ability to bind cholesterol in eukaryotic cell membranes (4Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Infect Immun. 1985; 47: 52-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Palmer M. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Individual toxin molecules oligomerize and insert into the cell membrane to form transmembrane pores up to 30 nm in diameter. Sufficient doses of SLO result in cell lysis (4Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Infect Immun. 1985; 47: 52-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Alouf J.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 11: 661-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Alouf J.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar). Purified SLO is a potent toxin that is lethal within minutes of intravenous injection in animal models, primarily because of cardiotoxicity (8Halpern B.N. Rahman S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968; 32: 441-452Google Scholar, 9Alouf J.E. Raynaud M. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NAD-glycohydrolases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the nicotinamide-ribose bond of NAD+ to yield nicotinamide and adenosine diphosphoribose. These enzymes have been described in several bacterial species and in a variety of eukaryotes (10Everse K.E. Everse J. Simeral L.S. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 11Kim U.H. Kim M.K. Kim J.S. Han M.K. Park B.H. Kim H.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The GAS NADase differs from most other known bacterial NAD-glycohydrolases in that it is secreted instead of being cell-associated and it possesses ADP ribosyl cyclase activity (12Karasawa T. Takasawa S. Yamakawa K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Nakamura S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 201-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Karasawa T. Yamakawa K. Tanaka D. Gyobu Y. Nakamura S.

Thus, in addition to producing adenosine diphosphoribose, the GAS NADase can convert NAD+ to cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose as a side reaction. Cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose is an important second messenger and signaling molecule for the regulation and mobilization of intracellular calcium stores (14Guse A.H. Curr. Mol. Med. (Hilversum). 2004; 4: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Lee H.C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Ziegler M. Jorcke D. Schweiger M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 131: 89-126PubMed Google Scholar). The GAS genes encoding SLO (slo) and NADase (nga) are expressed from an operon that is transcribed under the control of a promoter upstream of nga. Some studies have identified downstream of nga a second weak promoter for slo (17Savic D.J. McShan W.M. Ferretti J.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2730-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Kimoto H. Fujii Y. Yokota Y. Taketo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 134-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The two proteins are functionally linked in that SLO is required for the translocation of NADase from GAS bound to the surface of epithelial cells into the host cell cytoplasm (19Madden J.C. Ruiz N. Caparon M. Cell. 2001; 104: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Studies using mutant strains of GAS deficient in SLO or NADase indicated that NADase can enhance the extracellular survival of GAS and induce apoptosis after infection of keratinocytes in vitro (20Bricker A.L. Cywes C. Ashbaugh C.D. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the biological targets and the precise function of NADase inside the host cytoplasm are not fully understood. In particular, the mechanism through which NADase augments the cytotoxic activity of SLO has not been defined. We have now reported evidence that NADase contributes not only to cytotoxic injury of nucleated cells but also to hemolytic activity associated with GAS production of SLO. We found that the capacity of NADase to enhance SLO-mediated cytotoxicity is not due to a direct effect on pore formation but rather due to depletion of cellular NAD+ and ATP. The results have provided new insights into the intrinsic and cooperative functions of NADase and SLO during GAS infection. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—M-type 3 GAS strain 950771 (referred to hereafter as 771) and its isogenic mutants 771nga- and 771slo- have been described (20Bricker A.L. Cywes C. Ashbaugh C.D. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). GAS was grown at 37 °C in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (Difco). For cloning experiments, Escherichia coli DH5α or TOP10 (Invitrogen) was grown in Luria-Bertani medium (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). When appropriate, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml. Keratinocyte Cell Culture—OKP7 primary human soft palate keratinocytes (22Crowe D.L. Hu L. Gudas L.J. Rheinwald J.G. Differentiation. 1991; 48: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were cultured in serum-free keratinocyte medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), and 0.3 mm calcium chloride. Keratinocytes were seeded into 75-cm2 flasks (Costar) and cultured for 3-5 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until confluent. Keratinocyte Infection with GAS and Isolation of Keratinocyte Cell Fractions—GAS was resuspended in unsupplemented, serum-free medium to the desired multiplicity of infection and inoculated onto the surface of the keratinocyte monolayer. The infected keratinocytes were incubated at 37° C in 5% CO2 for the required length of time. GAS cytotoxicity for keratinocytes in vitro was assessed using the LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Values were expressed as the percentage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release compared with Triton X-100-treated cells (100% cytotoxicity, maximum LDH release) minus background LDH release from uninfected cells. In experiments to measure intracellular NAD+ and ATP, after exposure to GAS, the keratinocytes were incubated with 10 μg/ml clindamycin (to which strain 771 and derivatives are susceptible) for 15 min before harvesting to prevent contamination of the cell fractions with NADase produced by associated bacteria during processing of the samples. Cell culture supernatants were collected and cleared of bacteria and cell debris by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 5 min. Cell fractions for measuring NAD+ and ATP concentration were prepared as described (19Madden J.C. Ruiz N. Caparon M.

Adequacy of lysis and fractionation were verified using the LDH assay (Roche Applied Science) for cytoplasmic fractions and alkaline phosphatase assay (Sigma) for membrane fractions. Measurement of SLO Hemolytic Activity and NADase Activity—SLO activity was assayed as described (24Ruiz N. Wang B. Pentland A. Caparon M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Activity was quantified in hemolytic units as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of culture supernatant that resulted in erythrocyte lysis equivalent to 50% of the value obtained for complete lysis using water. NADase activity was assayed as described (13Karasawa T. Yamakawa K. Tanaka D. Gyobu Y. Nakamura S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 289-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NADase activity was quantified as the reciprocal of the highest supernatant dilution that hydrolyzed half of the amount of added NAD+. Measurement of SLO Lytic Activity with Liposomes—Liposomes containing calcein were prepared with egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol at a ratio of 2:1 (total lipid concentration, 3.5 mg/ml) by extrusion through 100-nm pore size polycarbonate membranes (Advance Biomedical Ltd.). Calcein release assays were performed as described (25Zitzer A. Bittman R. Verbicky C.A. Erukulla R.K. Bhakdi S. Weis S. Valeva A. Palmer M. J. Biol.

GAS supernatants were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) and then activated with dithiothreitol (final concentration, 6 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C and serially diluted 2-fold in PBS. An equal volume of the calcein liposomes (500 μl, final concentration, 0.2 mg/ml) was added to each 500-μl sample. Following incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the samples were diluted in 30 volumes of PBS and transferred to a 96-well plate, and the percentage of calcein released was determined fluorometrically (HTS 7000, Bioassay Reader, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, excitation, 490 nm; emission, 520 nm). PBS was used to determine background fluorescence, and a sample of liposomes treated with 1% Triton X-100 was used to determine the value for complete lysis. Relative fluorescence values for test samples were calculated from the equation: 100 × (sample - background)/(complete lysis - background). Measurement of NAD+ and ATP—NAD+ was assayed as described (26Kristian T. Fiskum G. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2004; 13: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the final fluorescent product, resofurin, was measured using an excitation wavelength of 550 nm and emission wavelength of 585 nm. ATP was assayed using an ATP bioluminescence assay (Sigma). The ATP assay mixture was diluted 10 times, and the amount of light produced was measured with a luminometer (HTS 7000, bioassay reader, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). TaqMan Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT) PCR Analysis—RNA was extracted from six independent cultures at late exponential phase for each GAS strain using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) followed by DNase I treatment. Fifty ng of RNA samples was analyzed in duplicate using the TaqMan one-step RT-PCR master mix reagents (Applied Biosystems) as described (27Chaussee M.S. Watson R.O. Smoot J.C. Musser J.M. Infect Immun. 2001; 69: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in an ABI 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotide primers and FAM-labeled probes (Table I) were designed with Primer Express 1.0 software (ABI Prism; PE Biosystems) and initially evaluated in serial dilution experiments. Results were normalized to the values of the constitutively transcribed control gene recA, expressed as mean arbitrary relative units. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance using the StatView statistical software program (SAS, Cary, NC).TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers and probes used in this studyPrimer/probe nameSequence (5′ to 3′)slo32F(PshAI)acgacaagagtctggaatcgaacaaacaaaacactsloR(EcoRI)cggaattcttactacttataagtaatcgaccanga2F(PshAI)gacgacaagagtcgtgctgagtattaccggngaF(BamHI)cgcggatccagaaacaaaaaagtaacattangaR(EcoRI)cggaattcttactacttataagtaatcgaaccslo-F Taqgagttgcaacgaaaaggtgtcaslo-R Taqgacccataggctacgttactcacaaaslo-M1 TaqMan probe6FAM-caatgaagctccgccactcnga-F Taqggtgttggtgaggtactttcctacanga-R Taqtctccttgctagatgtgtctccatnga TaqMan probe6FAM-cgtccccgatgcatattgggagarecA-F TaqtgttgtcgattcagtagcagctttarecA-R TaqtttacgcatggcctgactcarecA TaqMan probe6FAM-ccatgtcggattgcaagcacg Open table in a new tab Expression of Recombinant SLO (SLOr) and a C-terminal Fragment of NADase—The slo gene lacking the first 31 codons predicted to encode the signal peptide (Signal IP V2.0 software) was amplified (28Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar) using primers slo32F(PshAI) and sloR(EcoRI) (Table I) and chromosomal DNA of strain 771 as template. The PCR product was initially cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The cloned insert was released from the recombinant plasmid with PshAI/EcoRI digestion and subcloned into PshAI/EcoRI-digested pET-41 (Novagen) as an in-frame translational fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and an N-terminal His6 tag. The plasmid construct was verified by sequencing. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the recombinant plasmid was grown to A600 nm of 0.4, and then expression of SLOr was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration) for 2 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation (8000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), lysed in a French pressure cell (3 × 8000 p.s.i.), and clarified by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Purification of GST-His6-SLOr was done by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen) at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Column fractions were concentrated and desalted using a Centricon column YM-30 (Millipore) and digested with 0.5 units of enterokinase (Novagen), and the cleaved GST-His6 was removed by adsorption to Ni-NTA resin. Purified SLOr was stored in 25% glycerol at -80 °C. The 3′ portion of the nga gene corresponding to nucleotides 718-1356 was amplified using primers nga2F(PshAI) and ngaR(EcoRI) (Table I). Cloning, expression, and purification of the truncated NADase protein (tNADase) were performed as described above for SLOr. Preparation of Antisera and Purification of IgG—The purified SLOr and tNADase proteins were used to immunize rabbits (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Inc.). Immune sera were evaluated by Western blot for reactivity with protein bands corresponding to SLO or NADase in culture supernatant samples from GAS strains 771, 771slo-, or 771nga-. IgG was purified from immune sera by protein A affinity chromatography (ImmunoPure Protein A IgG purification kit, Pierce) for use in subsequent experiments. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for SLO—Microtiter plates (Nalge Nunc) were coated with IgG antibodies to SLOr at 2 μg/ml in 0.05 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, pH 7.4. Serial dilutions of SLOr or GAS culture supernatant in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin were added. Bound SLO was detected with anti-SLOr IgG conjugated to biotin (EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation Kit, Pierce) diluted 1:2000 followed by ImmunoPure streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) at 1 μg/ml and peroxidase substrate (Sure Blue TMB Microwell peroxidase substrate, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), 100 μl/well for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 n H2SO4, and absorbance was read at 450 nm in a microplate reader (HTS 7000, bioassay reader, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Results were quantified by comparison with optical absorbance values obtained from a standard curve generated using purified SLOr. Affinity Chromatography for Interaction of NADase with SLO—E. coli cell lysate containing recombinant GST-His6-SLOr was clarified by centrifugation and then loaded on a Ni-NTA resin column. After washing, 20 ml of filtered supernatant from a culture of 771slo- grown to late exponential phase was loaded onto the column. After washing, GST-His6-SLOr and proteins bound to it were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Column fractions were assayed for NADase activity and tested for the presence of NADase by Western blot probed with IgG purified from anti-tNADase rabbit serum. To test for the specificity of NADase-SLO interaction, we performed parallel experiments using, in place of GST-His6-SLOr, a GST-His6 fusion to a 12-kDa peptide representing a portion of the predicted extracellular domain of the GAS CsrS protein (molecular mass ∼43 kDa). 3I. Gryllos and M. R. Wessels, unpublished results. CsrS is the sensor component of the CsrR-CsrS (CovR-CovS) two-component regulatory system (29Gryllos I. Levin J.C. Wessels M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Levin J.C. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—SDS-PAGE and Western blot were performed according to standard techniques (31Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at a concentration of 2-6 mg/dl and a dilution of 1:5000 and secondary antibodies at a dilution 1:10000. Development and detection of hybridization bands were done using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of NADase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—For expression of NADase in S. cerevisiae INVSC1 strain, we used the pYES2/NT/C inducible expression vector (Invitrogen). This vector carries the GAL1 promoter (32Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) that is repressed in the presence of glucose and induced by galactose. To amplify nga from chromosomal DNA of GAS strain 771, we used primers ngaF(BamHI) and ngaR(EcoRI) (Table I). The nga sequence was introduced into pYES2/NT/C to produce recombinant plasmid pYES-nga. Plasmids pYES (pYES2/NT/C), pYES-lacZ (control plasmid carrying lacZ, encoding β-galactosidase), and pYES-nga were transformed separately into S. cerevisiae following the manufacturer's recommendations. Transformants were selected on SC-U (SC minimal medium lacking uracil) agar plates. The selected colonies were inoculated into 100 ml of SC-U to an initial A600 nm of 0.05 and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C with shaking. Expression was induced for 24 h at 30 °C by adding galactose to a final concentration of 2%. Samples were taken before and 2, 4, 8, 18, and 24 h after the addition of galactose. Measurement of Cytotoxicity in S. cerevisiae—The FUN1 viability-cytotoxicity stain (Molecular Probes) was used to assess the cytotoxic effects of NADase expression in S. cerevisiae. Dead yeast cells exhibit diffuse green-yellow fluorescence, whereas metabolically active cells are marked with red fluorescent cylindrical intravacuolar structures (33Millard P.J. Roth B.L. Thi H.P. Yue S.T. Haugland R.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For measuring cytotoxicity, 100 μl of yeast culture was washed once in 1 ml of sterile water containing 2% d-(+)-glucose and 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.2 (glucose-HEPES solution), concentrated by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and suspended again in 1 ml of glucose-HEPES solution. FUN1 stain was added to the yeast cell suspension at a final concentration of 15 μm, mixed thoroughly, and incubated at 30 °C in the dark for 30 min. 200 μl of the mixture was transferred to a 96-well flat bottom plate (Nalge Nunc) and read in a fluorescence microplate reader (HTS 7000, bioassay reader, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using two filter combinations: ∼485 nm excitation/∼530 nm emission (green) and ∼485 nm excitation/∼620 nm emission (red). Dye conversion was expressed as a change in the ratio of red/green for each well after subtracting the value for a blank well containing glucose-HEPES solution and dye. Samples from each time point were applied to poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Sigma) and examined by confocal microscopy. SLO Hemolytic Activity Is Unexpectedly Low in the NADase Mutant Strain 771nga—Previous studies in two independent strains of GAS reported that SLO hemolytic activity was apparently unaffected by the introduction of an inactivating deletion mutation in the upstream gene nga encoding NADase (19Madden J.C. Ruiz N. Caparon M. Cell. 2001; 104: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 20Bricker A.L. Cywes C. Ashbaugh C.D. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). By performing more detailed testing, we found that the NADase mutant strain 771nga- produces similar amounts of SLO hemolytic activity as wild-type strain 771 during early exponential phase but substantially less than strain 771 during later phases of growth (Fig. 1A). These differences in SLO hemolytic activity were observed both during growth of GAS in THY and during growth in tissue culture medium in contact with OKP7 human oropharyngeal keratinocytes (Fig. 1B). In addition, exposure of keratinocytes to wild-type strain 771 resulted in release of approximately twice as much LDH, a marker of cell membrane damage, as did exposure to 771nga- (Fig. 1C). These results raised the possibility that the attenuated cytotoxic effects of 771nga- could be attributable, at least in part, to reduced SLO cytolytic activity in this mutant strain. Transcription of slo Is Not Significantly Reduced in 771nga- When Compared with Wild-type Strain 771—Although the non-polar deletion mutation in the nga locus in strain 771nga- was not expected to affect transcription of the downstream slo locus, we used real-time RT-PCR to evaluate this possibility. The amount of slo mRNA in 771nga- and 771 was measured in GAS cells grown to mid-exponential phase. The results of real-time RT-PCR revealed only a modest and not statistically significant reduction in the relative slo transcript level in 771nga- when compared with that in 771 (771:3.87 ± 1.72, 771nga-: 2.62 ± 1.58, mean relative units ± S.E., p = 0.22) that does not explain the 80-90% reduction in SLO hemolytic activity of 771nga- relative to that of 771. Development of Specific Antisera against Recombinant SLO and NADase—Previous assessments of SLO protein production have used antisera that recognized not only SLO but also NADase (19Madden J.C. Ruiz N. Caparon M. Cell. 2001; 104: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 20Bricker A.L. Cywes C. Ashbaugh C.D. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To develop a more specific antiserum for use in SLO and NADase immunoassays, we expressed separately SLOr and tNADase. The proteins were expressed as GST-His6 fusions in E. coli. SLOr had the expected molecular mass of ∼61 kDa on SDS-PAGE and produced hemolytic activity of 250,000 units/mg of protein. Antiserum raised in rabbits to SLOr reacted strongly and specifically with a 61-kDa band in culture supernatants of wild-type strain 771 but not with culture supernatants from 771slo- (Fig. 2A). Multiple attempts to express the complete NADase in a variety of vectors and inducible expression systems failed. Recombinant plasmids recovered from transformants were invariably found to contain one or more mutations in the nga sequence that produced an enzymatically inactive product, an observation that suggests that NADase is toxic to E. coli. A recent study by Meehl et al. (34Meehl M.A. Pinkner J.S. Anderson P.J. Hultgren S.J. Caparon M.G. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggests that NADase is maintained in an inactive state within GAS by an endogenous inhibitor that must be co-expressed for expression of NADase in E. coli. However, we were able to clone and express an enzymatically inactive 22-kDa peptide (termed tNADase) corresponding to the C terminus of the native NADase protein. Rabbit antiserum to tNADase reacted specifically with a 49-kDa band in culture supernatants of strains 771 and 771slo- but not 771nga- (Fig. 2B). A Quantitative Immunoassay Reveals Similar Amounts of SLO Protein in Culture Supernatants of 771nga- and Wild-type Strain 771—Because slo transcript levels were similar in 771nga- and wild-type strain 771, we considered whether the lower level of SLO activity in 771nga- might reflect a reduction in translation of slo message or more rapid degradation of SLO. To determine the concentration of SLO in culture supernatants, we developed a quantitative immunoassay using purified rabbit anti-SLO IgG. Results were quantified by comparison with values obtained from a standard curve generated using purified SLOr. SLO protein was measured in supernatants of GAS cultures grown to late exponential phase, at which point SLO hemolytic activity of 771nga- was ∼10% of that of 771. Similar to the results of RT-PCR experiments, this quantitative assessment revealed only a slight and not statistically significant reduction (p = 0.56) in the amount of SLO protein in culture supernatants of 771nga- (0.72 ± 0.11 μg/ml) when compared with those of wild-type 771 (0.80 ± 0.21 μg/ml). The fact that 771nga- produces similar amounts of SLO protein but markedly reduced SLO hemolytic activity suggests that NADase enhances cytotoxicity of SLO not only for nucleated cells, but also for erythrocytes. NADase Binds to Recombinant SLO—The discrepancy between the amount of immunoreactive SLO protein and SLO hemolytic activity in 771nga- raised the possibility that association of NADase with SLO might serve to stabilize or enhance the activity of SLO as a pore-forming toxin. We used affinity chromatography to test whether NADase"

Emerging commonalities indicate that genetic insufficiencies predispose for PLE and environmental insults, e.g. viral infections and inflammation, trigger PLE onset. The specific loss of heparan sulfate (HS) from the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells only during episodes of PLE suggests a possible mechanistic link. In the first tissue culture model of PLE using a monolayer of intestinal epithelial HT29 cells, we proved that HS loss directly causes protein leakage and amplifies the effects of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα).

Increased pressure, mimicking venous hypertension seen in post-Fontan PLE patients, substantially increased protein leakage, but HS loss, IFNγ, or TNFα alone had only minor effects. However, IFNγ up-regulated TNFR1 expression and amplified TNFα-induced protein leakage. IFNγ and TNFα compromised the integrity of the HT29 monolayer and made it more susceptible to increased pressure. HS loss itself compromises the integrity of the monolayer, amplifying the effects of pressure, but also amplifies the effects of both cytokines.

It appears to involve a combination of genetic insufficiencies and environmental insults. The evidence for this is that patients do not suffer from PLE continuously; rather, PLE is episodic. Its onset is often associated with viral infections and a pro-inflammatory state (2Westphal V. Murch S. Kim S. Srikrishna G. Winchester B. Day R. Freeze H.H. Am. J.

Most intriguing is the loss of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (HSPG) specifically from the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells only during PLE episodes (1Beeken W.L. Busch H.J.

Pathol. 2000; 157: 1917-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The combination of multiple factors contributing to PLE is most apparent in post-Fontan patients. The Fontan procedure was developed to separate the systemic and the pulmonary circulation in patients with congenital heart malformations (11Marino B.S. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2002; 14: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the surgery vastly improves survival, it often elevates central venous pressure (11Marino B.S. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2002; 14: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Venous hypertension in post-Fontan patients is thought to be associated with intestinal protein leakage with the increased pressure from the basolateral side pressing plasma proteins into the intestinal lumen (11Marino B.S. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2002; 14: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Fujii T. Shimizu T. Takahashi K. Kishiro M. Ohkubo M. Akimoto K. Yamashiro Y. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2003; 37: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because venous pressure increases immediately after the intervention and remains elevated for the rest of the patient's life, there is no good explanation why PLE develops in only 3–10% of the patients months to years after the surgery (3Mertens L. Hagler D.J. Sauer U. Somerville J. Gewillig M. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1998; 115: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 4Thorne S.A. Hooper J. Kemp M. Somerville J. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation is that genetic factors and Fontan-induced venous hypertension predispose for PLE, which precipitates upon a series of sequential or simultaneous environmental insults. Consistent with this hypothesis, seven out of eight post-Fontan patients have been diagnosed with viral infections at the onset of PLE symptoms (5Lenz D. Hambsch J. Schneider P. Hausler H.J. Sauer U. Hess J. Tarnok A. Crit. Care. 2003; 7: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating that this additional insult triggered PLE. Jejunal biopsies, taken during episodes with PLE, revealed an increased IFNγ concentration (7Shimizu T. Nagata S. Fujii T. Takahashi K. Kishiro M. Ohkubo M. Akimoto K. Yamashiro Y. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2003; 37: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), most likely as a response to the viral infection and elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα (6Ostrow A. Rychik J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; (Abstr., in press)Google Scholar). Both cytokines are known to impair the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier (13Bruewer M. Luegering A. Kucharzik T. Parkos C.A.

Similar to other primary diseases associated with PLE, episodes of post-Fontan PLE are characterized by a loss of HSPG specifically from the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells. HSPG expression in the lamina propria is normal (10Salvestrini C. Myrdal U. Holmgren D. Spray C. Bode L. Freeze H. Murch S. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2004; 39: 278-279Google Scholar). 3S. Murch, unpublished data. Overall intestinal architecture remains intact, and the expression of other matrix components is also normal (10Salvestrini C. Myrdal U. Holmgren D. Spray C. Bode L. Freeze H. Murch S. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2004; 39: 278-279Google Scholar). 3S. Murch, unpublished data. The reasons why HSPGs are lost during episodes of PLE are still unknown. Recently, we established the first in vitro model of PLE and proved a direct link between HS loss and protein leakage through a monolayer of HT29 cells, a human intestinal epithelial cell line. In addition, we showed that HS loss amplifies TNFα-induced protein leakage (19Bode L. Eklund E.A. Murch S. Freeze H.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), providing the first reasonable explanation on how two of the factors associated with PLE onset synergize. Heparin compensates for the loss of cell-associated HS and abolishes the synergism between HS loss and TNFα (19Bode L. Eklund E.A. Murch S. Freeze H.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results offer a potential explanation for the favorable response some PLE patients have to heparin treatment (20Donnelly J.P. Rosenthal A. Castle V.P. Holmes R.D. J. Pediatr. 1997; 130: 474-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Kelly A.M. Feldt R.H. Driscoll D.J. Danielson G.K. Mayo Clin.

Hepatol. 2001; 13: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HS loss and elevated TNFα concentrations are just two factors thought to trigger PLE. Based on the strong correlation between PLE onset and viral infections together with increased IFNγ concentrations, we hypothesized that IFNγ either directly or indirectly causes protein leakage. We further hypothesized that venous hypertension caused by the Fontan surgery predisposes for protein leakage. To test these hypotheses, we modified the in vitro model to mimic venous hypertension and assessed the individual and combined effects of increased pressure, HS loss, IFNγ, and TNFα on protein leakage. We find that HS is the central figure coordinating their synergistic effects. The human intestinal epithelial cell line HT29 (ATCC HTB-38) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Albumin Flux—Cells were grown on a semipermeable membrane in Snapwell inserts (12-mm diameter, 3.0-μm pore size, Corning, NY) for 5 days until they reached confluence. Albumin flux was measured in cells treated with heparinase III (HSase), p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (β-xyloside), heparin (Sigma), recombinant human IFNγ, or recombinant human TNFα (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) at final concentrations and time points as indicated for each experiment. Cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 (with/without serum, with/without phenol red) (Invitrogen). The ring-supported membrane with the HT29 monolayer was mounted on a slider and inserted into the EasyMount Ussing Chamber System (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Both sides of the HT29 monolayer were bathed in 4-ml Ringers solution (pH 7.4) gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The chamber system was constantly heated at 37 °C. To determine protein leakage, albumin-FITC (400 μl/ml) was added to the Ringers solution bathing the basolateral side of the HT29 monolayer. After 3 h the concentration of albumin-FITC in the buffer bathing the apical side of the monolayer was measured using a spectrofluorometer (excitation. 485 nm; emission, 538 nm). Basolateral to apical albumin flux through the untreated monolayer is defined as 1.0. To evaluate the effects of hydrostatic pressure, a millimeter scale was tagged to the transparent chambers. The addition of 250 μl of Ringers solution to one side of the chamber generates 1 mm of hydrostatic pressure. Confocal Microscopy—HT29 cells grown on the Snapwell membrane were fixed with paraformaldehyde and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against dipeptidyl peptidase IV (clone 202–36, LabVision, Fremont CA). The secondary antibody was FITC-labeled (Sigma). Cell nuclei were stained with ToPro3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The Snapwell membrane was carefully cut out of the ring support with a razor blade and placed on a microscope slide, and the cells were visualized with a MRC 1024 SP Bio-Rad laser point scanning confocal microscope. Flow Cytometry—HT29 cells were harvested with EDTA and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against TNFR1 (clone H-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or with an isotype-matched control antibody to determine nonspecific binding. The secondary antibody was FITC-labeled (Sigma). Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Biosciences FACSort and the CellQuest software. Data for 10,000 events were collected. Events were considered positive if their fluorescence intensity exceeded that of 98% of the isotype-matched control antibody. The median fluorescence intensity for TNFR1(FITC) in untreated controls is defined as 1.0. The Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen) was used to quantitatively determine the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis and cell death. Statistical Analysis—Results are given as the means ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Differences between interventions were tested by the two-tailed Student's t test. p < 0.05 is considered significant. In Vitro Monolayer of Intestinal Epithelial Cells—Microscopic observation revealed that the HT29 cells had grown into a confluent monolayer 5 days after seeding on Snapwell inserts. We used confocal microscopy to determine monolayer polarity. The apical surface marker dipeptidyl peptidase IV was exclusively expressed on the cell membrane facing the media (data not shown), defining the apical surface. The cell membrane attached to the porous membrane of the Snapwell did not express dipeptidyl peptidase IV, therefore defining the basolateral surface. To prove that the untreated monolayer at day 5 provides a barrier to prevent basolateral-to-apical protein leakage, we added albumin-FITC to the basolateral side and determined albumin flux through the monolayer by measuring the concentration of albumin-FITC on the apical side over time. Although albumin-FITC concentrations on both sides of an empty insert (without cells) reached equilibrium in less than 4 h, the HT29 monolayer grown on the insert prevented protein leakage and allowed only 1.2% albumin-FITC to pass from the basolateral to the apical side even after 8 h. This percentage did not further decrease when cells were grown on the Snapwell inserts for more than 5 days, confirming that the cells reached confluence at day 5 (data not shown). Effects of Individual Factors—HS loss, IFNγ, TNFα, and venous hypertension are thought to be involved in the molecular pathogenesis leading to protein leakage in patients with PLE. Our first aim was to evaluate the individual contributions of each of these four factors alone. To deplete cell-associated HS, we incubated the basolateral surface of the HT29 monolayer with HSase at 0.6 milliunits/ml for 1.5 h. We have reported earlier that these conditions cause maximum depletion of cell-associated HS (19Bode L. Eklund E.A. Murch S. Freeze H.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, albumin flux increased 2.6 ± 0.1-fold compared with untreated controls (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). Co-incubation with 100 μm β-xyloside, which competes out GAG chain synthesis on core proteins, did not further increase HSase-induced protein leakage (data not shown). Incubating the cells with TNFα at 2 or 20 ng/ml for 12 h increased albumin flux 2.3 ± 0.4 (p < 0.01)- and 4.9 ± 0.5-fold (p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 1A). These results with our Ussing chamber model are consistent with our previous data in a Transwell system showing that HS loss and TNFα cause protein leakage (19Bode L. Eklund E.A. Murch S. Freeze H.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). IFNγ had no effect on protein leakage when applied in low (1 ng/ml) or moderate concentrations (10 ng/ml), but high concentrations (100 ng/ml) slightly increased albumin flux 1.5 ± 0.2-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). TNFα or IFNγ at concentrations and incubation times used in these experiments did not alter the percentage of annexin V-positive cells or the uptake of propidium iodine (data not shown), and we concluded that neither TNFα-nor IFNγ-induced protein leakage was caused by increased apoptosis or cell death. To mimic venous hypertension, we raised the hydrostatic pressure on the basolateral side of the monolayer by 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mm H2O. Albumin flux increased 4.1 ± 0.8-, 8.9 ± 1.1-, and 15.8 ± 0.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B). To assure that the hydrostatic pressure did not cause the cells to detach from the Snapwell membrane, we examined the monolayer by confocal microscopy after measuring albumin flux. The monolayer was still intact up to 5.0 mm H2O, but the cells began to detach from the membrane at 10.0 mm H2O (data not shown). Effects of Paired Combinations; Synergy—After determining the effects on protein leakage for each of the four factors alone, we next did pairwise combinations. First, we combined HS loss and pressure since we hypothesized that loss of HS from the basolateral surface compromises the integrity of the monolayer and makes the monolayer more susceptible to increased pressure. Results are shown in Fig. 2A. Adding the individual effects of HS loss and 2.5 mm H2O pressure, we predicted a 10.5-fold increase in albumin flux. In fact, we measured a 15.7 ± 0.9-fold increase in albumin flux (p < 0.001), indicating that the combined effects of HS loss and increased pressure were not only additive, but synergistic. Similarly, we hypothesized that TNFα also compromises the integrity of the monolayer and enhances the effects of increased pressure. We incubated the cells with TNFα (2 ng/ml) for 12 h, applied different amounts of hydrostatic pressure on the basolateral side, and determined protein leakage (Fig. 2B). The measured effects on albumin flux were higher than the predicted sum, suggesting synergistic effects of TNFα and increased pressure. In contrast, incubating the cells with IFNγ (10 ng/ml) instead of TNFα did not affect pressure-induced protein leakage (data not shown). Next, we combined HS loss and TNFα. We incubated the cells with HSase for 1.5 h to digest cell-associated HS. At the same time we added 100 μm β-xyloside to inhibit GAG synthesis on newly synthesized core proteins and, thus, prevented the reappearance of cell-associated HS over time (19Bode L. Eklund E.A. Murch S. Freeze H.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Afterward, we incubated the cells with different concentrations of TNFα for 12 h and determined protein leakage. The effects of HS loss and TNFα were not only additive, but synergistic (Fig. 2C). For example, although TNFα (2 ng/ml) alone increased albumin flux 2.3 ± 0.4-fold and HS loss alone increased albumin flux 2.6 ± 0.1-fold, the combination of these two factors increased albumin flux 5.8 ± 0.9-fold (p < 0.01) instead of the predicted 2.9-fold. This observation is consistent with our previously reported data showing that HS depletion amplifies TNFα-induced protein leakage (19Bode L. Eklund E.A. Murch S. Freeze H.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), especially at low cytokine concentrations. We also combined HS loss with IFNγ. We either digested the cell-associated HS with HSase 1.5 h before IFNγ treatment or incubated the cells with IFNγ first and then digested with HSase. In both cases, IFNγ had no effect on albumin flux beyond that of HS loss alone (data not shown). To combine the two cytokines, we preincubated the cells with IFNγ (10 ng/ml) for 12 h and then added TNFα (2 ng/ml) for another 12 h before measuring albumin flux. Although IFNγ alone had no effect on protein leakage and TNFα increased albumin flux only 2.3 ± 0.4-fold, incubation with IFNγ before the addition of TNFα increased albumin flux 4.4 ± 0.7-fold (p < 0.01), indicating that IFNγ amplifies TNFα-induced protein leakage (Fig. 2D). In summary, results from the two-factor systems revealed synergistic effects between HS loss and pressure, TNFα and pressure, HS loss and TNFα, and IFNγ and TNFα but not between HS loss and IFNγ or IFNγ and pressure. Effects of Triple Assaults; Enhanced Synergy—Next we tested combinations of three factors. Fig. 3A shows the results of combining HS loss, IFNγ, and TNFα treatments. We incubated the cells with IFNγ (10 ng/ml) for 12 h and added TNFα (2 ng/ml) for another 12 h. We depleted cell-associated HS before the addition of each cytokine. The individual effects of HS loss, IFNγ, and TNFα predict a 3.0-fold increase in albumin flux, but we actually measured a 11.2 ± 1.8-fold increase (p < 0.001). Depleting cell-associated HS before the addition of IFNγ but not before TNFα still increased albumin flux 6.8 ± 0.8-fold (p < 0.01), which was higher than predicted but significantly lower compared with HS depletion before both the addition of IFNγ and the addition of TNFα (p < 0.01). We also depleted cell-associated HS before TNFα addition but not before IFNγ addition, which increased albumin flux 8.1 ± 0.9-fold (p < 0.01). This effect was again higher than predicted but significantly lower than the effect of HS depletion before both IFNγ and TNFα addition (p < 0.05). These results show that HS loss amplified the effects of both IFNγ and TNFα. To investigate the combined effects of HS loss, TNFα, and pressure, we depleted cell-associated HS, incubated the cells with TNFα (2 ng/ml) for 12 h, and applied different amounts of hydrostatic pressure (Fig. 3B). With 2.5 mm H2O pressure, the predicted increase is 11.8-fold, but we measured a 16.5 ± 0.8-fold increase in albumin flux. Finally, we measured the combined effects of IFNγ, TNFα, and pressure. We incubated the cells with IFNγ for 12 h and with TNFα for another 12 h, applied different amounts of hydrostatic pressure, and measured albumin flux (Fig. 3C). Instead of the predicted 10.3-fold increase in albumin flux at 2.5 mm H2O pressure, we measured a 14.9 ± 1.4-fold increase (p < 0.001). Four Factors Produce Maximum Synergy—Finally, we combined all four factors. We depleted cell-associated HS from the basolateral surface, incubated the cells with IFNγ and TNFα, applied different amounts of hydrostatic pressure, and determined protein leakage (Fig. 4). Although the addition of the individual effects of the four factors predicted a 7.1-fold increase in albumin flux for a hydrostatic pressure of 1.0 mm H2O and a 11.9-fold increase in albumin flux for 2.5 mm H2O, we actually measured a 18.7 ± 2.1- and 26.3 ± 1.4-fold increase, respectively. Notably, the effect of only 1.0 mm H2O pressure in combination with the other three factors (18.7 ± 2.1-fold) is higher than the effect of 5.0 mm H2O pressure alone (15.8 ± 0.7-fold). In fact, combining a hydrostatic pressure of 5.0 mm H2O with the other three factors caused the cells to detach from the Snapwell membrane, which pressure alone or in combination with HS loss or TNFα cannot do. These results indicate that the combined effects of all four factors were highly synergistic. Basis of HS Loss, IFNγ, and TNFα Synergy—Because IFNγ alone had no effect on protein leakage but enhanced TNFα-induced protein leakage, we asked whether this synergism is caused by an IFNγ-mediated up-regulation of the TNFR1 receptor (24Tsujimoto M. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2441-2444PubMed Google Scholar). To address this question, we incubated the HT29 monolayer with IFNγ (10 ng/ml) for 12 and 24 h, harvested the cells, and determined TNFR1 expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig. 5A). Incubating the cells with IFNγ for 12 h increased TNFR1 expression 1.9-fold compared with untreated controls. In parallel, TNFα-induced albumin flux increased 2.0-fold when cells were preincubated with IFNγ 12 h before the addition of TNFα (Fig. 5B). Because IFNγ binds to and may be inactivated by HS (25Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 37: 253-260PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fritchley S.J. Kirby J.A. Ali S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we further hypothesized that loss of cell-associated HS increases the amount of active IFNγ and amplifies IFNγ-mediated up-regulation of TNFR1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we digested cell-associated HS with HSase, washed the cells, and incubated them with IFNγ for 12 or 24 h. That treatment up-regulated TNFR1 expression 2.7-fold (Fig. 5A) and, in parallel, increased TNFα-induced protein leakage 3.1-fold (Fig. 5B). These results support our hypothesis that IFNγ up-regulates TNFR1 expression and, therefore, enhances TNFα-induced protein leakage, which is further amplified in the absence of cell-associated HS. This provides a mechanistic explanation on how HS loss, IFNγ, and TNFα synergize. Heparin Abolishes Synergism between HS Loss, IFNγ, and TNFα—In our previous study we showed that soluble HS and heparin compensate for the loss of cell-associated HS and abolish synergism between HS loss and TNFα (19Bode L. Eklund E.A. Murch S. Freeze H.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We now asked whether heparin also abolishes the synergistic effects between IFNγ and TNFα based on the report that binding to heparin inactivates IFNγ (25Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 37: 253-260PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fritchley S.J. Kirby J.A. Ali S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To answer these questions, we incubated the cells with IFNγ (10 ng/ml) for 12 h, washed them, added TNFα (2 ng/ml) for another 12 h, and measured albumin flux. We depleted cell-assoc"

The mechanisms of peroxynitrite toxicity to oligodendrocytes (OLs), the major cell type of the white matter, are unknown. Using primary cultures of mature OLs that express myelin basic protein, we found that 3-morpholinosydnonimine, a peroxynitrite generator, caused toxicity to OLs. N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine, a zinc chelator, completely blocked peroxynitrite-induced toxicity. Use of FluoZin-3, a specific fluorescence zinc indicator, demonstrated the liberation of zinc from intracellular stores by peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite caused the sequential activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 42/44 (ERK42/44), 12-lipoxygenase, and generation of reactive oxygen species, which were all dependent upon the intracellular release of zinc. The same cell death pathway was also activated when exogenous zinc was used. These results suggest that in addition to preventing the formation of peroxynitrite, useful strategies in preventing disease progression in pathologies in which peroxynitrite toxicity plays a critical role might include maintaining intracellular zinc homeostasis, blocking phosphorylation of ERK42/44, inhibiting activation of 12-lipoxygenase, and eliminating the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.

Peroxynitrite, the reaction product of nitric oxide and superoxide (1Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a potent oxidant capable of inducing DNA damage (2Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), lipid peroxidation (3Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem.

A traditional view of the action of peroxynitrite is direct attack by oxidation and nitration of molecules vital for cell survival to cause cell death (6Szabo C. Toxicol. Lett. 2003; 140-141: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). This scenario suggests little opportunity for therapeutic intervention to protect cells exposed to peroxynitrite. An alternative more recent view is that peroxynitrite triggers a multistage signaling cascade that would permit therapeutic intervention.Stimulation of phospholipase A2 and the subsequent activation of arachidonic acid (AA) 2The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; OL, oligodendrocyte; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; 12-LOX, 12-lipoxygenase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; COX, cycloxygenase; MS, multiple sclerosis; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; dnMEK, dominant-negative MEK; EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution; 12-HETE, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; HSV, herpes simplex virus; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; BDM, basal chemically defined medium; BHPP, N-benzyl-N-hydroxy-5-phenylpentanamide; T3, 3,3′,5-triodo-l-thyronine; PLA2, phospholipase A2; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. 2The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; OL, oligodendrocyte; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; 12-LOX, 12-lipoxygenase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; COX, cycloxygenase; MS, multiple sclerosis; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; dnMEK, dominant-negative MEK; EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution; 12-HETE, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; HSV, herpes simplex virus; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; BDM, basal chemically defined medium; BHPP, N-benzyl-N-hydroxy-5-phenylpentanamide; T3, 3,3′,5-triodo-l-thyronine; PLA2, phospholipase A2; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. metabolism by lipoxygenase (LOX) and cycloxygenase (COX) pathways have been implicated in peroxynitrite-induced toxicity in PC12 cells (7Guidarelli A.

Zinc liberated by methylisothiazolinone, another oxidative agent, has been suggested to cause activation of 12-LOX, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 42/44 (ERK42/44), and ROS generation, leading to neurotoxicity (13Du S. McLaughlin B. Pal S. Aizenman E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7408-7416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that zinc release and activation of arachidonic acid metabolic pathways might be involved in peroxynitrite-induced toxicity.Myelin forming oligodendrocytes are the major cell type impaired in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (14Merrill J.E.

In addition, in a large population survey, the occurrence of MS and gout (hyperuricemic) appeared to be mutually exclusive, suggesting that hyperuricemia may protect against MS (19Hooper D.C.

These studies raise the possibility that peroxynitrite plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MS. Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite have previously been reported to cause toxicity to oligodendrocytes (22Mitrovic B. Ignarro L.J. Vinters H.V. Akers M.A. Schmid I. Uittenbogaart C. Merrill J.E.

We have found that mitochondrial dysfunction and the translocation of apoptosis inducing factor from mitochondria to the nucleus are associated with nitric oxide-induced toxicity to oligodendrocytes (OLs) (25Baud O. Li J. Zhang Y. Neve R.L. Volpe J.J. Rosenberg P.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 1713-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown how peroxynitrite induces injury to oligodendrocytes. Using primary cultures of rat brain OLs that express myelin basic protein, we found that peroxynitrite toxicity to OLs is mediated via a zinc-12-LOX-ROS pathway, and that ERK activation is upstream of 12-LOX activation and ROS generation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), peroxynitrite, carboxyl-PTIO, and FeTMPyP were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co.

AA-861 was purchased from BioMol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). N-Benzyl-N-hydroxy-5-phenylpentanamide (BHPP) was a gift from Dr. Lawrence J. Marnett (School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Plasmid DNAs containing dominant-negative mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, S222A MEK1 and K101A MEK2, were gifts from Drs. Rony Seger (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel) and Jeffery Holt (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), respectively. All the culture materials were purchased from Invitrogen. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor were from Peprotech (Princeton, NJ). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma.Oligodendrocyte Culture—Primary cultures of OLs were prepared by shaking off the progenitor cells from mixed glial cell cultures as previously described (26Wang H.

Briefly, mixed primary glial cultures were prepared from 1-2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by dissociation of the brains after they were dissected from the pups. Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (DMEM 20S) in polylysine-coated 75-cm2 flasks incubated in 95% air, 5% CO2, at 37 °C. The medium was changed 3 times per week until the cells were confluent (7-10 days). The flasks were then shaken for 1 h on an orbital shaker (200 rpm) at 37 °C to remove microglia. They were then changed to new medium and shaken overnight. The oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were detached from the astrocyte layer and resuspended and seeded onto polyornithine-coated plates (96-well (2.3 × 105 cells/plate) and 24-well (3 × 105 cells/plate)) in a basal chemically defined medium (BDM) (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 50 μg/ml apotransferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 30 nm sodium selenite, 10 nm biotin, 10 nm hydrocortisone) plus 10 ng/ml of both platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The cells were maintained in the BDM and the medium was half-changed 3 times per week. For culturing mature OLs, OLs at day 7 were changed to BDM plus 3,3′,5-triodo-l-thyronine (T3) (15 nm) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (10 ng/ml) and were half-changed 3 times per week for 2 weeks. At this stage, more than 90% of the cells were myelin basic protein positive (25Baud O. Li J. Zhang Y. Neve R.L. Volpe J.J. Rosenberg P.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 1713-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Wang H. Li J. Follett P.L. Zhang Y. Cotanche D.A. Jensen F.E. Volpe J.J. Rosenberg P.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 2049-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and were used for the experiments. The contamination of astrocytes and microglia was 1-2% each.Toxicity Assay—The survival of the cells after various treatments in 96-well plates were evaluated by visual inspection using phase-contrast microscopy and quantified by using Alamar Blue (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Westlake, OH), a viability assay that was previously described and validated by cell counting using trypan blue exclusion (27Back S.A. Gan X. Li Y. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6241-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Back S.A. Khan R. Gan X. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 91: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the culture plates were first washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA and then placed in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS, which is composed of 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm NaH2PO4, and 5.5 mm d-glucose). OLs were treated with SIN-1 or peroxynitrite for 2 h or zinc chloride (ZnCl2) for 90 min, washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA, and then placed in BDM with T3 and ciliary neurotrophic factor. All drugs were applied 15 min before, during, and after the cells were exposed to SIN-1, peroxynitrite, or ZnCl2. After the cells were incubated for 20-24 h, the culture medium was replaced with EBSS plus a 1:100 dilution of Alamar Blue. After 2 h exposure, the fluorescence of the Alamar Blue solution in each well in the plates was read at room temperature in a fluorescent plate reader (FluoroCount, Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) with excitation wavelength at 530 nm and emission wavelength at 590 nm. The data from Alamar Blue assays matched the results from visual inspection.Fluorescence Imaging of Intracellular Liberation of Zinc—Changes in intracellular free zinc concentration in OLs were monitored with a high affinity, zinc selective indicator, FluoZin-3 (29Gee K.R. Zhou Z.L. Qian W.J. Kennedy R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). OLs were loaded with FluoZin-3 (1 μm) for 30 min, washed with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA, and then treated with SIN-1 (1 mm) for various times. The fluorescence imaging of intracellular zinc was monitored immediately using digital fluorescence microscopy with a ×20 objective (excitation at 485 nm, emission at 530 nm). For all images, the microscope settings, such as brightness, contrast, and exposure time, were held constant to compare the relative intensity of intracellular zinc fluorescence across all treatment conditions.Measurement of 12-LOX Activity—12-LOX activity was measured by quantifying the major metabolic product of 12-LOX, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Assay Designs Inc., Ann Harbor, MI). OLs were treated with SIN-1 or ZnCl2 for various times or at 60 min with TPEN or U0126 present. After the cultures were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA, arachidonic acid (20 μm) in EBSS was added to the culture, which was then incubated for 30 min. The medium was then collected, extracted, and assayed for 12-HETE according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of 12-HETE in each sample was normalized to the protein concentration of the sample.Measurement of Intracellular ROS Generation—Intracellular free radical generation was evaluated with DCF (30LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar, 31Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar) and dihydrorhodamine 123 (Rho 123) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (27Back S.A. Gan X. Li Y. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6241-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Li J. Lin J.C. Wang H. Peterson J.W. Furie B.C. Furie B. Booth S.L. Volpe J.J. Rosenberg P.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5816-5826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after the cells in 96-well plates or on coverslips in 24-well plates were treated with SIN-1 or zinc for various times in the absence or presence of drugs, they were washed with EBSS and loaded with DCF (100 μm) for 30 min or Rho 123 (10 μm) for 20 min in EBSS (95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). After the loading solution was removed, the cells in the wells were washed and incubated in EBSS. The fluorescence of the cells in each well was measured and recorded in the fluorescence plate reader as described above (with excitation at λ = 480 nm, emission at λ = 530 nm, and temperature set to 37 °C). For fluorescence imaging of oxidized Rho 123, the oxidized form of dihydrorhodamine, cells plated on coverslips after treatment were immediately visualized using a digital fluorescent microscope equipped with a ×20 objective. Cells were visualized by excitation at 490 nm and emission at 515 nm.HSV Constructs Expressing Wild Type and Mutant MEKs—The wild type and mutant (S222A) MEK1 genes were supplied in the vector pcDNA3 (33Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and double digested with HindIII and XhoI. The inserts containing genes were ligated to the herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector between the HindIII and SalI sites. For wild type and mutant (K101A) MEK2 genes that were supplied in the vector pcDNA3 (34Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2732-2742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), BamHI was used for subcloning. The fragments containing the wild type and mutant genes were inserted into the BamHI site of the HSV vector. All final constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Infection of Recombinant Herpes Simplex Virus—At day 10 following medium change to BDM with T3 and ciliary neurotrophic factor, OLs were infected overnight with HSV expressing the lacZ gene, wild type, or the dominant-negative (dn) S222A MEK1 (33Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and K101A MEK2 (34Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2732-2742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and then followed by a complete medium change. Cells were cultured for an additional 24 h to allow the expression of wild type and dominant-negative MEK1 and MEK2. At this time, the virus infection rate was observed to be more than 90% by expression of LacZ. The HSV-infected OLs were then treated with SIN-1 (250 μm) for 2 h, and toxicity was observed at 24 h. For Western blot analysis, HSV-infected OLs were solubilized at 1 h after SIN-1 exposure. Antibody against MEK1/2 was obtained from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA.Western Blot Analysis of ERK and p38 Phosphorylation—At various times after SIN-1 or zinc treatment, OLs were placed on ice. After medium aspiration, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. An aliquot of cell lysate was removed for later protein determination. Cell lysate was mixed with Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and stored at -20 °C. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody for phosphorylated ERK42/44, phosphorylated p38, total ERK42/44, or total p38 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) diluted at 1:1000 in TBST containing 5% BSA. After washing 4 times with TBST, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted at 1:4000. The membrane was washed again as above and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Statistics—Statistical significance was assessed using analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc multiple comparison test. Statistical analysis was performed using the Instat program from GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). Representative experiments are shown unless noted otherwise. Experiments were performed with triplicate samples, and the data are expressed as mean ± S.D. or S.E., as is appropriate. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.RESULTSSIN-1 Toxicity to OLs Is Mediated by the Formation of Peroxynitrite—SIN-1 is a commonly used peroxynitrite generator, because it can simultaneously generate nitric oxide and superoxide in aerobic conditions (1Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the composition of the medium (e.g. serum, vitamins, and amino acids in the cell culture medium) might affect the toxic species produced by SIN-1 exposure (35Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Trackey J.L. Uliasz T.F. Hewett S.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Thome U. Lazrak A. Chen L. Kirk M.C. Thomas M.J. Forman H.J. Matalon S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 662-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the OL cultures were exposed to SIN-1 in EBSS, which is a biocarbonate-buffered saline. We found that SIN-1 induced OL toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), with an EC50 value of 270 ± 60 μm (n = 6). Similar to our observations in neuronal cultures (38Zhang Y. Rosenberg P.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the toxicity of SIN-1 (500 μm) to OLs was blocked by carboxyl-PTIO (50 μm), a nitric oxide scavenger, or superoxide dismutase (100 units/ml) plus catalase (100 units/ml), which block the accumulation of superoxide (Fig. 1B). This result suggested that the toxic species was not superoxide or nitric oxide alone. Nitric oxide reacts with superoxide to form peroxynitrite in a diffusion-limited reaction. Therefore, we concluded that the toxic species might be peroxynitrite. Indeed, SIN-1 (500 μm) toxicity was completely blocked by a peroxynitrite scavenger, uric acid (1 mm), or a decomposition catalyst of peroxynitrite, FeTMPyP (10 μm) (Fig. 1B).Zinc Release Is Critical in Peroxynitrite Toxicity to OLs—It has been reported that peroxynitrite causes zinc liberation from thymocytes (9Virag L. Szabo C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or neurons (10Bossy-Wetzel E. Talantova M.V. Lee W.D. Scholzke M.N. Harrop A. Mathews E. Gotz T. Han J. Ellisman M.H. Perkins G.A. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 2004; 41: 351-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 11Pal S. He K. Aizenman E. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 448: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Wang H. Li J. Jimenez D.A. Levitan E.S. Aizenman E. Rosenberg P.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10616-10627Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, we anticipated that the toxicity of peroxynitrite to OLs might also be mediated by intracellular zinc release. N,N,N,′N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), a zinc chelator, blocked SIN-1 (500 μm) toxicity to OLs in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In three experiments, the EC50 value of TPEN protection was 0.9 ± 0.5 μm. TPEN at 10 μm also completely blocked the toxicity of OLs induced by authentic peroxynitrite (Fig. 2B). It is known that TPEN is not exclusively a zinc chelator and can chelate other divalent cations, including iron and copper (39Armstrong C. Leong W. Lees G.J. Brain Res. 2001; 892: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Co-application of equimolar concentrations of zinc, but not iron, completely blocked the protective effect of TPEN (Fig. 2C), suggesting that iron is not involved in the toxicity of peroxynitrite to OLs. In addition, we found that two specific copper chelators, bathocuprione at 100 μm (39Armstrong C. Leong W. Lees G.J. Brain Res. 2001; 892: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and diethyldithiocarbamate at 100 μm (40Moskowitz S.I. Basu S.B. Bergold P.J. Brain Res. 2001; 913: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), also have no effect on peroxynitrite toxicity to OLs (data not shown), excluding the possibility that copper is released by peroxynitrite and is responsible for the toxicity to OLs. To further examine the release of zinc by peroxynitrite, OLs were loaded with FluoZin-3 for 30 min, and then treated with SIN-1 (1 mm) for various times. The peroxynitrite-induced time dependent increase of FluoZin-3 fluorescence is indicative of zinc release (Fig. 2D). Zinc release could be detected at 15 min, and reached a maximum at 60 min (Fig. 2D). When TPEN was used together with SIN-1, no increase of fluorescence was observed (Fig. 2D). The same results were also observed when another fluorescent zinc indicator, Newport Green, was used (data not shown).FIGURE 2Peroxynitrite toxicity to OLs was blocked by a zinc chelator. A, concentration dependence of TPEN protection against SIN-1 (500 μm) toxicity. A representative experiment of three that were performed is shown. The EC50 value of TPEN protection in this experiment was 0.4 μm. B, TPEN protected against peroxynitrite-induced toxicity to OLs. TPEN at 10 μm completely blocked OL toxicity induced by various concentrations of peroxynitrite (100, 300, and 500 μm). **, p < 0.01 and ***, p < 0.001 were obtained when the TPEN-treated groups were compared with the corresponding peroxynitrite groups without TPEN treatment. A representative experiment of three performed is shown. C, TPEN protection against SIN-1-induced toxicity was eliminated by co-administration of equimolar concentrations of ZnCl2 (10 μm), but not FeCl2 (10 μm). ***, p < 0.001 was obtained when the TPEN-treated group was compared with the group treated with SIN-1 alone. A representative experiment of three performed is shown. D, TPEN blocked the increase of FluoZin-3 fluorescence induced by SIN-1. OLs were treated with SIN-1 (1 mm) for various times, and then loaded with FluoZin-3 for 30 min. The time-dependent increase of FluoZin-3 fluorescence is shown. In the presence of TPEN (T), the fluorescence observed at 60 min SIN-1 exposure was diminished (T/S60′). A representative experiment of three performed is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation of 12-LOX Is Induced by Peroxynitrite and Blocked by TPEN—Previous studies have shown that 12-LOX-mediated toxicity is observed in ne"

Although a large number of such proteins have been identified, few of the gap junctions that they form have been characterized to provide combined information of biophysical properties, coupling pattern, and molecular compositions. We adapted the dual whole cell voltage clamp technique to in situ analysis of electrical coupling in Caenorhabditis elegans body-wall muscle. We found that body-wall muscle cells were electrically coupled in a highly organized and specific pattern. The coupling was characterized by small (350 pS or less) junctional conductance (Gj), which showed a bell-shaped relationship with junctional potential (Vj) but was independent of membrane potential (Vm). Injection of currents comparable to the junctional current (Ij) into body-wall muscle cells caused significant depolarization, suggesting important functional relevance. The innexin UNC-9 appeared to be a key component of the gap junctions. Both Myc- and green fluorescent protein-tagged UNC-9 was localized to muscle intercellular junctions. Gj was greatly inhibited in unc-9(fc16), a putative null mutant. Specific inhibition of UNC-9 function in muscle cells reduced locomotion velocity. Despite UNC-9 expression in both motor neurons and body-wall muscle cells, analyses of miniature and evoked postsynaptic currents in the unc-9 mutant showed normal neuromuscular transmission. These analyses provide a relatively detailed description of innexin-based gap junctions in a native tissue and suggest that innexin-based small conductance gap junctions can play an important role in processes such as locomotion.

Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow the passage of ions and small molecules. They play important roles in physiology and development. Mutations of gap junction proteins cause a variety of diseases, such as demyelination, deafness, female infertility, cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias or malformation, and embryonic lethality (1White T.W.

Pannexins are newly discovered in mammals in a search for invertebrate innexin homologues. Both the human and the mouse genomes contain three pannexin genes (Px1, Px2, and Px3) (6Panchin Y.

PX1 is also expressed in many other tissues (7Bruzzone R. Hormuzdi S.G. Barbe M.T. Herb A. Monyer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. However, it has not been confirmed that mammalian pannexins form gap junctions in native tissues. Properties and functions of connexin-based gap junctions are relatively well understood. However, physiological functions and in vivo biophysical properties of mammalian pannexin-based gap junctions are unknown. The anatomical complexity of the brain and the possible co-existence of connexin-based gap junctions make it very difficult to study properties of pannexin-based gap junctions in vivo or in situ. To gain understanding of pannexin-based gap junctions, an alternative approach is to study gap junctions in invertebrate systems. Essentially all identified invertebrate gap junction proteins are innexins (10Panchin Y.V. J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 1415-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Indeed, invertebrate systems have been the primary source for existing knowledge of innexin- and pannexin-based gap junctions. For example, analyses of the Drosophila shak-B and Caenorhabditis elegans eat-5 mutants established the connection between innexins and gap junctions (11Starich T.A. Lee R.Y. Panzarella C. Avery L. Shaw J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Phelan P. Nakagawa M. Wilkin M.B. Moffat K.G. O'Kane C.J. Davies J.A. Bacon J.P. J.

Drosophila Shaking-B protein was the first innexin confirmed to form gap junctions on heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes (13Phelan P. Stebbings L.A. Baines R.A. Bacon J.P. Davies J.A. Ford C. Nature. 1998; 391: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Human and mouse pannexins were discovered by data base search for invertebrate innexin homologues (6Panchin Y. Kelmanson I.

To elucidate the function of innexins/pannexins, it is critical to know the coupling pattern, biophysical and functional properties, and molecular compositions of the gap junctions that they form. However, most experimental systems do not allow combined analyses of these properties due to complex cellular organization, lack of gap junction isoform-specific inhibitors, and difficulty of molecular genetic manipulation. C. elegans body-wall muscle is potentially suitable for such analyses for several reasons: 1) C. elegans has only 95 body-wall muscle cells, which are organized in a regular pattern into four longitudinal strips called quadrants (24Waterston R.H. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.in: Wood W.B. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1988: 281-335Google Scholar); 2) gap junction-like structures have been identified in the muscle cells through ultrastructural analyses (25White J.G.

Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) innexin expression level in the muscle may be manipulated conveniently through genetic means in C. elegans. Detailed analyses of electrical coupling in this specific system may help us to understand general properties of innexin/pannexin-based gap junctions. The C. elegans genome contains 25 innexin genes (27Phelan P. Starich T.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mutants of several of them, including inx-3, eat-5, inx-6, unc-7, and unc-9, have been analyzed. INX-3 is essential to embryonic morphogenesis (28Starich T.A. Miller A. Nguyen R.L. Hall D.H. Shaw J.E. Dev. Biol. 2003; 256: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). EAT-5 and INX-6 are expressed in the pharynx and are required for synchronized pharyngeal muscle contractions (11Starich T.A. Lee R.Y. Panzarella C. Avery L. Shaw J.E. J.

Sheehan M. Jadrich J. Shaw J. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2001; 8: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it is yet to be confirmed whether any of the 25 innexins are expressed in C. elegans body-wall muscle cells to constitute the morphologically defined gap junctions (25White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1976; 275: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 26White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We adapted the dual whole cell voltage clamp technique to in situ analyses of electrical coupling in C. elegans body-wall muscle cells. We found that low conductance gap junctions mediate cell-specific electrical coupling among body-wall muscle cells, the innexin UNC-9 is a major component of the gap junctions, and the electrical coupling is important to locomotion. Electrophysiology—C. elegans was grown at room temperature (21–23 °C) on agar plates with a layer of OP50 Escherichia coli (38Sulston J.E. Hodgkin J. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.in: Wood W.B. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). Adult hermaphrodites were used for physiological analysis. Body-wall muscle cells in the two ventral quadrants were exposed as previously described (39Wang Z.W. Saifee O. Nonet M.L. Salkoff L. Neuron. 2001; 32: 867-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, an animal was immobilized on a glass coverslip by applying a cyanoacrylate adhesive along the dorsal side. A longitudinal incision was made in the dorsolateral region. After clearing the viscera, the cuticle flap was folded back and glued to the coverslip, exposing the ventral nerve cord and the two adjacent muscle quadrants. A Nikon Eclipse E600FN microscope equipped with a 40× water-immersion lens and 15× eyepieces was used for viewing the preparation. The classic whole cell configuration was obtained with borosilicate glass electrodes (3–5 MΩ), and was used for both voltage and current clamp experiments. Seal resistance was in the range of 10–20 GΩ. Membrane capacitance, membrane resistance, and access resistance were determined with Clampex (Axon Instruments) by applying a 20-mV depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of –60 mV. In 80 randomly picked wild-type body-wall muscle cells, membrane capacitance, membrane resistance, and series resistance (Rs) were 29.6 ± 0.4 picofarads, 1.51 ± 0.04 GΩ, and 9.6 ± 0.4 MΩ, respectively. Clampex software was used to acquire data at a rate of 10 kHz after filtering at 2 kHz. The dual whole cell voltage clamp technique was used to record Ij. Body-wall muscle cells have high membrane resistance and low Gj (see “Results”), making them suitable for analyses with this technique (5Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To record Ij, two neighboring body-wall muscle cells were voltage clamped. In most experiments, both cells were held at –30 mV, from which a series of voltage steps (–120 to +80 mV at 10-mV intervals and 100-ms duration) was applied to one cell (cell #1), whereas the other cell (cell #2) was held constant to record Ij. In one set of experiments (Fig. 2D), the holding potential was –60 mV, from which voltage steps of –60 to +90 mV (100-ms duration, in 10-mV increments) were applied to cell #1, whereas cell #2 was held constant to record Ij. The voltage steps were repeated four times and averaged. This protocol was alternated between the two cells in each pair. To determine if Gj is dependent on Vm, pairs of cells were held at –70 to +30 mV, from which 8 voltage steps (at 20-mV intervals, 4 steps on either side of the holding potential) were applied to one cell while the other cell was held constant to record Ij. The sequence to apply the different holding potentials was randomized to avoid potential time-dependent effects. Standard pipette solution contained (in mm) KCl 120, KOH 20, Tris 5, CaCl2 0.25, MgCl2 4, sucrose 36, EGTA 5, and Na2ATP 4, pH 7.2. Extracellular solution included (in mm) NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl2 5, MgCl2 5, dextrose 11, and HEPES 5, pH 7.2. The junctional potential between the two solutions, estimated to be ∼6 mV using the Clampex software, did not affect the analyses, because the pipette offset was zeroed immediately before getting a gigohm seal and because the extracellular solution was not changed during the period of the experiment. mPSCs and ePSCs were recorded as previously described with the muscle cell held at –60 mV (40Liu Q. Chen B. Yankova M. Morest D.K. Maryon E. Hand A.R. Nonet M.L. Wang Z.W. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6745-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The standard pipette and extracellular solutions were used. Dye Coupling Assay—5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein (Sigma) was applied through a whole cell patch clamp electrode. It was included in the pipette solution at a concentration of 100 μm (pH 7.2). The recording chamber was perfused briefly with standard extracellular solution to remove any dye that had leaked into the solution from the pipette. The muscle preparation was photographed for epifluorescence ∼15 min later. RNA Interference—A 0.6-kb genomic DNA fragment of unc-9 was amplified by PCR with a pair of specific primers (sense: CCGGAAATCGTCTGAAACTG; antisense: AGTGATTGCGAATCCACCAT). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the L4440 vector and transfected into E. coli to make unc-9-specific double-stranded RNA. RNAi was achieved by feeding animals with the bacteria expressing the unc-9 double-stranded RNA (41Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Methods. 2003; 30: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In control experiments determining the effect of unc-9 RNAi on locomotion, wild-type animals were fed with bacteria transfected with the L4440 vector (without the unc-9 insert). The effectiveness of RNAi was evaluated by examining GFP epifluorescence in transgenic animals expressing UNC-9::GFP fusion protein under the independent control of the neuron-specific rab-3 promoter (Prab-3) (42Nonet M.L. Staunton J.E. Kilgard M.P. Fergestad T. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Jorgensen E.M. Meyer B.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8061-8073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the muscle-specific myo-3 promoter (Pmyo-3) (43Okkema P.G. Harrison S.W. Plunger V. Aryana A. Fire A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 385-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rescue Experiments—Muscle-specific rescue of UNC-9 dysfunction was performed by introducing the wild-type UNC-9 into unc-9(fc16) using Pmyo-3 (43Okkema P.G. Harrison S.W. Plunger V. Aryana A. Fire A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 385-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rescuing plasmid (wp223) included Pmyo-3 and full-length unc-9 cDNA. The unc-9 cDNA was amplified from a first-strand cDNA library by nested PCR using two pairs of primers (outer sense: CCAGTTGTGGACTCGAAATCAA; outer antisense: CGACTACACCCATTGACGACAA; inner sense: GAGGATCCAGGATGAGTATGCTATTGTATT; and inner antisense: GAACCGGTAACACGTCGTGCATTTTTCCT). The inner primers contained AgeI and BamHI sites for insertion of the unc-9 cDNA into a vector (pPD118.20). The cloned unc-9 cDNA was completely sequenced. The rescuing plasmid was injected into the syncytial gonad of unc-9(fc16) hermaphrodites. A plasmid for muscle-specific GFP expression (pPD118.20) was co-injected to serve as a transformation marker. The transgene was integrated by γ-irradiation followed by backcrossing three times. Evaluation of UNC-9 Expression Pattern and Subcellular Localization—Cells expressing UNC-9 were identified by expressing GFP or DsRed2 in vivo under the control of unc-9 promoter (Punc-9). The unc-9 gene has an unusually large first intron (∼10 kb). Because this intron is potentially important for cell-specific expression but difficult to be included in a typical plasmid construct, we used an alternative approach. A 1.6-kb unc-9 genomic fragment immediately upstream of the initiation site (in the second exon) was cloned and fused in-frame to GFP or DsRed2. This plasmid (wp218 for GFP and wp268 for DsRed2) was injected into unc-9(fc16) together with cosmids R12H7 and F09D5. Cosmid R12H7 contains the 3′ portion of the first intron and the entire coding region of unc-9, whereas cosmid F09D5 contains the entire Punc-9 and the 5′ portion of the first intron. These two cosmids have significant overlap (>3 kb) in the first intron. Homologous recombination in vivo would result in a full-length Punc-9::gfp or Punc-9::DsRed2 transcriptional fusion (40Liu Q. Chen B. Yankova M. Morest D.K. Maryon E. Hand A.R. Nonet M.L. Wang Z.W. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6745-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 44Mello C. Fire A.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To confirm UNC-9 (DsRed2) expression in body-wall muscle cells and neurons, GFP was co-expressed either in neurons using Prab-3 (plasmid wp70) (42Nonet M.L. Staunton J.E. Kilgard M.P. Fergestad T. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Jorgensen E.M. Meyer B.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8061-8073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in muscle cells using Pmyo-3 (plasmid wp124) (43Okkema P.G. Harrison S.W. Plunger V. Aryana A. Fire A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 385-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine subcellular localization, two UNC-9 fusion proteins were expressed independently in body-wall muscle cells under the control of Pmyo-3. In one fusion protein, Myc was fused to the amino terminus of UNC-9 (Pmyo-3::myc::unc-9 cDNA, wp390). In the other fusion protein, GFP was fused to the carboxyl terminus of UNC-9 (Pmyo-3::unc-9 cDNA::gfp, wp206). The expression and localization patterns of DsRed2 and GFP were evaluated by examining epifluorescence of the fluorescent proteins in transgenic animals. The localization pattern of Myc::UNC-9 was determined by immunohistochemistry in whole mount animals following a published protocol (42Nonet M.L. Staunton J.E. Kilgard M.P. Fergestad T. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Jorgensen E.M. Meyer B.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8061-8073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Myc (Sigma) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The epifluorescence was visualized and photographed with a Nikon TE2000-U inverted microscope connected to a cooled monochrome digital camera (F-view II, Soft Imaging System GmbH, Germany). A 40× objective, and fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red filters (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT) were used for fluorescence imaging. Measurement of Locomotion Velocity—Locomotion assays were performed at room temperature on healthy adult hermaphrodites. A piece of paper with a circular hole (7 mm in diameter) was laid on top of the bacterial lawn in the culture plate to restrict animal movements within the field of observation. A single animal was placed in the center of the field to start the assay. The plate was left undisturbed for 7 min while it was photographed at 2-s intervals with the F-view II digital camera mounted on a Nikon SMZ800 stereomicroscope. The camera was operated through analySIS ® Imager software (Soft Imaging System GmbH). The distance traveled by the animal from the beginning of the third minute to the end of the seventh minute was determined by measuring the length of locomotion tracks left behind by the animal using the “Polygon Length” measurement function of analySIS ®. Locomotion speed was calculated by dividing the distance with the time. Statistics and Graphing—To compensate the effect of Rs on clamp voltage (Vclamp), the actual membrane potential (Vactual) was calculated using the formula, Vactual = Vclamp – Im× Rs, where Im is the whole cell membrane current. The mean current between the 50th and 100th ms at each Vj step was determined with Clampfit (Axon Instruments) after low pass filtering at 300 Hz and is considered as steady-state Ij, although it may not be truly steady state in some traces. For selected groups, instantaneous currents (the average current during the initial 2 ms of the Vj step) were also determined. In the latter case, the collected data were not further filtered during the analysis. The Ij-Vj relationship was plotted for each experiment. The Gj was determined from the slope conductance of the Ij-Vj relationship (–30 to +30 mV when Vhold was –30 mV, and –30 to 0 mV when Vhold was –60 mV). Vj was defined as “Vm of cell #2 – Vm of cell #1.” The apparent steady-state Gj was fitted to the Boltzmann function: Gjss = (1 – Gjmin)/{1 + exp[A(V – Vo)]} + Gjmin, where Gjss is the steady-state conductance, Gjmin is the minimum conductance, A is the cooperativity constant, and Vo is the voltage at which the decrease in Gjss is half-maximal (46Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Data graphing and fitting were performed with Origin (version 7.5, OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Statistical analyses were performed with Origin and SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All values are shown as mean ± S.E. “n” equals the number of cell pairs analyzed. Body-wall Muscle Cells Were Electrically Coupled in a Highly Specific Pattern—The 95 body-wall muscle cells of C. elegans are organized into two ventral quadrants and two dorsal quadrants. All electrophysiological experiments were performed on muscle cells in the two ventral quadrants (Fig. 1). At first, two adjoining muscle cells from different rows in the same quadrant (e.g. the R1R2 or L1L2 pair in Fig. 1) were analyzed. In response to a series of voltage steps applied to cell #1, Ij developed in cell #2 in a Vj-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, panel a). A bell-shaped relationship was observed between Gj and Vj (Fig. 2B), which is characteristic of gap junctions (5Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 47Bukauskas F.F. Verselis V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 42-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and is well fit by a Boltzmann function (46Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) with A = 0.10, Vo = 40, and Gjmin = 0.13. In contrast, Gj of the body-wall muscle was independent of Vm (Fig. 2C). The amplitude of Ij remained constant when the cell receiving the voltage steps was interchanged in the same pair (not shown). Thus, adjoining muscle cells from different rows in the same quadrant were electrically coupled in a non-rectifying manner. No significant Ij was detected between muscle cells in sequence in the same row (the R1R1 and R2R2 pairs) (Fig. 2, A (panel c) and D). The lack of coupling in R1R1 and R2R2 pairs suggests that second-order coupling (coupling of two R1s through a common R2 or vice versa) was undetectable in body-wall muscle cells. The coupling of adjoining muscle cells from different rows but not the same row within the same quadrant paints a wave-like coupling pattern (Fig. 2E, pan"

https://openalex.org/W1987857615,"Acanthamoeba CARMIL was previously shown to co-purify with capping protein (CP) and to bind pure CP. Here we show that this interaction inhibits the barbed end-capping activity of CP. Even more strikingly, this interaction drives the uncapping of actin filaments previously capped with CP. These activities are CP-specific; CARMIL does not inhibit the capping activities of either gelsolin or CapG and does not uncap gelsolin-capped filaments. Although full-length (FL) CARMIL (residues 1-1121) possesses both anti-CP activities, C-terminal fragments like glutathione S-transferase (GST)-P (940-1121) that contain the CARMIL CP binding site are at least 10 times more active. We localized the full activities of GST-P to its C-terminal 51 residues (1071-1121). This sequence contains a stretch of 25 residues that is highly conserved in CARMIL proteins from protozoa, flies, worms, and vertebrates (CARMIL Homology domain 3; CAH3). Point mutations showed that the majority of the most highly conserved residues within CAH3 are critical for the anti-CP activity of GST-AP (862-1121). Finally, we found that GST-AP binds CP ∼20-fold more tightly than does FL-CARMIL. This observation together with the elevated activities of C-terminal fragments relative to FL-CARMIL suggests that FL-CARMIL might exist primarily in an autoinhibited state. Consistent with this idea, proteolytic cleavage of FL-CARMIL with thrombin generated an ∼14-kDa C-terminal fragment that expresses full anti-CP activities. We propose that, after some type of physiological activation event, FL-CARMIL could function in vivo as a potent CP antagonist. Given the pivotal role that CP plays in determining the global actin phenotype of cells, our results suggest that CARMIL may play an important role in the physiological regulation of actin assembly.

The spatial and temporal control of actin polymerization is essential for a host of fundamental cellular processes such as cell migration, endocytosis, and cytokinesis (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G.

In vivo, actin polymerization occurs primarily at the barbed (fast-growing) end of the actin filament. Mechanisms that control the number of barbed ends are crucial, therefore, in the regulation of actin assembly within cells. Cells appear to use at least three mechanisms to generate barbed ends (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G.

First, barbed ends are created de novo by the action of the Arp2/3 complex and the formins, two actin-nucleating machines that drive the formation of branched (Arp2/3) and unbranched (formin) actin structures (5Welch M.D. Mullins R.D.

CP binds the barbed end of the actin filament tightly (Kd = 0.1-1.0 nm), and its presence there blocks both the association and dissociation of actin monomers (14Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 418-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The association of CP with the barbed end (capping) terminates filament elongation, whereas the dissociation of CP from a pre-capped actin filament (uncapping) creates a free barbed end, allowing the resumption of filament elongation. The extent to which CP can influence actin assembly and organization in vivo was revealed in dramatic fashion by a recent study that used RNA-mediated interference to reduce the cellular level of CP (15Mejillano M.R. Kojima S. Applewhite D.A. Gertler F.B. Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Specifically, B16 melanoma cells depleted of the majority of CP exhibited a striking diminution in the size of their lamellipodia and a dramatic increase in the number of filopodia on their surface. In addition to demonstrating a pivotal role for CP in determining the global organization of the actin cytoskeleton, this (15Mejillano M.R. Kojima S. Applewhite D.A. Gertler F.B. Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and previous studies (11Amatruda J.F. Cannon J.F. Tatchell K. Hug C. Cooper J.A.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1293-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) of CP function in vivo highlight the necessity of identifying physiological regulators of CP. One potential regulator of CP is CARMIL. CARMIL proteins comprise a novel family of molecules whose two most conspicuous features are a central, leucine-rich repeat domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (16Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer J.A. II I J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Genes encoding CARMIL proteins have been identified so far in Acanthamoeba, Dictyostelium, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, mouse, and man (16Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer J.A. II I J.

Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The first CARMIL protein to be identified was Acan125 (19Xu P. Zot A.S. Zot H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25316-25319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This 125-kDa Acanthamoeba protein was discovered based on its ability to bind to the isolated SH3 domain of Acanthamoeba myosin-IC, a monomeric unconventional myosin. Mapping studies showed that two PXXP motifs present within the Acan125 C-terminal proline-rich domain are responsible for its interaction with the myosin I SH3 domain (16Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, Jung et al. (17Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer J.A. II I J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) subsequently identified p116, the Dictyostelium homologue of Acan125. Importantly, the eluates of their myosin I SH3 domain affinity columns contained on a consistent basis not only p116 but also CP and the Arp2/3 complex. Immunoprecipitation reactions and other experiments provided evidence that p116 forms a complex with CP, Arp2/3, and myosin I in vivo and that p116 serves as the scaffold for assembly of this complex by binding CP, Arp2/3 and myosin I at independent sites. Given its central role in forming the complex, Jung et al. (17Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer J.A. II I J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) gave p116 the name CARMIL for capping protein, ARp2/3, myosin I linker. Recent efforts to purify Acanthamoeba CARMIL have provided evidence that CARMIL interacts tightly with CP (20Remmert K. Olszewski T.E. Bowers M.B. Dimitrova M. Ginsburg A. Hammer J.A. II I J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3068-3077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). First, CARMIL and CP were found to co-purify through a lengthy purification procedure that included ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography. Second, the mixture of CARMIL and CP that was obtained from these steps was only partially resolved by size exclusion chromatography despite the fact that these two proteins differ enormously in Stokes radius. Complete resolution of CARMIL and CP by gel filtration required the use of a running buffer with a pH of 5.4. Third, measurements of bound and free fractions in CARMIL·CP mixtures using analytical ultracentrifugation and SH3 domain pull-down assays indicated that CARMIL binds CP with an affinity of ∼0.4 μm or tighter. Given this affinity and the reported cellular concentrations of both proteins (∼1 μm for CP (21Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and ∼2 μm for CARMIL (22Lee W.L. Ostap E.M. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35159-35171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), Remmert et al. (20Remmert K. Olszewski T.E. Bowers M.B. Dimitrova M. Ginsburg A. Hammer J.A. II I J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3068-3077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggested that a significant amount of CP might be complexed with CARMIL in vivo. In terms of the possible functional consequences of forming this complex, Remmert et al. (20Remmert K. Olszewski T.E. Bowers M.B. Dimitrova M. Ginsburg A. Hammer J.A. II I J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3068-3077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) raised two possibilities. First, if CP can no longer cap the barbed end when bound to CARMIL, then forming the CARMIL·CP complex would reduce the level of free, active CP, favoring actin polymerization. If on the other hand CP still functions when bound to CARMIL, then the CARMIL·CP complex could function as a novel barbed end cap that might further recruit myosin I and the Arp2/3 complex to the filament end. In this study we used CARMIL and CARMIL fragments to characterize the effects of the protein on CP function. Our data show that the binding of CARMIL to CP inhibits the ability of CP to cap the barbed end. We also found to our surprise that CARMIL promotes the rapid dissociation of CP from the ends of actin filaments previously capped with CP, i.e. it promotes uncapping. Although FL-CARMIL is able to perform both of these anti-CP functions, C-terminal fragments of CARMIL that contain its CP binding site perform both tasks much more effectively. These and other observations suggest that, in the absence of some uncharacterized activating event, FL-CARMIL probably folds into a low activity state. Consistent with this, thrombin digestion of FL-CARMIL generates a C-terminal fragment that expresses full anti-CP activity. Together, our results suggest that CARMIL might play a significant role in controlling actin assembly in vivo by antagonizing in a regulated fashion the function of CP in two important ways. Proteins—Full-length (FL) Acanthamoeba CARMIL and CARMIL lacking its P domain (ΔP-CARMIL) were expressed in Sf9 cells with a FLAG tag at their N terminus. For FL-CARMIL, the FLAG tag (MDYKDDDDK) was added N-terminal of CARMIL residue 2 by amplifying the entire CARMIL coding sequence using Long Distance Polymerase Mix (Roche Applied Science), a full-length Acan125 cDNA as the template (a generous gift of H. Zot), and the primers 5′-TGCAGAATTCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGAGGAGTCGATCATCCAGCAGCGGCGGT-3′ and 5′-ATGGAGATCTAGCCCACCTCCAAGCAAGGCGCTCTAGTCGGCGGTGCTCATCATGGGCCTGC-3′. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and BglII and ligated into pBluescript SK digested with EcoRI and BamHI. An internal MluI/SphI fragment spanning ∼2.7 kb of the PCR product was replaced with the corresponding fragment from the parental Acan125 cDNA clone. The insert in the resulting construct (pBS-FLAG-Acan125) was released with EcoRI and NotI and cloned into pVL1393 (Invitrogen). To create ΔP-CARMIL, which lacks the C-terminal 167 residues of CARMIL, a portion of the FL-CARMIL insert in pBS-FLAG-Acan125 was removed by digestion with SphI and HindIII, and the gap was filled with a small double-stranded fragment made by annealing the following two oligonucleotides: 5′-CCCTAGAGCGCCTTGCTTGGAGGTGGGCTGCGGCCGC-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGCGGCCGCAGCCCACCTCCAAGCAAGGCGTCCTAGGGCATG-3′ (this fragment contains, in order, an SphI site cohesive end, a stop codon, a short stretch of 3′-untranslated region, a NotI site, and a Hind III site cohesive end). The insert in the resulting construct was released with EcoRI and NotI and cloned into pVL1393. After sequence confirmation, both pVL1393 constructs were transfected into Sf9 cells, and amplified virus stocks were prepared by standard procedures. We assume that the addition of the FLAG tag to CARMIL does not alter in any significant way its biochemical properties. For protein expression, 4 × 108 Sf9 cells were suspended in 250 ml of serum-free SF900-II medium (Invitrogen), mixed with 12 ml of amplified viral stock, distributed to ten 150-mm dishes, and incubated at 27 °C in the dark for 72 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle, and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 40 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysis was facilitated by homogenization using a glass Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes on ice) and incubation on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, mixed with 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma, A2220), and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed 5 times (15 ml per wash) using 1× TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) and FLAG-tagged CARMIL eluted using 3 ml of 1× TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml synthetic FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK). The eluted fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue, and the fractions containing FL-CARMIL or ΔP-CARMIL were pooled and dialyzed against Mono Q buffer A (25 mm Mops (pH 7.2), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). CARMIL proteins were further purified by chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) using a 50-500 mm KCl gradient made with Mono Q buffer A and Mono Q buffer B (25 mm Mops (pH 7.2), 500 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA). Aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. The preparation of the GST fusion proteins GST-VAP, GST-VA, GST-AP, and GST-P was reported previously (20Remmert K. Olszewski T.E. Bowers M.B. Dimitrova M. Ginsburg A. Hammer J.A. II I J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3068-3077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To prepare GST-51aa, a DNA fragment containing CARMIL residues 1071-1121 with flanking BamHI and EcoRI sites was created by PCR using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), pBS-FLAG-Acan125 as the template, and the primers 5′-CGGGGATCCAAGGAGCCCGAACCCGCCTCGGCGGA-3′ and 5′-AAGCGAATTCTAGTCGGCGGTGCTCATCATGGGC-3′. The product was digested with BamH1 and EcoR1 and cloned into pGEX-2TK. GST-A was prepared by PCR amplification of a DNA fragment containing CARMIL residues 868-939 with flanking BamHI and EcoRI sites using the primers 5′-CGGGGATCCCAGGTCGAAAGCGCCGACACACGTGC-3′ and 5′-AAGCGAATTCTACATCGGCACGCCGGTCGGTCGC-3′. The product was digested with EcoR1 and BamH1 and cloned into pGEX-2T. Versions of GST-AP carrying point mutations in the CAH3 domain were prepared using the appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotides, the AP insert cloned in pBluescript SK, and a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) carrying the GST fusion was grown for 4 h at 37 °C after the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle, resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors), and broken by 2 passes through a French press (20,000 p.s.i.). The lysate was then made 0.4% with Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 20 min, and clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 0.8 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The resin was washed 5 times (15 ml per wash) with PBS at 4 °C, and the fusion protein was eluted with elution buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma, G4251)). Eluted proteins were further purified using a Mono Q column as described above. Proteins were dialyzed into storage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA) and stored at -80 °C. To prepare the GST-free, 51-residue peptide (51aa), 1 ml of GST-51aa beads was resuspended in 0.9 ml of PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 50 units of thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation at 24 °C for 16 h, the supernatant containing cleaved 51aa was passed three times through a column containing 1 ml of p-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma, A-7155) and 0.1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads to remove thrombin and GST proteins, respectively. The eluate containing 51aa was dialyzed against storage buffer (Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA) and concentrated using a Centricon 3 membrane (Amicon). Mass spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the cleaved peptide contained the last 51 residues of CARMIL and an additional 8 amino acids (GSRRASVG) derived from pGEX-2TK. Acanthamoeba capping protein was purified using a novel method 3K. Remmert, T. Uruno, and J. Hammer, manuscript in preparation. in which purified GST-AP was covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads and used as an affinity matrix for purifying CP from crude cell extracts. Briefly, 50 g of frozen Acanthamoeba cell pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of 1× TBS (Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA, and lysed by thawing on ice. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was supplemented with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% and incubated with 5 ml of GST-AP affinity matrix for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. The matrix was washed extensively with 1× TBS at 4 °C, and CP was eluted with low pH elution buffer (100 mm MES (pH 5.4), 500 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA). Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining, pooled, dialyzed against Mono Q buffer A, and purified by chromatography on a Mono Q column as described above. Purified CP was dialyzed against CP storage buffer (50% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.3), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA) and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assay using BSA as standard and verified by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining using a dilution series of the sample and the BSA standard. For 51aa, the Bio-Rad assay underestimated its concentration by a factor of 8-10, so the concentration of 51aa was estimated using Coomassie Blue-stained gels loaded with known amounts of GST-51aa cleaved with thrombin. Actin Assembly Assays and Estimation of Actin Critical Concentration—Actin was purified from Acanthamoeba castellanii according to the method of Gordon et al. (23Gordon D.J. Eisenberg E. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a HiPrep Sephacryl S200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified, monomeric actin was stored at 4 °C with continuous dialysis in fresh G buffer-Ca (3 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.75 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% NaN3). Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared by labeling monomeric actin with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) according to the method of Kouyama and Mihashi (24Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Labeled actin was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiPrep Sephacryl S200 column and stored lyophilized at -80 °C. Before use, pyrene-labeled actin was resuspended in G buffer-Ca and dialyzed in the same buffer extensively. Actin critical concentration measurements were made according to standard methods (25Mullins R.D. Machesky L.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 214-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a stock solution of G-actin (20 μm, 5-10% pyrene-labeled) in G buffer-Ca was incubated with 0.1 volume of 10× exchange buffer (10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) for 3 min at 24 °C and polymerized for 1 h at 24 °C by the addition of 0.1 volume of 10× KMEI buffer (100 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA). Polymerized actin was diluted into 1× polymerization buffer without additions or with tested proteins at fixed concentrations to make an actin dilution series. Pyrene fluorescence was measured after 24 h to determine the extent of polymerization, and the data were plotted as a function of actin concentration. Pointed end elongation assays were performed as described (26Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) using the gelsolin-actin complex as seeds. Briefly, bovine plasma gelsolin (Sigma, G-8032) was resuspended in G buffer-Ca and dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 3 mm NaN3. Dialyzed gelsolin was mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of Ca-ATP-G-actin in G buffer-Ca supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C to prepare a stock of gelsolin-actin complex (5 μm). Acanthamoeba Arp2/3 complex was purified as described previously (27Kelleher J.F. Mullins R.D. Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Barbed end elongation assays were performed using either phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments as seeds or spectrin-actin seeds (SAS). To prepare phalloidin-stabilized actin filament seeds, Mg-ATP-G-actin (10 μm, 10% pyrene-labeled) was polymerized at room temperature for 1 h, mixed with an equal volume of 1× polymerization buffer (G-buffer-Mg plus 1× KMEI) containing 10 μm phalloidin (Molecular Probes, P-3456), and incubated at 24 °C for 1 h. Profilin was purified from Acanthamoeba as described previously (27Kelleher J.F. Mullins R.D. Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and used at final concentration of 4 μm in assays employing phalloidin-stabilized actin filament seeds to ensure that actin filament elongation occurs primarily at the barbed end. Spectrin-actin seeds were prepared from human red blood cells as described (28DiNubile M.J. Cassimeris L. Joyce M. Zigmond S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1659-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and were a generous gift of S. Zigmond. SAS were stored in 50% ethylene glycol at -20 °C. Recombinant CapG was a kind gift of F. Southwick. For barbed end elongation assays, G-actin was added to the reaction as Mg-ATP-actin. A stock solution of monomeric Mg-ATP actin (20 μm, 5 or 10% pyrenyl-actin) was generated by adding 0.1 volume of a solution containing 10 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgCl2 to a stock of Ca-ATP-actin and incubating for 3 min at 24 °C. Assays were assembled by applying separate drops of F buffer (G buffer-Mg supplemented with 0.1 volume of 10× KMEI), 10× KMEI buffer, and Mg-ATP-actin in G buffer-Mg (2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.01% NaN3) to the sides of Eppendorf tubes and mixing by three gentle strokes of pipetting. Test proteins were added either to the F buffer or as separate drops. Actin polymerization was then initiated by the addition of seeds. Actin polymerization was monitored by measuring the change in fluorescence of pyrenyl actin (excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm) using either a PTI fluorescence luminometer (Model QM-1 system) or an LS55 luminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The concentration of filament ends was calculated using the equation R(t) = k+ [End(t)](G(t) - Cc), where R(t) equals the elongation rate at a given, k+ equals the monomer association rate constant (10 μm-1·s-1) (29Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), [End(t)] equals the concentration of free barbed ends (μm) at time t, G(t) equals the concentration of actin monomer at time t (μm), and Cc equals the actin critical concentration (assumed to be 0.2 μm under all conditions). The elongation rate, R(t), is dF(t)/dt = -dG(t)/dt. F(t) is the mass of actin polymer at time t, derived from the fluorescence of pyrene-actin, and G(t) was calculated from G(t) = G(0) - F(t). G(0) equals the original actin concentration. The time-dependent change in the concentration of filament ends was calculated to obtain the concentration of barbed ends at steady state for each condition. Determination of the Apparent Affinity of GST-AP for CP—An E. coli lysate containing GST-AP was mixed with a lysate expressing GST alone at a volume ratio of ∼1:8 and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h. Control beads loaded with GST only were prepared"
https://openalex.org/W2049253602,"Aberrant thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are found in over 70% of the human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) analysed. To better understand the role(s) of these TR mutants in this neoplasia, we analysed a panel of HCC mutant receptors for their molecular properties. Virtually all HCC-associated TR mutants tested retained the ability to repress target genes in the absence of T3, yet were impaired in T3-driven gene activation and functioned as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type TR activity. Intriguingly, the HCC TRα1 mutants exerted dominant-negative interference at all T3 concentrations tested, whereas the HCC TRβ1 mutants were dominant-negatives only at low and intermediate T3 concentrations, reverting to transcriptional activators at higher hormone levels. The relative affinity for the SMRT versus N-CoR corepressors was detectably altered for several of the HCC mutant TRs, suggesting changes in corepressor preference and recruitment compared to wild type. Several of the TRα HCC mutations also altered the DNA recognition properties of the encoded receptors, indicating that these HCC TR mutants may regulate a distinct set of target genes from those regulated by wild-type TRs. Finally, whereas wild-type TRs interfere with c-Jun/AP-1 function in a T3-dependent fashion and suppress anchorage-independent growth when ectopically expressed in HepG2 cells, at least certain of the HCC mutants did not exert these inhibitory properties. These alterations in transcriptional regulation and DNA recognition appear likely to contribute to oncogenesis by reprogramming the differentiation and proliferative properties of the hepatocytes in which the mutant TRs are expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2064150730,"The specialized yeast mitochondrial chaperone system, composed of the Hsp70 Ssq1p, its co-chaperone J-protein Jac1p, and the nucleotide release factor Mge1p, perform a critical function in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins. Using a spectroscopic assay, we have analyzed the potential role of the chaperones in Fe/S cluster assembly on the scaffold protein Isu1p in vitro in the presence of the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1p. In the absence of chaperones, the kinetics of Fe/S cluster formation on Isu1p were compatible with a chemical reconstitution pathway with Nfs1p functioning as a sulfide donor. Addition of Ssq1p improved the rates of Fe/S cluster assembly 3-fold. However, this stimulatory effect of Ssq1p required neither ATP nor Jac1p and could be fully attributed to the activation of the Nfs1p desulfurase activity by Ssq1p. Furthermore, chaperone-stimulated Fe/S cluster assembly did not involve the specific interaction between Isu1p and Ssq1p, since the effect was observed with Isu1p mutant proteins defective in this interaction, suggesting that nonspecific binding of Ssq1p to Nfs1p helped to prevent its unfolding. Consistent with this idea, these Isu1p mutants were capable of binding an Fe/S cluster in vivo but failed to restore the growth and Fe/S cluster assembly defects of a Isu1p/Isu2p-deficient yeast strain. Taken together, these data suggest that Ssq1p/Jac1p/Mge1p are not important for Fe/S cluster synthesis on Isu1p. Hence, consistent with previous in vivo data, these chaperones likely function in steps subsequent to the de novo synthesis of the Fe/S cluster on Isu1p."
https://openalex.org/W2137207996,"A mutation linked to autistic spectrum disorders encodes an Arg to Cys replacement in the C-terminal portion of the extracellular domain of neuroligin-3. The solvent-exposed Cys causes virtually complete retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum when the protein is expressed in transfected cells. An identical Cys substitution was reported for butyrylcholinesterase through genotyping patients with post-succinylcholine apnea. Neuroligin, butyrylcholinesterase, and acetylcholinesterase are members of the α,β-hydrolase fold family of proteins sharing sequence similarity and common tertiary structures. Although these proteins have distinct oligomeric assemblies and cellular dispositions, homologous Arg residues in neuroligin-3 (Arg-451), in butyrylcholinesterase (Arg-386), and in acetylcholinesterase (Arg-395) are conserved in all studied mammalian species. To examine whether an homologous Arg to Cys mutation affects related proteins similarly despite their differing capacities to oligomerize, we inserted homologous mutations in the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase cDNAs. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy and analysis of oligosaccharide processing, we find that the homologous Arg to Cys mutation also results in endoplasmic reticulum retention of the two cholinesterases. Small quantities of mutated acetylcholinesterase exported from the cell retain activity but show a greater Km, a much smaller kcat, and altered substrate inhibition. The nascent proteins associate with chaperones during processing, but the mutation presumably restricts processing through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, because of local protein misfolding and inability to oligomerize. The mutation may alter the capacity of these proteins to dissociate from their chaperone prior to oligomerization and processing for export.

The mutation may alter the capacity of these proteins to dissociate from their chaperone prior to oligomerization and processing for export. Several mutations that were found in human neuroligin 3 and 4 genes appear to be associated with the autistic spectrum disorders (1Jamain S. Quach H. Betancur C. Rastam M. Colineaux C. Gillberg I.C.

One of the more interesting mutations is an Arg to Cys mutation found in neuroligin-3 (NL-3) 3The abbreviations used are: NL, neuroligin; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; BChE, butyrylcholinesterase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PNGase F, N-glycosidase F, HEK, human embryonic kidney; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; RT, reverse transcriptase. at position 451 near the C terminus of the extracellular domain (1Jamain S. Quach H. Betancur C. Rastam M. Colineaux C. Gillberg I.C. Soder-strom H. Giros B. Leboyer M. Gillberg C. Bourgeron T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). This mutation, identified in an affected twin set, has been shown to give rise to an altered cellular phenotype. The protein is largely retained intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with little of the nascent protein reaching its cell membrane location (3Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4Chih B. Afridi S.K. Clark L. Scheiffele P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, the residual protein that reaches the cell surface has an altered affinity for its cognate partner, β-neurexin (3Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). When Arg-451 (rat numbering, Arg-471) is mutated to a Thr or a Glu, the mutant NL is exported normally but shows significantly lower affinity for β-neurexins (3Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis of the secreted fraction of the R471C-NL3 mutant indicated that the mutated protein had an unaltered disulfide bonding pattern (3Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Arg-451 is highly conserved within the NL family and across mammalian species. This residue is also conserved in many other α,β-hydrolase fold proteins. Recently, a cysteine substitution for the conserved arginine in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was found as an infrequent mutation in patient populations with post-succinylcholine apnea (5Yen T. Nightingale B.N. Burns J.C. Sullivan D.R. Stewart P.M. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6On-Kei Chan A. Lam C.W. Tong S.F. Man Tung C. Yung K. Chan Y.W.

Genet. Metab. 2005; 84: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BChE appears as a soluble tetramer in the plasma but is synthesized in liver (8Darvesh S. Hopkins D.A. Geula C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The physiological function of BChE is not clear; nevertheless, the enzyme has proven critical in inactivating various administered drugs such as succinylcholine (9Giacobini E. Butyrylcholinesterase, Its Function and Inhibitors. Martin Dunitz Ltd., London2003: 1-181Google Scholar). The cloning of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene 2 decades ago revealed a new protein family structurally distinct from other hydrolases of the then known structures (10Schumacher M. Camp S. Maulet Y. Newton M. MacPhee-Quigley K. Taylor S.S. Friedmann T. Taylor P. Nature. 1986; 319: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and homology of AChE to a large domain in thyroglobulin suggested a new superfamily of proteins with diverse functions extending beyond hydrolytic reactions (10Schumacher M. Camp S. Maulet Y. Newton M. MacPhee-Quigley K. Taylor S.S. Friedmann T. Taylor P. Nature. 1986; 319: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Subsequently a variety of homologous hydrolases have been identified that fall in this family as do several proteins that lack hydrolase activity but function as adhesion proteins (11Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 12Holmquist M. Curr. Protein Pept.

Martin Dunitz Ltd., London2000: 63-79Google Scholar). Among these, the neuroligins are the only ones of mammalian origin that have been identified and characterized to date (14Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 15Scholl F.G. Scheiffele P. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 618-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The commonality of tertiary structure has enabled one to classify these proteins as members of the α,β-hydrolase fold family (16Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The neuroligins are a family of multidomain transmembrane-spanning proteins expressed on the postsynaptic side of the synapse (14Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 17Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extracellular region is homologous to AChE and serves as the extracellular recognition portion of the molecule. C-terminal to this recognition domain is a linking O-glycosylation-rich region followed by a transmembrane span and a cytoplasmic region with recognition capacity for PDZ proteins. The association of NL with β-neurexin and perhaps α-neurexin provides a potential trans-synaptic interaction. Accordingly, the neuroligins presumably display a capacity to stimulate formation and maturation of new excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the central nervous system (19Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 20Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E.

Cell. 2004; 119: 1013-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Although the molecular details of the neuroligin-neurexin association that underlie this function are not understood, a crystal structure of neurexin has been reported (24Rudenko G. Nguyen T. Chelliah Y. Sudhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 1999; 99: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the structure of neuroligin has been inferred from its homology to AChE (25Tsigelny I. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Sudhof T.C. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Hoffman R.C. Jennings L.L. Tsigelny I. Comoletti D. Flynn R.E. Sudhof T.C. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By constructing truncated, soluble forms of neuroligin, we characterized the disulfide bonding and glycosylation pattern of NL and demonstrated secondary structural features that are similar to AChE (26Hoffman R.C. Jennings L.L. Tsigelny I. Comoletti D. Flynn R.E. Sudhof T.C. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Comoletti D. Flynn R. Jennings L.L. Chubykin A.

In contrast to NL, cholinesterases do not possess a transmembrane spanning region but rather associate with membranes through either an attached glycophospholipid or by attachment to structural subunits that associate with the plasma membrane or basement membrane (13Taylor P. Luo Z.D. Camp S. Giacobini E. Cholinesterases and Cholinesterase Inhibitors. Martin Dunitz Ltd., London2000: 63-79Google Scholar, 28Massoulié J. Giacobini E. Cholinesterases and Cholinesterase Inhibitors. Martin Dunitz Ltd., London2000: 81-101Google Scholar). Moreover, the alternative splicing mechanism that controls the nature of the membrane attachment of AChE also influences its degree of its oligomerization. Homomeric dimers and tetramers have been identified, as have heteromeric associations between catalytic and structural subunits (13Taylor P. Luo Z.D. Camp S. Giacobini E. Cholinesterases and Cholinesterase Inhibitors. Martin Dunitz Ltd., London2000: 63-79Google Scholar, 29Massoulié J. Anselmet A. Bon S. Krejci E. Legay C. Morel N. Simon S. J. Physiol.

Accordingly, given the distinct assembly modes of this family of proteins, we sought to determine whether a mutation at homologous residue positions in AChE and BChE would give rise to similar processing aberrations as those seen with the neuroligins. The data presented here suggest that the mutation results in a common folding and processing deficiency. This particular mutation may also uncover mechanistic details essential for catalytic activity, subunit assembly, and oligomerization of nascent proteins belonging to the α,β-hydrolase fold family. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—A cDNA encoding mouse GPI-AChE was subcloned into a FLAG-tagged vector (Sigma) for detection and purification. The natural leader peptide of AChE was replaced by the pre-protrypsin leader peptide. The N-terminal FLAG is followed by a linker peptide of 10 residues and by the AChE sequence beginning at Glu-1 (sequence of the mature mouse AChE protein). Soluble monomeric mouse AChE (AChE-548) was constructed by introducing a stop codon at Cys-549 of mouse AChE-GPI as described previously (31Marchot P. Ravelli R.B. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C. Kanter J. Camp S. Sussman J.L. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Arg-395 → Cys (R395C) and Leu-386 → Cys (L386C) mutations were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and were subsequently subcloned into expression vectors. Mutations were verified by automated sequencing. Plasmids were purified using DEAE columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Rat NL1 and NL3 wild type constructs and the Arg to Cys mutants were described previously by Comoletti et al. (3Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The pGS vector containing cDNA encoding human BChE was described previously (32Blong R.M. Bedows E. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis introduced the Cys mutation at Arg-386. A FLAG tag was added to the C terminus of wild type BChE after Leu-574 (32Blong R.M. Bedows E. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK-293 cells were maintained at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids (10 μg) carrying the neomycin resistance gene were transfected into HEK-293 cells with (Ca)3(PO4)2 precipitation or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Stably transfected cells were selected with G418 (Geneticin, Sigma) as described elsewhere (27Comoletti D. Flynn R. Jennings L.L. Chubykin A. Matsumura T. Hasegawa H. Sudhof T.C. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50497-50505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although initial studies were conducted on protein generated after transient transfection, clonal cells were selected for studies of mRNA levels, enzyme activity at 31 and 37 °C, kinetic profiles, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Wild type and mutant AChEs were also purified on affinity columns to apparent homogeneity for the kinetic and turnover studies. BChE was studied only after transient transfection. Cell Surface Activity and Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cells were rinsed and harvested by removal from the dish in phosphate-buffered saline, and activity was measured on the surface of intact cells. Proteins were extracted from cells in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 plus a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 5 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin, 10 μg/ml bacitracin, and 0.01 mm benzamidine (33Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated on ice for 10 min and then spun at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants containing all solubilized proteins were used for subsequent experiments. Assay of AChE and BChE Catalytic Activity—To avoid serum AChE contamination, selected clones of transfected cells were maintained in serum-free Ultraculture medium supplemented with l-glutamine (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). Media were collected at 48-h intervals, pooled for purification, and assayed for AChE or BChE activity using 0.5 mm acetylthiocholine iodide or 5 mm butyrylthiocholine iodide as substrates (34Ellman G.L. Courtney Jr., K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar). Both media and cell-associated AChE activities were then normalized to the total cell protein content (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether AChE expression could be enhanced at low temperature, 80% confluent cells were cultured for 48 h at 31 °C prior to harvesting. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Western blots were performed as described by Towbin et al. (36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude cell extracts (20 μg of total protein) or batch anti-FLAG immunoprecipitated proteins from cell culture media were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). After transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocking of nonspecific binding was achieved by incubating the membrane with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl, containing 5% nonfat dry milk, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer as follows: anti-AChE polyclonal (37Jennings L.L. Malecki M. Komives E.A. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11083-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 1:4000; anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), 1:1000; anti NL-1 monoclonal (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany), 1:5000; anti-PTP-1B monoclonal (Calbiochem), 1:10,000; anti-BChE monoclonal antibody, 1:1. Monoclonal antibody to human BChE was prepared by the Monoclonal Core Facility at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The pure BChE protein used to form crystals (38Nicolet Y. Lockridge O. Masson P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nachon F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41141-41147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) was injected into mice for production of antibodies. Human BChE protein was truncated at residue 529 thereby missing residues 530-574. It was also devoid of carbohydrate chains at Asn-17, -455, -481, and -486. Hybridoma clone C191 2.1.1 secreted the monoclonal antibody into culture medium. Antibody hybridization was detected with ECL (Pierce). The proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (10 μm, Sigma), was applied to the cells 24 h after transient transfection, and the altered cellular disposition of NL-3, AChE, and BChE was assessed after treatment for 24 h. Total RNA Extraction, cDNA Preparation, and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) from one 100-mm tissue culture dish of HEK-293 cells stably transfected with wild type and mutant AChE constructs. DNase I turbo treatment (Ambion, Austin, TX) was performed to avoid any genomic DNA contamination. Four μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using the Superscript First-strand System (Invitrogen). One μl of the resulting cDNA was subjected to real time RT-PCR using Taqman primer/probe technology (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer/probe sets for detecting AChE (exon 3 to exon 4) and the endogenous reference gene β-actin are, respectively, Mm004772 75_m1 and Mm00607939_s1. PCRs were run according to the manufacturer's instructions. All assays were run in duplicate. The quantity of the target mRNA was calculated using the Sequence Detector software package version 1.7 (Applied Biosystems). AChE mRNA was normalized to β-actin mRNA allowing for measurement of the relative expression level of AChE mRNA with the comparative CT method (Applied Biosystems user's manual). Analysis of Glycosylation—Cell lysates (10 μg) from HEK-293 cells expressing NL1 and AChE wild type and mutant proteins were incubated with 1500 units of endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or 250 units of N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C for 3 h at pH 5.5 and 7.5, respectively. FLAG-tagged Wild type and R395C-AChE-548 Expression and Purification—Serum-free culture medium was collected from AChE-548 wild type and R395C-expressing cells maintained in triple layer flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Enzymes were purified by passing the media over an M2 anti-FLAG-affinity column (Sigma). The column was then washed with 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, with 450 mm NaCl and eluted using the FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 2.5-bed volumes of the Hepes buffer with NaCl containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Proteins were concentrated to ∼4 μm using Centriprep 30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at 4 °C. Purified proteins were used for AChE kinetics studies. Lower scale purification, from around 20 ml of media, was done to purify R395C-AChE and R386-BChE mutant proteins to be used for Endo H digestion. After purification, E386C BChE was also concentrated. Immunohistochemical Localization and Confocal Microscopy—Parental HEK-293, NL1, and AChE-GPI stably expressing cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, washed, and labeled for immunofluorescence (3Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) were mixed and diluted 1:500 and 1:200, respectively, with blocking buffer diluted 5-fold. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were diluted 1:100 in the same buffer. Image processing employed an MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal system (Bio-Rad) coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 35 M microscope. Determination of Kinetic Parameters for the AChE Catalytic Activity—AChE activity was measured over acetylthiocholine concentrations of 0.010 to 100 mm, and individual kinetic constants were assessed by nonlinear fitting of activities versus substrate concentration (39Radić Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The AChE catalytic turnover constant kcat was then determined by normalizing Vm to the concentration of AChE active sites. The concentration of active sites was determined by titration of AChE activity using the covalent, “irreversible” organophosphate inhibitor, (Sp)-dimethyl-butyl methylphosphonothiocholine (39Radić Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Expression of Cysteine-substituted AChE—The AChE gene was mutated so that the homologous Arg mutation in NL (Arg-451 → Cys) was also converted to a Cys in AChE (R395C) (Fig. 1). To analyze the effect of oligomeric assembly on the processing and export of AChE and its related proteins, two forms of mutated AChE were generated. The first is a truncated form of AChE terminating at residue 548 (AChE-548) that is expressed as a soluble monomer. This form lacks sequence necessary to form disulfide-linked dimers or larger oligomers of AChE (40Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar monomeric species of AChE have been identified in situ. The second form contained an amino acid sequence capable of forming a disulfide-linked dimer and the signal capable of adding a glycophospholipid linkage at its C terminus after cellular processing, AChE-GPI (42Futerman A.H. Fiorini R.M. Roth E. Low M.G. Silman I. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This form appears largely in hematopoietic cells as a dimer with the glycophospholipid tethering it to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (42Futerman A.H. Fiorini R.M. Roth E. Low M.G.

In contrast to the wild type form of AChE-548, activity is not detected in the culture medium when the R395C AChE-548 mutant is transfected into HEK-293 cells (Table 1). Measurement of cell-associated activity in the cell lysates of AChE-548 and R395C AChE-548 reveals intracellular activity in both the wild type and in the Cys mutant, although the R395C mutant has far lower activity than the wild type enzyme (Table 1).TABLE 1Expression of wild type and mutant mouse AChEs in HEK-293 cellsAChE gene productAChE activity,aActivity is normalized to total cell protein content.

Open table in a new tab Expression of the cDNA encoding AChE with the requisite signal sequence for addition of a glycophospholipid anchor at its C terminus, AChE-GPI, yields cells expressing AChE on the cell surface. Activity measurements on the intact cells show substantially reduced activity for the R395C mutant of the GPI form of AChE (Table 1). This reduction is also evident when the cells are extracted with Triton X-100 to reveal total cellular activity, suggesting that transport of AChE-GPI to its cell surface location is compromised with the R395C mutation (Table 1). Electrophoretic Analysis of Expressed AChE—Western blots to detect AChE protein production confirmed the activity measurements showing that virtually no R395C AChE-548 was exported into the media, whereas expression of the parent AChE-548 showed robust secretion into the media (Fig. 2A). Western blots using cell lysates in nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2B) show slightly higher cellular levels of R395C AChE-548 compared with the wild type enzyme indicating that the mutated R395C protein is synthesized but compromised in its capacity to be exported from the cell. The lower catalytic activity found for the cell lysates may reflect either inactivation of a metastable enzyme conformation or altered catalytic properties of the mutated AChE. The glycophospholipid forms of AChE, whether expressed in transfected cells or natively expressed on the erythrocyte surface, exist as disulfide-linked dimers with the C-terminal cysteine forming the inter-subunit linkage (41Haas R.

https://openalex.org/W2055497692,"Monastrol is a small molecule inhibitor that is specific for Eg5, a member of the kinesin 5 family of mitotic motors. Crystallographic models of Eg5 in the presence and absence of monastrol revealed that drug binding produces a variety of structural changes in the motor, including in loop L5 and the neck linker. What is not clear from static crystallographic models, however, is the sequence of structural changes produced by drug binding. Furthermore, because crystallographic structures can be influenced by the packing forces in the crystal, it also remains unclear whether these druginduced changes occur in solution, at physiologically active concentrations of monastrol or of other drugs that target this site. We have addressed these issues by using a series of spectroscopic probes to monitor the structural consequences of drug binding. Our results demonstrated that the crystallographic model of an Eg5-ADP-monastrol ternary complex is consistent with several solution-based spectroscopic probes. Furthermore, the kinetics of these spectroscopic signal changes allowed us to determine the temporal sequence of drug-induced structural transitions. These results suggested that L5 may be an element in the pathway that links the state of the nucleotide-binding site to the neck linker in kinesin motors.

The kinesins are a large superfamily of molecular motors that serve a wide variety of roles in the cell (1Goldstein L.S. Philp A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

These functions are to a large extent served by different families within the kinesin superfamily. For example, although members of the kinesin 1 family transport vesicles, members of the kinesin 5 family are involved in formation and maintenance of the spindle during mitosis. The members of this latter group appear to function by generating sustained opposing forces on the overlapping microtubules that project toward each other from the two spindle poles (5Kapitein L.C.

Monastrol is a prototypical inhibitor of Eg5 that appears to be uniquely specific for this member of the kinesin 5 family, and several laboratories have investigated its mechanism of action (14Cochran J.C.

Furthermore, one study argued that monastrol enhances the reversal of the ATP hydrolysis step (14Cochran J.C. Gatial J.E. Kapoor T. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol.

These include a folding of loop L5 to form the top of an induced fit, hydrophobic drug-binding cavity and a reorientation of the “switch II cluster” that is associated with docking of the neck linker (19Yan Y. Sardana V. Xu B. Homnick C. Halczenko W. Buser C.A. Schaber M. Hartman G.D. Huber H.E. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Loop L5 and α4, at the center of the switch II cluster, are separated by over 35 Å (18Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol.

It thus remains unclear how these conformational changes are induced by monastrol binding and how they are connected, given their wide separation.In our previous study of Eg5 (20Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35684-35695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we combined a series of novel spectroscopic approaches with transient kinetic measurements to develop a model of the structural changes that this molecular motor undergoes during its mechanochemical cycle. In this study, we use these and additional spectroscopic methodologies to determine the timing and the pathway of the structural changes produced in Eg5 by binding of monastrol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Media components were obtained from Difco. Protease inhibitors, isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside, and reagents for buffers and agarose gel electrophoresis were obtained from Sigma. Ribonuclease A and deoxyribonuclease I were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). Fluorescent probes were purchased from Molecular Probes. Synthesis and purification of 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP 3The abbreviations used are: mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; 2′dmD, 2′-deoxy,3′-mant-ADP; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; R0,Förster critical energy transfer distance, DHPC, dihydropyrancarboxamide; AMPPCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate). and 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP from N-methylisatoic anhydride and the corresponding nucleotides were carried out as described (21Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Monastrol, consisting of a mixture of the S and R enantiomers, was obtained from Calbiochem and prepared as a 5 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. Enantiomerically pure DHPC-1R was prepared in a related study 4Z. Maliga and T. J.

(2006) Patent pendingGoogle Scholar), and stored as a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO until use. A monomeric, cysteine light mutant of Eg5, containing the first 367 residues and a single reactive cysteine in the neck linker at position 365, was generated as described in our prior study (20Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35684-35695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and used in all of the studies described here. This construct retains the single tryptophan residue at position 127, within L5 (18Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Labeling of position 365 with Oregon Green 488 maleimide was accomplished by incubating the 2′dmD-labeled material with a 10-fold molar excess of fluorescent probe at room temperature for 30 min. Excess fluorophore was removed by sequential equilibrium dialysis through Centricon 10 tubes and gel filtration on pre-poured Sephadex G-25 columns (PD10; Amersham Biosciences). Labeling stoichiometry was typically 0.82–0.93. Labeling of the active site of the Oregon Green-modified construct with 2′dmD was accomplished by incubating Eg5 with a 20–50-fold molar excess of 2′dmD, incubating for 30 min at room temperature, and removing excess nucleotide by equilibrium dialysis and gel filtration as above.Kinetic Measurements—Transient kinetic measurements were made in an Applied Photophysics SX.18 MV stopped-flow spectrometer with an instrument dead time of 1.2 ms. Complexes of Eg5 and microtubules were formed by mixing the two with a slight excess of microtubules and incubating with apyrase as described in our previous studies. Mant nucleotide to Oregon Green fluorescence resonance energy transfer was monitored by exciting the mant donor at 350 nm and monitoring the emission through a 500-nm long pass filter. Tryptophan fluorescence emission was monitored by exciting the fluorophore at 295 nm and monitoring the emission using a 335-nm long pass filter.Transient Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed with a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter equipped with an IBH 5000 photon-counting lifetime system (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan). Data from donor-acceptor decays were analyzed as a static Gaussian distribution of distances, as described previously (23Xing J. Wriggers W. Jefferson G.M. Stein R. Cheung H.C. Rosenfeld S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35413-35423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Values of R0 using Oregon Green were calculated using the quantum yield of disodium fluorescein in 0.01 m NaOH as a reference (0.91; see Ref. 24Heidecker M. Yan-Marriott Y. Marriott G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11017-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).UV Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Continuous wave UV resonance Raman spectra were generated using the 229 nm output of a frequency-doubled argon ion laser (1.8 milliwatts at the sample). The Raman scattered light was collected, dispersed, and detected using a previously described (25Juszczak L. Hirsch R. Nagel R. Friedman J. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1998; 29: 963-968Crossref Google Scholar) UV Raman apparatus derived from a single spectrograph with a CCD detector. The sample-containing quartz NMR tubes were cooled (∼4–10 °C), spun, and vertically rastered to minimize sample heating and laser-induced degradation. The frequency scale of each spectrum was calibrated against the peaks of two reference solvents, indene and toluene, and is accurate to ±1 cm-1.RESULTSEffects of Drug Binding on Neck Linker Position and Dynamics as Monitored by FRET and Fluorescence Anisotropy Decay—Crystallographic models of Eg5:ADP in the presence and absence of monastrol suggest that drug binding induces the neck linker to dock along the switch II complex (19Yan Y. Sardana V. Xu B. Homnick C. Halczenko W. Buser C.A. Schaber M. Hartman G.D. Huber H.E. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), in a position analogous to what has been seen for the Kif1A-AMPPCP complex (26Kikkawa M. Sablin E.P. Okada Y. Yajima H. Fletterick R.J. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2001; 411: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), conventional kinesin with bound sulfate (27Sindelar C.V. Budny M.J. Rice S. Naber N. Fletterick R. Cooke R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 844-848PubMed Google Scholar), and to what has been proposed for kinesin:ATP when bound to the microtubule (28Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). We utilized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor the effect of monastrol binding on the neck linker to nucleotide distance distribution. We labeled our cysteine light construct at position 365 with Oregon Green 488 maleimide and at the nucleotide-binding site with 2′dmD, and we measured changes in FRET efficiency between these two probes in the absence and presence of monastrol and DHPC-1R, a novel Eg5 inhibitor.4 Fig. 1 illustrates the structures of the physiologically more active enantiomers of these two drugs. DHPC-1R causes bipolar spindle collapse and displays the same kinesin family selectivity. DHPC binds to the same site as monastrol but is 8-fold more potent in cells and in vitro, with an IC50 of ∼1 μm.4 Furthermore, unlike monastrol, it does not have a broad absorption band in the 290–320 nm range, which means that its presence should not interfere with measurements involving the fluorescence emission of tryptophan 127.FRET results are summarized in Table 1. In each case, the FRET data could be fit to two distances, R1 and R2, each with an associated distance distribution half-width. In the absence of drug, R1 and R2 had similar values, and each was associated with a fairly broad distribution half-width. Addition of either DHPC-1R or monastrol had no appreciable effect on R1, although it did increase the half-width 1.5–2-fold. By contrast, in both cases R2 shortened by 5 Å and its half-width shortened by a factor of 3.TABLE 1Effect of drug on active site to neck linker distance The conditions used are as follows: 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ADP, pH 7.5, 20 °C. Monastrol and DHPC concentrations were 100 μm. R0 = 47.6 Å.

This residue is located at the apex of L5. The crystallographic model demonstrates that monastrol binding causes this loop to bend toward a hydrophobic groove formed by α2 and α3 on the surface of the motor domain, creating a hydrophobic cavity that accommodates the drug (19Yan Y. Sardana V. Xu B. Homnick C. Halczenko W. Buser C.A. Schaber M. Hartman G.D. Huber H.E. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Monastrol has a major absorption band centered around the tryptophan fluorescence emission, and its presence would therefore be expected to interfere with anisotropy decay measurements. We therefore utilized DHPC-1R for these studies, because it does not appreciably absorb light in the 290–320 nm range, and as demonstrated in Table 1, this drug appears to have similar structural effects on the motor. Results are summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Effect of DHPC binding on L5 flexibility The conditions used are as follows: 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, 20 °C. Eg5 concentration was 40 μm, and DHPC concentration was 100 μm.

For both the tryptophan and mant probes, two rotational correlation times could be detected. Each correlation time (ϕ) is associated with an anisotropy (A). The shorter correlation time, ϕ1, in the range of 0.7–1.8 ns, reflects local probe motion (23Xing J. Wriggers W. Jefferson G.M. Stein R. Cheung H.C. Rosenfeld S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35413-35423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the longer time (ϕ2) reflects movements of the domain to which the fluorophore is attached. The value of ϕ2 for Eg5 labeled with 2′dmD (49.7 ns) is similar to what had been reported previously for a similarly labeled monomeric kinesin 1 construct, and it is within the range of what would be expected for rotation of a prolate ellipsoid of the size of our Eg5 construct (23Xing J. Wriggers W. Jefferson G.M. Stein R. Cheung H.C. Rosenfeld S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35413-35423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Table 2 also demonstrates that there is significant segmental flexibility in L5 in the absence of drug, as evidenced by comparing the values of ϕ2 for 2′dmD and tryptophan. Addition of DHPC-1R increases the value of ϕ2 by nearly 60%, implying that drug binding stabilizes the conformation of L5. However, even in the presence of drug, some degree of segmental flexibility in L5 remains, as evidenced by a value of ϕ2 that is nearly 2.5-fold shorter than that for the 2′dmD probe.These conclusions are also supported by analyzing the corresponding anisotropies, A1 and A2. The values of these parameters are related to the semi-cone angle of the fluorophore, which represents the angular distribution of possible orientations that the fluorophore can assume. The relationship between the anisotropies and the semi-cone angle, θ,is described by Equation 1 (29Kinosita K. Ikegami A. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 461-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), A2A1+A2=cos2θ·(1+cosθ)24(Eq. 1) Solving for θ leads to several conclusions (Table 2). First, there appears to be a moderate amount of rotational freedom for the mant fluorophore. This is consistent with the surface exposure of the 2′-ribose hydroxyl group evident in crystallographic models of Eg5 (18Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Yan Y. Sardana V. Xu B. Homnick C. Halczenko W. Buser C.A. Schaber M. Hartman G.D. Huber H.E. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with our prior quenching studies, which revealed appreciable solvent exposure for the mant fluorophore when bound to kinesin 1 (30Rosenfeld S.S. Correia J.J. Xing J. Rener B. Gong W. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30212-30222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second, the rotational freedom of tryptophan 127 in the absence of drug is appreciably larger than that for the mant fluorophore, a finding that is consistent with the corresponding differences in rotational correlation times. Finally, binding of DHPC-1R reduces θ for tryptophan 127 to a value that approximates that for the mant probe (Table 2). This supports our conclusion from the rotational correlation time measurements that drug binding to L5 reduces its mobility.Effect of Monastrol on the Conformation of L5, Monitored by UV Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Monastrol binding has been reported to produce an ∼7-Å movement of L5, leading to its folding over to produce a hydrophobic binding pocket for drug. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, which superimposes the drug-free (red) and drug-bound (yellow) conformations, derived from crystallographic models (18Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Yan Y. Sardana V. Xu B. Homnick C. Halczenko W. Buser C.A. Schaber M. Hartman G.D. Huber H.E. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To determine whether the same conformational changes occur under physiologic conditions, in solution, we examined the effects of monastrol binding on the Raman spectrum of the single tryptophan residue of Eg5. As illustrated in Fig. 2, tryptophan 127 lies at the apex of L5, and drug binding induces it to move into a hydrophobic environment. Raman spectra in the presence and absence of drug are depicted in Fig. 3. An increase in the intensity of the W3 band, located at 1550 cm-1, is seen with addition of monastrol (Fig. 3, dashed line) and indicates that drug binding causes the indole ring to move to a more hydrophobic environment (25Juszczak L. Hirsch R. Nagel R. Friedman J. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1998; 29: 963-968Crossref Google Scholar, 31Miura T. Takeuchi H. Harada I. J.

This indicates that the dihedral angle for tryptophan, which is the torsional angle between the pyridine ring and the aliphatic linker to the protein backbone, is the same for the drug-free and drug-bound states (31Miura T. Takeuchi H. Harada I. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1989; 20: 667-672Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These conclusions are consistent with the crystallographic models in the presence and absence of drug (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effect of monastrol binding on the conformation of Eg5:ADP.

These are best seen in the tyrosine Y8 band at 1614 cm-1. However, a comparison of the crystal structures in the presence and absence of monastrol reveals that multiple tyrosine residues change their degree of phenolic hydroxyl hydrogen bonding in response to drug binding (25Juszczak L. Hirsch R. Nagel R. Friedman J. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1998; 29: 963-968Crossref Google Scholar, 31Miura T. Takeuchi H. Harada I. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1989; 20: 667-672Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and this limits our ability to provide a structural interpretation to these spectroscopic changes. Although monastrol has a phenolic side chain, its Raman spectrum has only a low intensity peak in this part of the spectrum that does not appreciably contribute to the Raman intensities described above (data not shown).Kinetics of Monastrol Binding to Eg5:ADP—The strong absorption band of monastrol in the 290–320 nm range allows us to monitor the kinetics of monastrol binding to Eg5:ADP, through its quenching of the Eg5 tryptophan at position 127. This spectroscopic strategy was used in a prior study that demonstrated that mixing Eg5:ADP with monastrol quenched the tryptophan fluorescence emission in a single phase (32Luo L. Carson J.D. Dhanak D. Jackson J.R. Huang P.S. Lee Y. Sakowicz R. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15258-15266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, commercially available monastrol is a racemic mixture of equimolar concentrations of S and R enantiomers, which have different affinities for an Eg5 intermediate (17DeBonis S. Simorre J.-P. Crevel I. Lebeau L. Skoufias D.A. Blangy A. Ebel C. Gans P. Cross R. Hackney D.D. Wade R.H. Kozielski F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to see if we could distinguish the binding of these two enantiomers by re-examining the kinetics of the quenching of tryptophan 127. Results are depicted in Fig. 4A. The fluorescence transient resulting from mixing Eg5:ADP with monastrol consists of two phases. The rate constants of both the fast and slow phases depend hyperbolically on monastrol concentration (Fig. 4A, inset). This dependence defines maximum rate constants for binding of 536 ± 139 and 39 ± 3 s-1 and for dissociation of 82 ± 25 s-1 and 3 ± 1 s-1. Furthermore, the apparent monastrol affinities, determined from the hyperbolic fitting, are 96 ± 37 μm for the fast phase and 12 ± 3 μm for the slow. Finally, the relative amplitude of the faster phase increases hyperbolically with drug concentration, extrapolating to 0.97 ± 0.05 (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Time-dependent change in the fluorescence emission of tryptophan 127 after mixing with monastrol. A, fluorescence transient produced by mixing 10 μm Eg5 with 100 μm monastrol in the stopped flow.

Inset, plots of the rate constants for the fast (solid boxes) and slow (open boxes) phases of the fluorescence transient versus monastrol concentration.

We previously demonstrated that overexpression of PKC-δ slowed the G1 progression of Caco-2 colon cancer cells, accelerated apoptosis, and induced cellular differentiation. In this study, we further characterized the PKC-δ dependent signaling pathways involved in these tumor suppressor actions in Caco-2 cells overexpressing PKC-δ using a Zn2+ inducible expression vector. Consistent with a G1 arrest, increased expression of PKC-δ caused rapid and significant downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E proteins (50% decreases, P<0.05), while mRNA levels remained unchanged. The PKC agonist, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA, 100 nM, 4 h), induced two-fold higher protein and mRNA levels of p21Waf1, a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor in PKC-δ transfectants compared with empty vector (EV) transfected cells, whereas the PKC-δ specific inhibitor rottlerin (3 μ M) or knockdown of this isoenzyme with specific siRNA oligonucleotides blocked p21Waf1 expression. Concomitantly, compared to EV control cells, PKC-δ upregulation decreased cyclin D1 and cyclin E proteins co-immunoprecipitating with cdk6 and cdk2, respectively. In addition, overexpression of PKC-δ increased binding of cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 to cdk4. These alterations in cyclin-cdks and their inhibitors are predicted to decrease G1 cyclin kinase activity. As an independent confirmation of the direct role PKC-δ plays in cell growth and cell cycle regulation, we knocked down PKC-δ using specific siRNA oligonucleotides. PKC-δ specific siRNA oligonucleotides, but not irrelevant control oligonucleotides, inhibited PKC-δ protein by more than 80% in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, PKC-δ knockdown enhanced cell proliferation (∼1.4-2-fold, P<0.05) and concomitantly increased cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression (∼1.7-fold, P<0.05). This was a specific effect, as nontargeted PKC-ζ was not changed by PKC-δ siRNA oligonucleotides. Consistent with accelerated apoptosis in PKC-δ transfectants, compared to EV cells, PKC-δ upregulation increased proapoptotic regulator Bax two-fold at mRNA and protein levels, while antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein was decreased by 50% at a post-transcriptional level. PKC-δ specific siRNA oligonucleotides inhibited Bax protein expression by more than 50%, indicating that PKC-δ regulates apoptosis through Bax. Taken together, these results elucidate two critical mechanisms regulated by PKC-δ that inhibit cell cycle progression and enhance apoptosis in colon cancer cells. We postulate these antiproliferative pathways mediate an important tumor suppressor function for PKC-δ in colonic carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2075265850,"Rho-family proteins play a central role in most actin-dependent processes, including the control and maintenance of cell shape, adhesion, motility, and phagocytosis. Activation of these GTP-binding proteins is tightly regulated spatially and temporally; however, very little is known of the mechanisms involved in their recruitment and activation in vivo. Because of its inducible, restricted signaling, phagocytosis offers an ideal physiological system to delineate the pathways linking surface receptors to actin remodeling via Rho GTPases. In this study, we investigated the involvement of early regulators of Fcγ receptor signaling in Rac recruitment and activation. Using a combination of receptor mutagenesis, cellular, molecular, and pharmacological approaches, we show that Src family and Syk kinases control Rac and Vav function during phagocytosis. Importantly, both the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif within Fcγ receptor cytoplasmic domain and Src kinase control the recruitment of Vav and Rac. However, Syk activity is dispensable for Vav and Rac recruitment. Moreover, we show that Rac and Cdc42 activities coordinate F-actin accumulation at nascent phagosomes.

We believe they will contribute to a better understanding of more complex cellular processes, such as cell adhesion and migration. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton drives cell shape changes during processes such as cell adhesion, migration and chemotaxis, bacterial invasion, immune synapse formation, and phagocytosis (1Cougoule C. Wiedemann A. Lim J. Caron E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Generally induced locally, these morphological changes originate from the activation of a given set of cell surface receptors and the induction of signaling pathways that activate Rho family GTP-binding proteins, which control localized actin polymerization. Understanding how Rho-GTPase signaling is locally activated is therefore crucial to many essential aspects of molecular cell biology.Rho proteins cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound conformations. Only the latter can bind downstream effectors. Conversion to the GTP-bound form is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 3The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; FcγR, Fcγ receptor; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; SRBC, sheep red blood cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild-type. 3The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; FcγR, Fcγ receptor; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; SRBC, sheep red blood cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild-type. whereas inactivation back to the GDP-bound form is mediated by GTPase-activating proteins. Inducible activation of Rho GTPases requires their targeting to membranes, where they will interact with both GEFs and downstream targets (3Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). Although Rho proteins can bind to membranes directly, by virtue of their posttranslationally added prenylation, their subcellular localization is also regulated, as Rho GTP-binding proteins are held soluble and inactive in the cytosol through an interaction between their prenyl moiety and the effector region of GDP dissociation inhibitor proteins (4Dransart E. Morin A. Cherfils J. Olofsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4674-4683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Rho proteins are recruited and activated in particular regions of the cells to control actin polymerization are still poorly understood. Furthermore, the deciphering of these mechanisms is complicated by several factors, for example by the fact that different Rho-family members can be involved in a given cellular process, leading to synergistic or antagonistic cross-talk, as shown during cell migration or adherens junction formation (5Noren N.K.

Because of its spatiotemporally restricted and inducible signaling, the phagocytic uptake of model particles offers an ideal biological system to delineate the pathways linking the localized ligation of surface receptors to actin remodeling via Rho proteins (1Cougoule C. Wiedemann A. Lim J. Caron E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Phagocytosis is the mechanism by which cells take up large particles (>0.5 μm) into an intracellular compartment, the phagosome (7Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). Phagocytic uptake is initiated by the direct or opsonin-mediated recognition of ligands exposed on the particle surface by specific receptors present at the surface of phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils, and receptor-transfected cells). Receptor clustering triggers intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for particle uptake. The receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins (FcγR) is the best studied phagocytic receptor (8Castellano F. Chavrier P. Caron E. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Greenberg S. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 10Wiedemann A. Lim J. Caron E. Rosales C. Molecular Mechanisms of Phagocytosis. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004: 72-84Google Scholar). Binding of IgG-opsonized particles to FcγR induces the activation of Src kinases, which phosphorylate two tyrosines in the receptor immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domain (11Ghazizadeh S. Bolen J.B. Fleit H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ITAM phosphorylation is crucial for the formation of actin-rich cups and thus for particle uptake, as shown in experiments using hck/lyn/fgr-deficient mice, FcγR mutants, or Src kinase inhibitors (12Fitzer-Attas C.J.

Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 801-811PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated ITAM motifs act as docking sites for a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Syk, which undergoes autophosphorylation and whose activation is necessary for phagocytosis (16Kiefer F. Brumell J.

Lowell C. Tybulewicz V.L. DeFranco A.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Moreover, surface expression of a FcγR/Syk chimera is sufficient to stimulate particle uptake (18Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). If Syk activation clearly lies downstream of Src kinase activity as demonstrated in hck/lyn/fgr-deficient macrophages (12Fitzer-Attas C.J. Lowry M. Crowley M.T. Finn A.J. Meng F. DeFranco A.L. Lowell C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Crowley M.T. Costello P.S. Fitzer-Attas C.J. Turner M. Meng F. Lowell C. Tybulewicz V.L. DeFranco A.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), its role in actin polymerization downstream of FcγR is still controversial. On one hand, actin polymerized normally at nascent phagosomes in macrophages derived from Syk-deficient mice (16Kiefer F. Brumell J. Al-Alawi N. Latour S. Cheng A. Veillette A. Grinstein S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, actin polymerization was impaired in FcγR-transfected DT40 lymphocytes engineered to lack Syk (19Cox D. Chang P. Kurosaki T. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16597-16602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas piceatannol, a specific inhibitor of Syk (20Oliver J.M. Burg D.L. Wilson B.S. McLaughlin J.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29697-29703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked actin accumulation at nascent phagosomes in murine macrophages (15Majeed M. Caveggion E. Lowell C.A. Berton G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 801-811PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, taken together, these data show that Src kinase activity and ITAM-dependent signaling are essential for actin polymerization and particle uptake during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis.Rho GTP-binding proteins play a critical role during FcγR-mediated uptake, as inhibition of either Rac or Cdc42 blocks phagocytosis (19Cox D. Chang P. Kurosaki T. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16597-16602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Caron E. Hall A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6219-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 are activated and recruited to forming phagosomes in response to IgG-particle challenge (21Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 23Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Elegant fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies have recently confirmed that active forms of Rac and Cdc42 accumulate rapidly, coincidentally with F-actin, underneath bound IgG-opsonized particles (25Hoppe A.D. Swanson J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is thought that each of these two Rho proteins controls the local recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex, thereby actin polymerization at phagosomes (26May R.C. Caron E. Hall A. Machesky L.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of Rac and Cdc42 in actin polymerization at forming phagosomes is still controversial, as two independent studies have reported that expression of dominant negative Rac or Cdc42 did not completely block F-actin accumulation at nascent phagosomes, although each individually inhibited FcγR-mediated phagocytosis (19Cox D. Chang P. Kurosaki T. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16597-16602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Massol P. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6219-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Another unresolved issue is whether Rac and Cdc42 are recruited in their active form or locally activated. Our published data support the latter, as the inactive (N17) form of Rac is recruited to nascent phagosomes (21Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recruitment of Rac (either N17 or wild-type) to nascent phagosomes occurs in the absence of Vav-exchange activity, despite the fact that Vav activity is necessary for Rac activation and phagocytosis (23Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Intriguingly, whether and how the tyrosine kinase and Rho signaling pathways are connected to control actin polymerization and phagocytosis downstream of FcγR has not yet been elucidated. Because activation of Src and Syk kinases corresponds to the first signaling events detected after binding of IgG-opsonized particles, they are good candidates to control small GTPase function during phagocytosis. Src and Syk kinases have been described to phosphorylate Vav and enhance Vav exchange factor activity in vitro as well as during T- and B-cell receptor signaling (27Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 28Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In line with this, we have shown that Syk is still recruited to nascent phagosomes in macrophages expressing dominant negative Vav, suggesting that Vav acts downstream of initial FcγR signaling (23Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Herein, we show that early FcγR signaling controls recruitment and Vav-dependent activation of Rac and actin polymerization. Remarkably, the kinase activity of Src, but not Syk, controls Rac and Vav recruitment to nascent phagosomes, whereas Syk activity is essential for Rac activation, and therefore, for particle uptake. We also show that Rac activation is dispensable for actin polymerization at nascent phagosomes although necessary to coordinate with Cdc42-actin polymerization and engulfment during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—Eucaryotic pRK5 expression vectors encoding human FcγRIIA (FcγR), myc-tagged N17Rac, N17Cdc42, Wasp (amino acids 201–310), Vav wild-type (Vav-WT), VavC (comprising just the carboxyl-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 domains), VavΔ342-348 (containing a 6-amino-acid deletion in the catalytic DH domain, VavΔDH), pEGFP-p59HckWT and pEGFP-RacWT have been previously described (21Caron E.

Hemagglutinin-tagged pCMV-VavΔ342-348 was a kind gift from Charles Abrams (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).Plasmids expressing truncated versions of the FcγR were generated from the pRK5-FcγRIIA template by inverse PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science) using the following primers: 5′-tcagatcttcatttcctgcagtagatcaa-3′ and 5′-gaagatcttctagagtcgacctgcag-3′ for FcγRΔ240; 5′-tcagatcttcattggtttcttcaagttgt-3′ and 5′-gaagatcttctagagtcgacctgcag-3′ for FcγRΔ275.

Briefly, DNA/calcium phosphate precipitates (10 μg of DNA/400 μl of calcium phosphate/6-cm dishes containing 3.6 ml of fresh complete medium) were added onto the cells for 16–18 h, washed, and incubated in fresh complete medium for an additional 6 h.Drug Treatments and Phagocytosis Assay—Transfected COS-7 were transferred to 10 mm Hepes-buffered serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (SFM) for a period of 18 h and then incubated with drugs for 30 min. Drugs were maintained in the medium during a challenge with IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC, Cappel) prepared as previously described (21Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 23Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4 μl of SRBC were opsonized with rabbit anti-SRBC IgG during 30 min in 1 ml of gelatin veronal buffer (Sigma) and washed once with gelatin veronal buffer. IgG-SRBC were allowed to adhere for 15 min at 4 °C and synchronized phagocytosis was induced for 15 min at 37 °C.Immunofluorescence—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. Free aldehyde groups were neutralized in 13.3 mg/ml of NH4Cl/PBS for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 15 min. For immunostaining, cells were incubated for 30 min with antibodies diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS supplemented with excess human IgG (Sigma) to prevent nonspecific binding of the antibodies to Fcγ receptors. FITC-, rhodamine- and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were used to detect opsonized SRBC. Myc-tagged constructs were visualized using mouse monoclonal anti-myc followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. F-actin was stained using Alexa546-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol mountant (Calbiochem), and images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.Determination of Rac Activity Levels—The Cdc42/Rac interactive-binding domain of Pak1 (PAK-CRIB) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was prepared for GTPase pull-down assays as previously described (23Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). J774.A1 macrophages seeded at 107 cells/14-cm dish were starved in 12 ml of 10 mm Hepes-buffered SFM for 2 h and challenged with 50 μl of IgG-SRBC/plate for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then scraped on ice in 800 μl of pull-down buffer (PD buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per plate. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. 700 μl of supernatant were used to assess the levels of active Rac using the Pak-CRIB pull-down method (30Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 10 mg of a 50% slurry of PAK-CRIB-GST coupled to glutathione-agarose beads to precipitate GTP-loaded GTPases. Beads were subsequently washed three times in cold, modified PD buffer (without deoxycholate or SDS) and resuspended in 20 μl of 2× sample buffer. Equal amounts of beads and total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using a monoclonal anti-Rac antibody. Fold activation of Rac was assessed, relative to the level of Rac in the total cell lysate, by quantification of autoradiographic exposures using ImageJ software.Analysis of Vav Phosphorylation Level—J774.A1 macrophages seeded at 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish were starved in 10 mm Hepes-containing SFM during 1.5 h, treated with the drugs for an additional 30 min, then challenged with 15 μl of IgG-SRBC in 3 ml of cold Hepes-buffered SFM for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed once to remove unbound particles, reincubated at 37 °C for 10 min, washed again on ice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, and scraped in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture 1 μg/ml, 1 mm Na3VO4-, 1 mm NaF). Whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Total Vav levels were assessed after membrane stripping and immunoblotting. Fold phosphorylation of Vav was related to the level of Vav in the total cell lysate, by quantification of autoradiographic exposures using the ImageJ software.Scoring—Binding and phagocytosis indices were determined by counting the number of particles respectively associated to and internalized by 100 cells, whether J774.A1 or FcγR-expressing COS-7 cells. Protein recruitment to nascent phagosomes was scored blindly by confocal microscopy and is expressed as the percent positive phagosomes out of a population of >100 phagosomes, corresponding to an average of 20 cells/coverslip.Statistics—A paired t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the results. Data sets were considered different for p values < 0.05.RESULTSSrc and Syk kinase activities are necessary for FcγR-mediated phagocytosis (12Fitzer-Attas C.J. Lowry M. Crowley M.T. Finn A.J. Meng F.

Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the first detectable signaling events after particle binding are Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcγR ITAM domain and the accumulation to nascent phagosomes of several phosphorylated proteins, including Src kinases themselves and the Src substrate Syk (31Cox D. Greenberg S. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We used a pharmacological approach to investigate the role of Src and Syk kinases in the activation of Rac signaling. PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src-family kinases (14Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), and piceatannol, a selective Syk inhibitor (20Oliver J.M. Burg D.L. Wilson B.S. McLaughlin J.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29697-29703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were titrated for inhibition of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in J774.A1 macrophages (data not shown). Compared with control, Me2SO-treated cells, macrophages treated with PP2 (10 μm), and piceatannol (75 μm) exhibited a marked reduction in their FcγR-dependent ability to phagocytose but were as competent in binding particles, confirming that the drugs specifically act on phagocytic signaling (Fig. 1A). Me2SO treatment did not affect the binding and phagocytic properties of any of the cell types we used (data not shown).We next examined the effect of these drugs on FcγR-induced Rac activation. Endogenous GTP-loaded Rac was precipitated from lysates of control, drug-treated and SRBC-challenged J774.A1 using the Rac/Cdc42 binding fragment of p21-activated kinases (PAK) fused to GST (GST-PAK-CRIB). Drug treatments per se had no reproducible effect on RacGTP levels in unchallenged cells (mean ± S.D. of 1.7 ± 0.8 for PP2 and 1.2 ± 1 for piceatannol). As already described for FcγR-transfected COS-7 cells (23Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and RAW 264.7 macrophages (24Niedergang F. Colucci-Guyon E. Dubois T. Raposo G. Chavrier P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), challenge of J774.A1 macrophages with IgG-SRBC triggered a transient increase in the amount of GTP-loaded Rac in control Me2SO-treated cells after 10 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1B and data not shown). The SRBC-dependent, FcγR-mediated increase in RacGTP levels was blocked in PP2- and piceatannol-treated cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that Src and Syk kinase activities are necessary to trigger Rac activation during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis.Rac has been described to control actin polymerization at nascent phagosomes (26May R.C. Caron E. Hall A. Machesky L.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We thus examined the effect of each Rac-inhibiting treatment on the accumulation of F-actin underneath bound SRBC. In J774.A1 macrophages, PP2, but not piceatannol, treatment blocked actin polymerization at nascent phagosomes (Fig. 2). These results were confirmed in FcγR-transfected COS-7 cells, a phagocytic model that recapitulates all steps and signaling pathways of phagocytosis analyzed so far (see above (21Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 23Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Downey G.P.

In FcγR-expressing COS-7 cells, both drugs prevented phagocytosis, although had neither had any significant effect on SRBC binding (Fig. 3A). Importantly, PP2, but not piceatannol, abrogated F-actin accumulation at nascent phagosomes, indicating that Src-family, but not Syk kinases, control F-actin accumulation at nascent phagosomes (Fig. 3B). It is well documented that expression of Src-like kinases and Syk kinases is not restricted to hematopoietic cells (35Yanagi S. Inatome R. Takano T. Yamamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36Huang Z.Y. Hunter S. Kim M.K. Chien P. Worth R.G. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. J.

Nuclear Stat1 and Stat3 are dephosphorylated and deactivated by the T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP), which facilitates the return of both proteins to the cytoplasm. The protein kinase PKR plays an important role in translational control through the modulation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2α phosphorylation. Previous data have implicated PKR in cell signaling via regulation of Stat1 and Stat3, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these events have remained elusive. Using PKR-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts and a conditionally active form of human PKR, we demonstrate herein that tyrosine (but not serine) phosphorylation of either Stat1 or Stat3 is impaired in cells with activated kinase. This reduction in Stat1 and Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation by active PKR proceeds through TC-PTP, which is a substrate of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2α kinase both in vitro and in vivo. TC-PTP phosphorylation alone is insufficient to increase its in vivo phosphatase activity unless accompanied by the inhibition of protein synthesis as a result of PKR activation. These data reveal a novel function of PKR as a negative regulator of Stat1 and Stat3 with important implications in cell signaling.

Immunol. 2003; 3: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). These transcription factors remain latent in the cytoplasm until activated by extracellular signaling proteins, primarily cytokines and growth factors (1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar, 2Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Stat1 plays an important role in the cellular response to interferon (IFN) and viral infection and in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis (1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Stat1 knock-out mice are extremely susceptible to infection with viruses and other pathogens, demonstrating the essential role of this transcription factor in innate immunity (3Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar, 4Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S.

Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, IFN treatment leads to Stat1 activation by phosphorylation at Tyr701 mediated by activated Jaks, a family of tyrosine kinases that are associated with the cytoplasmic portions of IFN receptors (1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for Stat1 dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and gene transcription (1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser727 in the C-terminal domain of Stat1 enhances its transactivation capacity (5Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Stat3, another member of the Stat family, was discovered as a result of its response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) in hepatocytes (6Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Stat3 is a major signal transducer downstream of gp130-like receptors, and its activation induces many responses, including proliferation of B-lymphocytes, activation of terminal differentiation and growth arrest in monocytes, and maintenance of the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar, 6Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As with Stat1, Stat3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated at a site close to the C terminus and serine-phosphorylated within the transactivation domain (1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar, 7Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Stat3 knock-out mice exhibit early embryonic lethality, and loss of Stat3 is even lethal in embryonic stem cells; therefore, Stat3 is also required for embryogenesis (6Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although both Stat1 and Stat3 are hyperphosphorylated in numerous cancers (8Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar), Stat3 is categorized as a proto-oncogene, whereas Stat1 is generally believed to act as a tumor suppressor (9Bromberg J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The cell has developed numerous mechanisms to regulate both the duration and magnitude of Stat activation so that it can formulate appropriate responses to cytokine stimulation. Phosphorylation of Stats is inhibited by proteins known as SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling), which either interfere with activation of Jaks or compete with Stats for binding to cytokine receptors (10Wormald S. Hilton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 11Kubo M. Hanada T. Yoshimura A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Stat activation is also limited by dephosphorylation of upstream signaling components (i.e. receptors and Jaks) by the SH2 domain-containing phosphatases (2Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 10Wormald S. Hilton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the transcriptional activities of Stats are regulated by PIAS (protein inhibitors of activated Stats), which prevent DNA binding (2Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), or by specific phosphatases that remove phosphate groups from the tyrosine residues of active Stat molecules (2Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 10Wormald S. Hilton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In particular, the nuclear T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) (12Ibarra-Sanchez M.J. Simoncic P.D. Nestel F.R. Duplay P. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) decreases both the cytokine-induced phosphorylation and transcriptional activities of Stat1 and Stat3, thus inhibiting the signaling through each pathway (13Yamamoto T.

Zhu W. Tremblay M. David M. Shuai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). PKR is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase that is induced by IFN-α/β and activated by double-stranded RNA, cytokines, growth factors, and cellular stress (15Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar). The most extensively characterized role of PKR is its ability to inhibit the initiation of translation through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 α-subunit (eIF2α) at Ser51 (15Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar, 16Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Through its capacity to regulate protein synthesis, PKR has been considered as a major mediator of the antiviral and anti-proliferative effects of IFN (17Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). We previously reported that PKR physically interacts with Stat1, an interaction that is diminished in cells treated with IFN or double-stranded RNA (18Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Yang Y.L. Cuddihy A.R. Li S.

Despite the clear inhibitory role of PKR in Stat1 function (18Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Yang Y.L. Cuddihy A.R. Li S. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Decker T. Koromilas A.E.

Herein, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from a catalytic knock-out of PKR (20Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3415-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that PKR negatively regulates Stat1 and Stat3. We show that this regulation occurs through activation of TC-PTP, which in turn specifically decreases the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3. Interestingly, induction of Stat1 and Stat3 dephosphorylation by TC-PTP is facilitated, at least in part, by the inhibition of protein synthesis as a result of PKR activation and eIF2α phosphorylation. Collectively, our data provide evidence, for the first time, of a functional cross-talk between PKR and TC-PTP with important implications in the regulation of Stat1 and Stat3 signaling. The interrelation of these pathways may illustrate a heretofore uncharacterized mechanism employed by viruses to evade the host response.

Phosphatase Assay—GST-TC-PTP bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was washed three times with 5 volumes of 1× phosphatase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1.6 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 900 × g for 1 min, the supernatant was removed, and 200 μl of phosphatase assay buffer containing 1.0 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) was added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched with 20 μlof2 m NaOH at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, and color production was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Immunostaining—Cell fixation and immunostaining were performed as described (26Qu L. Huang S. Baltzis D. Rivas-Estilla A.M. Pluquet O. Hatzoglou M. Koumenis C. Taya Y. Yoshimura A. Koromilas A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The cells were stained with anti-Stat1α monoclonal antibody (mAb; 2 mg/ml; C-111, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-human TC-PTP mAb (1-2 μg/ml; 3E2). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (20 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) was applied as the secondary antibody. To visualize the nucleus, cells were counter-stained with 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Luciferase Assay—Stat1- and Stat3-dependent gene transactivation was measured using the Dual Luciferase reporter system (Promega Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The Stat1 reporter construct (pGL-2XIFP53-GAS) was obtained from BD Biosciences, and the Stat3 construct (6x APRE (acute-phase response element)) was a gift from T. Decker (University of Vienna). Firefly luciferase levels were normalized to Renilla luciferase levels (pRL-TK; Promega Corp.), which was used as an internal control. GyrB-wtPKR-expressing HT1080 cells were transfected with 1.0 μgof pRC/CMV-eIF2α(S51A) (27Donze O. Jagus R. Koromilas A.E. Hershey J.W. Sonenberg N.

Northern Blot Analysis—PKR+/+ and PKR-/- MEFs were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA (15 μg) was electrophoretically resolved on denaturing agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to [α-32P]dCTP-labeled random-primed cDNA probe (5 × 106 cpm/ml) consisting of a 750-bp fragment of human interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) or the entire rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA at 65 °C for 16 h.

For immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting, the following antibodies were used: anti-Stat1α mAb (C-111), rabbit anti-Stat1α polyclonal antibody (pAb; M-23), anti-phospho-Tyr701 Stat1 mAb (A-2), rabbit anti-Stat3 pAb (C-20), anti-phospho-Tyr705 Stat3 mAb (B-7), rabbit anti-SHP-2 pAb (C-18), anti-c-Myc mAb (9E10), rabbit anti-IRF-1 pAb (C-20), and anti-actin mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Rabbit anti-phospho-Tyr701 Stat1 pAb was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) and rabbit anti-phospho-Ser727 Stat1 pAb were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-TC-PTP mAb (CF4) and anti-p53 mAb (Ab-6) were purchased from Oncogene Research Products. Goat anti-GST pAb was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit anti-VSV pAb was a generous gift from J. C. Bell. All antibodies were used at final concentrations of 0.1-1 μg/ml. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences), proteins were visualized with the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of the bands in the linear range of exposure was performed by densitometry using Scion Image software. Increased Phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 in Mouse Cells Deficient in PKR—We previously observed an inhibitory role of PKR on Stat1 transcriptional activity (18Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Yang Y.L. Cuddihy A.R. Li S. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Decker T. Koromilas A.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We followed up this observation by examining the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in MEFs with a targeted deletion of the catalytic domain of PKR (20Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A. McBurney M.W. Koromilas A.E. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5953-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). PKR+/+ and PKR-/- MEFs were treated with recombinant mouse IFN-γ, and protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Stat1α mAb (C-111) (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies showed that Tyr701 phosphorylation of Stat1 was stronger and persisted longer in PKR-/- cells compared with PKR+/+ cells (Fig. 1A, panel a, ratio a/c). Contrary to tyrosine phosphorylation, Ser727 phosphorylation of Stat1 did not significantly differ between PKR+/+ and PKR-/- MEFs treated with IFN-γ (Fig. 1A, panel b, ratio b/c). The higher induction of Stat1 Tyr701 phosphorylation in PKR-/- cells than in PKR+/+ cells by IFN-γ was further verified by immunoblotting with a second phospho-specific antibody using whole protein extracts (supplemental Fig. 1A). We also noticed that Stat1 Tyr701 phosphorylation was more highly induced in PKR-/- MEFs than in PKR+/+ MEFs after VSV infection (supplemental Fig. 1B). Induction of Stat1 Tyr701 phosphorylation was not observed in IFN-γ-treated PERK-/- MEFs compared with isogenic PERK+/+ MEFs (supplemental Fig. 2), indicating a specific inhibitory effect of PKR on Stat1 activation among the other eIF2α kinases. We further examined Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in PKR+/+ and PKR-/- MEFs (Fig. 1B). Similar to Stat1, Tyr705 phosphorylation of Stat3 in response to IL-6 was higher in PKR-/- cells compared with PKR+/+ cells (Fig. 1B, panel a). Collectively, these data indicate that the catalytic activity of PKR exhibits a negative effect on Stat1 and Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Because tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for Stat protein function (1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar), we examined Stat1 transcriptional activity in an in vivo setting. We evaluated the expression of IRF-1 protein and mRNA levels upon IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 1C, panel a). IRF-1 protein levels were induced more quickly and to a higher degree in PKR-/- cells as opposed to PKR+/+ cells following IFN-γ treatment. Examination of IRF-1 mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis revealed that IRF-1 transcripts were higher in PKR-/- cells after 6 and 12 h of IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 1C, panel c). The transcriptional activity of Stat1 in PKR+/+ and PKR-/- cells was further examined using cells transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a Stat1-dependent promoter containing two tandem IFN-γ-activated sequence elements (19Wong A.H. Durbin J.E. Li S. Dever T.E. Decker T. Koromilas A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13727-13737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We observed a 2.2-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of Stat1 in PKR-/- cells compared with their wild-type counterparts upon IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 1D). We also performed a luciferase assay to evaluate Stat3 transcriptional activity using a luciferase reporter construct containing six consecutive repeats of the acute-phase response element. Regulation of Stat3 activity was analogous to that of Stat1 activity in the two cell lines. Stat3-dependent transcriptional activity was increased by 2.6-fold in PKR-/- cells relative to the wild-type cells upon treatment with IL-6 (Fig. 1E). This confirms our previous observation that PKR negatively affects Stat1 transcriptional activity (18Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Yang Y.L. Cuddihy A.R. Li S. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Decker T. Koromilas A.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Wong A.H. Durbin J.E. Li S. Dever T.E. Decker T. Koromilas A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13727-13737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and further indicates that Stat3 is subject to the same regulation. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 Is Decreased by Conditionally Active PKR—We previously reported that catalytic PKR-/- MEFs express a truncated PKR protein that still contains the N-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domain of the kinase (29Baltzis D. Li S. Koromilas A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38364-38372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As such, increases in Stat1 and Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells may not have been due to the lack of catalytic activity, but due to a gain of function of the truncated PKR protein. To better address the role of catalytically active PKR in regulating Stat1 and Stat3, we employed an inducible PKR system in which the kinase domain of PKR is expressed as a fusion protein with the first 220 amino acids of the Escherichia coli GyrB protein (21Ung T.L. Cao C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking of the GyrB domain with the drug coumermycin leads to GyrB-PKR dimerization, autophosphorylation, and consequently eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser51 (21Ung T.L. Cao C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We established a human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080) stably expressing either GyrB-wtPKR or the catalytically inactive GyrB-PKR(K296H) mutant (22Kazemi S. Papadopoulou S. Li S. Su Q. Wang S. Yoshimura A. Matlashewski G. Dever T.E. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3415-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In these cells, treatment with coumermycin results in GyrB-wtPKR activation and phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2α as opposed to GyrB-PKR(K296H), which is unable to induce eIF2α phosphorylation (22Kazemi S. Papadopoulou S. Li S. Su Q. Wang S. Yoshimura A. Matlashewski G. Dever T.E. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3415-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We employed HT1080 cells expressing either GyrB-wtPKR or GyrB-PKR(K296H) to examine the role of PKR activation in Stat1 and Stat3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Each cell type was pretreated with coumermycin for 6 h to reach the optimal GyrB-PKR activation (22Kazemi S. Papadopoulou S. Li S. Su Q. Wang S. Yoshimura A. Matlashewski G. Dever T.E. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3415-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), followed by stimulation with either IFN-γ (Fig. 2A) or IL-6 (Fig. 2B). In cells containing GyrB-wtPKR, Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced by >50% after 30 min of IFN-γ treatment compared with both the parental cells and the GyrB-PKR(K296H)-expressing cells (Fig. 2A, panel a, ratio a/b). GyrB-PKR(K296H) does not function as a dominant-negative mutant to suppress the activity of endogenous PKR present in the parental cell line (22Kazemi S. Papadopoulou S. Li S. Su Q. Wa"

The crystal structures of the strongly anion-selective porin alone and in complex with the substrate malate were solved at 1.5 and 1.45 Å resolution, respectively, and revealed a malate-binding motif adjacent to the channel constriction zone. Binding is mediated by interaction with a cluster of two arginine residues and two threonines. This binding site is specific for Omp32 and reflects the physiological adaptation of the organism to organic acids. Structural studies are combined with a 7-ns unbiased molecular dynamics simulation of the trimeric channel in a model membrane. Molecular dynamics trajectories show how malate ions are efficiently captured from the surrounding bulk solution by the electrostatic potential of the channel, translocated to the binding site region, and immobilized in the constriction zone. In accordance with these results, conductance measurements with Omp32 inserted in planar lipid membranes revealed binding of malate. The anion-selective channel Omp32 is the first reported example of a porin with a 16-stranded β-barrel and proven substrate specificity.

Porins are channel proteins that facilitate the exchange of ions and small hydrophilic substrate molecules across the outer membrane present in Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (1Nikaido H.

They all possess β-barrels as the common structural principle (3Schulz G.E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The trimeric bacterial porins are usually classified according to their number of barrel-forming β-strands (3Schulz G.E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4Schirmer T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar); 18-stranded porins function as substrate-specific channels and provide periplasmic binding proteins and uptake systems of the inner membrane with their specific substrates (5Schirmer T.

The current classification is mainly based on the crystal structures of 3 different 18-stranded and seven 16-stranded porins from Proteobacteria. Structural studies of substrate binding to trimeric porins were, thus, restricted to the sugar-specific maltoporins and to ScrY (5Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 6Forst D. Welte W. Wacker T. Diederichs K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The nucleoside-specific pore protein Tsx and the fatty acid-binding transporter FadL are monomeric 12- and 14-stranded β-barrel proteins, respectively (17Ye J. van den Berg B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18van den Berg B. Black P.N. Clemons Jr., W.M. Rapoport T.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). They are not regarded as porins proper; however, they also belong to the class of passive outer membrane channel proteins. Thus, in a more general view, substrate binding is not a special feature of 18-stranded outer membrane proteins. Several theories were developed to describe channel-substrate interactions which apply to diffusion pores in general (19Berezkhovskii A.M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A decisive step of substrate translocation was modeled for maltoporin by conjugate peak refinement (20Dutzler R.

The 16-stranded porin Omp32 is the major protein constituent of the outer membrane from the bacterium Delftia acidovorans (formerly Comamonas acidovorans (12Engelhardt H. Gerbl-Rieger S. Krezmar D. Schneider-Voss S. Engel A. Baumeister W. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 105: 92-102Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Baldermann C. Lupas A. Lubieniecki J. Engelhardt H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3741-3749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). This species, being facultatively pathogenic (14Horowitz H. Gilroy Sh. Feinstein S. Gilardi G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 143-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is closely related to Neisseriaceae, which causes serious infectious diseases in humans. The predominant carbon sources of D. acidovorans are organic acids (15Willems A. de Vos P. de Ley J. Balows A. Trüper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.H. The Prokaryotes Vol. III. Springer-Verlag, New York1992: 2583-2590Google Scholar), among which malic acid is one of the characteristic and physiologically important substrates (16Gödde C. Liebergesell M. Steinbüchel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ability of the bacterium to grow on organic acids as a single carbon source suggests that proteins in the inner and outer membranes are specialized for the influx of these molecules. The Omp32 channel strongly discriminates between anions and cations, with a selectivity factor of ∼20 (24Mathes A. Engelhardt H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1255-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Accordingly, its structure displays a large number of basic residues inside the pore and an unusually narrow constriction zone located approximately halfway along the pore axis (25Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recent MD studies showed that even the small chloride ions experience intimate interactions with charged amino acids arranged as a “basic ladder” and located in the channel constriction (26Zachariae U. Helms V. Engelhardt H. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 954-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a situation that is less obvious but also present in porins exhibiting a larger pore cross-section such as OmpF from Escherichia coli (27Suenaga A. Komeiji Y. Uebayasi M. Meguro T. Saito M. Yamato I. Biosci. Rep. 1998; 18: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Danelon C. Suenaga A. Winterhalter M. Yamato I. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 104: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The affinity of D. acidovorans toward organic acids as carbon source, together with the strong anion selectivity and the small channel diameter of Omp32, suggests that a certain level of substrate specificity may also be present in a porin that would be attributed as unspecific by its structure according to the current classification (3Schulz G.E.

We combined x-ray crystallography and unbiased MD simulations of a complete membrane system and studied substrate-protein interactions in Omp32 in more detail. The simulation revealed that malate ions are spontaneously attracted by the channels from the surrounding solution, translocated into the pore, and bound near the constriction zone. The x-ray structure at 1.45 Å resolution of the porin-malate complex gives a detailed view of protein-substrate interactions, and functional measurements confirm substrate binding in the course of malate translocation. Crystallization of Omp32—The preparation of outer membranes from D. acidovorans strain JL0 and the purification of porin Omp32 were adapted from Ref. 25Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar (see supplemental data). Crystallization trials were performed using purified porin at 15 mg/ml in buffer B (20 mm Tris at pH 8.6 and 2% β-d-octylglucoside). Crystallization was tested against crystal screens I and II from Hampton Research by mixing 1 μl of protein and 0.5 μl of reservoir solution to yield hanging drops, which were incubated at 20° C. To prepare crystals of Omp32 including organic acids, protein crystals were soaked for 12 h by the addition of 100-200 mm l-malate (MLT structure) to the crystallization drops. All crystals were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at beamline ID14-EH4 of the synchrotron radiation source ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) at 100 K and a wavelength of 1.0053 Å. Diffraction patterns were recorded on a ADSC Q4R mosaic CCD detector system, and all data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using programs XDS and XSCALE, respectively (29Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1988; 21: 67-71Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar). X-ray Crystallographic Analysis, Data Collection, Phasing, and Refinement—Molecular replacement trials using the room temperature structure of Omp32 (PDB entry 1E54 (25Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar)) were performed by means of the program Molrep (30Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 program package. The solution observed was further refined by the molecular refinement program Refmac (31Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Side chains were successively rebuilt according to 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps followed by iterative cycles of model rebuilding with O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). At this stage the malate ligand was placed into the electron density and refined under the restraints included in the Refmac program libraries. Solvent waters were then placed into 3-s peaks of Fo - Fc maps using the automated ArpWarp routine (33Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and all atoms were refined with independent anisotropic B-factors. The final refined protein model at 1.45 Å of MLT comprises residues 3-332 (1.5 Å and residues 1-332 for NAT, the Omp32 without malate) according to the full-length protein sequence. The model geometry was checked with PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the solvent content Vm of the crystals was calculated using programs included in the CCP4 program package (35Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar). The structural superposition of MLT with the 1E54 model of Omp32 and the unsoaked structure was carried out using the program TOP. Molecular Dynamics—The hexagonal simulation system was built using the original crystal structure of Omp32 (PDB 1E54). A model membrane, consisting of a bilayer of hydrated DMPC lipids, was constructed according to Woolf and Roux (36Woolf T.B. Roux B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11631-11635Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 37Woolf T.B. Roux B. Proteins. 1996; 24: 92-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and Im and Roux (38Im W. Roux B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1177-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 39Im W. Roux B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The simulation system comprised an Omp32 trimer embedded in the lipid bilayer. Two water layers were placed above and below the membrane layer, and the pores were filled with water. The system was equilibrated following the methods given in Ref. 38Im W. Roux B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1177-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar. 12 chloride anions were used to neutralize the system during the equilibration step. Before the production run was started, six chloride ions were removed, and six were substituted by malate ions, corresponding to a malate concentration of ∼25 mm. Three malate ions were placed into the exoplasmic (MAL1-MAL3) and three into the periplasmic region (MAL4-MAL6) and equilibrated for further 10 ps. Three of the malate ions possessed L-stereochemistry (MAL1, MAL3, MAL5), the others were D-enantiomers (MAL2, MAL4, MAL6) because D. acidovorans consumes both types. 3H. Engelhardt, unpublished results. Altogether, the system contained 996 amino acid residues, three protein-bound Ca2+ ions, 162 l-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid molecules, 14,323 TIP3P water molecules (40Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J. Impey R. Klein M. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29895) Google Scholar), and six malate ions, yielding 76,737 atoms in total. After complete equilibration, a 7-ns MD production run was carried out in a CPTA ensemble with hexagonal periodic boundary conditions. The integration time step was 1.6 fs. The trajectory was generated at a constant normal pressure of 1 atm, a constant temperature of 330 K, and a constant cross-section surface area. The temperature was kept constant using a Nosé-Hoover thermostat. The temperature of 330 K ensured a fluid liquid-crystalline Lα-membrane phase (38Im W. Roux B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1177-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). All calculations were performed using CHARMM version 28b2 (41Brooks B. Bruccoleri R. Olafson B. States D. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13941) Google Scholar) together with the PARAM22 all-atom parameter set for proteins and phospholipids (42MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellot M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. McCarthy D.J. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher III, W.E. Roux B. Schlenkrich M. Smith J.C. Stote R. Straub J. Watanabe M. Wiórkiewicz-Kuczera J. Yin D. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11686) Google Scholar). The partial charges on the malate ions were determined by MNDO in conjunction with Mulliken population analysis using the program InsightII (Accelrys Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The porin trimers were separated by 99.88 Å in the xy-plane, and the initial distance between the membrane centers was 87 Å in the z-dimension. Bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were kept constant using the SHAKE algorithm (43Ryckaert J. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H. J. Comput. Chem. 1977; 23: 327-341Google Scholar). Long range electrostatic interactions were treated using the Particle-Mesh-Ewald method (44Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (15621) Google Scholar) on a 100 × 100 × 72 grid for fast Fourier transforms, κ = 0.32 Å-1, and a sixth-order B-spline interpolation. The calculation of the van der Waals interactions was switched off between 8 and 10 Å. Global translation of the trimeric Omp32 was counteracted by the application of a cylindrical harmonic restraint to its center of mass in the xy-plane. The equilibration and the following 7-ns MD trajectory were calculated on eight processors of a Beowulf linux cluster. Electrophysiological Experiments—Conductance measurements were performed in sodium l-malate solutions at room temperature, using a two-compartment chamber separated by a septum containing a hole of 90 μm in diameter. The hole was covered by a lipid bilayer made of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Application of porin, data acquisition, and the digital setup were described previously (24Mathes A. Engelhardt H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1255-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at +20 mV with respect to the compartment containing the porin. The recombinant Omp32 used had the same conductance characteristics in KCl solutions as porin purified from outer membranes. 4E. Roth and H. Engelhardt, unpublished results. The current steps of porin insertion events were analyzed by means of our STEPSIZE procedure that is based on a correlation approach and was written for IGOR (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswega, OR). Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The crystallization attempts were aimed at obtaining high resolution structures of the membrane protein Omp32 to allow us to identify ordered organic acids that were incubated with the crystals. The protein was initially tested for crystallization in the presence of 2% β-d-octylglucoside under conditions similar to our previous experiments (25Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar) at high sulfate concentrations (>1.5 M). To allow organic acid molecules to compete for possible binding sites we screened for conditions depleted in divalent anions. However, a certain amount of sulfate ions appears to be indispensable for the formation of highly ordered crystalline arrays. Small needle-shaped crystals that grew over a 2-week period were observed with 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, and 0.2 m ammonium sulfate. These conditions were further refined yielding crystals of 0.3 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm. Crystals of appropriate size were directly used or soaked with l-malate before data collection. Soaking experiments with succinate and fumarate did not yield ordered substrate positions admittedly done in the presence of higher amounts of sulfate ions. Although the room temperature structure (PDB 1E54) was determined at 2.1 Å in rhombohedral space group R3, the data of the newly discovered crystal form were collected at 100 K. The collection statistics of all data are summarized in Table 1 in the supplemental data. In brief, Omp32 diffraction data sets NAT and MLT merge in the hexagonal space group P63 and diffracted to 1.5 and 1.45 Å resolution, respectively. Initial molecular replacement trials using the room temperature model as a basis resulted in clear solutions for the NAT and MLT data in rotation and translation function, and a crystallographically useful model arrangement with 1 monomer/asymmetric unit was achieved. The NAT protein structure was refined leading to a complete porin model (residues 1-332) and eight ordered residues of the periplasmic porin-associated protein PAP. PAP is highly flexible in crystals so that its complete structure could not be determined yet. The protein homologue of PAP in Neisseria meningitidis putatively binds to the peptidoglycan (45Grizot S. Buchanan S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1027-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and is assumed to stabilize outer membrane proteins (46Prinz T. Tommassen J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 183: 49-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional cofactors, two SO42-, two Ca2+, and one Cl- ions were added to both structures (NAT and MLT) according to high difference peaks in Fo - Fc maps. Surprisingly, at the same stage of the MLT model building it became obvious that crystals soaked either with malate or acetate (data not shown) lost their ability to bind the PAP. Concomitant with the loss of PAP a significant destabilization of the N terminus was observed. Although the MLT structure was refined under identical crystallographic restraints as NAT, the resulting electron density allowed tracing of residues 3-332 only, and the refined structure showed significantly increased B-values for the PAP-binding residues 3-6. The displacement of PAP yielded access for the integration of a single ordered detergent molecule into the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1, A and D). Two minor parts of the structure that deviate between the NAT and MLT structures are located within loop L3 (residues 98-110), both are directly involved in malate binding (see below). Further deviations were observed for the region at turn 2 (residues 46-51). More significant Fo - Fc density features within the pore interior not present in the unsoaked crystal structure were attributed to the malate binding site and were included in the further refinement (Fig. 1, A and D). The final well defined model of MLT including 377 (409 for the NAT structure) automatically picked waters has been refined to R/Rfree-values of 15.0/17.0% (15.0/17.9 for NAT), average B-factors of 14.8 (16.4 for NAT) for the main chain atoms and an excellent overall stereochemistry (Table 1, supplemental data). The large number of water molecules observed may originate from the surface charges, leading to the appearance of a densely covered protein channel. Channel Architecture and Substrate Location—The principal structural features of Omp32 corroborated a 2.1 Å model of the substrate-free porin based on data collected at room temperature (25Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The porin is a homotrimer formed by three 16-stranded β-barrels with antiparallel β-strands (β1-β16). Similar to other structurally known porins Omp32 possesses 8 exoplasmic loops (L1-L8) and 7 periplasmic β-turns of variable length. The N and C termini are oriented toward the periplasmic side and are located in the contact region between neighboring monomers. The longest loop L3 folds into the central pore and narrows the cross-section of the channel jointly with L8 and the small protrusion located on β2 (residues 32-37). Although L3 also constricts the channel in other porins with 16 β-strands the participation of L8 and the existence of a β-strand protrusion is unique for Omp32 (25Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Its channel constriction is therefore particularly narrow. The accessible cross-section for a molecule of 3-Å in diameter measures only 25 Å2 near the center in the crystal structure (Ref. 26Zachariae U. Helms V. Engelhardt H. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 954-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). It is interesting to compare the strategies of pore constrictions in the substrate-specific porins. In maltoporins, loops L1, L3, and L6 fold into the channel (5Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 6Forst D. Welte W. Wacker T. Diederichs K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Loop 1 is essentially a large “protrusion” of β-strand 2 that is stabilized by a cysteine bridge (47Meyer J.E.W. Hofnung M. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The loop is located at a position corresponding to that of L8 in Omp32. Loops L3 and L6 jointly form the constriction at the opposite channel wall in maltoporins. L3 in Omp32 possesses an additional protrusion (25Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and is much longer, apparently “replacing” the contribution of L6 in the sugar-specific porins. In principle, we observe a congruence in the building plan of the pore constriction in Omp32, the maltoporins, and ScrY, despite the distinct differences in the number of β-strands and in structural detail. In Omp32, 17 positively charged residues are distributed over both pore openings, 5 arginines are located in the exoplasmic half, while 7 arginines and 5 lysines are located on the periplasmic side. The positive charges in the pore are not compensated by negatively charged groups, which is the case in other porin channels (7Weiss M.S. Abele U. Weckesser J. Welte W. Schlitz E. Schulz G.E. Science. 1991; 254: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 8Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P.

Rosenbusch J. Benedi V. Schirmer T. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This is particularly important for the residues Arg38, Arg75, and Arg133, forming the fully charged arginine ladder in the constriction zone. Together they create a strong electrostatic field inside the channel that attracts anions (Fig. 1, B and C and Refs. 26Zachariae U. Helms V. Engelhardt H. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 954-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 48Zachariae U. Koumanov A. Engelhardt H. Karshikoff A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the MLT structure, five ions (two SO42-, one Cl-, and two Ca2+ ions) were discovered, some of which were not visible in the 1E54 structure probably because of differing crystallization conditions (i.e. pH), crystal packing, or the significant improvement in resolution (25Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In all three structures (1E54, NAT, MLT), a sulfate ion is bound to Arg38 (Fig. 1, E and F) in the same position, which is close to the minimum of the free energy a chloride ion experiences inside the channel (26Zachariae U. Helms V. Engelhardt H. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 954-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The second SO42- is kept in a clamp-like arrangement between Lys256 (on β13) and Arg329 (on β16) located close to the periplasmic channel exit (Fig. 1, D and F). The chloride ion is embedded in a pocket formed by the residues Arg76, Thr78, Ser80, and a water molecule, whereas the two Ca2+ are located outside at the monomer-monomer interface. All these sites were different from the binding site found for l-malate. The position of the divalent acid was identified in a clamp-like arrangement, creating an extended network of salt bridges and H-bonds in cl"

In mammals, the endogenous morphine synthetic pathway is associated with the dopamine and catecholamine biosynthetic pathway (for review, see Refs. 1Herbert R.B. Venter H. Pos S. Nat. Prod.

These authors have shown morphine de novo synthesis in human and animal primary and cancer cell cultures. Chromaffin cells are neuroendocrine cells originating from the neural crest and are the predominant cell type in the adrenal medulla (for review, see Ref. 13Aunis D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 181: 213-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells possess the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway, leading to dopamine and adrenaline/noradrenaline synthesis (13Aunis D. Int. Rev.

Chromaffin secretory granules contain a complex mixture of peptides and proteins that are co-released with catecholamines into the circulation in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation (13Aunis D.

Exogenously administered morphine is catabolized in the liver by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B enzyme family (24Turgeon D. Carrier J.S. Levesque E. Hum D.W. Belanger A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), leading to the formation of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). M3G is totally inactive, whereas M6G appears to display stronger analgesic activity than morphine (50-600 times depending on the animal model) (25Lotsch J. Geisslinger G. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2001; 40: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and exhibits a much longer half-life (26Romberg R. Olofsen E. Sarton E. den Hartigh J. Taschner P.E. Dahan A.

Using immunocytochemical, biochemical, and proteomic strategies, we reveal in this study that bovine chromaffin cell secretory granules store the PEBP·M6G complex. We show that M6G is secreted from bovine chromaffin cells upon nicotinic stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography experiments also revealed the interaction between the alkaloid carrier (i.e. PEBP) and a UGT2B-like enzyme necessary for the conversion of morphine into M6G. Finally, M6G de novo synthesis was demonstrated using the UGT2B-like enzyme present in chromaffin granules. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy Analysis—Bovine primary chromaffin cells cultured and fixed as described previously (23Goumon Y. Angelone T. Schoentgen F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Almas B.

Cells were then washed (6 × 5 min) with NaCl/Pi buffer and incubated with secondary antibodies (Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG at 1:2000 dilution and Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG at 1:2000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in NaCl/Pi buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37 °C. UGT2B was immunodetected using a commercial goat polyclonal antibody against the human UGT2B family (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and Alexa 488-conjugated donkey antibodies (1:2000 dilution). CGA was detected with rabbit anti-bovine CGA-(124-143) polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution; see above) and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution). All glass coverslips were mounted on a glass slide with a drop of Mowiol 4-88. Various controls were carried out to assess antibody specificity: (i) cells without antibody, (ii) secondary antibody incubated alone; and (iii) primary antibody incubated with the respective antigen prior to immunolabeling. Anti-UGT2B antibody was blocked with the commercial peptide (12 h, 4 °C, 1:5 (w/w) ratio; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-morphine antibody with M6G (12 h, 4 °C, 1:50 mol/mol ratio). Immunofluorescence staining was monitored with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope equipped with a Planapo oil immersion objective (×63, numerical aperture of 1.4) (23Goumon Y. Angelone T.

Carrier J.S. Montminy V. Beaulieu M. Belanger A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3869-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Isolation of Proteins Exocytotically Released from Stimulated Chromaffin Cells—Chromaffin cells (2.5 × 106) cultured for 3 days were washed (4 × 5 min) with 10 ml of Locke's solution at 37 °C to get rid of the culture medium and floating dead cells. Cells were subsequently stimulated for 10 min with 10 μm nicotine in Locke's solution as described previously (28Metz-Boutigue M.-H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The extracellular medium of unstimulated cells and Locke's solution were treated as controls. Secreted medium and controls were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and filtered with a 0.22-μm syringe filter to remove cells that might be present in secretions. Samples were acidified up to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to prevent degradation (23Goumon Y. Angelone T. Schoentgen F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Almas B. Fukami M.M. Langley K. Welters I.D. Tota B.

Purification of Alkaloids by RP-HPLC—Subcellular fractions (1 ml of the corresponding sucrose gradient fraction) were deproteinized and prepared as described previously (16Goumon Y. Zhu W. Weeks B.S. Casares F. Cadet P. Bougaeva M. Brownawell B. Stefano G.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alkaloids were purified using an ÄKTA purifier HPLC system (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and a Nucleosil RP300-5C18 column (4 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å porosity; Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France) as described (23Goumon Y.

Buffer A (TFA 0.1% (v/v) in water) and buffer B (acetonitrile 70%, TFA 0.1% in water (v/v)) were used. Mass Spectral Analysis—Mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS (MS/MS) analyses were performed by electrospray MS on a Q-TOF II (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) in positive mode. Scanning was done from 50 to 700 m/z in 1 s, and calibration was performed using 0.1% phosphoric acid in 50:50 water/acetonitrile. MS and MS/MS analysis were done by nanospray offline using NanoES spray capillaries (Protana, Odense, Denmark). For MS/MS experiments, argon grade 5.5 gas was used for the collision gas, and the collision energy was set to 10-30 eV. MS/MS spectra were acquired using the selection of the precursor ion by the quadrupole, and fragments were analyzed by time of flight. The absence of M6G prior to sample application was systematically controlled using the MS and MS/MS modes. Affinity Chromatography—Purified anti-bovine PEBP-(1-11) antibody (3 mg prepared as described (30Lugardon K. Chasserot-Golaz S. Kieffer A.E. Maget-Dana R. Nullans G. Kieffer B. Aunis D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35875-35882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) or commercial anti-human UGT2B antibody (200 μg) was coupled to a HiTrap NHS-activated high performance 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody-coupled column was first washed with 5 volumes of buffer A (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Samples (i.e. cytoplasm, microsomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and intragranular matrix) resuspended in buffer A (2 mg in a 1-ml final volume) were loaded onto the column and allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature. The column was then washed with 10 volumes of buffer A prior to elution performed with 1 ml of buffer B (150 mm NaCl and 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0). The eluate was immediately neutralized with 20 μl of buffer C (1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) prior to RP-HPLC analysis or desalting. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—500 μg of proteins isolated from the chromaffin granule matrix was treated as described previously using anti-human UGT2B antibody (31Marban C. Redel L. Suzanne S. Van Lint C. Lecestre D. Chasserot-Golaz S. Leid M. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. Rohr O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using rabbit anti-bovine PEBP-(1-11) polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution). A semiquantitative approach with different amounts of the granule matrix protein was used to quantify the amount of PEBP bound to the UGT2B-like enzyme. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—For one-dimensional electrophoresis analysis, proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide containing 10 or 12% acrylamide and electrotransferred as described (23Goumon Y. Angelone T. Schoentgen F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Almas B. Fukami M.M. Langley K. Welters I.D. Tota B. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13054-13064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis, isoelectric focusing was performed using the PROTEAN IEF™ cell isoelectric focusing system (Bio-Rad, Marnes-La-Coquette, France) equipped with dry polyacrylamide gel strips (11-cm immobilized pH gradient strips) using a pH 4-7 gradient (32Gasnier C. Lugardon K. Ruh O. Strub J.-M. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1789-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunodetected with goat polyclonal antibodies raised against the human UGT2B family (60 kDa, 1:500 dilution) and immunorevealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antisera. Control experiments using the antibodies were performed as described above. For silver staining, the gel was incubated in ethanol/acetic acid/water solution (40:10:50%) and treated using a Dodeca silver stain kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tryptic Digestion and Mass Spectrometry—Silver-stained bands were excised, washed with 100 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3, dehydrated twice with 100 μl of acetonitrile, and dried with a SpeedVac evaporator before reduction (10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm NH4HCO3) and alkylation (55 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm NH4HCO3) (33Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.-M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For tryptic digestion, gel pieces were resuspended in 3 gel volumes of trypsin (12.5 ng/μl) freshly diluted in 25 mm NH4HCO3 and incubated overnight at 35 °C. The digested peptides were then extracted from the gel in buffer containing 25% H2O, 70% acetonitrile, and 5% formic acid and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS and liquid chromatography/MS/MS. For nano-HPLC, a CapLC system (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) was used. Samples were concentrated on a precolumn, and peptides were separated on a column (75 μm, inner diameter × 15 cm) packed with C18 PepMap (3 μm, 100 Å; LC Packings). The MS and MS/MS analyses were performed with a Q-Tof II hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd.). Data analysis was performed with Global Server software (Micromass Ltd.) and Mascote (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) against the NCBI Database. M6G de Novo Synthesis—UGT2B was purified by affinity chromatography on an ÄKTA purifier HPLC System. The eluted material was desalted on a Sep-Pak cartridge and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-UGT2B antibody to confirm the presence of UGT2B-like material. The eluted fraction was also submitted to gel migration, followed by silver staining. Silver-stained bands were excised and treated as described above. The affinity-purified UGT2B-like enzyme was dried and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a reaction volume of 100 μl (100 μm UDP-glucuronic acid, 2 mm saccharolactone, 0.9 μm morphine, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.5). The resulting sample was deproteinized and desalted prior to Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis to examine the presence of M6G. Controls experiments were performed with the boiled affinity column eluate, the reaction buffer alone, and morphine used for the assay. Protein Deglycosylation—The intragranular UGT2B-like enzyme was deglycosylated using an enzymatic protein deglycosylation kit (Sigma) in presence of Triton X-100. Total deglycosylation was carried on using peptide: N-glycosidase F, O-glycosidase, α2(3,6,8,9)-neuraminidase, β1,4-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The non-deglycosylated control and the resulting deglycosylated products were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel prior to electrotransfer. Deglycosylation method efficiency was tested using a control glycosylated protein (fetuin, 10 μg) provided in the manufacturer's kit. Immunolabeling of Morphine-like Components in Chromaffin Cells—We extended our previous observations related to the presence of morphine and its derivatives in adrenal medulla and PC-12 cells (15Goumon Y. Stefano G.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 77: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Goumon Y. Zhu W. Weeks B.S. Casares F. Cadet P. Bougaeva M. Brownawell B. Stefano G.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by investigating the subcellular localization of morphine and its derivatives in chromaffin cells by laser confocal microscopy. Morphine localization was compared with CGA immunoreactivity, a specific marker of the intragranular matrix of secretory granules (23Goumon Y. Angelone T. Schoentgen F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Almas B. Fukami M.M. Langley K. Welters I.D. Tota B. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13054-13064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Morphine-like immunolabeling (Fig. 1A, left panel, green) was observed as bright dots in the cytoplasm, similar to that obtained with CGA (middle panel, red). The superimposition of the two labeled materials may suggest a partial intragranular co-localization in chromaffin granules (Fig. 1, A and B, right panels and arrows). Control experiments using anti-morphine antibody blocked with M6G prior to immunocytochemistry experiments or secondary antibody alone (Fig. 1C) were carried out to determine the specificity of labeling. Characterization of M6G in the Chromaffin Intragranular Matrix—To clearly demonstrate the presence of M6G in chromaffin granules, bovine intragranular matrix (33 mg) was isolated and loaded onto an RP-HPLC column to purify and characterize the alkaloids present. The HPLC gradient was specifically designed to separate M3G, morphine, M6G, codeine, and morphine acetate (500 pmol) (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the chromatography profile of the deproteinized intragranular material with the elution profile of standards indicated the presence of a peak with the same retention time as M6G. Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of this peak allowed its unambiguous identification as M6G (462.15 Da) according to its fragmentation profile generating morphine (i.e. 286.13 Da) (Fig. 2B). Identification of M6G Secreted from Nicotine-stimulated Cultured Chromaffin Cells—To characterize M6G as a secretory product of stimulated chromaffin cells, alkaloid standards (390 pmol) (Fig. 3A, panel 1) and the extracellular medium were analyzed by RP-HPLC. After stimulation with 10 μm nicotine, the secreted material was submitted to 1 n HCl and chloroform/isopropyl alcohol extractions. Alkaloids present in the aqueous phase were separated by RP-HPLC on a C18 column (panel 2). A major peak corresponding to the M6G standard was observed. In extracellular media corresponding to basal secretions, M6G could not be detected (panel 3), demonstrating the genuine release of M6G upon nicotine stimulation. Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of the peak corresponding to M6G unambiguously demonstrated the presence of M6G (462.15 Da) according to its fragmentation profile whereby morphine is generated (i.e. 286.13 Da) (Fig. 3B). Similar analysis revealed the absence of M6G in secretions from unstimulated cells (Fig. 3C). Evidence for Interaction between PEBP and M6G—We reported recently that PEBP is present in chromaffin granules and is able to translocate from the cytoplasm to the intragranular space probably via a granule membrane raft-binding mechanism (23Goumon Y. Angelone T. Schoentgen F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Almas B. Fukami M.M. Langley K. Welters I.D. Tota B. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13054-13064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on this property, we then examined the capacity of PEBP to bind intragranular morphine-like components by immunoaffinity experiments carried out using the intragranular matrix, cytoplasm, microsomes, mitochondria, and lysosomes. Immunoaffinity experiments using the purified antibody directed against PEBP-(1-11) were carried out to isolate the putative intragranular PEBP·morphine-like complex(es). Subcellular fraction extracts (20 mg each) were loaded onto a HiTrap NHS-activated column coupled with anti-PEBP-(1-11) antibody. The eluted PEBP-binding molecules were concentrated and then purified by RP-HPLC. The chromatograms in Fig. 4A represent the elution profile of a mixture of 500 pmol of standards (M3G, morphine, M6G, codeine, and morphine acetate) (panel 1) as well as the purification of immunoaffinity eluate from 20 mg of intragranular matrix (panel 2), cytoplasm and microsomes (panel 3), and mitochondria and lysosomes (panels 4 and 5). Peaks marked with arrows on chromatograms representing the affinity elution of the granule matrix, cytoplasm, and microsomes (panels 2 and 3) correspond to the elution time of the M6G standard. Only the intragranular matrix and, at a lower level, the fraction corresponding to the cytoplasm and microsomes contain M6G-like molecules, but not morphine. Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of the peak corresponding to M6G of the elution from the granule matrix (panel 2) detected M6G (462.15 Da) and its fragmentation-derived fragment (i.e. morphine, 286.13 Da) (Fig. 4B). Control experiments using the MS and MS/MS modes with the elution buffer confirmed that the eluted M6G did not result from contamination (Fig. 4C). Subcellular Localization of the UGT2B-like Enzyme in Chromaffin Cells—Given the presence of M6G in secretory granules, the presence of an enzyme able to convert morphine to M6G was investigated. It has been reported that UGT2B family enzymes, which act in this specific enzymatic reaction, are present in the microsomal fraction of several organs, including the liver (34Armstrong S.C. Cozza K.L. Psychosomatics. 2003; 44: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical experiments were performed on bovine primary cultured chromaffin cells using antibodies specific to UGT2B enzymes. Confocal laser microscopy revealed UGT2B immunoreactivity as a dispersed dotted pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A, green), which was found to co-localize partially with CG"

Cells naturally expressing the disialoganglioside GD3 often O-acetylate the terminal sialic acid residue, giving 9-O-acetyl-GD3 (9AcGD3), a marker of neural differentiation and malignant transformation. We also reported that Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with GD3 synthase can spontaneously O-acetylate some of the newly synthesized GD3. It is unclear whether such phenomena result from induction of the 9-O-acetylation machinery and whether induction is caused by the GD3 synthase protein or by the GD3 molecule itself. We now show that exogenously added GD3 rapidly incorporates into the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells, and 9AcGD3 is detected after ∼6 h. The incorporated GD3 and newly synthesized 9AcGD3 have a half-life of ∼24 h. This phenomenon is also seen in other cell types, such as human diploid fibroblasts. Inhibitors of gene transcription, protein translation, or endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport each prevent induction of 9-O-acetylation, without affecting GD3 incorporation. Inhibition of the initial clathrin-independent internalization of incorporated GD3 also blocks induction of 9-O-acetylation. Thus, new synthesis of one or more components of the 9-O-acetylation machinery is induced by incorporation and internalization of GD3. Prepriming with structurally related gangliosides fails to accelerate the onset of 9-O-acetylation of subsequently added GD3, indicating a requirement for specific recognition of GD3. To our knowledge, this is the first example wherein a newly expressed or exogenously introduced ganglioside induces de novo synthesis of an enzymatic machinery to modify itself, and the first evidence for a mechanism of induction of sialic acid O-acetylation.

With ceramide tails embedded in the membrane bilayer and glycans protruding from the surface, gangliosides are often clustered in microdomains and lipid rafts. Besides being major structural components in neural cell membranes, gangliosides have been found to play important roles in cell adhesion, cell recognition, signal transduction, and neural development (3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 4Vyas A.A. Schnaar R.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Allende M.L.

Early studies showed that when gangliosides in micellar form are exogenously added to cell culture media, they are capable of first becoming associated with cell surface proteins (a trypsin-sensitive component) and subsequently becoming inserted into the plasma membrane (becoming trypsin-resistant) (7Schwarzmann G. Hoffmann B.P. Schubert J. Sandhoff K. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5041-5048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter molecules are then indistinguishable from their endogenous counterparts that are synthesized in the same cell (8Callies R. Schwarzmann G. Radsak K. Siegert R. Wiegandt H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Schwarzmann G. Hoffmann-Bleihauer P. Schubert J. Sandhoff K. Marsh D. Biochem. 1983; 22: 3041-3048Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This technique has since been widely employed to study the metabolic fate and functions of gangliosides. Radioactive and fluorescently labeled gangliosides have been used to elegantly trace the internalization route of exogenous gangliosides, demonstrating that such gangliosides are internalized from the plasma membrane by a clathrin-independent, caveolar-related mechanism, subsequently transported to endosomes, and eventually degraded in lysosomes, and their components are recycled (10Schwarzmann G.

There is evidence that a small fraction of such internalized gangliosides can also be further glycosylated to make higher gangliosides (12Sonderfeld S. Conzelmann E. Schwarzmann G. Burg J.

Both GD3 and 9AcGD3 are prominently expressed during neuronal development, and their expression becomes very limited in adult tissues (18Yu R.K. Macala L.J. Taki T. Weinfield H.M. Yu F.S. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1825-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 19Levine J. Beasley L. Stallcup W. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 820-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Drazba J. Pierce M. Lemmon V. Dev. Biol. 1991; 145: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, both are aberrantly expressed in basal cell carcinomas and in malignant melanomas of various species (21Heidenheim M. Hansen E.R. Baadsgaard O. Br. J. Dermatol. 1995; 133: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Cheresh D.A. Reisfeld R.A. Varki A. Science. 1984; 225: 844-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that 9AcGD3 has its own biological significance, distinct from GD3. For example, unlike GD3, 9AcGD3 is a selective marker for germinal cells of the central nervous system (19Levine J. Beasley L. Stallcup W. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 820-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shows a dorsoventral gradient across the developing retina (23Constantine-Paton M. Blum A.S. Mendez-Otero R. Barnstable C.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). More recently 9AcGD3 has been shown to be associated with vinculin and β1-integrin at point contacts of neuronal growth cones (24Negreiros E.M. Leao A.C. Santiago M.F. Mendez-Otero R. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 57: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The CD60 subset of human T-lymphocyte markers includes GD3 and 9AcGD3 (25Fox D.A. He X. Abe A. Hollander T. Li L.L. Kan L. Friedman A.W. Shimizu Y. Shayman J.A. Kozarsky K. Immunol. Investig. 2001; 30: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Also, although certain cells are susceptible to GD3-mediated apoptosis, administration of 9AcGD3 can apparently prevent this process (26Malisan F. Franchi L. Tomassini B. Ventura N. Condo I. Rippo M.R. Rufini A. Liberati L. Nachtigall C. Kniep B. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Chen H.Y. Varki A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It remains unclear why most cells that express GD3 also 9-O-acetylate GD3. Unfortunately, the enzymatic machinery involved has proven very labile and difficult to directly assay, purify, or clone. We have previously reported studies on the biosynthesis and turnover of 9AcGD3 in GD3-expressing melanoma cells and GD3-synthase-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (28Manzi A.E. Sjoberg E.R. Diaz S. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13091-13103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sjoberg E.R. Varki A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7942-7948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the case of CHO cells which normally only express the precursor molecule GM3, new expression of GD3 caused by GD3-synthase transfection was accompanied by spontaneous appearance of 9AcGD3 (30Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15130-15138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It remained unclear whether this involved a pre-existing O-acetyltransferase that was simply “waiting” for the GD3 substrate to appear, or whether the O-acetyltransferase is newly induced, and if the latter was the case, whether the GD3 synthase protein or the GD3 molecule itself was involved in the induction. Here we describe the spontaneous 9-O-acetylation of exogenously added ganglioside GD3 that becomes incorporated into cells, presenting evidence for a new pathway in which GD3 induces 9-O-acetylation of itself. This 9-O-acetylation occurs in the absence of endogenous expression of GD3 synthase and requires new transcription and protein synthesis, presumably that of a specific 9-O-acetyltransferase, which may then work at the cell surface. Materials—Ganglioside GD3 was purchased from Matreya. Tissue culture media were from Invitrogen Corp. Other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—CHO-K1, human skin fibroblast, and 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL-61, CRL-1826, and CRL-11268, respectively). CHO-K1 cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. CHO-GD3, a cell line established previously by stable transfection of mouse GD3 synthase into parental CHO-K1 cells (31Satake H. Chen H.Y. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7942-7948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were grown in the same medium containing 0.8 mg/ml G418, to assure continued expression of GD3 synthase. Fibroblast cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with non-heat-inactivated 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. GD3 Feeding Study—Cells were grown in 6-well plates until ∼60% confluent. Ganglioside GD3 (Matreya catalog 1504) in chloroform: methanol 1:1 was dried down under vacuum by using a Speedvac rotor, resuspended in serum-free medium, and briefly sonicated to ensure proper micellar suspension. GD3-containing medium was passed through a 0.2-μm sterilizing filter and diluted with fresh medium to a final 50 μm concentration. Cells were then incubated in GD3-containing medium in a 37 °C incubator for varying periods of time, as indicated in the text, figures, or figure legends. Antibodies—The mouse IgG3 monoclonal antibodies R24 (32Pukel C.S. Lloyd K.O. Travassos L.R. Dippold W.G. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 155: 1133-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) against GD3 and 27A (33Reivinen J. Holthöfer H. Miettinen A. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 624-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) against 9AcGD3 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Farquhar, UCSD) were purified from hybridoma culture supernatants by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells (1 × 106) were trypsinized to eliminate nonspecifically adherent gangliosides and expose membrane-bound gangliosides. Briefly, standard EDTA/trypsin solutions normally used for passaging of tissue culture cells was added to minimally cover the cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 min, detached cells were collected, and the trypsin was quenched by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Each cell suspension was then incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with either 5 μg/ml R24 or 27A antibody precomplexed with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibody. After the final washing, the fluorescent intensity on the cell surface was measured using a Becton Dickinson FACScan instrument. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated using FlowJo software. As shown in the example in Fig. 1A, the forward and side scatter profiles of the CHO cells were very similar with or without GD3 addition. The gating shown in Fig. 1A excludes debris and obviously dead cells and is also typical of those used in all studies, capturing ∼93% of the cells. Of the cells in the gated area, more than 98% were typically viable, as determined by propidium iodide incorporation, and there was no obvious toxicity of added exogenous GD3. Therefore, in subsequent experiments, we did not routinely use propidium iodide for such screening. However, we did routinely gauge the forward and side scatter and use similar gating in all studies. Inhibitor Treatments—CHO-K1 cells were grown in 6-well plates until they were ∼60% confluent. For inhibition of biosynthesis or trafficking, cells were incubated in serum-free media containing brefeldin A (10 μg/ml), actinomycin D (200 ng/ml), or cycloheximide (25 μm) for 18 h along with 50 μm GD3. Endocytosis inhibitors were added at appropriate concentrations according to Puri et al. (34Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pretreated with chlorpromazine (6 μg/ml), nystatin (25 μg/ml), or genistein (200 μm) in serum-free medium for 2 h at 37°C. Cells were then exposed to serum-free medium containing 50 μm GD3 in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors for 18 h. For delayed endocytosis inhibition cells were first incubated with 50 μm GD3 for 6 h, followed by addition of chlorpromazine (6 μg/ml), nystatin (25 μg/ml), or genistein (200 μm) and continued inhibition for another 13 h. For each inhibitor treatment, no differences in cell viability were observed compared with sham treatment. To ensure that inhibitors did not nonspecifically induce degradation of 9AcGD3, they were also added to CHO-K1 cells that had been stably transfected with GD3 synthase (CHO-GD3). No difference in cell viability and no change in the expression of GD3 or 9AcGD3 were observed in CHO-GD3 cells over a period of 18 h. Appearance of 9AcGD3 on the CHO-K1 Cell Surface upon Addition of Exogenous GD3 to the Media—Wild type CHO cells predominantly express the monosialoganglioside GM3 and no detectable GD3 (35Weis F.M.B.

A. 1994; 91: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that when gangliosides are added to cell culture medium in the nanomolar to micromolar range, they are capable of inserting into the cell plasma membrane, becoming indistinguishable from endogenous gangliosides, and being subject to routine cellular trafficking and turnover (10Schwarzmann G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There is also some nonspecific adsorption to cell surface proteins, but these molecules can be removed by trypsin treatment (10Schwarzmann G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) before detection of the membrane-inserted molecules by antibodies. This trypsin treatment (see “Experimental Procedures”) also has the advantage that it better exposes the gangliosides for optimal detection by antibodies. We first incubated CHO-K1 cells in medium containing 50 μm GD3 with reduced serum (5% v/v). Using monoclonal antibodies R24 (detects GD3) and 27A (detects 9AcGD3), we found that after a 3-day incubation, GD3 molecules were incorporated onto CHO-K1 cell surface in a trypsin-resistant fashion and that a small but noticeable amount was 9-O-acetylated (see Fig. 1B, top panels). After 7 days of incubation, a significant portion of the incorporated GD3 became 9-O-acetylated (see Fig. 1B, bottom panels). As indicated in Fig. 1A and “Experimental Procedures,” the addition of GD3 caused no major change in forward and side scatter of the cells, and there was no change in cell viability (detailed data not shown). A similar phenomenon was observed at a much faster rate, when GD3 was incubated in serum-free medium (serum is known to inhibit the incorporation of exogenously added gangliosides into the cell membrane) (10Schwarzmann G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, under serum-free conditions, GD3 molecules were inserted into the plasma membrane within the first 3 h of incubation. By the 6th hour, 9-O-acetylation was detected by antibody staining. At later time points, GD3 levels fluctuated as more molecules became incorporated and 9-O-acetylated. At the end of a 24-h incubation, a substantial amount of GD3 was 9-O-acetylated. It is not entirely clear why there is a broad peak of GD3 at 3 and 24 h but a tight and brighter peak at 6–9 h. We assume that only a finite amount of GD3 can become incorporated and that there is an equilibrium achieved with endocytic turnover from the cell surface, preventing unlimited GD3 accumulation. Also, as some of the GD3 becomes 9-O-acetylated at later time points, there would be correspondingly less GD3 detected on the cell surface, as the antibody R24 only recognizes the non-9-O-acetylated GD3. We did indirect fluorescence microscopy of these cells under several of these conditions, and the findings were generally consistent with the flow cytometry data and the above interpretations. We obtained similar results using another approach where cells were first serum-starved overnight to induce cellular quiescence, after which GD3 was added for 18 h in serum-free medium (data not shown). In follow-up experiments, it was observed that 9-O-acetylation only occurs if GD3 is maintained in the medium for more than 6 h. If GD3 is removed from the medium after 3 h of incubation, no 9-O-acetylation is observed at later time points, despite a substantial amount of GD3 molecules having already been incorporated (data not shown). This suggests that induction of the 9-O-acetylation machinery requires continued incorporation of new GD3 molecules, possibly to maintain a certain critical cell surface concentration for >3 h. All of these phenomena were best observed if cells were in a subconfluent stage prior to the start of the GD3 addition. Turnover Rate of Incorporated GD3 and Newly Synthesized 9AcGD3—We determined the turnover time of exogenous GD3 and the resulting 9AcGD3 by first loading GD3 onto CHO-K1 cell surface for 24 h in serum-free medium. The GD3-containing medium was then removed and replaced with regular serum-free medium, and samples were taken at various time points to check for GD3 and 9AcGD3 expression. The MFI of GD3 and 9AcGD3 antibody staining was calculated using FlowJo software. The initial GD3 and 9AcGD3 MFIs at time 0 prior to chase were set at 100%. As shown in Fig. 3, the amounts of trypsin-resistant GD3 and 9AcGD3 increased during the first 3 h of the chase. This increase is likely because of the slow incorporation of the remaining cell membrane-associated (trypsin-sensitive) GD3 into the membrane bilayer (trypsin-resistant). Following this initial increase, the amount of cell surface trypsin-resistant GD3 steadily declined. After a 30 h chase, the fluorescence intensity dropped by 50%, and very little GD3 remained on the cell surface after 48 h. On the other hand, total 9AcGD3 fluorescence intensity continued to increase for 12 h. However, after 12 h the level of 9AcGD3 decreased at a rate similar to GD3. This suggests that a continual presence of GD3 may be required to maintain 9-O-acetyltransferase activity. It is also possible that a negative feedback mechanism exists, to sustain an optimal ratio of GD3 to 9AcGD3. Otherwise, the remaining amount of GD3 should have continued to be 9-O-acetylated until it was all converted to 9AcGD3. 9-O-Acetylation of Exogenous GD3 in Other Cell Lines—In many instances where the GD3 ganglioside is found to be naturally expressed, there is already some level of expression of 9AcGD3. The current observation of 9-O-acetylation of exogenously added GD3 is thus likely to be mimicking this natural phenomenon. To rule out that this is strictly a CHO cell-specific phenomenon, we tested two other cell lines with very different properties that do not naturally express GD3 or 9AcGD3. Human skin fibroblast (CCD-919Sk) is a primary cell line and undergoes senescence with multiple cell culture passages, and 293T cells are immortalized human kidney epithelial cells. These cells do not express detectable amounts of GD3 under typical cell culture conditions (see Fig. 4). Upon overnight incubation with GD3 in serum-free medium, both cell lines incorporated considerable levels of trypsin-resistant GD3 on the cell surface. Staining with 27A antibody revealed 9-O-acetylation of exogenous GD3, with CCD-919Sk cells expressing more than 293T cells. This indicates that 9-O-acetylation of exogenous GD3 occurs in more than one species and cell type and that the degree of 9-O-acetylation varies with the cell type. 9-O-Acetylation of GD3 Requires New Protein Synthesis—Based on our data up to this point, the GD3 9-O-acetyltransferase could either be constitutively expressed in CHO-K1 and other cell types (i.e. waiting for the appearance of the GD3 substrate) or be induced only when GD3 becomes available. There is unfortunately no reliable method to directly measure the 9-O-acetyltransferase enzyme activity using exogenous GD3 as a substrate. The enzyme activity is too labile after solubilization, and the efforts of many investigators have failed to isolate or clone sialic acid 9-O-acetyltransferases (30Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15130-15138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Kanamori A. Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Stallcup W.B. Sasaki K. Fukuda M. Hirabayashi Y. Proc.

Commun. 1996; 225: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, we turned to other approaches to explore the phenomenon of O-acetylation of exogenously added GD3. To determine whether new synthesis of proteins is required for the appearance of 9-O-acetylation, we inhibited protein production at the transcriptional, translational, or ER-Golgi transport levels. Actinomycin D binds to double stranded DNA and prevents RNA synthesis, cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the ribosome, and brefeldin A blocks membrane binding of ADP-ribosylation Factor 1, collapsing the cis and medial Golgi into the ER, and thereby blocking ER to Golgi transport. As shown in Fig. 5, both actinomycin D and cycloheximide completely abolished 9-O-acetylation induced by exogenous GD3 addition. Brefeldin A also exhibited a profound inhibitory effect. Because prior biochemical studies indicate that 9-O-acetyltransferases are localized in the late Golgi apparatus (40Diaz S. Higa H.H. Hayes B.K. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19416-19426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Higa H.H. Butor C. Diaz S. Varki A. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 15: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we postulated that the addition of brefeldin A would prevent any newly synthesized 9-O-acetyltransferase molecules from reaching their natural localization. On the other hand, none of these inhibitors had any significant effect on the incorporation of GD3 into the plasma membrane. This data also eliminates the possibility that exogenous GD3 induces the expression of endogenous GD3 synthase molecule, which in turn synthesizes endogenous GD3 and 9AcGD3 from pre-existing GM3. It is unclear why there is a doublet in the GD3 profile with cycloheximide treatment. This treatment can have additional effects by preventing the synthesis of various proteins, e.g. perhaps those involved in GD3 internalization. Regardless, the dramatic effects on blockade of O-acetylation are very clear, as is the interpretation of the overall result, especially when taken together with the actinomycin D and brefeldin A effects. 9-O-Acetylation of GD3 Is Decreased by Endocytosis Inhibitors—Cell surface gangliosides are typically found in microdomains and rafts (2Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 43Vyas K.A. Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Schnaar R.L. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). No study has been done on the fate of plasma membrane-associated GD3. However, Sandhoff and colleagues reported that exogenously added radiolabeled GM2 (12Sonderfeld S. Conzelmann E. Schwarzmann G. Burg J. Hinrichs U. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and biotinylated GM1 (13Möbius W. Herzog V. Sandhoff K. Schwarzmann G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are internalized and degraded in lysosomes. Using certain inhibitors, Pagano and colleagues (44Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrated that exogenously added BODIPY-labeled glucosylceramide is endocytosed primarily through clathrin-independent endocytosis. Although BODIPY-glycolipids are somewhat different from normal gangliosides (they can be removed from the plasma membrane by added albumin) we postulated that exogenous GD3 would also be endocytosed mainly through a clathrin-independent pathway. To determine whether 9-O-acetylation would be affected by endocytic processes, CHO cells were first pretreated with the same inhibitors, chlorpromazine, genistein, or nystatin. After pretreatment for 2 h, 50 μm GD3 was added into the medium and incubated overnight in the continued presence of inhibitors. Fig. 6 shows that the inhibitors had no adverse effect on the initial incorporation of GD3. In fact, GD3 levels were slightly higher, presumably because of inhibition of endocytosis and clearance from the surface. In contrast, 9AcGD3 expression decreased dramatically. Both chlorpromazine and genistein inhibited 9-O-acetylation by ∼50%, and the addition of nystatin almost completely abolished it. These data suggest that induction of the 9-O-acetylation of GD3 relies on both clathrin-independent and -dependent pathways, with clathrin-independent endo"

https://openalex.org/W2001811371,"It was recently shown that ALA1, the only alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, uses two successive ACG triplets as the translation initiators for its mitochondrial form. Evidence presented here argues that the second ACG triplet not only acts as a remedial initiation site for scanning ribosomes that skip the first ACG, but also enhances the activity of the preceding initiator by providing a preferable “A” at its relative position +4. Therefore, ALA1 constructs with redundant ACG initiators exhibit stronger complementing activity and express a higher level of protein than do those with a single ACG initiator. A similar scenario is seen when a single or redundant ACG triplets are placed in the positions of the first and second AUG initiators of VAS1, which serve as the start sites of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of valyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively. Cumulatively, the results suggest that this feature of redundancy of non-AUG initiators in a single mRNA per se may represent a novel paradigm for improving the efficiency of a poor or otherwise nonproductive initiation event.

Therefore, ALA1 constructs with redundant ACG initiators exhibit stronger complementing activity and express a higher level of protein than do those with a single ACG initiator. A similar scenario is seen when a single or redundant ACG triplets are placed in the positions of the first and second AUG initiators of VAS1, which serve as the start sites of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of valyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively. Cumulatively, the results suggest that this feature of redundancy of non-AUG initiators in a single mRNA per se may represent a novel paradigm for improving the efficiency of a poor or otherwise nonproductive initiation event. Typically, there are 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in prokaryotes, one for each amino acid (1Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology.in: Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed.

In eukaryotes, protein synthesis occurs not only in the cytoplasm but also in organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts (5Maréchal-Drouard L. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 8: 115-131Google Scholar). Thus, eukaryotes, such as yeast, need distinct sets of proteins for each aminoacylation activity, one localized to the cytoplasm and the other to the mitochondria. Each set aminoacylates the isoaccepting tRNAs within its respective cell compartment and is sequestered from isoacceptors confined in other compartments. In most cases, the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities are encoded by two distinct nuclear genes, regardless of the cell compartments to which they are confined. However, two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, HTS1 (the gene encoding histidyl-tRNA synthetase) (6Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and VAS1 (the gene encoding valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) 2The abbreviations used are: ValRS, valyl-tRNA synthetase; AlaRS, alanyl-tRNA synthetase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; YPG, yeast extract-peptone-glycerol. ) (7Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specify both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms through alternative initiation from two in frame AUG codons. Each of these genes encodes mRNAs with distinct 5′-ends. Some of these mRNAs have their 5′-ends located upstream of the first AUG codon, whereas others have their 5′-ends located between the first and second AUG codons. The mitochondrial form of the enzyme is translated from the first AUG on the “long” messages, whereas the cytosolic form is translated from the second in-frame AUG on the “short” messages. Hence, the mitochondrial enzymes have the same polypeptide sequences as their cytosolic counterparts, except for a short amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. The transit peptide is subsequently cleaved away upon import into the mitochondria. Because the two isozymes are targeted to different compartments, the two isoforms of ValRS, for example, cannot substitute for each other in vivo (7Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar scenario has been observed for the genes that encode the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of Arabidopsis thaliana alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), threonyl-tRNA synthetase, and ValRS (8Souciet G. Menand B. Ovesna J. Cosset A. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, two rare cases of one gene encoding both activities have also been discovered in yeast in which the protein isoforms are produced by alternative use of two in-frame initiation codons: an upstream non-AUG initiator and a downstream AUG initiator (9Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a stringent process requiring not only initiator tRNA but also many protein factors. Upon binding to the cap structure, the 43 S preinitiation complex, composed of the 40 S ribosome and initiation factors, moves along the mRNA in a 3′ direction until it encounters the first AUG codon. At this point, GTP hydrolysis that leads to dissociation of the eIF2-GDP complex from the initiator tRNA in the preinitiation complex signifies a 3-bp codon/anticodon interaction between Met-tRNAiMet and the start codon (11Unbehaun A. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3078-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recognition of a non-AUG initiator is probably mediated by a similar mechanism but with a lower level of GTP hydrolysis, due to poor interaction between the start codon and initiator tRNA. Previous studies on CYC1 (12Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Schweingruber A.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in S. cerevisiae suggested that AUG is the only codon recognized as the translational initiator and that the AUG codon nearest the 5′-end of an mRNA serves as the start site for translation. If the first AUG codon is mutated, then initiation can begin at the next available AUG from the 5′-end of the message. The same rules apply to all eukaryotes. However, there are many examples in higher eukaryotes, where cellular and viral mRNAs can initiate from “non-AUG” codons that differ from AUG by just one nucleotide (13Kozak M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The relatively weak base pairing between a non-AUG codon and the anticodon of an initiator tRNA appears to be compensated for by interactions with nearby nucleotides, in particular a purine (A or G) in position –3 and a “G” in position +4 (14Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mutations in the sequence region surrounding the first AUG can lead to its inefficient utilization as initiator and subsequent use of an AUG at a downstream location. In addition to sequence context, a stable hairpin structure located 12–15 nucleotides downstream from the initiator can also facilitate recognition of a non-AUG codon by the 40 S ribosomal subunit (15Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In contrast, there seems to be little effect from sequence context in yeast (16Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 2964-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and perhaps for that reason, yeast cannot efficiently use non-AUG codons as the translation start site (17Clements J.M. Laz T.M. Sherman F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4533-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). So far, only three yeast genes, GRS1 (one of the two glycyl-tRNA synthetase genes in S. cerevisiae) (9Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), ALA1 (the only AlaRS gene in S. cerevisiae) (10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and CARP2A (the gene coding for acidic ribosomal protein P2A in Candida albicans) (18Abramczyk D. Tchorzewski M. Grankowski N. Yeast. 2003; 20: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have been reported to use naturally occurring non-AUG triplets as translation initiators. In the case of CARP2A, a non-AUG codon (i.e. GUG) serves as the exclusive translation initiator, whereas in the cases of ALA1 and GRS1, non-AUG codons act as alternative translation initiators that are accompanied by a downstream in-frame AUG. Although there are two homologous glycyl-tRNA synthetase genes, namely GRS1 and GRS2, in the yeast genome, only one (i.e. GRS1) is functional and provides both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aminoacylation activities, whereas the other (i.e. GRS2) appears to be dispensable for growth (19Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further studies by site-specific mutagenesis indicated that these two activities are provided by two functionally exclusive protein isoforms alternatively generated from a single message of GRS1. A short form that is responsible for the cytoplasmic activity is translationally initiated from a classical AUG initiator, whereas a longer isoform that provides the mitochondrial activity is initiated from an upstream in-frame UUG codon (9Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Expression of ALA1 follows a similar scenario. However, unlike all previous examples of non-AUG initiation, the mitochondrial form of AlaRS is initiated from two successive in-frame ACG triplets 69 nucleotides upstream of the putative AUG initiator of the cytoplasmic form (i.e. ACG(–25) and ACG(–24)) (10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). (The numbers –25 and –24 in parenthesis refer to the 25- and 24-codon triplets that precede AUG1, respectively.) These two ACG triplets function redundantly in initiation of protein translation. In this report, we investigated the unique feature of redundancy of non-AUG initiators in protein synthesis and the effect of sequence context on initiation from these noncanonical start sites. In particular, we wondered whether redundant ACG triplets could function in a gene that normally uses an AUG initiator. Quantitative analyses by growth curve assays as well as Western blots showed that redundant ACG triplets are more efficient in initiation of protein translation than a single ACG triplet. Sequence context, in particular the nucleotide at position +4 relative to the non-AUG initiator, also considerably affected the efficiency of translation initiation. Remarkably, redundant ACG triplets could not only substitute for the AUG initiator of the mitochondrial form but also the AUG initiator of the cytoplasmic isoform of VAS1. A single ACG triplet, on the other hand, could barely do so. But most surprising of all, redundant ACG triplets could still function as initiators when relocated to a position 5 codons downstream of the native initiation site. It is therefore likely that the efficiency of a relatively weak initiation event can be enhanced by successive recognition of two or more poor initiators by leaky ribosomes. Considering the fact that sequence context provides only limited help for recognition of the start site in yeast, this elegant feature of redundancy of non-AUG initiators may be important for expression of certain genes in this microorganism. Construction of Mutants and Plasmids—The wild-type ALA1 gene (designated as wt ALA1) (20Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), extending from 250-bp upstream of its open reading frame to 300-bp downstream of the stop codon, was first amplified by PCR, using yeast genomic DNA as the template, and then cloned into the low copy number yeast shuttle vector pRS315 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for expression. Various point mutations, such as ACG(–25) to AAT and ACG(–24) to TCG, were subsequently introduced into the wild-type clone following standard protocols. Construction of the wild-type VAS1 gene and its mutants in the high copy number yeast shuttle vector pRS425 followed a similar strategy (22Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Construction of the lexA gene and various ALA1-lexA fusions for Western blot analysis was as previously described (10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of lexA was amplified by PCR as an NdeI-XhoI fragment and cloned in the high copy number yeast shuttle vector pADH to give wild-type lexA, where the initiator ATG is part of the NdeI site. The NdeI site at the 5′-end of lexA was subsequently mutated to a SpeI site, resulting in lexA*, where the asterisk denotes a mutation in the ATG initiator of lexA. A wild type or mutant ALA1 sequence containing base pairs –105 to –24 relative to ATG1 was amplified by PCR as a PstI-SpeI fragment and cloned in-frame into the PstI/SpeI sites 5′ to lexA*, resulting in ALA1-lexA* fusions. These ALA1-lexA* constructs were expressed under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter (23Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of various VAS1-lexA* fusions followed a similar strategy. Complementation Assays for the Cytoplasmic Function of ALA1—The yeast ALA1 knock-out strain TRY11 (MATa, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, lys2-801, trp1Δ101, ura3-52, ala1Δ::TRP1) is maintained by a plasmid carrying the wild-type ALA1 gene and a URA3 marker (20Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Complementation assays for the cytoplasmic function of plasmid-borne ALA1 and its derivatives were carried out by introducing a test plasmid (with a LEU2 marker) into TRY11 and determining the ability of transformants to grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). The cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days or until colonies appeared. Photos for the complementation assays were taken at day 3 following incubation. The transformants evicted the maintenance plasmid that carries a URA3 marker in the presence of 5-FOA. Thus, only an enzyme with the cytoplasmic AlaRS activity encoded by the test plasmid could rescue the growth defect. Complementation Assays for the Mitochondrial Function of ALA1—Briefly, TRY11 was co-transformed with a test plasmid (carrying a LEU2 marker) and the second maintenance plasmid. In the presence of 5-FOA, the first maintenance plasmid (carrying a URA3 marker) was evicted from the co-transformants, whereas the second maintenance plasmid (carrying a HIS3 marker) was retained. Thus, all co-transformants survived 5-FOA selections, due to the presence of the cytoplasmic AlaRS derived from the second maintenance plasmid. The co-transformants were further tested on YPG plates for their mitochondrial phenotypes at 30 °C, with results documented at day 3 following plating. Because a yeast cell cannot survive on glycerol without functional mitochondria, the co-transformants do not grow on YPG plates unless a functional mitochondrial AlaRS is generated from the test plasmid. The second maintenance plasmid (with a HIS3 marker) contained ALA1(I(–1)stop) cloned in pRS313 (10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Complementation assays for the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions of VAS1 and its mutants were as previously described (22Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Western Blot—The protein expression patterns of the lexA fusions were determined by a chemiluminescence-based Western blot analysis following standard protocols. The lexA fusion constructs were first transformed into INVSc1 (Novagen), and the transformants were subsequently grown in a selection medium lacking leucine. Total protein extracts were prepared from each of the transformants with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of the protein extracts (∼40 μg) were loaded onto a minigel (size 8 × 10 cm) containing 12% polyacrylamide and electrophoresed at 100 V for ∼2 h. Following electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer device. The membrane was probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-LexA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and then exposed to an x-ray film following the addition of the appropriate substrates. The Western blot data were obtained from at least three independent experiments (only one blot was shown in each figure), and the relative intensity of the protein bands shown was presented as (mean ± 2 × S.D.) using the mean value of the intensity of the protein band initiated from the native initiator as a reference. Growth Curve Assay—Growth curve assays for the plasmid-borne cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ValRS activities were carried out in 5-FOA and YPG broth, respectively. For determining the cytoplasmic activity, one colony of the CW1 (a vas1– strain) transformants grown on an SD/–Ura–Leu plate was inoculated in 3 ml of SD broth lacking uracil and leucine and grown to stationary phase. Appropriate amounts of the cell culture were transferred to a flask containing 10 ml of 5-FOA broth to a final cell density of A600 = 0.1. The cell culture was shaken in a 30 °C incubator, and the cell density of the culture was checked every 16 h for a period of 96 h. For determining the mitochondrial activity, CW1 co-transformants grown on an SD/–Ura–His–Leu plate were first selected on a 5-FOA plate, and then one colony of the survivors was inoculated in 3 ml of SD broth lacking histidine and leucine and grown to stationary phase. Appropriate amounts of the cell culture were transferred to a flask containing 10 ml of YPG broth to a final cell density of A600 = 0.1. The cell culture was shaken in a 30 °C incubator, and the cell density of the culture was checked every 4 h for a period of 28 h. Redundant ACG Triplets Acting as a Translation Start Site—Unlike all known genes that use a single non-AUG codon as an alternative or exclusive start site, ALA1, the only gene coding for AlaRS in the yeast genome (20Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), uses redundant ACG codons as the start sites for the synthesis of its mitochondrial form (10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These two ACG triplets function redundantly. Either triplet can initiate translation of the mitochondrial form in the absence of the other. Nevertheless, ACG(–25) appeared to play a predominant role in initiation, as demonstrated by a qualitative complementation test (10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We wondered whether this feature of redundancy is just a fluke or represents a novel mechanism of translational control of ALA1 gene expression. To gain further insight, various mutations were introduced at or near the ACG triplets and tested for their effect on synthesis of the mitochondrial preprotein. Assaying mitochondrial AlaRS activity for constructs that express a functional cytoplasmic AlaRS could be carried out by plating the transformants on YPG (yeast extract-peptone-glycerol) following selection on 5-FOA. However, assaying mitochondrial AlaRS activity for constructs that do not encode a functional cytoplasmic AlaRS required an additional maintenance plasmid to provide the essential, cytoplasmic AlaRS activity (after eviction of the original maintenance plasmid on 5-FOA plates). To be consistent, assays of mitochondrial AlaRS activity were carried out for all constructs in the same manner in this report, irrespective of their potential to express a cytoplasmic AlaRS. For this purpose, we co-transformed TRY11 with a second maintenance plasmid that expresses a functional cytoplasmic AlaRS but is defective in mitochondrial AlaRS activity. As shown in Fig. 1, mutation of ACG(–24) to ACC (inactivating the second ACG initiator while maintaining the +4 nucleotide A relative to ACG(–25)), TCG (changing the +4 nucleotide to T while maintaining the +5 and +6 nucleotides relative to ACG(–25)), or TTG (further changing TCG(–24) to a potential non-ATG initiator), resulting in pKJ216, pHLT35, and pKJ217, respectively, had no detectable effect on the ability of the gene to rescue the growth defect of an ala1– yeast strain on a YPG plate (Fig. 1B), i.e. transformants formed colonies after ∼2–3 days of growth on the YPG plate, suggesting that ACG(–25) alone is sufficient for initiation of the mitochondrial protein. In contrast, when ACG(–25) was mutated to AAT (inactivating the first ACG initiator while maintaining the –3 nucleotide A relative to ACG(–24)), resulting in pHLT31, the mitochondrial activity of the mutant was drastically compromised (i.e. transformants did not appear until after ∼3–4 days of incubation on the YPG plate (Fig. 1B) and remained small even after 5 days of growth (data not shown)). Such an adverse effect could be readily rescued by a second mutation that changed TCA(–23) to ACA (resulting in pIVY86), suggesting that the nucleotide at position +4 relative to ACG(–24) also modulates the initiating potential of the weak initiator, with “A” being a more preferable nucleotide. A similar effect was seen when TCA(–23) was mutated to ACG (resulting in pKJ180). Comparison of the initiating activity of a single versus redundant ACG triplets was further carried out by a quantitative growth curve assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, transformants harboring pHLT35 (with the second ACG mutated) grew almost equally well as those harboring pCW413 (wild-type ALA1), but much better than those harboring pHLT31 (with the first ACG mutated) or pHLT27 (with both ACG initiators mutated). It should be noted that although the only remaining ACG initiator in pHLT35 and pHLT31 contains a similar sequence context at its –3 and +4 positions, ACG(–25) apparently has a higher initiating activity than ACG(–24). We reckoned that nucleotides at other locations or distance from a possible downstream secondary structure might also play a significant role in recognition of the translation initiators. To look directly at the protein levels initiated from these various triplets, we turned to Western blot analysis. A wild-type or mutant ALA1 sequence containing base pairs –105 to –24 was amplified by PCR from the above mentioned mutants (Fig. 1A) and fused in frame to the open reading frame of lexA* (where the native ATG initiator had been inactivated by mutation to ACT), resulting in various ALA1-lexA* constructs (exemplified in Fig. 2A). These fusions were expressed under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter. We have previously shown that the efficiency of translation initiation from the redundant ACG triplets is around 30% compared with an AUG codon placed in the same position (10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that more protein was produced from the redundant ACG triplets than from either of the ACG triplets (compare pKJ258, pKJ279, and pKJ281), and ACG(–25) is more robust than ACG(–24) (compare pKJ279 and pKJ281), consistent with the observations made in functional assays. When the redundant ACG triplets were both mutated to codons unsuitable for initiation, no protein band was observed (see pKJ284). When ACG(–24) was mutated to ACC (resulting in pKJ278), protein synthesis was also significantly reduced as compared with the redundant ACG triplets (compare pKJ258 and pKJ278), but was much higher than that from pKJ279, which hasaTat nucleotide +4 relative to ACG(–25) (compare pKJ278 and pKJ279). This result suggested that the nature of the nucleotide at position +4 relative to ACG(–25) also affects the initiating potential of the poor initiator, with A being a more favorable nucleotide than T. Remarkably, when TCG(–24) in pKJ279 was further mutated to TTG (resulting in pKJ280), the overall production of protein increased to a level comparable with that from pKJ278 (compare pKJ278, pKJ279, and pKJ280), despite the fact that both pKJ279 and pKJ280 have a T at nucleotide position +4 relative to ACG(–25). Thus, it appears that redundant non-AUG initiators, such as ACG/ACG (in pKJ258) and ACG/TTG (in pKJ280), serve as better start sites than a single non-AUG initiator, such as ACG/TCG (in pKJ279). In addition, sequence context also appears to play a significant role in initiation, as evidenced by the higher protein expression level from ACG/ACC than from ACG/TCG (in these two instances, only ACG(–25) actually initiates the protein translation, whereas the codon at position –24 modulates its initiating efficiency and is not by itself base-paired with initiator tRNA for initiation). A similar scenario was seen in the initiation event of ACG(–24), where ACG(–25) had been inactivated by mutation to AAT. When TCA(–23) in pKJ281 was mutated to ACA (resulting in pKJ282), the initiating activity of ACG(–24) was significantly enhanced (compare pKJ281 and pKJ282). When ACA(–23) in pKJ282 was further mutated to ACG (resulting in pKJ283), the overall production of protein increased even more (compare pKJ282 and pKJ283). Thus, redundant ACG triplets (ACG(–25)/ACG(–24) or ACG(–24)/ACG(–23)) function as a better start site than a single ACG triplet, irrespective of their locations. Since ACG(–25) appears to be more robust than ACG(–24) within a similar context, we wondered whether we could enhance the initiating activity of ACG(–24) simply by inserting an extra codon downstream of this site, thereby changing the relative position of this ACG to codon position –25 relative to ATG1. As shown in Fig. 2B, inserting an extra codon behind ACG(–24) (by changing TCA(–23) to AGATCT) (resulting in pKJ285) did enhance its initiating activity (compare pKJ281 and pKJ285), but this effect appears to result from changes in sequence context (i.e. the nucleotide at position +4 relative to ACG(–24) changed from T to A) rather than changes in position relative to ATG1 (compare pKJ278, pKJ282, and pKJ285). As a result, ACG/ACG appears to be the best initiation site among these variants, perhaps because it combines the beneficiary effects of both sequence context and redundancy of non-AUG initiators. Substituting the AUG Initiator of the Mitochondrial Form of ValRS with Redundant ACG Triplets—Our previous study has shown that redundant ACG triplets are only ∼30% as strong as an AUG initiator located within a similar sequence context (10Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We wondered whether redundant ACG triplets or even a single ACG triplet could serve as the start site for a gene that normally initiates from an ATG triplet. We chose VAS1, the yeast gene that codes for both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of ValRS through alternative transcription and translation, as the target for its well characterized translation patterns and complementation activities (22Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To start with, ATG1 of VAS1 (i.e. the ATG initiator of the mitochondrial form of ValRS) was substituted with a single ACG or redundant ACG triplets and tested for its effect on protein"
https://openalex.org/W2074358899,"In a previous study, we demonstrated that the β5′-loop in the C-terminal domain of human pancreatic triglyceride lipase (hPTL) makes a major contribution in the function of hPTL (Chahinian et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 13725–13735). In the present study, we characterized the contribution of three residues in the β5′-loop, Val-407, Ile-408, and Leu-412, to the function of hPTL. By substituting charged residues, aspartate or lysine, in these positions, we altered the hydrophilic to lipophilic ratio of the β5′-loop. Each of the mutants was expressed, purified, and characterized for activity and binding with both monolayers and emulsions and for binding to colipase. Experiments with monolayers and with emulsions suggested that the interaction of hPTL with a phospholipid monolayer differs from the interaction of the hPTL-colipase complex with a dicaprin monolayer or a triglyceride emulsion (i.e. neutral lipids). Val-407, Ile-408, and Leu-412 make major contributions to interactions with monolayers, whereas only Val-407 and Ile-408 appear essential for activity on triglyceride emulsions in the presence of bile salt micelles. In solutions of taurodeoxycholate at micellar concentrations, a major effect of the β5′-loop mutations is to change the interaction between hPTL and colipase. These observations support a major contribution of residues in the β5′-loop in the function of hPTL and suggest that a third partner, bile salt micelles or the lipid interface or both, influence the binding of colipase and hPTL through interactions with the β5′-loop. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the β5′-loop in the C-terminal domain of human pancreatic triglyceride lipase (hPTL) makes a major contribution in the function of hPTL (Chahinian et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 13725–13735). In the present study, we characterized the contribution of three residues in the β5′-loop, Val-407, Ile-408, and Leu-412, to the function of hPTL. By substituting charged residues, aspartate or lysine, in these positions, we altered the hydrophilic to lipophilic ratio of the β5′-loop. Each of the mutants was expressed, purified, and characterized for activity and binding with both monolayers and emulsions and for binding to colipase. Experiments with monolayers and with emulsions suggested that the interaction of hPTL with a phospholipid monolayer differs from the interaction of the hPTL-colipase complex with a dicaprin monolayer or a triglyceride emulsion (i.e. neutral lipids). Val-407, Ile-408, and Leu-412 make major contributions to interactions with monolayers, whereas only Val-407 and Ile-408 appear essential for activity on triglyceride emulsions in the presence of bile salt micelles. In solutions of taurodeoxycholate at micellar concentrations, a major effect of the β5′-loop mutations is to change the interaction between hPTL and colipase. These observations support a major contribution of residues in the β5′-loop in the function of hPTL and suggest that a third partner, bile salt micelles or the lipid interface or both, influence the binding of colipase and hPTL through interactions with the β5′-loop. The three-dimensional structure of human pancreatic triglyceride lipase (hPTL) 2The abbreviations used are: hPTL, human pancreatic triglyceride lipase; hPTLS153G, hPTL mutant in which the active site serine 153 has been substituted with a glycine residue; TDC, taurodeoxycholate; LPL, lipoprotein lipase. revealed two functional domains, a globular N-terminal domain and a β-sandwich C-terminal domain (residues 336–449) (1Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Since the determination of the structure, functional roles have been described for each domain. The N-terminal domain consisting of an α/β-hydrolase fold contains the catalytic site. A surface loop, the lid, delineated by a disulfide bond between Cys-237 and Cys-261, covers the active site and controls the activity of hPTL (2van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 3van Tilbeurgh H. Gargouri Y. Dezan C. Egloff M.P. Nesa M.P. Ruganie N. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the inactive conformation, the lid sterically hinders access of substrate to the active site. In the active conformation, the lid adopts a new position that opens and configures the active site. The C-terminal domain, which has structural similarity to the C2 domain of other lipid-binding proteins, contributes the majority of the binding surface for colipase, a necessary cofactor for hPTL function in the duodenum (4van Tilbeurgh H. Bezzine S. Cambillau C. Verger R. Carriere F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Until recently, colipase binding was the best documented function for the C-terminal domain. Over the past several years, several lines of evidence suggested an additional role for the C-terminal domain. Examination of the colipase-PTL crystal structure reveals an exposed hydrophobic loop, the β5′-loop, including residues 405–414, of the C-terminal domain that orients in same plane as the hydrophobic plateau of colipase and the lid (5Bezzine S. Carriere F. De Caro J. Verger R. De Caro A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11846-11855Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This orientation positions the loop to interact with the oil-water surface of the lipid substrate (Fig. 1). Next, a number of studies indicate that a homologous loop in lipoprotein lipase, a protein with structural similarity to hPTL, contributes to the lipid-binding properties of lipoprotein lipase. For instance, mutagenesis of three tryptophans in the lipoprotein lipase loop abolished binding of the lipase to substrate (6Lookene A. Groot N.B. Kastelein J.J. Olivecrona G. Bruin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 766-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, our earlier study demonstrated that a mutant of hPTL in which the hydrophobicity and size of the β5′-loop was increased by introducing the homologous lipoprotein lipase β5′-loop into hPTL had altered interactions with phospholipid monolayers and with trioctanoin emulsions (7Chahinian H. Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Ivanova M.G. Perez B. Lowe M.E. Carriere F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13725-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These findings support a major role for the β5′-loop in the function of hPTL, possibly in the interaction with substrate. Another finding in our previous study was that the hPTL-β5′LPL mutant had decreased affinity for colipase in the presence of bile salts (7Chahinian H. Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Ivanova M.G. Perez B. Lowe M.E. Carriere F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13725-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because colipase does not interact with the β5′-loop in the crystal structure of the hPTL-colipase complex, we considered several alternative explanations for the effect of the mutation on the affinity for colipase. One possibility arises from the observation that colipase, PTL, and bile salt micelles can form a complex with the micelle contacting the β5′-loop and residues in colipase (8Ayvazian L. Kerfelec B. Granon S. Foglizzo E. Crenon I. Dubois C. Chapus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14014-14018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Pignol D. Ayvazian L. Kerfelec B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4220-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). β5′-Loop mutations could impair the interaction between PTL and bile salt micelles thereby decreasing the affinity of the hPTL-β5′LPL mutant for colipase. Another potential explanation is that the larger size of the LPL β5′-loop might sterically hinder binding of the PTL mutant to colipase. Alternatively, the LPL loop could perturb the protein structure near the binding site of colipase resulting in decreased affinity for colipase even though the overall structure of the hPTL-β5′LPL mutant is not grossly altered. In this study, we have addressed the possibility that the β5′-loop interacts with a third partner to increase the affinity for colipase by introducing mutations in the β5′-loop that increase the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of the loop without greatly altering the size. To accomplish these studies, we created mutants of hPTL with substitutions of a positively or negatively charged residue for a hydrophobic residue. Each mutant was expressed in yeast, purified, and characterized for interfacial binding and lipase activity in both bulk phase and monolayer assays. The effects of bile salts and colipase on activity and binding were studied and compared with the properties of hPTL. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Manipulations of DNA were done by using standard methods (10Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the wild-type hPTL cDNA in the pHILS1 vector by PCR using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit per the manufacturer's protocol (11Yang Y. Lowe M.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to introduce the desired mutations and were generally 27 bp long. Transformations into Epicurian Coli XL-1 Supercompetent cells were performed as described in the QuikChange protocol. Minipreps were performed using either the Qiagen Plasmid Mini kit or the Qiagen QIAprep Miniprep kit. Presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit. The DNA was transformed into yeast by electroporation, and positive clones were selected as previously done (11Yang Y. Lowe M.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Cordle R.A. Lowe M.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein Methods—The mutant lipases were expressed and purified as previously described (11Yang Y. Lowe M.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis and by spectrophotometry at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of E1&x0025;1cm=1.2. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with GELCODE Blue stain (Pierce) to confirm the homogeneity of the isolated protein. Lipase Activity Measurements—The lipase activity of wild-type and mutant hPTL was determined in bulk by measuring the release of fatty acids from mechanically stirred emulsions of tributyrin, trioctanoin, or triolein as previously described (7Chahinian H. Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Ivanova M.G. Perez B. Lowe M.E. Carriere F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13725-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Crandall W.V. Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12505-12512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, pure colipase from porcine pancreas or pure recombinant, human colipase was added at a molar excess of 5. The lipolytic activities are expressed in International Units per milligram of enzyme. One unit corresponds to 1 μmol of fatty acid released per minute. Binding of hPTL and the Mutants to Tributyrin and Trioctanoin Emulsions—The interfacial binding of hPTL and the mutants was assayed by mixing the enzyme with a trioctanoin or tributyrin emulsion as previously described (14Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Ivanova M.G. Lopez V. Verger R. Carriere F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5499-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Cordle R. Lowe M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1759-1767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 5-fold molar excess of colipase and varying amounts of taurodeoxycholate were included in the incubations as indicated. Monolayer Experiments—Lipase activities were measured by the monolayer technique using monomolecular films of 1,2-dicaprin (Fluka, Paris, France) spread over an aqueous phase made of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 21 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and placed in a zero order trough (16Ransac S. Ivanova M.G. Verger R. Panaiotov I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 263-292Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis rates were expressed in moles of substrate hydrolyzed per cm2 of the reaction compartment, per minute, and for a theoretical enzyme concentration of 1 m in the reaction compartment. The kinetics of the adsorption of hPTL and β5′-loop mutants were studied by recording the changes with time of the surface pressure of a monomolecular film of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC, Sigma, Saint Quentin-Fallavier, France) spread at the air-water interface in a cylindrical Teflon trough (volume: 5 ml; surface area: 7 cm2). The surface pressure was measured using the Wilhelmy method with a thin platinum plate (perimeter 3.94 cm) attached to an electromicrobalance (Beckman LM 600). The trough was filled with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 21 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and the monolayer was spread using various volumes (1–10 μl) of a 1 mg.ml–1 phospholipid solution in chloroform. Once the initial surface pressure had stabilized, the lipase was injected into the aqueous subphase, which was stirred for 30 s at 250 rpm with a magnetic rod to homogenize the aqueous phase. The increase in the surface pressure was then recorded for 60 min. Experiments with PC monolayers were performed using 5 μg of lipase (20 nm overall concentration in the trough). Modeling of β5′-Loop Mutations and Calculating the Water-accessible Surfaces—Three-dimensional models of the hPTL-β5′-loop mutants were built from the known x-ray three-dimensional structure of open hPTL (accession number 1LPA in the Protein Data Bank). The water-accessible surfaces were calculated using the DSSP option in the Turbo-Frodo software program (17Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12419) Google Scholar, 18Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar). Design and Expression of Single Substitution Mutants in the β5′-Loop—Examination of the three-dimensional structure of hPTL revealed that three hydrophobic residues, Val-407, Ile-408, and Leu-412, reside on the surface of the β5′-loop (Fig. 1). To determine the effect of increasing the hydrophilic to lipophilic ratio of the β5′-loop without greatly changing the size of the loop, we substituted each site with an aspartic acid to create I407D, V408D, and L412D or with lysine to create I407K, V408K, and L412K. Introduction of a single charged residue changed the accessible surface area minimally, 2.5% or less for the aspartate mutants and 7% or less for the lysine mutants (Table 1). In contrast, the hydrophilic to lipophilic ratio was increased from 50% to 135%, with substitutions at position 408 causing the greatest effect.TABLE 1Water-accessible surfaces (Å2) of the β5′-loop in hPTL and the β5′-loop mutantshPTLV407DI408DL412DV407KI408KL412KÅ2Charged residues105277289286283290286Semipolar residues284206261185246311237Hydrophobic residues488409315384409320384Total surfaces877892865855938921907HLBaHLB is the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and is defined by the (charged plus semipolar/hydrophobic) ratio.0.801.181.751.231.291.881.36a HLB is the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and is defined by the (charged plus semipolar/hydrophobic) ratio. Open table in a new tab Each mutant was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The yeast secreted each mutant protein into the medium indicating that the proteins were not misfolded. The yield for each mutant ranged from 5 to 10 mg/liter of culture. Analysis of the purified proteins by SDS-PAGE revealed a single band for each mutant (data not shown). By this analysis, there was no evidence for degradation of any of the mutants. We further confirmed the structural integrity of each mutant by determining the temperature stability of the mutants. After incubation at 50 °C for 20 min, similar residual activity, ∼50% of the original activity in 0.5 mm TDC, remained for wild-type hPTL and each of the hPTL mutants. Additionally, the activity and binding of the mutants did not change over time indicating that degradation or alterations such as isoaspartate formation in the substituted residues did not occur (19Reissner K.J. Aswad D.W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1281-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Effect of Colipase and Bile Salts on the Activity of the β5′-Loop Mutants against Three Different Substrates—To begin our analysis of the mutants, we measured the activity of hPTL and each mutant against emulsions of tributyrin, trioctanoin, and triolein in the standard pH-stat assay containing increasing concentrations of TDC. In the absence of colipase, hPTL and all of the mutants had activity at 0.5 mm TCD, and these activities ranged from 500 to 4,000 units/mg depending on the substrate (Fig. 2). There were no differences in activity among the mutants and wild-type hPTL indicating that the mutations did not grossly affect the folding of the catalytic N-terminal domain. Above the critical micelle concentration of TDC (∼1.1 mm) all of the lipases were inhibited. When colipase was included in the assay, the activity below the critical micelle concentration of TDC increased for all mutants with each substrate and equaled the activity for hPTL. At higher TDC concentrations, colipase restored the activity for the L412D and L412K mutants to 80% or more of the hPTL activity with all of the substrates. Colipase restored activity to the Ile-407 and Val-408 mutants only with tributyrin, but the levels were significantly lower than that for wild-type hPTL. At 4 mm taurodeoxycholate and tributyrin, V407D and I408D had 16%, V407K had 13%, and I408K had 55% of wild-type hPTL activity. None of these mutants were active against emulsions of the water-insoluble triglycerides, trioctanoin, or triolein, under these conditions. Thus, mutations in the β5′-loop alter hPTL function but only in the presence of micellar solutions of bile salts. During the standard 5-min assays with triolein, we noted the presence of a lag time with the L412D mutant and determined if the other mutants also exhibited lag times (Table 2). Each of the mutants except for L412K showed a lag time when assayed against triolein in 4 mm TDC. The times ranged from 2.0 min for L412D to 32.5 min for I408D. After the lag time, the mutants showed a burst of activity. The activities of all mutants except those at position 408 were near normal. This result shows that denaturation of the mutants in 4 mm TDC cannot explain the decreased activity of the loop mutants in the standard assay. The long lag times suggest that the mutants have altered partitioning onto the substrate interface.TABLE 2Lag times and activity against triolein of β5′-loop mutants in 4 mm TDCLipaseLag timeActivityminunits/mgWild type0.0 ± 0.03900 ± 280V407D23.6 ± 4.03100 ± 4001408D32.5 ± 3.21500 ± 230L412D2.0 ± 0.53400 ± 370V407K12.9 ± 1.33200 ± 290I408K6.0 ± 1.02500 ± 380L412K0.0 ± 0.03100 ± 260 Open table in a new tab Partitioning of the β5′-Loop Mutants in Tributyrin and Trioctanoin—We next tested the ability of the β5′-loop mutants to partition with lipid substrate at both 0.5 and 4.0 mm TDC in the presence of colipase (Table 3). At 0.5 mm TDC, the mutants partitioned with tributyrin and trioctanoin to the same extent as did wild-type hPTL. In the presence of 4.0 mm TDC, clear differences among the mutants were seen. V407D, I408D, and V407K had decreased partitioning with both tributyrin and trioctanoin, a finding consistent with the decreased or absent activity of these mutants against these lipids. I408K partitioned well in tributyrin and has ∼60% of wild-type activity (Fig. 2). I408K also partitioned normally in trioctanoin even though the mutant had no activity against trioctanoin in 4.0 mm TDC and colipase (Fig. 2). The L412D and L412K mutants had normal partitioning in both lipids as expected for their near normal activity against tributyrin and trioctanoin. These results support a role for the β5′-loop in the function of hPTL in the presence of micellar solutions of bile salts.TABLE 3Partitioning of lipase mutants with tributyrin and trioctanoinLipaseTributyrinaThe percentage of the original lipase amount that partitions with each lipid is given.

Open table in a new tab Interaction of the β5′-Loop Mutants with Colipase—One explanation for the decreased activity and partitioning of the mutants in 4.0 mm TDC is that the β5′-loop mutations impair the interactions of the mutant lipases with colipase. To test the effects of the mutations on the colipase-lipase interaction, we first determined the ability of colipase to activate the β5′-loop mutants over a range of colipase concentrations in 0.5 or 4.0 mm TDC and excess substrate with a constant amount of each lipase (Fig. 3). In 0.5 mm TDC, the mutants had normal activity suggesting normal interactions with colipase and with the lipid interface (Fig. 3, upper panels). Furthermore, these findings indicate that mutations in the β5′-loop did not affect the overall folding of the C-terminal domain. A different situation was observed when the TDC concentration was increased to 4.0 mm where several of the mutants had decreased activity. Because hPTL activity in 4.0 mm depends on colipase, which is not the situation in 0.5 mm TDC where hPTL has activity in the absence of colipase, we were able to calculate the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and apparent binding constant (Bmax) for the colipase-hPTL complex in 4.0 mm TDC by nonlinear regression with a rectangular hyperbola function (Table 4). The apparent Bmax was similar to hPTL for all of the mutants. The two Leu-412 mutants had values for apparent Kd similar to hPTL. In contrast, the I408K mutant had ∼a 5-fold increase in Kd and the V407K, V407D, and I408D mutants had 15-fold increases in Kd values. These results indicate that mutations in positions 407 and 408 influence the interaction of colipase and hPTL in the presence of bile salt micelles but not in the presence of bile salt monomers.TABLE 4Apparent Kd and Bmax of β5′-loop mutants for colipase with 4 mm TDCLipaseApparent KdApparent BmaxWild type4.7 ± 0.811,800 ± 640V407D72.0 ± 6.010,740 ± 450I408D74.0 ± 4.610,855 ± 245L412D6.9 ± 0.99,890 ± 360V407K84.9 ± 5.611,380 ± 400I408K14.0 ± 1.110,790 ± 310L412K6.8 ± 1.210,270 ± 565 Open table in a new tab We next tested the ability of each mutant to compete for colipase with hPTL or with S153G, an inactive mutant of hPTL with normal colipase binding. In each of these assays, we included equimolar amounts of the β5′-loop mutants with a lipase:colipase ratio of 1.0: 0.5. Because the V407D, I408D, and V407K mutants have no activity against trioctanoin in 4 mm TDC, we tested their ability to compete with hPTL in an assay against trioctanoin in 4 mm TDC. None of these mutants inhibited hPTL under these conditions indicating that they have a much lower affinity for colipase than does hPTL (Table 5). For the mutants with activity at 4.0 mm TDC (I408K, L412D, and L412K), we estimated their affinities for colipase by their ability to compete with S153G lipase for colipase. If these mutants have normal or near normal affinities for colipase, S153G should decrease their activity by 50%. In this assay, S153G decreased L412D activity to 47.0 ± 8.2%, I408K activity to 46.2 ± 17.1%, and L412K activity to 31.3 ± 21.4%. Although there was considerable variability in the assay for the I408K and L412K mutants, it is clear these mutants can compete with S153G for colipase and have relatively preserved affinity for colipase. The two methods concur that the V407D, I408D, and V407K mutants have decreased affinity for colipase in 4.0 mm TDC, whereas the L412D, I408K, and L412K mutants have normal or near normal affinities for colipase.TABLE 5Affinity of β5′-loop mutants for colipase by competition assaysLipaseResidual lipase activity%A) Incubation of the mutant lipase with hPTL and colipaseV407D107.6 ± 7.8I408D116.0 ± 16.7V407K117.8 ± 27.6B) Incubation of the mutant lipase with colipase followed by the addition of S153G hPTLL412D47.0 ± 8.2I408K46.2 ± 17.1L412K38.9 ± 18.5 Open table in a new tab Effect of the β5′-Loop Mutations on Lipase Activity against Monolayers—To more directly determine the interaction of the mutants with a lipid interface, we turned to studies with monolayers. Monolayers allow the variation and control of the interfacial quality of the interface and allow assays in the absence of colipase and bile salts (16Ransac S. Ivanova M.G. Verger R. Panaiotov I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 263-292Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We first measured the activity of the mutants against monolayers of dicaprin. Each mutant was assayed at various surface pressures ranging from 15 to 35 millinewtons/m (Fig. 4). In general, the mutants behaved similarly to hPTL. Although the V407D, V407K, and L412D mutants had increased activity compared with hPTL, the differences were not statistically significant. These results indicate that the introduction of single mutations into the β5′-loop did not greatly alter the interaction of the mutant lipases with a neutral lipid monolayer and suggest that the β5′-loop plays a greater role in the activity against neutral lipids in the presence of colipase and bile salts. We next measured the interaction of the β5′-loop mutants with a zwitterionic monolayer of phosphatidylcholine. For our analysis of interactions with phosphatidylcholine, we determined the increase in surface pressure as a function of the initial surface pressure of the monolayer under which the lipase was injected (Fig. 5). Phosphatidylcholine is not a substrate for hPTL or the mutants, and the recorded variations in surface pressure only reflect the ability of the test lipase to bind and penetrate the phospholipid monolayer. Each of the β5′-loop mutants behaved similarly. They all showed decreased penetration compared with hPTL. None of the mutants penetrated the monolayer above a surface pressure of 4 millinewtons/m, whereas the critical surface pressure of penetration for hPTL was above 12 millinewtons/m. In our previous study, we concluded that the β5′-loop plays a critical role in the function of hPTL (7Chahinian H. Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Ivanova M.G. Perez B. Lowe M.E. Carriere F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13725-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that the β5′-loop, particularly the region containing Val-407 and Ile-408, contributes to the function of hPTL by influencing the binding of colipase in micellar concentrations of bile salts. Additionally, experiments with monolayers and with emulsions suggest that the interaction of hPTL with a phospholipid monolayer differs from the interaction of the hPTL-colipase complex with a dicaprin monolayer or a triglyceride emulsion (i.e. neutral lipids). Importance of Residues Val-407 and Ile-408—The substitution mutants of Val-407 and Ile-408 had greater effects than the replacement of Leu-412. Both the aspartate and lysine substitutions at position 407 greatly impaired the activity of the mutant PTL in the presence of bile salt micelles. In contrast, the aspartate substitution at position 408 made a greater change in activity than did the lysine substitution. Furthermore, the I408K mutant had relatively preserved partitioning with tributyrin and trioctanoin as well as only minimal effects on the interaction with colipase. The differences between I408D and I408K lipases can be explained by repulsion of the negatively charged aspartate side chain from the negatively charged surface of an emulsion particle coated with TDC or of TDC micelles. Conversely, the positively charged side chain of lysine might interact favorably with these same surfaces. Alternatively, the hydrophobic portion of the lysine side chain might stretch or snorkle into the hydrophobic portion of the emulsion or bile salt micelle and thereby allow the I408K mutant to have near normal function (20Strandberg E. Killian J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Regardless, the data are consistent with the conclusion that the region of the β5′-loop containing Val-407 and Ile-408 contributes to the function of hPTL. Binding to Phospholipid Monolayers—A major difference between the results of experiments with a phospholipid monolayer and with triglyceride emulsions is the importance of Leu-412 in the interactions with phospholipid monolayers and the relative lack of effect with emulsions and dicaprin monolayers. Like the other mutants, the Leu-412 mutants showed decreased penetration of a phosphatidylcholine monolayer compared with hPTL. In contrast, Leu-412 does not appear to contribute significantly to the activity of hPTL in the presence of triglyceride emulsions with bile salts with or without colipase. Leu-412 mutations had minimal to no effect on the activity against tributyrin, trioctanoin, and triolein, on binding to tributyrin and trioctanoin, or on the interactions with colipase. The varied behavior of the Leu-412 mutants depending on the nature of the lipid-water interface suggests that hPTL may orient differently on a phospholipid monolayer than it does on an emulsion particle. Molecular modeling of the hPTL indicates that Leu-412 should not be as close to the interface as are Val-407 and Ile-408 when the β5′-loop and the putative lipid binding regions of the N-terminal domain (lid and β9-loop) are in contact with the interface. If hPTL positions so that Leu-412 interacts with the interface, the catalytic site moves away from the interface creating an unfavorable orientation of hPTL for activity. Improper orientation of hPTL when bound to a phospholipid interface could explain, in part, the absence of activity of hPTL against phospholipids and the ability of phospholipids to inhibit hPTL activity in either monolayers or emulsions. The β5′-Loop and Colipase—In our earlier study, where we replaced the β5′-loop of hPTL with the homologous loop from LPL, we also found that the mutant hPTL had reduced affinity for colipase (7Chahinian H. Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Ivanova M.G. Perez B. Lowe M.E. Carriere F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13725-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We offered several possible explanations for these findings. First, the larger lipoprotein lipase β5′-loop might sterically hinder the binding between the mutant hPTL and colipase. Alternatively, the presence of the larger β5′-loop could cause enough perturbation of the C-terminal domain structure to alter the critical colipase binding sites in this domain. The current study makes these interpretations less likely. The substitutions do not greatly alter the size of the β5′-loop, and the single-site substitutions are less likely to perturb the colipase binding sites of the C-terminal domain. Examination of the crystal structure of the hPTL-colipase complex indicates that the substitution of either aspartate or lysine at Val-407 or Ile-408 should not allow interactions of the new side chains with colipase. More importantly, each of these mutants showed normal activity and normal partitioning with colipase in 0.5 mm TDC. These results suggest that the β5′-loop mutants hPTL can form normal interaction with colipase under these conditions. Thus, the single-site substitutions we created and characterized do not hinder the interaction between colipase and hPTL because of their size or by perturbing the structure of the C-terminal domain. Another explanation for the decreased affinity of the LPL β5′-loop mutant for colipase arose because we only measured the interaction between colipase and the mutant by competition with S153G hPTL. Under these conditions, the S153G-colipase complex may have a stronger affinity for the interface than does the lipoprotein lipase β5′-loop hPTL-colipase complex. Even if the mutant hPTL has normal affinity for colipase in the bulk phase, the accumulation of the S153G-colipase complex at the interface would deplete the concentration of colipase in solution and induce the dissociation of the LPL β5′-loop hPTL-colipase complex thereby decreasing the amount of the complex at the interface. If this were true, the mutants should have a normal apparent Kd for colipase and a decreased apparent Bmax. V407D, V407K, and I408D had increased apparent Kd values and normal apparent Bmax values indicating that the mutants have decreased affinity for colipase and that, once formed, the mutant hPTL-colipase complex functions efficiently at the interface. The last hypothesis to explain our results is that colipase and hPTL form a ternary complex with another partner. Because the mutations affect activity only in micellar solutions of bile salts, the partner could be bile salt micelles. Many older studies have demonstrated binding between bile salts and colipase or lipase (21Momsen W.E. Brockman H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 384-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lairon D. Nalbone G. Lafont H. Leonardi J. Domingo N. Hauton J.C. Verger R.

More recently, examination of the hPTL-colipase complex by neutron diffraction identified a detergent micelle contacting both colipase and the C-terminal domain of hPTL, including the β5′-loop (26Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For several reasons, binding to bile salt micelles seems unlikely. First, the dissociation of bile salts from the micelles occurs at a millisecond rate, and it is difficult to accept that pure bile salt micelles contribute to a stable ternary complex with colipase and hPTL. Second, multiple studies have shown that TDC reduces the binding between colipase and hPTL and decreases the dissociation constant from 3–5 × 10–7 to 0.3– 1 × 10–5 (24Donner J. Spink C.H. Borgstrom B. Sjojolm I. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5413-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Patton J.S. Albertsson P.A. Erlanson C. Borgstrom B. J. Biol.

The concentrations of hPTL and colipase in our assays are well below this range, 1.3 × 10–9 and 6.5 × 10–9, respectively. Importantly, the dissociation constants in the earlier studies were not measured in the presence of lipid substrate, and the presence of a lipid-water interface may influence the formation or stability of a hPTL-colipase-bile salt micelle ternary complex. Another potential partner in the formation of a ternary complex with colipase and hPTL are mixed micelles. In contrast to pure bile salt micelles, fatty acid-bile salt micelles increase the binding between colipase and hPTL 1000-fold (29Patton J.S. Donner J. Borgstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In fact, several studies have shown the formation of a hPTL-colipase complex with mixed micelles or with the lipoprotein particles present in bile (22Lairon D. Nalbone G. Lafont H. Leonardi J. Domingo N. Hauton J.C. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Lairon D. Nalbone G. Lafont H. Leonardi J. Vigne J.L. Chabert C. Hauton J.C. Verger R.

Entressangles B. Biochimie. (Paris). 1975; 57: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In our experimental system, fatty acid-bile salt micelles may form rapidly during a short and lag period or the bile salt micelle-hPTL-colipase complex may form at the lipid-water interface. In vivo, the hPTL-colipase complex likely forms on the mixed micelles present in bile (22Lairon D. Nalbone G. Lafont H. Leonardi J. Domingo N. Hauton J.C. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pancreatic and biliary secretions mix before they enter the duodenum. Because pancreatic secretions contain colipase and hPTL at concentrations of 10–6 m and the dissociation constant for the hPTL-colipase complex in the presence of mixed micelles is 10-fold lower, binding to the mixed micelles in bile is likely to be rapid. Although there is evidence that colipase and hPTL associate with mixed micelles, there is no evidence that colipase and hPTL remain associated with the mixed micelles at the lipid-water interface. It is possible that the interface also plays the role of the third partner that stabilizes the colipase-hPTL complex and allows optimal activity. Whatever the nature of the complex at the lipid-water interface, the present results confirm that the colipase-hPTL association is stabilized in a ternary complex influenced by residues Val-407 and Ile-408 (Fig. 1)."
https://openalex.org/W1980577435,"We have detected versican, a member of the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and its degraded C-terminal G3 fragments in human plasma and observed that the versican G3 domain promoted blood coagulation. Silencing G3 expression with small interfering RNA reduced the effect of G3 on coagulation. Plasma coagulation assays suggest that G3 enhances coagulation irrespective of its actions on platelets and white blood cells. To examine how versican affected blood coagulation, we used normal human plasma and different types of coagulation factor-deficient plasmas. The experiments indicated that versican enhanced coagulation through the extrinsic pathway, and that Factor VII was the target molecule. FVII activity assays showed that G3 activated FVII in the presence of plasma but not with purified FVII directly. Yeast two-hybrid, immunoprecipitation, and gel co-migration assays showed that G3 interacted with the tissue factor pathway inhibitor-1 (TFPI-1). TFPI-1 activity assays suggested that G3 inhibited TFPI-1 activity, allowing FVIIa and FXa to facilitate the coagulation process. G3-induced blood coagulation was further confirmed with a mouse model in a real-time manner. Taken together, these results indicate that versican may represent a new target for the development of therapies against atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2053026053,"Tropomodulin-1 (Tmod-1) is a well defined actin-capping protein that interacts with tropomyosin (TM) at the pointed end of actin filaments. Previous studies by others have mapped its TM-binding domain to the amino terminus from amino acid 39 to 138. In this study, we have identified several amino acid residues on Tmod-1 that are important for its interaction with TM5 (a nonmuscle TM isoform). Glutathione S-transferase affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation assays reveal that Tmod sense mutations of either amino acid 134, 135, or 136 causes various degrees of loss of function of Tmod TM-binding ability. The reduction of TM-binding ability was relatively mild (reduced ∼20-40%) from the G136A Tmod mutant but more substantially (reduced ∼50-100%) from the I134D, L135E, and L135V Tmod mutants. In addition, mutation at any of these three sites dramatically alters the subcellular location of Tmod-1 when introduced into mammalian cells. Further analysis of these three mutants uncovered a previously unknown nuclear trafficking function of Tmod-1, and residues 134, 135, and 136 are located within a nuclear export signal motif. As a result, mutation on either residue 134 or residue 135 not only will cause a significant reduction of the Tmod-1 ability to bind to TM5 but also lead to predominant nuclear localization of Tmod-1 by crippling its nuclear export mechanism. The failure of the Tmod mutations to fully associate with TM5 when introduced into neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was also associated with an accelerated and severe fragmentation of sarcomeric structures compared with overexpression of wild type Tmod-1. The multiple losses of function of Tmod engendered by these missense mutations are most severe with the single substitution of residue 135.

The regulatory role of Tmod in the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments has been well studied, and it is regarded as a major regulatory component for the architecture of the sarcomere in muscle cells and of the membrane skeleton in nonmuscle cells (3Ursitti J.A.

Tmod-1 was originally isolated from the erythrocyte membrane and was shown to bind to one end of erythrocyte tropomyosin (TM) (2Fowler V.M. J. Biol.

Tmod-1 is also the dominant isoform expressed in vertebrate cardiac muscle and slow twitch muscle fibers, whereas Tmod-4 (Sk-Tmod) is the predominant isoform in fast twitch skeletal muscle (4Almenar-Queralt A.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been shown that Tmod can completely inhibit elongation at, and depolymerization from, the pointed ends of TM coated thin filaments and can function as an actin filament pointed end capping protein in vitro (12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tmod requires TM for tight capping of actin filaments (Kd ≤1nm); in the absence of TM, Tmod is a “leaky” cap and only partially inhibits actin monomer association and dissociation at the pointed end (Kd ∼0.1-0.4 μm) (12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The ability of Tmod to cap the pointed ends of TM-actin filaments tightly is likely to be a consequence of binding of Tmod to both TM (Kd ∼0.2-0.5 μm) (2Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12792-12800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and actin (Kd values, derived from the inhibition of elongation rates of pure actin filaments, range between 0.1 and 0.4 μm) (12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This interpretation is consistent with the presence of two distinct functional domains on Tmod. Conversely, the carboxyl-terminal portion of Tmod is required for binding to actin at the pointed filament end; a monoclonal antibody that binds to an epitope near the carboxyl terminus inhibits the ability of Tmod to cap the pointed ends of pure actin or TM-actin filaments but has no effect on binding of Tmod to TM (8Gregorio C.C.

Competition binding assays using recombinant Tmod fragments have shown that the aminoterminal half (residues 6-184) contains full binding activity for tropomyosin (13Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies by Babcock and Fowler (13Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) elegantly revealed that the TM-binding domains of Tmod-1 differ between muscle and nonmuscle TM isoforms. These authors identified amino acid residues 6-94 on Tmod-1 as containing a skeletal muscle TM binding site and residues 90-184 on Tmod-1 as containing an erythrocyte TM-binding domain (13Babcock G.G.

In this study, we applied several mutagenesis techniques to map and analyze the functional domain(s) of Tmod-1 in single residue detail. In addition to defining at least three amino acid residues that contribute to TM (nonmuscle isoform) binding by Tmod-1, we were surprised to discover that these same residues were those responsible for nuclear cytoplasmic transport of Tmod (19Kong K.Y. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30856-30864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the integrity of at least one residue, leucine 135, is crucial for sarcomere stability in cardiomyocytes. Yeast Two-hybrid System—Various Tmod cDNAs, wild type or mutants, were generated by specifically designed primers (Table 1) and subcloned into either pGBT9 or pGADGH vectors (Clontech) through the EcoRI site. The Tmod-1 cDNA template used for all of the assays in this study was originally isolated from a mouse muscle cDNA library (20Ito M. Swanson B. Sussman M.A. Kedes L. Lyons G. Dev. Biol.

In brief, specific primer pairs that targeted the deletion areas were generated and are shown in Table 1. These primer pairs were used separately and paired with another primer that matched either the N or C terminus for the first PCR (Table 1 (top), wild type Tmod-1). The products from the first PCR were then mixed and used as templates for the second PCR to create the final internal deletion constructs. Primers used to generate wild type TM5 cDNAs for subcloning into pGBT9 and pGADGH vectors are also shown in Table 1. Both subclonings were done through the EcoRI sites of the vectors.

Yeast strains SFY and HF7c were used for the assays. β-Galactosidase activities of the lacZ reporter gene were measured by the liquid culture assay using o-nitrophenylgalactoside as substrate. We used the detailed experimental procedures provided by the Clontech yeast two-hybrid product protocol (www.Clontech.com). Briefly, after resuspending the overnight SFY yeast culture in 1.5 ml of 1× TE/LiAc (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m lithium acetate, pH 7.5) solution, the cells were stored on ice until ready for co-transformation. 0.1 μg of each DNA plasmid was used for each designed reaction (pGBT9, pGADGH, Tmod/pGBT9, TM5/pGADGH, or Tmod mutants/pGBT9) together with 100 μg of salmon carrier DNA. 100 μl of the SFY yeast competent cells was then added to each reaction and mixed well. 600 μl of sterile PEG/LiAc (40% PEG 4000 and 0.1 m lithium acetate in TE buffer) was added subsequently to each reaction and was vortexed to mix. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 30 min. After the incubation, 70 μl of Me2SO was added to each reaction and mixed gently. After heating for 15 min at 42 °C, the transformed yeast cells were spun and resuspended with a small volume of TE buffer for plating on appropriate medium (SD medium minus Trp, Leu, and His for SFY or SD medium minus Trp and Leu for HF7c). Inoculated plates were cultured at 30 °C for 3-7 days until colonies appeared. Four colonies from each transformation reaction were picked and cultured into appropriate synthetic medium containing glucose. Liquid cultures were incubated at 30 °C until they reached midlog phase. 0.7 ml of Z buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (16 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 5.5 g/liter NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.75 g/liter KCl, and 0.246 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, pH 7.0; β-mercaptoethanol was added to Z buffer freshly at a concentration of 0.27 ml/100 ml of Z buffer) was added to 0.1 ml of each culture together with 50 μl of CHCl3 and 50 μl of 0.1% SDS. After vortexing for 30 s, 0.16 ml of o-nitrophenylgalactoside solution (4 mg/ml in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was added to the lysed cells. The reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and were stopped by adding 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. Levels of o-nitrophenol released from the substrate o-nitrophenylgalactoside by the lacZ gene product, β-galactosidase, were measured by reading the samples at A420. The β-Galactosidase activity was calculated by the formula, β-galactosidase units = 1000 × (A420/t × V × A600), where t represents time (min) of incubation, and V is volume (ml) of culture added to Z buffer. The β-galactosidase activity and S.D. were calculated from each transformation reaction repeated at least three times. Degenerate primers 96 bases long encoding the region from amino acid 108 to 138 on Tmod were synthesized by introducing random mutations through the addition of a dNTP mixture during oligonucleotide generation following synthesis of the first three bases (Norris Cancer Center Core Facility, USC). After the PCRs, a pool of Tmod templates with lower numbers (∼6-12) of random mutations were purified and then subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector for large scale screening assays. All Tmod mutants of interest were subsequently examined by DNA sequence analysis (ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer, Applied Biosystems). One μg of various supercoiled DNA plasmids was transcribed in vitro and then translated in the presence of [35S]methionine with the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All GST and GST fusion proteins used in this study were recombinant proteins prepared from a bacterial expression system. Expression and purifications of GST and GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously (23Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The GST proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for integrity and to normalize the amount of each protein. To perform protein-protein interaction assays, glutathione beads (Sigma) coated with GST or the GST fusion protein (∼5 μg) were reacted with 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled translation product in 200 μl of binding buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 detergent (Nonidet P-40), and 5 μg of ethidium bromide. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking, after which the glutathione beads were collected by brief centrifugation and subjected to extensive washing with the binding buffer. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE; the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Single amino acid mutation Tmod mutants were generated using custom designed primers (Invitrogen) that are specific to the site of mutation (Table 1). The reactions were carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR conditions were carried out following the supplier's suggestions. The integrity of the coding capability of all Tmod mutants was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer; Applied Biosystems). Human embryonal kidney cells (293T) were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (penicillin/streptomycin) (Sigma) both before and after transfection. Except for control plates, a total of 4 μg of DNA plasmid was transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation onto each 10-cm culture plate with cells at ∼50% confluence as described previously (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and collected in PBS 48 h after transfection. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended with 0.3 ml of 1× protein buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma)). Cells were lysed by pipetting and then centrifuged at full speed (∼14,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected as total protein extracts and stored at -80 °C until ready for further analysis. The resin for immunoprecipitation was prepared as follows. 1 μl (∼3 μg) of anti-FLAG M2 antibody was preabsorbed with 15 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (50% slurry) for 45 min at room temperature and washed extensively. Antibody-bound protein A/G Plus-agarose was resuspended with 10 μl of 1× protein buffer. An aliquot containing 1 mg of total protein extracted from each transfection reaction (range from 2.5 to 3.5 μg/μl) was incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody-bound A/G protein beads and 250 μl of 1× protein buffer. All reactions were rocked for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed extensively with protein buffer. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were removed. The proteins bound by the beads were eluted by exposure to 15 μl of 80 mm phenyl phosphate. The eluted proteins were loaded directly onto an SDS acrylamide gel for Western blot analysis. Aliquots containing 100 μg of the total protein extracts were also examined by SDS-PAGE to determine the efficiency of transgene expression. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were anti-HA polyclonal antibodies (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:500; Sigma). Secondary antibodies used for immunoblotting were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:25,000; Sigma) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:25,000; Sigma). Proteins were detected by chemifluorescence (ECF kit; Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's instructions. Probed and washed membranes were incubated with Vistra ECF substrate solution (Amersham Biosciences) at a ratio of 1 ml/24 cm2 for 5 min. Membranes were scanned directly with a Storm PhosphorImager, and signals emitted by targeted proteins were measured with the ImageQuant version 1.1 program (Amersham Biosciences). C3H10T1/2 cells were grown at 50-60% confluence and were transfected with various pEGFP constructs using calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline ∼16 h after transfection and replaced with fresh medium to grow for an additional 8-10 h before fixing or harvesting for further analysis. C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) before and after transfection. Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at ambient temperature followed by 100% methanol at -20 °C for 5 min. After extensive washing and counterstaining with ToPro3 (Molecular Probes) at 1 μm final concentration for 10 min, slides were washed again and mounted with mounting medium. Photomicrographs were taken with a 20× objective on a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal system, and images were processed by LSM 5 Pascal software version 2.8 WS. 300 cells from separate experiments were examined to calculate the percentage of cells possessing the representative phenotype. Lentivirus-based vectors encoding IRES-GFP (pHR′-IRES-GFP) were generated by transient co-transfection of 293T cells with a threeplasmid combination as described previously (25Sakoda T. Kasahara N. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 2037-2047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All viral stocks used in the transduction of the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were from unfractionated culture media. Titers were determined by infecting 293T cells with an aliquot of each viral stock in a dilution series. Control cells were examined at the time of infection and at the time of harvesting. The percentages of GFP-positive cells were determined by flow cytometry by the USC Pathology Reference Laboratory. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes from 2-4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared by using a previously described protocol (26Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and cultured for 5-7 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in modified Eagle's medium (5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% 5-bromodeoxyuridine). Cardiac cells were plated onto laminin-coated glass coverslips (Sigma; used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) and cultured for 5-7 days in growth medium. A multiplicity of infection of five copies of virus per cell was used for all lentiviral transductions. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence using standard procedures as previously described (27Sussman M.A. Sakhi S. Barrientos P. Ito M. Kedes L. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were anti-Tmod polyclonal antibodies (27Sussman M.A. Sakhi S. Barrientos P. Ito M. Kedes L. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (5 μg/ml) and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) (10 μg/ml). Secondary antibodies used were FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) (1:80) and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) (1:100). TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) (2.5 μg/ml) was used as an internal marker for filamentous actin localization. Immunostained cardiomyocytes were mounted in Vectashield antibleaching medium (Vector) and sealed with nail polish (Revivánail™; European Touch). Digital images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with filters for fluorescein and rhodamine epifluorescence. Domain Mapping of Tmod-1—We created a series of deletion mutants on Tmod-1 based upon convenient PCR techniques as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We initially used a yeast two-hybrid system to test these Tmod-1 deletion mutants for a significant change of tropomyosin (TM5)-binding affinity based on the color change of colonies upon binding of the two proteins. These mutants and Tmod-1 were cloned into a vector that would then express a Tmod-Galbinding domain (Tmod/GalBD) fusion polypeptide. We compared the β-galactosidase stimulation of each Tmod construct when expressed in combination with a vector expressing either the Gal activation domain alone (GalAD) or the GalAD domain fused with TM5. Since Gal-Tmod-1 alone engendered modest background activation, it was not possible to select loss-of-function Tmod-1 mutants by looking for a change of color on colonies. Accordingly, we used yeast two-hybrid liquid culture assays to identify the region of Tmod-1 that interacts with TM5. The results of this assay are shown in Table 2 and in Fig. 1 (right panel). These data suggest that there is a region of Tmod-1 between residues 39 and 138 that is both necessary and sufficient to interact well with TM5. Several subdeletions on Tmod-1 between residues 39 and 138 (TΔ39-138, TΔ39-72, TΔ73-138, TΔ73-107, and TΔ108-138) all showed a complete or nearly complete elimination of TM5-binding ability in the two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with the possibility that several subdomains located between amino acids 39 and 72, between amino acids 73 and 107, and between amino acids 108 and 138 contribute to the binding of the two proteins. However, only the TΔ73-138 TΔ108-138 and deletion constructs showed a complete loss of [35S]TM5 pull-down signal when we submitted the same constructs for further confirmation by using GST affinity chromatography assays (data not shown). Accordingly, we focused on this region as probably comprising the key binding residues. Random mutations were then introduced within residues 108-138 in order to identify specific amino acids that are"
https://openalex.org/W1991643144,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a pluripotent cytokine that regulates cell growth and differentiation in a cell type-dependent fashion. TGF-β exerts its effects through the activation of several signaling pathways. One involves membrane proximal events that lead to nuclear translocation of members of the Smad family of transcriptional regulators. TGF-β can also activate MAPK cascades. Here, we show that TGF-β induces nuclear translocation of the NF-YA subunit of the transcription factor NF-Y by a process that requires activation of the ERK cascade. This results in increased binding of endogenous NF-Y to chromatin and TGF-β-dependent transcriptional regulation of the NF-Y target gene cyclin A2. Interestingly, the kinetics of NF-YA relocalization differs between epithelial cells and fibroblasts. NIH3T3 fibroblasts show an elevated basal level of phosphorylated p38 and delayed nuclear accumulation of NF-YA after TGF-β treatment. In contrast, MDCK cells show low basal p38 activation, higher basal ERK phosphorylation and more rapid localization of NF-YA after induction. Thus, NF-Y activation by TGF-β1 involves ERK1/2 and potentially an interplay between MAPK pathways, thereby opening the possibility for finely tuned transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1994617139,"β-catenin, an oncogene, and P53, a tumor suppressor, are common targets of mutation in human cancers. It has been observed that P53 is often inactivated in tumors involving β-catenin activation. In an attempt to model this situation in vivo, we crossed the previously characterized MMTV-ΔN-β-catenin mouse with the P53 knockout mouse. Female multiparous mice that carry the MMTV-ΔN-β-catenin transgene and that are heterozygous for P53 (TgΔN-βCat/+, P53+/−) display an increased tumor burden (2.05 vs 1.31 tumors/animal), with a generally more advanced pathology, and increased metastatic rate (39 vs 0%) relative to transgenic female mice that are wild type for P53 (TgΔN-βCat/+, P53+/+). These differences were not due to complete loss of P53 as only one of 21 tumors demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at the P53 locus. Furthermore, no mutations were present in tumors retaining a single wild-type allele. TgΔN-βCat/+, P53−/− male mice developed testicular teratomas and survived an average of 65 days, whereas non-TgΔN-βCat, P53−/− males survived an average of 84 days. Sixty-two percent of TgΔN-βCat, P53−/− mice developed testicular teratomas, whereas only 10% of the non-TgΔN-βCat, P53−/− mice developed these tumors. These results indicate that the level of P53 and the tissue of origin are important factors in determining outcome of cancer caused by oncogene activation."
