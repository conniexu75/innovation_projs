https://openalex.org/W1490299254,"Methoxypolyethylene glycols of 1900 and 5000 daltons have been attached covalently to bovine serum albumin using cyanuric chloride as the coupling agent. When sufficient polymer is attached, the modified bovine serum albumin appears to lose its immunogenicity in the rabbit and, on intramuscular or intravenous injection, elicits antibodies neither to itself nor to native bovine serum albumin. It does not react with antibodies raised against native bovine serum albumin. Bovine serum albumin to which methoxypolyethylene glycol has been attached exhibits a blood circulating life in the rabbit rather similar to native bovine serum albumin, except that it is not removed from circulation by the eventual development of antibodies. Modified bovine serum albumins which had been iodinated with 125I, or prepared with [14C]cyanuric chloride, were injected intravenously in rabbits. Both labels appeared almost quantitatively in the urine after 30 days. The modified bovine serum albumins showed substantial changes in properties, such as solubility, electrophoretic mobility in acrylamide gel, ion exchange chromatography, and sedimentation, as compared with the unmodified protein."

https://openalex.org/W2047064689,"Two kittens with progressive neurologic disease had increased concentrations of GM2 ganglioside in their cerebral cortex. Examination under the light microscope revealed cytoplasmic vacuolation of neurons and hepatocytes. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic inclusions encompassed by membranes in various central nervous system cell types and in hepatocytes. Beta-D-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase activity was reduced to about 1.0 percent of normal in brain, liver, and cultured skin fibroblasts of the diseased kittens; both major electrophoretic forms, A and B, of the enzyme were deficient. In fibroblasts from the parents of the diseased kittens, this enzyme activity was intermediate between that of affected and normal cats, suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of the enzyme defect. Histopathological and ultrastructural lesions, glycolipid storage, enzyme defect, and pattern of inheritance are similar to those of human GM2 gangliosidosis type 2."

https://openalex.org/W2109461619,"Oviduct membrane preparations from chicks treated for various times, up to 20 days, with diethylstilbestrol were studied to determine the effect of estrogen-induced differen- tiation on the lipid intermediate pathway of protein glyco- sylation. A significant increase in the transfer of [‘4Clmannose from GDP-[‘*C]Man into [14C]mannosylphos- phoryldolichol, [Wlmannosyloligosaccharide lipid, and [14Clmannosylprotein is found after animals are treated with diethylstilbestrol. These increases parallel increases in the amounts of ovalbumin, lysozyme, and oviduct wet weight. Mannosylphosphoryldolichol and mannosyloligo- saccharide lipid labeled by GDP-[W]Man, using prepara- tions from diethylstilbestrol-treated animals, are chromato- graphically identical to the compounds isolated from mem- brane preparations from mature hens. The specific activities and time courses of reaction are equivalent in fully induced preparations from diethylstilbestrol-treated animals and preparations derived from mature animals. The apparent"

https://openalex.org/W1964955161,"This is the first report of successful immunization of experimental monkeys against a human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Of the five owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus) used in this pilot study, two served as controls and the other three were immunized with P. falciparum antigen consisting primarily of mature segmenters containing fully developed merozoites. Two injections of antigen emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant were administered intramuscularly 3 weeks apart. Three weeks after the second vaccination, all monkeys were challenged with the homologous strain of P. falciparum. The control monkeys died with high levels of parasitemia within 2 weeks of challenge. The three immunized monkeys survived and showed strong protection against P. falciparum. These results are encouraging for the possible future development of an effective vaccine against human malaria."

These strains represent a smaller proportion of gonococcal isolate from blacks than from whites. Asymptomatic urethral infection is important in the epidemiology of gonorrhea, particularly among whites."
https://openalex.org/W2158797526,"We have used a stirred, temperature-regulated, reaction vessel separated by a Teflon membrane from the ion source of a mass spectrometer to monitor continuously the time course of disappearance of C18O16O, mass 46, at chemical equilibrium as the 18O exchanges with 16O in water. This instrument is sensitive to less than 0.01 mm Hg of partial pressure of C18O16O with a response time of less than 3 s. The equation of Mills and Urey was used to calculate the hydration velocity constant for uncatalyzed or catalyzed homogenous solutions from the exponential disappearance of mass 46. Addition of red blood cells to the reaction mixture produces biphasic (double exponential) disappearance curve for mass 46. A theory of this process has been developed which describes the time course of [C18O16O] as a function of the catalytic factor for intracellular carbonic anhydrase (A) and the permeability of the cell membrane to HCO3- (P) in addition to the known values; water volume of the cells in the suspension, extracellular pH, the extracellular hydration reaction velocity constant, ku, and dehydration reaction velocity constant, ku. Using this theory, A and P were estimated from the disappearance curve for mass 46 at different values of hematocrit in the reaction mixture, both by a trial and error curve fitting procedure and by a more convenient graphical linearization method. The values of A and P obtained were very sensitive to small amounts of lysis (less than 1%), but the graphical method of analysis minimized this effect. For the blood cells of five normal subjects suspended in 24 mM bicarbonate in 145 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees, using the graphical method we obtained an average value of 9,906 for A as compared to 19,900 for a comparable concentration of hemolysate. Correcting for a lower pH and chloride concentration inside the cell the latter figure would reduce to 17,500, still 80% higher than the intracellular value. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. The average permeability of the red cell to bicarbonate ion was 3 X 10(-4) cm/s."

Since biogenic particulate products, especially fecal pellets, are known to sink rapidly and intact to the ocean bottom, the transport of PCB's by such sinking particles could be an important mechanism which contributes to the penetration of PCB's into the deep sea."

These neurons are mainly located in lamina IV and medially in more ventral laminae of the dorsal horn on the side ipsilateral to the medullary injection. Large neurons in the ventral horn (""spinal border cells"") also appear to project to the ipsilateral dorsal medulla. The dorsal column nuclei of a primate thus are the recipient not only of ascending dorsal root fibers but also of a more complexly integrated spinal input."

Double mutant combinations lacking both enzyme activities, obtained either by recombination or by mutagen treatment of a chromosome bearing the lethal allele, result in a restoration of viability. The indispensability of the pentose phosphate shunt in Drosophila appears to depend upon the specific position of the block within the pathway."

A polypeptide product similar to the MOPC-46B kappa chain was identified by its antigenic properties and by analysis of the products of tryptic digestion. In addition, the cell-free product was glycosylated after translation. It appeared that glycosylation of the cell-free product occurred on the same tryptic peptide glycosylated by intact cells. The characteristics and requirements of glycosylation are described. The presence of Mn2+ was a major requirement."

https://openalex.org/W1986363632,"Scrapie is an unusual slow-virus disease of sheep which is very much like kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, both fatal, slow neuological diseases of man. In mice, scrapie usually has an incubation period of about 6 months. Intraperitoneal inoculation of virus particles into newborn mice caused no disease, and there was no detectable virus replication for 1 year, but high titers of scrapie were present in the spleen and brain at 18 months. Virus replication occurred in mice injected from 4 days after birth by all inoculation routes, wheter or not they were injected with scrapie virus on day 0. The results suggest that scrapie virus replicates peripherally only in thymocytes, which are not present in mice until a few days after birth. The latent state suggests that the comparable human diseases could appear in later life as a result of perinatal infection. In some respects these diseases resemble premature senility."

https://openalex.org/W2345371328,"Purine nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient cultured human fibroblasts accumulate inosine from the medium at 60% of the rate in wild type cells when the extracellular inosine concentration is 10 micronM and 30% of the normal rate when inosine is present at 100 micronM. When 10 micronM inosine is present, uridine but not hypoxanthine inhibits the accumulation of inosine. There exist two transport systems for inosine. One is shared with pyrimidine ribonucleosides and is the predominant one at 10 micronM inosine; the other is purine nucleoside phosphorylase-dependent and prevails at 100 micronM inosine."
https://openalex.org/W2069318515,"Two mutant cell lines derived from the MPC-11 mouse myeloma synthesize immunoglobulin with abnormal heavy chains and normal light chains. The defective heavy chains have molecular weights of 38,000-42,000 (M3.11) and 50,000 daltons (ICR 11.19) as compared to 55,000 daltons of the wild-type. The glycosylation of the defective heavy chains demostrated several unusual features: first, 30-50% of the M3.11 heavy chain contained no carbonydrate, while 100% of the wildtype and ICR 11.19 heavy chains were glycosylated; second, the glycopeptides of the M3.11 heavy chains revealed an altered gel filtration pattern when compared with the wild-type; and third, digestion with an endoglycosidase indicated that the heterogeneity of the wild-type and M3.11 glycopeptides involved structural changes in the core region of the oligosaccharide. Examination of two other glycoproteins (the major histocompatibility complex antigens) in these cell lines showed that in M3.11, the H-2D but not the H-2K product was abnormally glycosylated and contained a smaller glycopeptide. However, in a subclone of M3.11 that had lost the ability to produce immunoglobulin heavy chains, the H-2D glycopeptide had returned to wild-type size. We concluded from these studies that the defective M3.11 immunoglobulin heavy chain interfered both with its own glycosylation and the glycosylation of another protein, H-2D."
https://openalex.org/W2026605790,"Several clones of independently established somatic cell hybrids between two human lymphoid cell lines, Raji and Namalwa, were examined for surface immunoglobulin expression. Double-antibody radioimmunoassays were established for kappa and lambda light chains. Immunoglobulins were detergent-extrated by Triton X-100 and quantified by radioimmunoassay. The Raji parent expressed small amounts of kappa chains on its surface, and the Namalwa parent a 10 fold greater amount of lambda chains. We show that the majority of the hybrid clones co-express both parental phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W105745212,"Membrane isolated from Bacillus subtilis strain 168 incorporated GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc directly onto undecaprenyl phosphate via transphosphorylation and subsequent transglucosylations. Chain lengths of 6, 4, and 1 units of GlcNAc were found. Approximately 80% of the isotope incorporated was extracted into chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v), and could be distinguished from the undecaprenyl disaccharide cell wall intermediate by a different elution pattern on DEAE-cellulose (acetate form). The GlcNAc-lipid(s) were eluted from a similar column in chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3, v/v) with 6 mM NH4COOH indicating a pyrophosphate linkage between the lipid and the GlcNAc. The GlcNAc-lipid(s) were not degraded by conditions which completely deacylated [32P]glyceryl phospholipids, but were rapidly hydrolyzed by mild acid treatment (0.005 N HCl, 90 degrees) with the release of oligosaccharide phosphate (typical of sugars linked to undecaprenyl pyrophosphate). Catalytic hydrogenation of the GlcNAc-lipid(s) resulted in the release of water-soluble sugar phosphate. Under these same conditions, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate and undecaprenyl disaccharide cell wall intermediate were similarly effected while [32P]glyceryl phospholipids remained intact. The formation of GlcNAc-lipid(s) in vitro was inhibited if membranes were prepared from cells previously treated with bacitracin. Thus, the GlcNAc-lipid(s) has the properties of undecaprenyl poly(N-acetylglucosaminyl pyrophosphate) and may represent a new synthetic role of the polyisoprenyl lipid in B. subtilis."

https://openalex.org/W1587841517,"The biosynthesis of glucuronosyl diacylglycerol from UDP-glucuronate and diacylglycerol is catalyzed by an enzyme found in both the 34,800 X g supernatant and particulate preparations from disrupted Pseudomonas diminuta (ATCC 11586). UDP-glucuronate served as the glucuronosyl donor and could not be replaced by glucuronic acid, glucuronate-1-phosphate, and a number of nucleotide-linked sugars. The maximum velocity was estimated to be 19 nmol of glucuronosyl diacylglycerol synthesized/h/mg of protein in the presence of the 34,800 X g particulate enzyme and 63 nmol/h/mg of protein with the 34,800 X g supernatant preparation. The apparent Km for UDP-glucuronate was 4.2 micronM for supernatant and 4.4 to 6.0 micronM for particulate preparations. The biosynthesis of glucuronosyl diacylglycerol in vitro, was strongly dependent upon exogenous diacylglycerols containing unsaturated and shorter chain fatty acids. The enzymatic activity was very heat-labile and lost about 80% of the initial rate of synthesis after preincubation for 5 min at 37 degrees. The reaction was stimulated by 14.7 mM Triton X-100 and had an optimal pH of 7.1 and an ionic strength of 0.2 M. Divalent cations were not required."
