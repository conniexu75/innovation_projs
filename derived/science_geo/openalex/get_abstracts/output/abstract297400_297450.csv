https://openalex.org/W1979683779,"In the presence or absence of water, behenic acid generates hydrocarbons during heating at 200 degrees C with bentonite. Without water the ratio of isobutane or isopentane to normal butane or normal pentane is much higher than with water. Besides C(21). and lower n-alkanes, n-alkanes with 22 to 34 carbon atoms are also formed."

https://openalex.org/W1986752669,"The chromic oxide indicator method was used to determine percentage utilization of three diets prepared from lyophilized plant tissues for fifthtnstar larvae of the pale western cutworm. Because of the simplicity of the method and uniformity of results within each of the diets, the procedure can be used routinely in feeding trials with this insect, and perhaps others with biting and chewing mouth parts."

https://openalex.org/W2026133184,Bermuda wind-blown limesands are lobate-shaped bodies composed internally of leeward foreset strata which dip at 30 to 35 degrees and windward strata which dip at 10 to 15 degrees in an opposite direction. The foreset beds are convex upward. This convex upward cross-stratification is preserved because of the early stabilization of the eolian calcareous sand due to surface cementation by percolating rain water.

https://openalex.org/W2081055036,"The serum gamma globulin (Gm) serological system was examined in 24 chimpanzees. Five Gm a, Gm b, and Gm x phenotypes, including Gm (a-b-x-), were observed. Phenotype did not appear to be related to serum gamma globulin concentration. The presence of the Gm system in apes suggests that this polymorphism in man is balanced and ancient."
https://openalex.org/W2051741260,"Major coal mine disasters (five or more fatalities per accident) in the United States over the past 150 years have tended to occur primarily in the winter months from November through April. Minor accidents (zero to four fatalities per accident) occur at a fairly uniform rate throughout the year. This peak for major disasters is ascribed to effect of barometric minima on the methane content of mine air, to the effect of dry polar air masses in reducing the moisture content of coal dust, and, possibly, to cyclic fatigue of rock structures from cycling barometric pressure. Obvious safety practices are suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2074127186,The association of Physcia picta with the giant Galdpagos tortoise is believed to be the first reported occurrence of lichens on land animals. The habitat is restricted to specific sites on the carapace of male tortoises.

https://openalex.org/W2024520966,Application of a slight osmotic stress to only a portion of young wheat roots significantly affected certain metabolic fractions throughout the entire plant. These components change rapidly with time and therefore time studies must be used in experiments of this type concerned with an evaluation of changes in metabolic fractions in plants that are induced by environmental factors.
https://openalex.org/W2034856296,"Fifty-nine of 493 ponds sampled in the Wellington fossil conchostracan belt contained Cyzicus mexicanus (Claus). Persistent habitat preference and faunal association were also found for four orders of insects (Odonata, Ephemeroptera, Neuroptera, and Homoptera). Comparative limnology is detailed. Greater geographic fractionation of Permian conchostracan gene-pools is attributed to a more arid climate indicated by evaporites."

Ratios of 1.4 or greater indicate flow from Canada, by way of the St. Lawrence lowland. The heavy mineral assemblages were evidently undiluted by local sources in western New York."

https://openalex.org/W1985633657,"An isolate of the fungus Colletotrichum orbiculare (syn. C. lagenarium) race 1 that forms perithecia in culture was isolated from edible gourd in North Carolina. This isolate has been identified as a species of Glomerella. The isolate produces very few ascopores when selfed; however, ascospores are produced in abundance when mated with certain other isolates of C. orbiculare."

It occurs in great abundance in the clay fraction of the phosphorite both as well formed, separate crystals and as clusters of crystals attached to granular particles."
https://openalex.org/W1964540460,The system described was effective in obtaining a complete record of the discussions which arose during a week-long symposium with over 300 participants. Each individual wrote a publishable summary of his question or comment on a special numbered card immediately after speaking. This not only provided an accurate report but greatly facilitated preparation for publication.
