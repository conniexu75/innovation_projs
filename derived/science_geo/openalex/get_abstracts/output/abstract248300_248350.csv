Traditional timber plantations have supplied some goods but have made only minor contributions to fulfilling most of these other objectives. New approaches to reforestation are now emerging, with potential for both overcoming forest degradation and addressing rural poverty."

We report a family of DNA tetrahedra, less than 10 nanometers on a side, that can self-assemble in seconds with near-quantitative yield of one diastereomer. They can be connected by programmable DNA linkers. Their triangulated architecture confers structural stability; by compressing a DNA tetrahedron with an atomic force microscope, we have measured the axial compressibility of DNA and observed the buckling of the double helix under high loads."

Agricultural expansion in the A2 scenario results in significant additional warming over the Amazon and cooling of the upper air column and nearby oceans. These and other influences on the Hadley and monsoon circulations affect extratropical climates. Agricultural expansion in the mid-latitudes produces cooling and decreases in the mean daily temperature range over many areas. The A2 scenario results in more significant change, often of opposite sign, than does the B1 scenario."
https://openalex.org/W1989053944,"Signal transduction pathways control cellular responses to stimuli, but it is unclear how molecular information is processed as a network. We constructed a systems model of 7980 intracellular signaling events that directly links measurements to 1440 response outputs associated with apoptosis. The model accurately predicted multiple time-dependent apoptotic responses induced by a combination of the death-inducing cytokine tumor necrosis factor with the prosurvival factors epidermal growth factor and insulin. By capturing the role of unsuspected autocrine circuits activated by transforming growth factor–α and interleukin-1α, the model revealed new molecular mechanisms connecting signaling to apoptosis. The model derived two groupings of intracellular signals that constitute fundamental dimensions (molecular “basis axes”) within the apoptotic signaling network. Projection along these axes captures the entire measured apoptotic network, suggesting that cell survival is determined by signaling through this canonical basis set."

https://openalex.org/W2101998831,"The comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis of intraviral protein interactions in two members of the herpesvirus family, Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), revealed 123 and 173 interactions, respectively. Viral protein interaction networks resemble single, highly coupled modules, whereas cellular networks are organized in separate functional submodules. Predicted and experimentally verified interactions between KSHV and human proteins were used to connect the viral interactome into a prototypical human interactome and to simulate infection. The analysis of the combined system showed that the viral network adopts cellular network features and that protein networks of herpesviruses and possibly other intracellular pathogens have distinguishing topologies."
https://openalex.org/W2148894303,"cIAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) 1 and 2 are able to regulate apoptosis when ectopically expressed in recipient cells and probably also in vivo. Previous work suggested that this is at least partially due to direct caspase inhibition, mediated by two of the three baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains that are contained in these proteins. In support of this we show that the BIR domains 2 and 3 of the two cIAPs are able to bind caspases-7 and -9. However, we demonstrate that neither of these BIR domains is able to inhibit caspases because of critical substitutions in the regions that target caspase inhibition in the X-linked IAP, a tight binding caspase inhibitor. The cIAP BIR domains can be converted to tight binding caspase inhibitors by substituting these critical residues with XIAP residues. Thus, cIAPs maintain protein scaffolds suitable for direct caspase inhibition but have lost or never acquired specific caspase inhibitory interaction sites. Consequently, although the binding function of the cIAP BIRs may be important for their physiologic function, caspase inhibition is not. cIAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) 1 and 2 are able to regulate apoptosis when ectopically expressed in recipient cells and probably also in vivo.

Apoptosis is normally a highly regulated cellular pathway that ultimately results in the packaging and disposal of unwanted or damaged cells. At the heart of the apoptosis pathway is a family of proteases known as the caspases, the activity of which is responsible for the organized destruction of the cell (reviewed in Ref. 1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Much work has been done to deduce the regulatory mechanisms of caspase activation, and it is now clear that a two-step pathway is required. The pathway consists of an apical (or initiator) phase in which multicomponent protein recruitment complexes provide a platform to activate the zymogens of caspases-8 and -10 (extrinsic pathway) or caspase-9 (intrinsic pathway). Once active, these initiator caspases cleave and activate the zymogens of executioner (or effector) caspases-3 and 7, which in turn are responsible for the majority of proteolytic events that ultimately result in the destruction of the cell.This proteolytic pathway, like most proteolytic pathways, is regulated at two levels: 1) timing and location of zymogen activation and 2) inhibition of active protease. In mammals, the most well documented mechanism for influencing caspase activity is driven by direct interaction of members of the IAP 2The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; CIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein; BIR, baculoviral IAP repeat; IBM, IAP-binding motif; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride. 2The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; CIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein; BIR, baculoviral IAP repeat; IBM, IAP-binding motif; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride.

Sci. 1998; 23: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), are characterized by the presence of at least one baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain. A characteristic of many BIR domains is the presence of a surface groove that has a preference for binding the extreme N terminus of short peptides of defined sequence (reviewed in Refs. 3Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar and 5Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence preferred by BIR domains is NH2AΦPΦ, where Φ represents a hydrophobic amino acid, and is termed the IAP-binding motif (IBM); hence the groove is called the IBM-interacting exosite. These exosites are conserved in many BIR domains across species.XIAP (X-linked IAP), also known as BIRC4 (BIR-containing protein 4), 3The Human Genome Nomenclature Committee recommends the gene and protein designation BIRC1–8 for the human IAP family members. In this system cIAP1 is BIRC2, cIAP2 is BIRC3, and XIAP is BIRC4, although in this paper we use the former (trivial) names. 3The Human Genome Nomenclature Committee recommends the gene and protein designation BIRC1–8 for the human IAP family members.

Significantly, in addition to the IBM-interacting exosite, XIAP has an absolute requirement for ancillary interaction surfaces to potently inhibit caspases.The two closest XIAP paralogs in humans are cellular IAP1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2), both of which have been demonstrated by several groups to ablate apoptosis triggered by multiple stimuli when introduced into mammalian cells (15Roy N.

Because of their high degree of similarity with XIAP and the observed anti-apoptotic phenotype when overexpressed, it is often reported that cIAP1 and cIAP2 are caspase inhibitors (15Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 20Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S.

However, although the BIR domains of these IAPs contain consensus IBM-interacting exosites, they display distinct differences at other key caspase interacting residues (Fig. 1). Specifically, the third BIR domain (BIR3) of cIAP1 and cIAP2 displays residues incompatible with caspase-9 inhibition. In contrast, the second BIR domain (BIR2) of cIAP1 and cIAP2 displays residues compatible with inhibition of caspases-3 and 7. Therefore, we hypothesized that cIAP1 and cIAP2 had lost the ability to inhibit caspase-9 but not caspases-3 and -7. The goal of this study was thus to determine whether cIAP1 and cIAP2 could in fact function as physiologic caspase inhibitors in a similar manner to XIAP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Caspases and IAPs—Full-length caspase-3, full-length caspase-7, and caspase-9 lacking the caspase recruitment domain were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (21Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding cIAP1 was the generous gift of John Reed of the Burnham Institute and was used as a template for production of various constructs. Constructs encoded by cIAP2 were directly amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library. BIR domains and mutants thereof were cloned into a modified pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) that generates N-terminal fusion His8 proteins (22Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), or pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate N-terminal GST fusion proteins. Full-length cIAP1 was cloned into pET 23b to generate a C-terminal fusion His6 protein. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 DE3. Protein expression was induced with the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when cells, grown at 37 °C, reached an OD600 of 0.4. The cultures were incubated 4 h at 30°C following isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The full-length cIAP1 construct was transformed in to BL-21 DE3 codon+ cells and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm) was added to induce protein expression, and cells were grown at 25 °C for 8 h. His-tagged proteins were purified using chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) charged with NiSO4 in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.4 followed by elution using a 0–0.2 m linear gradient of imidazole. GST-tagged protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences).Cell-free Lysates—HEK293A cells were grown at 37 °C in 15-cm plates to 70% confluence, harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and allowed to swell for 30 min on ice in hypotonic buffer (20 mm PIPES, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm dithiothreitol at a pH of 7.4) as previously described (23Stennicke H.R.

The cells were sheared using a 27-gauge needle and centrifuged at 500 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were collected and stored at –80 °C. The lysates were activated for cell-free apoptosis by the addition of 10 μm cytochrome c (Sigma) and 0.5 mm dATP (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C (24Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). Following activation the lysates were assayed for caspase activity in the presence of BIR domains as described below or treated with 100 μm Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fmk (Enzymes Systems Products, Livermore, CA) for 30 min at room temperature to prevent further caspase activity.Binding Assays—GST-tagged BIR domains produced in E. coli were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline-Triton X 100 (1% v/v) and resuspended at 50% (v/v), and 5 μl of beads was incubated with 400 ng (total protein) of cytochrome c-activated HEK293A cell lysate in a total volume of 100 μl overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in hypotonic buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Equal volumes of input (untreated and cytochrome c-treated) BIR bound, and supernatant (depleted lysates) were loaded on an 8–18% linear gradient acrylamide SDS gel for electrophoresis. The samples were either transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and immunoblotted or stained with Gel Code Blue Stain reagent (Pierce).Immunoblotting—Caspase-7 was detected using a rabbit caspase-7 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology number 9492). Caspase-9 was detected using a caspase-9 polyclonal antibody (23Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Secondary anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchase from Amersham Biosciences.Caspase Assays—Recombinant caspases were preactivated with 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose (w/v), and 0.1% CHAPS with 100 nm NaCl (caspases-3 and -7) or without NaCl (caspase-9) at pH 7.4 for 15 min (caspases-3 and -7) or 20 min (caspase-9) at 37 °C. A range of BIR domain concentrations was incubated with the activated caspases for 5 min. Caspase activity was determined by cleavage of Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products) for caspase-3 and 7 or Ac-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products) for caspase-9 as measured in an Fmax fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Inhibitory constants for each enzyme-inhibitor pair was determined from the uninhibited rate (vo) and inhibited rates (vi), such that a plot of (vo/vi) – 1 versus [I] gives a slope of 1/Ki(apparent).Inhibition of endogenous executioner caspase activity by BIR2 was determined using HEK293A cell-free lysates preactivated for 15 min as described above followed by incubation for 5 min with selected recombinant BIR2 domain proteins. Residual activity was determined as for recombinant caspases. Inhibition of endogenous caspase-9 activity by BIR3 was also determined using HEK293A cell-free lysates. In this case cytochrome c/ATP activation was carried out in the presence of recombinant BIR3 proteins, and activity was measured by cleavage of Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-pNA (Bachem, Torrance, CA) on a SpectraMax 340 spectrophotometric plate reader (Molecular Devices) as a measure of the ability of caspase-9 to activate executioner caspases (23Stennicke H.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).Protein Stability Assays—Fluorescence spectra were monitored using a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer coupled with the FL Win Lab software using a 1-cm-pathlength cuvette (Helma). Unfolding studies were carried out by incubating protein (dialyzed into 50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) in the presence of incremental increases in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl, 0–6.35 m) for 1 h at room temperature. Emission spectrum was measured from 300 to 400 nm after excitation at 280 nm. The emission and excitation slit widths were 5 and 7 nm, respectively. A shift in the fluorescence emission peak was indicative of protein unfolding. After collecting all of the emission spectra, the area under the curve was calculated by summing the product of wavelength increment and emission intensity for each recorded wavelength-intensity pair. To calculate the average wavelength for each respective GdmCl concentration, the product of emission intensity and corresponding wavelength was calculated for each recorded wavelength-intensity pair and divided by values of the area under the curve. The change in average wavelength from native state (0 m GdmCl) at each GdmCl concentration were normalized to the denatured states (6.35 m GdmCl) and plotted as relative change in the average emission wavelength.RESULTSThe BIR2 and BIR3 Domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 Bind to Caspases-7 and -9—BIR domains are characterized by their ability to bind proteins possessing conserved sequences at their N terminus. Indeed, this specific binding mode is a necessary step in the inhibition of the apoptotic caspases-3, -7, and -9 by XIAP (7Shiozaki E.N. Chai J. Rigotti D.J. Riedl S.J. Li P. Srinivasula S.M.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To test whether the BIR domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 have this property, we used GST-tagged BIR2 and BIR3 domains (Fig. 2A) and analyzed binding to endogenous caspases-7 and -9 from cell-free lysates programmed to develop apoptotic activity. We performed this by initiating cell-free apoptosis through addition of cytochrome c to hypotonic cytosolic extracts of HEK cells, followed by the addition of recombinant purified GST-BIR domains and adsorption of material on immobilized glutathione. Bound material was eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by immunoblotting with specific antisera raised against caspase-7 or -9. We found that both the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 associated with caspase-7 (Fig. 2, B and C, top panels). The mode of binding of caspase-7 to IAPs is partly dependent on neoepitopes generated at the large and small subunits during proteolytic activation (Fig. 2D) (8Scott F.L. Denault J.B. Riedl S.J.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, because the caspase-7 antiserum does not recognize the small subunit in immunoblots, we are only able to visualize the associated large subunit, which comes in two differentially processed forms (22–25 kDa; Fig. 2, B and C, top panels). Significantly, BIR2 and BIR3 domains of cIAP1 were able to deplete most of the endogenous caspase-7, whereas the same domains of cIAP2 were less efficient at this task (Fig. 2, B and C, top panels), implying that cIAP1 has a higher affinity for caspase-7 than does cIAP2.FIGURE 2cIAP-caspase binding. A, protein expression gel demonstrating equal input of recombinant GST-tagged BIR2 and BIR3 domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 for the binding assay. Exosite mutants of cIAP1 BIR2 are E239R/H343V, and those for BIR3 are E325R/W329V. Cell-free HEK293A lysates were activated with 10 μm cytochrome c and 0.5 mm dATP, split, and incubated with equal volumes of beads saturated with various GST-tagged BIR domains. B, association of endogenous caspase-7 (top panel) and caspase-9 (bottom panel) was observed with wild type (WT) BIR2 (lane 3) and BIR3 (lane 5) of cIAP1 but not the mutants (Mut; lanes 4 and 6).

Depleted (Dep) indicates the post-binding supernatant and demonstrates the ability of the wild type domains to deplete the entire endogenous pool of caspase-7 and approximately half of the caspase-9 (lanes 7–10, top and bottom panels). C, the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of cIAP2 each bound caspase-7 and demonstrated association with the same forms of the caspase as cIAP1 (top panel, lanes 3 and 4), whereas only BIR2 bound caspase-9 (bottom panel, lanes 3 and 4).

IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the caspase/IAP interaction was dependent on the IBM-interacting exosite maintained within the BIR domain, we mutated key residues that characterize the exosites in cIAP1 (E239R and H243V in BIR2 and E325R and W329V in BIR3) using the strategy previously shown to attenuate caspase interaction with XIAP (8Scott F.L. Denault J.B. Riedl S.J. Shin H. Renatus M. Salvesen G.S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These mutations ablated the ability of the BIR domain to efficiently associate with the caspase, demonstrating that this interaction requires the conserved IBM-interacting exosite (Fig. 2B, top panel).We also tested the ability of the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of the cIAPs to bind caspase-9. The mode of binding of caspase-9 to IAPs is via neoepitopes generated at the small subunit during proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 2, B and C, lower panels) (7Shiozaki E.N. Chai J. Rigotti D.J. Riedl S.J.

Like the caspase-7 antiserum, the caspase-9 antiserum does not recognize the small subunit in immunoblots, and again we visualize the associated large subunit, which comes in two differentially processed forms (Fig. 2, B and C, lower panel). The lower panels in Fig. 2 (B and C) reveal that BIRs 2 and 3 of cIAP1 as well as BIR2 of cIAP2 associate with caspase-9. One site of cleavage is the autocatalytic event in the caspase-9 interdomain linker at Asp315, which is a consequence of apoptosome driven activation (26Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P.

The other site of cleavage is at Asp330, and it is controversial whether this latter event uncovers an IBM (26Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D.

We found that only the p35 form of the large subunit of caspase-9 was efficiently bound by the cIAPs (Fig. 2, B and C, lower panel). Again this interaction was found to be IBM-binding and exosite-dependent because the mutants were unable to bind caspase-9 (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Interestingly, the BIR3 domain of cIAP2 was unable to effectively bind caspase-9 (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). This could potentially be attributed to other IAPs within the lysate sequestering the cleaved caspase-9, thereby preventing it from interacting with cIAP2-BIR3. In support of this, we observed incomplete depletion of caspase-9 from the lysates by the cIAPs.These experiments demonstrate that the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 are competent to bind caspases in an IBM-dependent manner, with the possible exception of the BIR3 domain of cIAP2. However, binding should not be equated with inhibition, and so we proceeded to test whether the BIR domains are able to inhibit the bound caspases.The BIR2 Domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 Are Poor Inhibitors of the Executioner Caspases-3 and -7—Tight inhibition of executioner caspases by XIAP requires two surfaces on the BIR2 domain: the IBM-interacting groove (8Scott F.L.

In contrast to the IBM-interacting groove, the N-terminal extension of XIAP exhibits less conservation of important interaction sites when compared with cIAPs (Fig. 1).To determine whether cIAP1 and cIAP2 are caspase inhibitors, we tested the inhibitory capacity of their BIR2 domains with the respective N-terminally flanking linkers (residues 144–260 of cIAP1, residues 129–246 of cIAP2, equivalent to the caspase-3 and -7 inhibitory unit of XIAP) using purified recombinant caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10 as targets. We observed virtually no inhibition (apparent Ki values greater than 5 μm) of these caspases by BIR2 from cIAP1 or cIAP2. (Fig. 3 and data not shown). This represents physiologically irrelevant inhibition when compared with the BIR2 domain of XIAP that has low to subnanomolar apparent Ki values toward caspases-3 and -7. To investigate why cIAP1 and cIAP2 were such poor inhibitors of these caspases, we used structure/sequence-based analysis to predict whether the lack of inhibition stemmed from differences in the putative caspase interacting regions. The IBM-interacting groove of the BIR2 domain of XIAP is highly conserved in many IAPs, including cIAP1 and cIAP2, and so we focused on the N-terminal extension that in XIAP interacts with the active site region of caspases-3 and -7 (11Riedl S.J.

Although the cIAPs maintain several crucial caspase-interacting residues in the N-terminal linker (starred residues in Fig. 1), this region is slightly more divergent from XIAP, and it is the conformation of this region that we predicted to be the basis for the insignificant inhibition of caspases by cIAPs.FIGURE 3Inhibition of caspase-3 and -7.

Like many other class 1 fusion proteins such as those of HIV-1, influenza viruses, and filoviruses (ebola- and marburgviruses), some coronavirus S proteins are cleaved by a furin-like protease in virus-producing cells, generating two subunits (S1 and S2 in the case of coronaviruses).

Following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the reovirus virion is converted to an infectious subvirion particle by partial proteolysis, mediated by cathepsins B, L, or S.

In contrast, HCoV-NL63 infection is not dependent on cathepsin B, L, or S activities. Thus variations in the activity of cellular proteases can modulate the relative efficiencies with which these viruses enter ACE2-expressing cells.

Pseudotyped Virus Production and Infection—MLV-GFP virions pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein have been described previously (45Moore M.J. Dorfman T. Li W. Wong S.K. Li Y. Kuhn J.H. Coderre J. Vasilieva N. Han Z. Greenough T.C. Farzan M. Choe H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10628-10635Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The experiments described here utilize S proteins of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 with 27- and 24-residue deletions, respectively, in their cytoplasmic C termini. We have previously shown that such deletions enhance incorporation of the S proteins into the retroviral particle (45Moore M.J. Dorfman T. Li W. Wong S.K. Li Y. Kuhn J.H. Coderre J. Vasilieva N. Han Z. Greenough T.C. Farzan M. Choe H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10628-10635Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the SARS-CoV or HCoV-NL63 S proteins were cotranfected with plasmid encoding the MLV gag and pol genes and with a construct bearing the MLV long terminal repeats, packaging signal, and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (pQ-GFP), derived from the pQCXIX vector (Invitrogen). To generate pseudotyped MLV/GFP virions, HEK293T cells were transfected at a 5:5:2 ratio with gag/pol expressor, pQ-GFP, and plasmids encoding SARS-CoV or HCoV-NL63 S protein, ebola- or marburgvirus GP protein, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (HXB2 isolate), or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). Virus-containing cell culture supernatants were harvested 2 days later and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Target cells were prepared by transfecting HEK293T cells with expressor plasmids for ACE2 for SARS/MLV and NL63/MLV or CD4 and CXCR4 for HIV-1/MLV. Cells were replated onto polylysine-coated 24-well plates and infected ∼48 h after transfection. Level of infection was assessed 2 days later by measuring GFP expression by flow cytometry. For inhibitor studies, cells were preincubated for 3 h with medium containing the indicated inhibitors and infected for 5 h with virus suspension containing the same concentration of inhibitor. In experiments that included HCoV-NL63, to achieve similar infection levels among various pseudoviruses, SARS/MLV was diluted 5–7-fold, HIV-1/MLV by 2-fold, VSV-G/MLV by 20–30-fold, and NL63/MLV was not diluted. At these dilutions, mean fluorescence intensity of total cells incubated with these pseudoviruses ranged from 72 to 123 for NL63/MLV, from 63 to 151 for SARS/MLV, 46 to 96 for VSV-G/MLV, 90 to 151 for HIV/MLV, and 5 to 11 for uninfected cells. Infection of Cells Expressing Exogenous Cathepsins—HEK293T cells grown on 6-well plates were transfected with 0.2–2 μg of plasmid expressing human ACE2 (9Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K. Berne M.A. Somasundaran M. Sullivan J.L. Luzeriaga C. Greenough T.C. Choe H. Farzan M.

One aliquot of transfected cells was labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine between 36 and 48 h following transfection to assess the expression of cathepsins in each transfection. Approximately 48 h after transfection, an additional aliquot of transfected cells was stained with goat anti-human-ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems) to assess ACE2 expression level, and a third aliquot of cells was infected with SARS/MLV, NL63/MLV, or VSV-G/MLV, as described above. The degree of infection is represented by GFP expression (mean fluorescence) in infected cells measured by flow cytometry 48–60 h after infection. Labeled cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40/PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and cathepsins were immunoprecipitated with anti-c9 tag antibody 1D4 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program) and Protein A-Sepharose. Washed samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cathepsin Inhibitor Studies Using Infectious Virus—Vero cells were cultured at 34 °C in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells in 96-well plates were pretreated with medium containing the indicated inhibitors and inoculated for 1 h with SARS-CoV (strain 5688, fourth passage) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 in the presence of the same concentration of inhibitors, and cells were washed twice with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. Eight hours later, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 70% ethanol, 0.5% H2O2 successively, permeabilized with PBS/0.5% Tween 20, and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 40-fold-diluted polyclonal antisera obtained from SARS-CoV-infected ferrets (Mustela furo). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-ferret antibodies (Dako) were used at 1:50 dilution. The reaction was developed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and infected cells were counted. LLC-MK2 cells were cultured at 34 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HCoV-NL63 (sixth passage) infection was carried out for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. After 24-h incubation, plates were processed as described above, and HCoV-NL63 infecton was detected by staining cells with 100-fold diluted human polyclonal serum, biotinylated anti-human antibody (1:250), and the VEC-TASTAIN ABC reagents (Vector Laboratories). All experiments were performed twice in duplicate. LLC-MK2 cells, HCoV-NL63, and human antiserum were generous gifts from Dr. Lia van der Hoek. We investigated the ability of inhibitors of several classes of proteases to modulate infection mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein, or by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, included as a control. Murine leukemia viruses carrying the gene for GFP and pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV or HIV-1 fusion proteins (SARS/MLV and HIV-1/MLV, respectively) were incubated with 293T cells expressing ACE2 or the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CXCR4. The infections were performed in the presence of the aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin A, serine protease inhibitor AEBSF, cysteine protease inhibitor E64d, and metalloprotease inhibitor phosphoramidon. As shown in Fig. 1A, of four classes of protease inhibitors assayed, only E64d, a general inhibitor of cysteine proteases, blocked SARS/MLV infection. E64d had no significant effect on HIV-1/MLV infection. SARS-CoV infection is sensitive to NH4Cl, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification (45Moore M.J. Dorfman T. Li W. Wong S.K. Li Y. Kuhn J.H.

Accordingly, we investigated the ability of cathepsin inhibitors to block infection mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, cathepsin L inhibitor (Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK) potently blocked SARS/MLV infection, and cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074 methyl ester) also showed consistent but less significant inhibition of infection. In contrast, HIV-1/MLV infection was enhanced by both of these inhibitors, consistent with other reports indicating that lysosomal degradation interferes with productive HIV-1 infection (47Wei B.L. Denton P.W. O'Neill E. Luo T. Foster J.L. Garcia J.V. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5705-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows representative fields of SARS/MLV and HIV-1/MLV infection in the presence and absence of 10 μm cathepsin L inhibitor. These data imply that cathepsin L activity contributes substantially to the SARS-CoV S-protein-mediated infection. We then examined the ability of these protease inhibitors to block infection of replication-competent SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, a group 1 coronavirus that also utilizes ACE2 as its cellular receptor. Sindbis virus and VSV were also included in these studies as controls. Infection was assessed within 8 and 24 h of incubation with SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, respectively, thereby minimizing any potential effects of inhibitors on post-entry steps in viral replication. As shown in Fig. 2A, neither SARS-CoV nor HCoV-NL63 infection was inhibited by AEBSF or phosphoramidon. SARS-CoV infection was effectively blocked by cathepsin L inhibitor and less significantly by cathepsin B inhibitor (Fig. 2B) at concentrations comparable with those effective with pseudotyped virus. While cathepsin B inhibitor did not have any effect, cathepsin L inhibitor partially blocked HCoV-NL63 and Sindbis virus infection at the highest concentration in one of two cell lines assayed. This partial inhibition in LLK-MK2 cells may have been to due to cytotoxicity. We further explored this difference in sensitivity to cathepsin inhibitors between HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV and sought to determine whether other cathepsin inhibitors could interfere with infection mediated by their respective S proteins. Inhibitors of cathepsin B, L, K, and S, the only cathepsins for which specific inhibitors are available, were examined. None of these inhibitors had a detectable effect on the infection of MLV pseudotyped with the HCoV-NL63 S protein (NL63/MLV) or with the fusion protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G/MLV), whereas cathepsin L and cathepsin S inhibitors efficiently blocked SARS/MLV entry (Fig. 3A). Again, cathepsin B inhibitor partially inhibited SARS/MLV infection. We also explored the ability of other broad protease inhibitors to block NL63/MLV infection. None of the protease inhibitors used in Fig. 1A had any effect on NL63/MLV infection (data not shown) nor did E64d, which again potently inhibited SARS/MLV (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that NL63/MLV infection is not dependent on the cysteine proteases that contribute to SARS/MLV infection nor on the protease activities blocked by the broader inhibitors assayed. The inability of E64d, a broad inhibitor of cyteine proteases, to block NL63/MLV infection raised the possibility that HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV enter cells via distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this possibility, NH4Cl, an inhibitor of acidification of lysosomal and endosomal compartments, had substantially less effect on NL63/MLV infection than on SARS/MLV (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that, in contrast with SARS-CoV, internalization of HCoV-NL63 to a low pH compartment may not be an essential step in its entry into the cell. Because cathepsin inhibitors can cross-react, we investigated the consequences of exogenous cathepsin B, L, and S expression in 293T cells that express human ACE2. To ensure comparable ACE2 expression levels in cells transfected with various cathepsins, cells were transfected with various amounts of ACE2-expressing plasmid together with a fixed amount of cathepsin plasmid, and ACE2 cell-surface expression was assessed by flow cytometry following each transfection. As shown in Fig. 4A, exogenous cathepsin L markedly increased infection by SARS/MLV but had no effect on NL63/MLV or VSV-G/MLV. Exogenous cathepsin S also modestly enhanced SARS/MLV infection but, surprisingly, inhibited NL63/MLV infection. We speculate that overexpressed cathepsin S, which is secreted and active at neutral pH, may digest and inactivate the HCoV-NL63 S protein but not that of SARS-CoV. In parallel, epitope-tagged cathepsins were immunoprecipitated from an aliquot of the same cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 4B shows that exogenous cathepsin L expression was lower than that of cathepsin B or S, despite its greater effect on SARS-CoV infection. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 4C, introduction of cathepsin L into mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice lacking cathepsin L (MEFs L–/–) resulted in substantially enhanced infection by SARS/MLV and MLV pseudotyped with marburg- and ebolavirus GP proteins. Again, no enhancement of infection was observed with NL63/MLV or VSV-G/MLV. Additional experiments with similar results are shown in supplemental Fig. 1A. Collectively, these data show that introduction of cathepsin L into cells where this enzyme is limiting or absent can substantially boost infection mediated by the SARS-CoV but not the HCoV-NL63 S protein. The role of cathepsins in the cellular entry of reoviruses has been appreciated for some time (34Ebert D.H. Deussing J. Peters C. Dermody T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24609-24617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 36Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that infection mediated by the GP protein of Zaire ebolavirus also depends on cathepsin B and, to a lesser extent, on cathepsin L (41Chandran K. Sullivan N.J. Felbor U. Whelan S.P. Cunningham J.M. Science. 2005; 308: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Here we extend this observation to SARS-CoV, which appears to be more dependent on cathepsin L than on cathepsin B. Cathepsin S also appears to contribute modestly to SARS-CoV infection and may partially compensate for the absence of cathepsin L in some cells. We also show that infection mediated by the S protein of another coronavirus that utilizes ACE2 as a receptor, HCoV-NL63, is not dependent on any of these cathepsins. It remains to be investigated whether other cellular proteases contribute to HCoV-NL63 infection through a mechanism analogous to the role played by cathepsin L in SARS-CoV infection or whether HCoV-NL63, like HIV-1 and VSV, infects cells independently of target-cell proteases. It is not yet clear how cathepsin L facilitates SARS-CoV infection. Several compatible possibilities exist. Cathepsin L may serve to nonspecifically degrade the S1 domain of SARS-CoV S protein, thereby permitting conformational transitions in the S2 domain necessary for fusion. ACE2 could also be a cathepsin target, thereby facilitating its dissociation with the S protein. Interestingly, we have observed that introduction of exogenous cathepsins reduces cell-surface expression of ACE2 (supplemental Fig. 1B). Cathepsin L could also cleave immediately upstream of the coronavirus fusion peptide in process equivalent to the furin cleavage of the HIV-1 and influenza fusion proteins. Our studies show that SARS-CoV infection can be limited by low cathepsin L expression. Of note, mature endothelial cells express relatively low levels of cathepsin L (48Urbich C. Heeschen C. Aicher A. Sasaki K. Bruhl T. Farhadi M.R. Vajkoczy P. Hofmann W.K. Peters C. Pennacchio L.A. Abolmaali N.D. Chavakis E. Reinheckel T. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and despite their efficient expression of ACE2, little infection or replication of SARS-CoV has been observed in these cells (11Hamming I.

Pathol. 2004; 203: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although multiple factors may contribute to the infection efficiency of endothelial cells, one possibility is that low cathepsin L activity limits SARS replication in these cells. Studies determining whether HCoV-NL63 more efficiently infects these cells in vivo than SARS-CoV are warranted. Finally our studies suggest that inhibitors specific to cathepsin L may be effective in treating SARS-CoV. However, they also raise the possibility that SARS-CoV can escape from a cathepsin L inhibitor by altering its S protein to function more like that of HCoV-NL63. Therefore, the means by which viruses escape from these inhibitors requires study.

This distance was determined by triangulation, with Earth's orbit as one segment of a triangle, using the Very Long Baseline Array. This resolves the long-standing problem that there is a discrepancy of a factor of 2 between different techniques used to determine distances. The reason for the discrepancy is that this portion of the Perseus arm has anomalous motions. The orientation of the anomalous motion agrees with spiral density-wave theory, but the magnitude of the motion is somewhat larger than most models predict."

Because these catalysts do not require the presence of any particular functional group or aryl substituent in the substrate, they considerably broaden the scope of asymmetric hydrogenation."

https://openalex.org/W2055388969,"Mechanisms of cell death in pancreatitis remain unknown. Parenchymal necrosis is a major complication of pancreatitis; also, the severity of experimental pancreatitis correlates directly with necrosis and inversely with apoptosis. Thus, shifting death responses from necrosis to apoptosis may have a therapeutic value. To determine cell death pathways in pancreatitis and the possibility of necrosis/apoptosis switch, we utilized the differences between the rat model of cerulein pancreatitis, with relatively high apoptosis and low necrosis, and the mouse model, with little apoptosis and high necrosis. We found that caspases were greatly activated during cerulein pancreatitis in the rat but not mouse. Endogenous caspase inhibitor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) underwent complete degradation in the rat but remained intact in the mouse model. Furthermore, XIAP inhibition with embelin triggered caspase activation in the mouse model, implicating XIAP in caspase blockade in pancreatitis. Caspase inhibitors decreased apoptosis and markedly stimulated necrosis in the rat model, worsening pancreatitis parameters. Conversely, caspase induction with embelin stimulated apoptosis and decreased necrosis in mouse model. Thus, caspases not only mediate apoptosis but also protect from necrosis in pancreatitis. One protective mechanism is through degradation of receptor-interacting protein (RIP), a key mediator of “programmed” necrosis. We found that RIP was cleaved (i.e. inactivated) in the rat but not the mouse model. Caspase inhibition restored RIP levels; conversely, caspase induction with embelin triggered RIP cleavage. Our results indicate key roles for caspases, XIAP, and RIP in the regulation of cell death in pancreatitis.

By contrast, very little is known about the mechanisms mediating another major pathologic response in pancreatitis, the parenchymal cell death. In experimental models of acute pancreatitis, acinar cells have been shown to die through both necrosis and apoptosis (6Gukovskaya A.S. Perkins P. Zaninovic V. Sandoval D. Rutherford R.

Morphologically, apoptosis is manifested by cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation, whereas necrosis is characterized by swelling of the cell and its organelles and rupture of the plasma membrane. Biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis, such as activation of specific cysteine proteases, the caspases, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, are usually absent in necrotic cells. Apoptosis preserves the structural integrity of the plasma membrane, whereas the necrotic cell releases its constituents, which damage neighboring cells and promote inflammatory infiltration in the organ. Therefore, necrotic death is “deadlier” to the organism than apoptotic death (13Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P.

The extrinsic pathway is initiated by receptor-induced activation of the initiator caspase-8 (or caspase-10) followed by activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3. This pathway is typically triggered by “death receptors”, e.g. tumor necrosis factor receptor or Fas. In the intrinsic pathway, a critical event is permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, resulting in the release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c. Once released, cytochrome c forms a complex with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, resulting in caspase-9 activation. Caspase-9 further cleaves and activates the effectors caspases, (e.g. caspase-3) leading to subsequent degradation of cellular constituents.

Invest. 2002; 110: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), there is very little known about the signaling mechanisms of apoptosis in pancreatitis. We have recently shown (29Gukovskaya A.S. Gukovsky I. Jung Y. Mouria M. Pandol S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22595-22604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) that the apoptotic “machinery” is present in isolated rat pancreatic acinar cells and can be activated by supramaximal doses of cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8), which cause pancreatitis-like changes in acinar cells. In particular, CCK-8 induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of caspases-9, -3. and -8. In contrast with apoptosis, the signaling mechanisms mediating necrotic cell death are in general poorly understood. Recent findings indicate that there are two types of necrosis (15Edinger A.L.

Accidental necrosis is an unregulated process triggered by severe cellular stress that is often characterized by depletion of cellular ATP. It is seen as a passive explosion of a cell overwhelmed by ion fluxes. By contrast, so-called programmed necrosis (or necrosis-like programmed cell death) is mediated by a coordinated series of signaling events that can be triggered via death receptors. For example, depending on conditions the same tumor necrosis factor receptor could induce either apoptosis or necrosis (30Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Acinar cell necrosis, and in particular, recurrent necrosis, is one of the most serious complications of acute pancreatitis (1Raraty M.G. Connor S. Criddle D.N. Sutton R. Neoptolemos J.P. Curr.

Based on the above-described observations that milder forms of experimental pancreatitis are associated with more apoptosis and the relatively severe forms, with more necrosis, it has been hypothesized (6Gukovskaya A.S.

Pancreatology. 2004; 4: 567-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that switching from the necrotic pattern of cell death to apoptosis could be beneficial in treatment of acute pancreatitis. In the present study we investigated the mechanisms of apoptosis and necrosis in pancreatitis and explored the possibility of necrosis/apoptosis switch through manipulating these signaling mechanisms. For this purpose, we utilized the differences between two related rodent models of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis induced in rats by supramaximally stimulating doses of the CCK-8 analog, cerulein, is a mild form of the disease characterized by relatively high extent of apoptosis and low necrosis (7Kaiser A.M. Saluja A.K. Sengupta A. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sandoval D. Gukovskaya A. Reavey P. Gukovsky S. Sisk A. Braquet P. Pandol S.J. Poucell-Hatton S. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). By contrast, in mice the same cerulein treatment results in a more severe disease with significant necrosis and very little apoptosis (7Kaiser A.M. Saluja A.K. Sengupta A. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both are the most commonly used and well characterized in vivo models of acute pancreatitis (37Lerch M.M. Adler G. Int. J. Pancreatol. 1994; 15: 159-170PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gorelick F.S. Adler G. Kern H.F. Go V.W. DiMagno E.P. Gardner J.D. Lebenthal E. Reber H.A. Scheele G.A. The Pancreas: Biology, Pathology, and Disease. Raven, New York1993: 64-69Google Scholar). We found drastic differences in death-signaling mechanisms, namely, caspase activation, and XIAP and RIP degradation, between the rat and mouse models of cerulein pancreatitis. By manipulating these mechanisms using pharmacologic inhibitors, we were able to shift the necrosis/apoptosis ratio, making the two models more like each other. The results identify several critical mediators of acinar cell death that may represent targets for therapeutic interventions to attenuate cell-death responses of acute pancreatitis. Experimental Pancreatitis—Cerulein pancreatitis was induced in male (200–250 g) Sprague-Dawley rats and male (25–30 g) Swiss Webster CD-1 mice by up to seven hourly intraperitoneal injections of 50 μg/kg cerulein. Control animals received similar injections of physiologic saline. Caspase inhibitors Q-VD-OPH (25 mg/kg) and Z-D-DCB (10 mg/kg), or vehicle (Me2SO), were applied in rats as a single intravenous injection 30 min before the start of cerulein treatment. XIAP inhibitor embelin (20 mg/kg), or vehicle (Me2SO), was applied in mice as one daily subcutaneous injection for 5 consecutive days; treatment with cerulein started 30 min after the last embelin injection. In the cerulein models, animals were sacrificed at 30 min, 2, 4, and 7 h after the first injection. Arginine pancreatitis was induced in rats by two hourly intraperitoneal injections of 2.5 g/kg l-arginine; controls received similar injections of saline. In this model, rats were sacrificed 24 h after the first injection. Animals were euthanized by CO2-induced asphyxiation, and the blood and pancreas were harvested for measurements. Serum Amylase and Lipase Measurements—Serum amylase and lipase levels were measured in a Hitachi 707 analyzer (Antech Diagnostics, Irvine, CA). Quantification of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was quantified on pancreatic tissue sections stained with Hoechst 33258 to visualize nuclear chromatin morphology or with TUNEL assay to measure DNA breaks, as we described previously (3Gukovsky I.

Tissue was fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, and 6 μm-thick sections were adhered to glass slides. Sections were deparaffinized by washing in Hemo-De and hydrated by transferring through graded ethanol. The sections were stained with 8 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei with condensed or fragmented chromatin were considered apoptotic (12Gukovskaya A.S. Pandol S.J. Pancreatology. 2004; 4: 567-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 39Gukovskaya A.S.

For these and other quantifications of histologic measurements, a total of at least 1000 acinar cells was counted on pancreatic tissue sections from each animal. Quantification of Necrosis—Quantification of necrosis was performed on pancreatic tissue sections stained with H&E. Cells with swollen cytoplasm, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and leakage of organelles into interstitium were considered necrotic. Quantification of Inflammatory Infiltration—Quantification of inflammatory infiltration was performed on pancreatic tissue sections stained with H&E. Isolation of Pancreatic Acini—Isolation of pancreatic acini from rats or mice was performed using a collagenase digestion procedure as we described previously (3Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S.

Dispersed pancreatic acini were then incubated at 37 °C in 199 medium (Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of 100 nm CCK-8. Caspase Activities—Caspase activities were measured using a fluorogenic assay as we described previously (29Gukovskaya A.S. Gukovsky I. Jung Y. Mouria M. Pandol S.J. J. Biol.

Pancreatic tissue or acinar cell samples were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Igepal CA-630, and 0.5 mm EDTA, centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected. Proteolytic reactions were carried out at 37 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, using substrates specific for caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-AMC), caspase-8 (Ac-IETD-AMC), or caspase-9 (Ac-LEHD-AMC). Cleavage of these substrates relieves 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), which emits fluorescent signal with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm. Fluorescence was calibrated using a standard curve for AMC. The data are expressed as moles of AMC/mg of protein/min. Preparation of Tissue and Cell Lysates for Western Blot Analysis—Portions of frozen tissue were homogenized on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the protease inhibitor mixture containing pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and aprotinin (5 μg/ml of each), rotated for 20 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were collected and stored at –80 °C. Dispersed pancreatic acini were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and processed as described above for tissue samples. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Preparation of Membrane and Cytosolic Fractions—Pancreatic tissue or acinar cell samples were homogenized in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture in a glass Dounce homogenizer (80 strokes). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and both the pellet (mitochondria-enriched membrane fraction) and supernatant (cytosolic fraction) were collected separately and used for Western blotting.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 1-h incubation of the membranes in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5). The blots were then incubated for 2 h or overnight with primary antibodies in the antibody buffer containing 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TTBS (0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline), washed three times with TTBS, and finally incubated for 1 h with a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody in the antibody buffer. The blots were developed for visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Pierce). Band intensities in the immunoblots were quantified by densitometry. Reduction/Alkylation—This was done according to a previous study (41Soares R.V. Liu B. Oppenheim F.G. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Arch. Oral Biol. 2002; 47: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, proteins in tissue lysate were reduced in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 8 m urea and 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Alkylation of reduced proteins was achieved by incubation for 30 min with 0.3 m iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibody against cytochrome c. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies against XIAP and p44/42 mitogen-activate protein kinase (Erk1/2) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); caspase-3, caspase-8, and FLIPS/L, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); cytochrome c, RIP, and Pyk2, from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA); COX IV, from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); and caspase-9, from Stressgen (San Diego, CA). CCK-8 was from American Peptide (Sunnyvale, CA); cerulein was from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Caspase fluorogenic substrates Ac-IETD-AMC, Ac-DEVD-AMC, and Ac-LEHD-AMC, and the XIAP inhibitor embelin (2,5-dihydroxy-3-undecyl-1,4-benzoquinone) were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Caspase inhibitors Z-Asp-2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone (Z-D-DCB) and Q-Val -Asp(non-O-methylated)-OPh (Q-VD-OPH) were from ALEXIS Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) and Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA), respectively. Other reagents were from Sigma. In rat and mouse cerulein pancreatitis, we measured time-dependent changes in the extent of apoptosis and necrosis in pancreas (Fig. 1). In the rat model, the extent of apoptosis was unchanged at 30 min after the start of cerulein treatment and increased ∼33-fold at 4 h and ∼16-fold at 7 h. The decrease in apoptosis at 7 h could be due to an increased clearance of apoptotic cells by inflammatory cells, the number of which in pancreas increases with time. Compared with the rat model, there was much less apoptosis in mouse cerulein pancreatitis, and the increase in apoptosis was minimal. Necrosis time dependently increased in both models of cerulein pancreatitis. In the rat model, the increase in necrosis was only detected at 4 a"
https://openalex.org/W2091323369,"Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1) was initially identified as an interacting partner of huntingtin, the Huntington disease protein. Unlike huntingtin that is ubiquitously expressed throughout the brain and body, HAP1 is enriched in neurons, suggesting that its dysfunction could contribute to Huntington disease neuropathology. Growing evidence has demonstrated that HAP1 and huntingtin are anterogradely transported in axons and that the abnormal interaction between mutant huntingtin and HAP1 may impair axonal transport. However, the exact role of HAP1 in anterograde transport remains unclear. Here we report that HAP1 interacts with kinesin light chain, a subunit of the kinesin motor complex that drives anterograde transport along microtubules in neuronal processes. The interaction of HAP1 with kinesin light chain is demonstrated via a yeast two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, HAP1 is colocalized with kinesin in growth cones of neuronal cells. We also demonstrated that knocking down HAP1 via small interfering RNA suppresses neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Analysis of live neuronal cells with fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching demonstrates that suppressing the expression of HAP1 or deleting the HAP1 gene inhibits the kinesin-dependent transport of amyloid precursor protein vesicles.

HAP1 is a good candidate for htt-mediated pathology, because its binding to the N-terminal region of htt is enhanced by expanded polyQ tracts, and its expression is enriched in the brain (1Li X.J.

The critical role of HAP1 in neuronal function has been demonstrated in HAP1 knock-out mice. Deletion of the mouse HAP1 gene leads to retarded growth, depressed feeding behavior, and postnatal death of these mice (6Chan E.Y. Nasir J. Gutekunst C.A. Coleman S. Maclean A. Maas A. Metzler M.

This phenotype may be caused by the degeneration of hypothalamic neurons that control feeding behavior (7Li S.H. Yu Z.X. Li C.L. Nguyen H.P. Zhou Y.X. Deng C. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6956-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that HAP1 is involved in neuronal transport of organelles or molecules. HAP1 is required for vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor along microtubules, and mutant htt impairs this transport concomitant with its increased interactions with HAP1 and dynactin p150 (9Gauthier L.R. Charrin B.C. Borrell-Pages M. Dompierre J.P. Rangone H. Cordelieres F.P. De Mey J. MacDonald M.E. Lessmann V. Humbert S. Saudou F.

Evidence to support this idea includes the interaction of HAP1 with Hrs, which plays a critical role in the endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (10Li Y. Chin L.S. Levey A.I. Li L. J.

The native conventional kinesin complex (379-386 kDa) consists of two heavy chains (KHC) (110-120 kDa) and two light chains (KLC-1 and KLC-2) (60-70 kDa) (21Bloom G.S. Wagner M.C. Pfister K.K.

Here we demonstrate that HAP1 interacts with the kinesin motor complex and that suppressing the expression of HAP1 inhibits kinesin-associated transport in neurons, providing the biochemical basis for the involvement of HAP1 in anterograde transport in neuronal cells. Reagents—The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HAP1-A, HAP1-B, and HAP1 (27Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2178-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); a mouse antibody against kinesin heavy chain (Chemicon); and a rabbit antibody against kinesin light chain-2 was generated using GST fusion proteins containing a rat KLC-2 fragment (amino acids 124-411) by Covance Inc. Other antibodies used in the study were those against tubulin (Sigma) and the hemagglutinin epitope 12CA5 (Cell Signaling). HAP1 constructs were generated in our previous studies (15Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also fused GFP or RFP to the N terminus of HAP1-A or HAP1-B in the PRK vector for examining its dynamic movement in cultured cells. The C-terminal region of HAP1-A at the BglII site of HAP1 cDNA was removed, resulting in a truncated HAP1 encoding 1-473 amino acids of HAP1 (27Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2178-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The full-length KLC-2 cDNA was isolated by screening a rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene) and inserted into the PRK expression vector. Amyloid precursor protein (APP)-YFP cDNA was a gift from Dr. Lawrence S. B. Goldstein at University of California in San Diego (28Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). PC12 cell lines stably expressing antisense HAP1 RNA were generated in our previous studies (7Li S.H. Yu Z.X. Li C.L. Nguyen H.P. Zhou Y.X. Deng C. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6956-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—HAP1 (1-599 amino acids) fused to the GAL-4 DNA binding domain was used as a bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library (1Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Two cDNAs were identified to contain a partial KLC-2 (amino acids 80-396) fragment that was able to interact with HAP1 in yeast. Filter and liquid β-galactosidase assays with different HAP1 fragments were performed using the same method as described previously (1Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Protein Interaction Assays and Western Blotting—In vitro binding assays were performed as described (1Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 15Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added to the mixture for an additional 1 h incubation. The beads were precipitated by gravity and washed twice in lysis buffer, which were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of HAP1 from mouse brain, hypothalamus was dissected from postnatal day one pups. Three to four hypothalami from wild type or HAP1 knock-out pups were combined and homogenized with a handheld Kontes pellet pestle motorized homogenizer in 0.2% Triton X-100 in a phosphate-buffered saline solution. Samples were then sonicated for 10 s at low power and were gently rocked for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Samples were adjusted to 500 μl of protein at 1.5 μg/μl and preabsorbed by protein A-agarose beads (25 μl, Sigma 1406-5G) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Supernatants were collected, and 20 μl of rabbit anti-HAP1-A (EM31) were added for incubation at 4 °C for 4 h. Next, 12.5 μl of protein A beads were added and incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were spun in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 10-15 s. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and finally resuspended in 80 μl of lysis buffer for Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of PC12 cells, PC12 cells were lysed in a Nonidet P-40-containing buffer. Anti-HAP1-A (10 μl) was then added to lysates (500 μl of 1 μg/μl solution) to incubate overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Protein A beads (15 μl) were then added to the tube for immunoprecipitation. For Western blots, cultured cells or brain tissues were solubilized in 1% SDS, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and sonicated for 10 s. The total lysate was used for Western blotting with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Neuronal Culture and Imaging Analysis—Primary neurons were cultured using the method similar to that described previously (29Li H. Li S.H. Yu Z.X. Shelbourne P. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8473-8481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Olfactory bulb neurons isolated from wild type and HAP1 knock-out mice at postnatal day one were plated on lysine-coated coverglass in two-well chamber slides from Nalge Nunc International Lab-Tek (catalog number 155379). Cells were cultured in B27-supplemented neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum containing 50-100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) for 3 days. Control cells were cultured without NGF. For immunofluorescence light microscopy, light micrographs were taken using a 63× objective lens (LD-Achroplan 63×/0.75) on a Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 200 MOT) attached to a digital camera (Hamamatsu Orca-100). Micrographs were taken using Openlab software (Improvision Inc). Confocal image analysis was performed with a Ziess LSM 510 NLO confocal microscope system. For transfection of PC12 cells and imaging analysis of live transfected cells, cells were plated on two-chambered coverglass (Lab-Tek 155379) and transfected with GFP-HAP1-A or GFP-HAP1-B by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen 18324-020) for 5 h. Cells were then loaded for 10-15 min with red MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 1:1000 in CO2-independent medium from Invitrogen (18045-088) at 37 °C. After two washes with CO2-independent medium, CO2-independent medium containing 100 ng/ml NGF (Sigma) was added to stimulate differentiation. Cells were then immediately placed in a heated stage and imaged using the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 40x objective lens. Images were scanned at 512 × 512 resolution, scan speed of 7, and a mean of 4 scans for an overall scan time of 3.93 s per image. The mitotracker dye (Molecular Probe) was imaged at a laser wavelength of 514 nm; the GFP fusion proteins were imaged at 488 nm. Scans were taken every 3 min over a course of 3.5 h. Movies were created using Metamorph software showing 6 frames/s. For vesicular movement assays, cultured olfactory bulb neurons or PC12 cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes. After culturing PC12 cells for 24 h and primary neurons for 96 h, cells were transfected with APP-YFP DNA using Lipofectamine 2000. Wild type cells served as a control, and the identity of the cells was blinded. Cells were examined 24-36 h later in CO2-independent medium using the 63× objective lens of the fluorescence light microscope. Cells were observed for 1 min to score those having visible vesicle movement in neurites. For each culture dish, 20 cells were randomly selected. The number of cells showing vesicular movement was divided by the total number of transfected cells examined to obtain a percentage of transfected cells having vesicle movement. For each cell type, three plates were assayed, and the data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Adenoviral HAP1-siRNA Preparation—The testing of small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences revealed that one siRNA (GAAGTATGTCCTCCAGCAA of 1695-1713 nucleotides of the rat HAP1 gene) was able to effectively inhibit the expression of HAP1. This siRNA was inserted into an adenoviral vector that independently expresses GFP under the control of the CMV promoter. A vector that expresses GFP alone or a scrambled HAP1 siRNA (GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG) served as the control. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated and purified by Welgen Inc. (Worcester, MA). The viral titer was determined by measuring the number of infected HEK293 cells expressing GFP. All viral stocks were adjusted to 1 × 108 plaque-forming units/μl before their use. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) Assay—Cultured olfactory neurons were transfected with APP-YFP DNA construct. After 18-36 h, cells were incubated with CO2-independent medium. Chamber slides were then placed into a heated microscope stage and maintained at 37 °C. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope microimaging system (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta from Carl Zeiss Microimaging) and software (LSM 510 version 302 SP2). All imaging was done with a 63× oil immersion objective lens. For imaging, the Zeiss Argon laser (maximum power of 30 milliwatt) was adjusted to a wavelength of 488 nm. Laser power was set to 75%, and transmittance was set at 4%. Transfected cells were then selected by the presence of YFP fluorescent puncta. A time series of images was collected. Total scanning time was set at 3.93 s with a wait time of 3 s between scans. Three scans were taken before photobleaching using the conditions listed above. The distal one-third to one-quarter of the longest process (in an effort to select the tips of axons over dendrites) was outlined as a region of interest to be photobleached. To photobleach cells, the laser transmittance was adjusted to 100% for both the 477 nm and 488 nm line of the argon laser. Seventy bleaching iterations were performed, lasting a total of ∼10-15s. Immediately after photobleaching, scans were taken as described above for up to 5 min. Regions of interest were also established for an unbleached cell region and for a region outside of cells at each time point. These values were used to correct background and for overall fluorescence loss because of scanning. For each wild type or HAP1 knock-out animal, 3 cells were examined and their fluorescence data averaged at each time point. A total of 13 cells from four mice were examined and the data averaged for each genotype. Statistical Analysis—Error bars in the vesicle movement assays reflect S.E., as computed for three trials of 20 cells/trial. Differences were found to be statistically significant using the Student's t test for both primary neurons (p = 0.02) and antisense RNA expressing PC12 cells (p = 0.02). Error bars in the FRAP assays reflect the S.E. for 13 cells from four wild type and four knock-out mice. Interaction of HAP1 with Kinesin—Rodent HAP1 consists of two isoforms, HAP1-A and HAP1-B, which have different C-terminal sequences (1Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that a C-terminal fragment of HAP1 present in both rodent isoforms binds kinesin light chain-2 (KLC-2, Fig. 1), a subtype of KLC that is highly homologous to kinesin light chain-1 (KLC-1) with 71.1% amino acid identity (30Rahman A. Friedman D.S. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15395-15403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil domains of HAP1 do not appear to mediate the binding of HAP1 to KLC, as HAP1 fragments that contained coiled-coil domains but lacked C-terminal amino acids failed to yield a positive interaction (Fig. 1B). To confirm the interaction between HAP1 and KLC, we performed a GST binding assay in which GST or GST-HAP1 fusion proteins were incubated with HEK293 cell lysates containing transfected KLC-2. A GST fusion protein consisting of a HAP1 fragment (160-599 amino acids), but not 160-445 amino acids, precipitated KLC-2, confirming the yeast two-hybrid results (Fig. 1C). To examine the in vivo interaction of HAP1 with KLC, we performed HAP1 immunoprecipitation of mouse brains. We used hypothalamic tissue for HAP1 immunoprecipitation, as it is enriched in HAP1. The hypothalamic tissue of HAP1 knock-out mice we previously created (7Li S.H. Yu Z.X. Li C.L. Nguyen H.P. Zhou Y.X. Deng C. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6956-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a control to confirm that precipitation of kinesin is dependent on the presence of HAP1. We generated a rabbit anti-KLC using the conserved region (124-411 amino acids) of KLC-2 as an antigen. This antibody reacts with both KLC-1 and KLC-2 in the brain. Western blotting revealed that KLC-1 is the major form of KLC in the hypothalamus and was coprecipitated by the antibody to HAP1. Only when HAP1 was present did HAP1 immunoprecipitation coprecipitate kinesin (Fig. 1D), indicating that KLC associates with HAP1 in vivo. Colocalization and Association of HAP1-A with Kinesin—To investigate whether HAP1 colocalizes with kinesin in cells, we examined PC12 cells that show elongated neurites in response to NGF. Without NGF treatment, KHC and KLC were mainly distributed in the cell body or soma (data not shown). After NGF treatment, PC12 cells developed long neurites. Consistent with a previous report (31Morfini G. Quiroga S. Rosa A. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), KHC and KLC were distributed in the growing tips of cellular processes (Fig. 2A). We have shown previously that HAP1-A is enriched in neurite tips, and HAP1-B is largely confined to the cell body (32Li S.H. Li H. Torre E.R. Li X.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to know whether kinesin and HAP1-A are colocalized in neurite tips. We used mouse anti-KHC and rabbit antibodies to HAP1 in immunofluorescence double labeling. KHC and HAP1-A were clearly colocalized in the same neurite tips (Fig. 2B). In contrast, most HAP1-B remained in the body of PC12 cells (Fig. 2B). Using immunoprecipitation, we then asked whether HAP1-A preferentially binds to kinesin. It is known that HAP1-A interacts with HAP1-B to form a dimer in cells (27Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2178-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As expected, immunoprecipitation of either HAP1-A or HAP1-B from PC12 cells pulled down both HAP1-A and HAP1-B. Because PC12 cells express more HAP1-B than HAP1-A, the HAP1-B immunoprecipitation yielded a much greater amount of HAP1-B than HAP1-A. Importantly, more KLC was precipitated by anti-HAP1-A than by anti-HAP1-B. Because KLC binds KHC to form an active motor complex, we probed the same blot with anti-KHC. The increased level of KHC in the HAP1-A immunoprecipitation as compared with the HAP1-B immunoprecipitation also supports the idea that HAP1-A is more likely than HAP1-B to associate with the kinesin complex (Fig. 2C). Trafficking of HAP1 and Neurite Outgrowth—Microtubule-dependent transport is required for neurite outgrowth. We have previously reported that overexpression of HAP1-A significantly increases the number of PC12 cells containing extended neurites (29.4%) as compared with HAP-1B overexpression (9.7%) and vector transfection (4.7%) (32Li S.H. Li H. Torre E.R. Li X.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether this neurite promotion is related to the trafficking function of HAP1. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of HAP1 on live NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. We expressed GFP- or RFP-linked HAP1-A or HAP1-B in these cells and then examined the dynamic subcellular localization of the different HAP1 isoforms. We observed that RFP-HAP1-A was able to move anterogradely from the cell body to neurite terminal (supplemental movie 1). Time-lapse imaging clearly shows that cells expressing GFP-HAP1-A are able to extend neurites. More importantly, GFP-HAP1-A is localized in the extended neurites and growth cone tips (Fig. 3A). However, GFP-HAP1-B remained in the cell body of PC12 cells and seemed to inhibit neurite outgrowth when compared with nontransfected cells labeled with a red mitochondrial staining (Fig. 3A). We also expressed a truncated HAP1 (amino acids 1-473), which lacks the C-terminal kinesin light chain binding domain. Overexpression of this mutated HAP1 was unable to promote neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells (Fig. 3B). As HAP1-B and HAP1-A are known to form heterodimers, it is possible that overexpression of HAP1-B sequesters all of the free endogenous HAP1-A of the cell, preventing cells from extending neurites. These results are consistent with the finding that HAP1-A preferentially binds kinesin and support the idea that the interaction of HAP1-A with kinesin may be involved in neurite outgrowth in some neurons. Altering the Expression of HAP1 in Neurons via siRNA—We next wanted to test the idea that HAP1-associated trafficking is indeed involved in the neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. To do so, we used siRNA to reduce the expression of endogenous HAP1 in PC12 cells. We identified one siRNA (see sequences under “Materials and Methods”) that was able to effectively inhibit the expression of HAP1. This siRNA was inserted into an adenoviral vector that also independently expresses GFP. Thus, GFP-positive cells are likely to express HAP1 siRNA. Infection of PC12 cells with this adenoviral siRNA effectively reduced endogenous levels of HAP1 in PC12 cells (Fig. 4A). Consequently, HAP1 siRNA reduced the number PC12 cells showing neurites longer than two cell bodies in the presence of NGF (Fig. 4B). This reduction by adenoviral HAP1 siRNA (20.95% ± 0.18, n = 3) is statistically significant (p < 0.01) as compared with adenoviral GFP infection (47.4% ± 1.94, n = 3), confirming the role of HAP1 in neurite growth of PC12 cells. We also tes"
https://openalex.org/W2142377643,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has been identified as one of the most potent of endogenous negative regulators of blood vessel growth in the body. Here we report that PEDF is able to inhibit growth factor-induced angiogenesis in microvascular endothelial cells through a novel pathway requiring cleavage and intracellular translocation of the transmembrane domain of the VEGFR-1. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of VEGFR-1 revealed the appearance of an 80-kDa C-terminal domain in the cytosol of cells treated with VEGF and PEDF that correlated with a decrease of the full-length receptor in the nuclear and cytoskeletal fractions. This regulated intramembrane proteolysis is dependent on γ-secretase because inhibition of γ-secretase abolished the inhibitory effect of PEDF on VEGF-induced angiogenesis as well as VEGFR-1 cleavage. The addition of PEDF to microvascular endothelial cells significantly increases γ-secretase activity even in the absence of VEGF, showing that VEGF binding to VEGF-R1 is essential for substrate availability. This increase in activity was associated with translocation of presenilin 1 from the perinuclear region to the cell membrane. PEDF was also able to inhibit VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-1. Taken together we have identified two novel pathways by which PEDF inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis: regulated intramembrane proteolysis and inhibition of phosphorylation. This confirms the importance of PEDF and VEGFR-1 in the negative regulation of angiogenesis. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has been identified as one of the most potent of endogenous negative regulators of blood vessel growth in the body. Here we report that PEDF is able to inhibit growth factor-induced angiogenesis in microvascular endothelial cells through a novel pathway requiring cleavage and intracellular translocation of the transmembrane domain of the VEGFR-1.

Johnson L.V. Investig. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 1700-1707PubMed Google Scholar) as a novel neurotrophic activity in conditioned medium from fetal pigmented epithelial cells. PEDF, a 50-kDa noninhibitory member of the serine protease inhibitor (Serpin) gene family (2Tombran-Tink J. Mazuruk K. Rodriguez I.R. Chung D. Linker T. Englander E. Chader G.J. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 11PubMed Google Scholar, 3Steele F.R. Chader G.J. Johnson L.V. Tombran-Tink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) has now been identified in a wide variety of tissues throughout the body. The finding that PEDF is essential for maintaining avascularity (4Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), coupled with recent observations that PEDF plays a critical role in preventing aberrant neovascularization (5Stellmach V. Crawford S.E. Zhou W. Bouck N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), has suggested that PEDF is a potent regulator of angiogenesis. PEDF has been shown to act by inhibiting the angiogenic response to factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (4Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect was more profound than any of the other anti-angiogenic factors tested (i.e. angiostatin, thrombospondin-1, and endostatin). PEDF selectively inhibits the formation of new vessels from endothelial cells but does not appear to harm the existing vascular structure (6Bouck N. Trends. Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 330-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of PEDF on vessel formation appears to be reversible when a transient and regulated angiogenesis occurs in situations including tissue repair after injury (7Tonnesen M.G. Feng X. Clark R.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2000; 5: 40-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). A recent study by Ogata et al. (8Ogata N. Nishikawa M. Nishimura T. Mitsuma Y. Matsumura M. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 2002; 133: 851-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) has provided clinical evidence to show that expression of VEGF and PEDF are inversely correlated during the development of retinal neovascularization, further supporting an anti-angiogenic role for PEDF in vivo. Although numerous studies have shown that VEGF mediates endothelial cell behavior via VEGFR-2 (9Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 10Takahashi T.

Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), there is increasing evidence that VEGFR-1 plays a critical role in regulating VEGFR-2-mediated signaling (12Bussolati B.

Based on these observations, we explored the possibility that PEDF regulates angiogenesis through VEGFR-1 using an in vitro angiogenesis model exposing microvascular endothelial cells to PEDF in the presence or absence of VEGF. We are the first to demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of PEDF on VEGF-induced angiogenesis results from enhancing γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of the C terminus of VEGFR-1, which in turn inhibits VEGFR-2-induced angiogenesis. In addition, PEDF was also able to regulate the phosphorylation of VEGFR-1, which itself can regulate VEGFR-2 signaling. Reagents—Microvascular endothelial cell basal medium (MECBM) and growth supplement were from TCS Works (Buckingham, UK). Recombinant VEGF and γ-secretase activity kits were obtained from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Recombinant PEDF was purchased from BioProducts MD (BioProducts MD LLC, MD). ProteoExtract™ subcellular proteome extraction kit was obtained from Merck. Neutralizing antibodies were initially a gift from Professor Asif Ahmed (Birmingham University, Birmingham, UK) and then obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other materials were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture—Bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BRMECs) were isolated and cultured as described previously (16Cai J. Ahmad S. Jiang W.G. Huang J. Kontos C.D. Boulton M. Ahmed A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2959-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated bovine retinas were homogenized by a Teflon-glass homogenizer. After trapping on an 83-μm nylon mesh, the microvessels were transferred into 2× modified Eagle's medium containing enzyme mixture (500 μg/ml collagenase, 200 μg/ml Pronase, and DNase) at 37 °C for 20 min. The resultant vessel fragments were trapped on a 53-μm mesh, washed, pelleted, and plated out in microvascular endothelial cell basal medium (MECBM) with growth supplement at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 days. The cells were used between passages 1 and 3. Growth Factor Treatment of Quiescent Cultures—Nearly confluent cells were rendered quiescent for 45 min in serum-free MECBM before treatment with 100 ng/ml VEGF in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml PEDF at 37 °C for indicated times. The cells exposed to medium alone acted as an unstimulated control group. Time Course of PEDF Treatment—Near confluent BRMECs were treated with 100 ng/ml VEGF for 1 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of 100 ng/ml PEDF for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. BRMECs were then subject to immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. In Vitro Angiogenesis Assays—The angiogenic activity of endothelial cells was analyzed quantitatively using in vitro proliferation, migration, and tubule formation models, as previously described (16Cai J. Ahmad S. Jiang W.G. Huang J. Kontos C.D. Boulton M. Ahmed A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2959-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Cai J. Jiang W.G. Mansel R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Proliferation—BRMECs were incubated in 96-well plates at 750 cells/well in MECBM with added growth supplement (TCS CellWork) for 24 h. The cells were transferred to serum-free MEBCM for 45 min, at which time the medium was replaced with basal medium containing 1% fetal calf serum, and the various growth factors and the cells were incubated for 48 h. The relative cell number was determined by crystal violet staining monitored at 540 nm. Tubule Formation—Near confluent BRMECs were pretreated with growth factors for 48 h. The cells were detached and plated sparsely (2.5 × 104/well) on 24-well plates coated with 12.5% (v/v) Matrigel™ (Collaborative Research) and left overnight. The medium was then aspirated, and 250 μl/well of 12.5% Matrigel™ was overlaid on the cells for 2 h to allow polymerization of Matrigel™, followed by adding 500 μl/well of MCDB131 (a reduced serum supplemental medium for the culture of microvascular endothelial cells) with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The following day, the culture plates were observed under a phase contrast microscope and photographed at random in five different fields (×10). The tubule length (mm/mm2) and number of capillary connections/microscope field were quantified. Migration Assay (Wound Healing)—BRMECs incubated in MECBM with growth supplement in wells of a chamber slide were allowed to reach near confluence. To prevent cell proliferation at the wound edge, the cell monolayers were pretreated with 25 mg/ml 5-fluorouracil for 5 min followed by 48-h treatment with growth factors (in the presence of 5-fluorouracil). Then the cell monolayers were wounded by a 1-cm3 tip pipette along one direction. Debris was removed, and fresh MECBM containing 1% fetal calf serum was added into the cultures at 37 °C for the time periods indicated. Cell migration was monitored and photographed at initial wounding and at time points indicated under a phase microscope (×4). The images were quantified using image analysis systems (NIH Image) and calculated as the distance (μm) migrated into the wound area. Antisense Treatment—Antisenses (VEGFR-1, 5′-AAGCAGACACCCGAGCAG-3′; VEGFR-2, 5′-GCTGCTCTGATTGTTGGG-3′) and scrambled antisenses (VEGFR-1, 5′-ACTGTCCACTCGCAGTTC-3′; VEGFR-2, 5′-TGCTGGCATGTGCGTTGT-3′) were transfected into BRMECs using the cationic liposomal carrier-DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) that has previously shown efficacy without evidence of toxicity in endothelial cells (18Kaiser S. Toborek M. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent effects of the antisenses were produced when the antisense probes were added to the cultures every 24 h for 3 days. To determine an optimal concentration and specificity of antisense oligonucleotides, BRMECs were treated with different concentrations (2-10 μm) of the antisenses and scrambled antisenses followed by Western blotting analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the VEGFR-1 C-terminal domain or the VEGFR-2 C-terminal domain by using antibodies at a final concentration of 1:250 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were stripped and reprobed with goat polyclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:250) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The band intensity was determined by LabWorks™ image acquisition and analysis software (Media Cybernetics) Based on titration results the BRMECs were treated with 10 μm of the antisense and scrambled oligonucleotides over a 3-day period. The cultures were then exposed to growth factors for 48 h followed by assessment of tubule forming ability. Western Blotting Analysis for Overall VEGFR-1 Expression—Details of the Western blotting procedure have been published previously (16Cai J. Ahmad S. Jiang W.G. Huang J. Kontos C.D. Boulton M. Ahmed A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2959-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysate of BRMECs following treatment with VEGF and/or PEDF at 100 ng/ml for 48 h were subject to Western blotting. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the VEGFR-1 C-terminal domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a final concentration of 1:250. The blots were stripped and reprobed with goat polyclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:250) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The band intensity was determined by LabWorks™ image acquisition and analysis software (Media Cybernetics). Cell Fractionation—Near confluent BRMECs were subjected to two extractions to obtain Triton X-1000-soluble (TX-sol) and -insoluble (TX-insol) fractions as previously described (17Cai J. Jiang W.G. Mansel R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were first extracted with 500 μl of Triton lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm each of NaF, Na3VO4, EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1% of Nonidet P-40, and Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected as the TX-sol fraction. The remaining debris was further extracted with 500 μl of SDS buffer, which was the same as the Triton lysis buffer except that it contained 1% SDS instead of 1% Triton X-100. The extract buffer was vigorously pipetted before centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and then the supernatant was collected as the TX-insol fraction. The proteins from the TX-sol and TX-insol fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. Neutralizing Antibodies—VEGFR-1 and VEGR-2 were blocked by using neutralizing antibodies as described previously (16Cai J. Ahmad S. Jiang W.G. Huang J. Kontos C.D. Boulton M. Ahmed A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2959-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, BRMECs at near confluence were exposed to neutralizing antibodies to either VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 at 60 ng/ml for 1 h followed by the addition of VEGF, PEDF, or a combination thereof for 48 h. The cell lysates were then assessed by Western blotting to determine VEGFR-1 expression/translocation using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the VEGFR-1 C-terminal domain or N-terminal domain (1:250). γ-Secretase Activity Detection—The assay was carried out in a microplate reader using a γ-secretase Activity kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The principle of the assay is that the cell lysate is tested for secretase activity by the addition of a secretase-specific peptide conjugated to the reporter molecules (5-[(2-aminoethyl)aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS) and 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL). In the uncleaved form the fluorescent emissions from EDANS are quenched by the physical proximity of the DABCYL moiety, which exhibits maximal absorption at the same wavelength (495 nm). Cleavage of the peptide by the secretase physically separates EDANS and DABCYL, allowing for the release of a fluorescent signal. The level of secretase enzymatic activity in the cell lysate is proportional to the fluorometric reaction. γ-Secretase Inhibition—Near confluent BRMECs in T25-cm2 flasks were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and serum-free MECBM for 45 min. The cells were treated for 2 h with 2 ml/flask of MECBM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 13.5 μm γ-secretase inhibitor (Sigma). BRMECs were cultured with growth factors (VEGF or/and PEDF at 100 ng/ml) for 48 h followed by either (a) assessment of tube forming ability or (b) Western blotting of lysates to determine VEGFR-1 distribution. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of Presenilin 1 Expression—Total RNA was isolated from BRMECs treated with growth factors by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then reversed transcribed using Reverse-iT™ (Abgene). Bovine presenilin 1 (PS1) transcripts were amplified using 5′-CCATGCCTGGCTTATTGTTT-3′ as forward primer and 5′-ATGCCTGCTGGAGTCTCAGT-3′ as reverse primer at 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 54/96 °C annealing temperature. As control for the amount of mRNA input, we amplified bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase at 54/93 °C annealing temperature, 1.5 mm MgCl2 concentration with forward primer 5′-GGGTCATCATCTCTGCACCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGTCATAAGTCCCTCCACGA3′. A total of 5-μl aliquots of amplified products were separated electrophoretically on a 1.2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and illuminated with UV light and analyzed using NIH Image software. Subcellular Protein Extraction—Purified proteins of four subcellular fractions from BRMECs treated with growth factors, including membrane, cytosolic, cytoskeletal, and nucleic fractions, were obtained using ProteoExtract™ subcellular proteome extraction kit. This kit preserves the integrity of the subcellular structures before and during extraction to prevent any mixing of the different subcellular compartments. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis of Presenilin 1 Maturation—The membrane proteins obtained as above from BRMECs treated with growth factors over the indicated period times were immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibody against the PS1 N-terminal domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1.5 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose overnight at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by goat polyclonal antibody against the PS1 C-terminal domain (1:250) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocytochemistry—BRMECs grown to near confluent on glass coverslips were treated with growth factors over indicated time periods. After treatment, the monolayers were washed once with fully supplement MECBM containing 5% fetal calf serum and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After blocking by 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies against the PS 1C terminus or Pan-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) was added to visualize the nuclei. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides. The images were collected on a Leica confocal microscope using a Leica TCS NT “Image” program. Tyrosine Phosphorylation Status of VEGFR-1—To determine the phosphorylation status of VEGFR-1 in whole cell lysate following treatment with VEGF and/or PEDF at 100 ng/ml, the phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from BRMEC lysate (200 μg/ml) by 10 μl of mouse anti-tyrosine phosphorylation monoclonal antibody (PY 20) for 1.5 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by antibodies against VEGFR-1 as described above. Phosphorylation status in subcellular fractions was determined following immunoprecipitation with an anti-tyrosine phosphorylation antibody (PY 20) prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by antibodies against VEGFR-1. Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments were repeated at least three times. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Proliferation, migration, and tube formation was analyzed using a Student's t test on log normalized data. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine statistical significance of the laser densitometry data. As expected exogenous VEGF stimulated microvascular endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubule formation by up to 80% as compared with the untreated cells (p < 0.01; Fig. 1). PEDF at 100 ng/ml resulted in a significant reduction of VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and abolished migration and tubule formation (p < 0.001). PEDF alone had no significant effect on migration or tubule formation when compared with the negative control (Fig. 1, b and c). VEGFR-1 was shown to be a requirement for PEDF inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis using an antisense oligonucleotide against VEGFR-1. Fig. 2a shows that VEGFR-1 antisense reduced VEGFR-1 expression in BRMECs in a concentration-dependent manner with an 84% reduction of VEGFR-1 for 10 μm antisense without affecting VEGFR-2 expression. Scrambled VEGFR-1 antisense had no effect on VEGFR-1 expression (Fig. 2b). VEGFR-1 antisense abolished the inhibitory effect of PEDF on VEGF-induced tubule formation but had no significant effect on VEGF-induced tubule length (Fig. 3b). However, suppression of VEGFR-1 expression inhibited the VEGF-induced increase in capillary connections even in the absence of PEDF (Fig. 3b). Scrambled VEGFR-1 antisense had no effect on the inhibitory effect of PEDF. VEGFR-1 antisense also reversed the inhibitory effect of PEDF in the proliferation and migration assays (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that (a) PEDF inhibition of VEGF activity is highly dependent on VEGFR-1 in endothelial cells and (b) VEGFR-1 is able to regulate vascular maturation.FIGURE 3The effect of VEGFR knock-out on in vitro tubule formation. Confluent microvascular endothelial cells were treated with antisense (AS) oligonucleotides against VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2. The cells were exposed to VEGF and/or PEDF for 48 h before being cultured between two layers of Matrigel™ for 24 h. Morphometric analysis of the degree of tube formation was then performed. a represents photomicrographs of representative microscope fields showing tubule formation in the presence of different growth factors.

Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. The error bars show the S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether VEGFR-2 is involved in the inhibitory effect of PEDF on VEGF-induced tubule formation, VEGFR-2 antisense was used to suppress VEGFR-2 expression in BRMECs. In Fig. 2c, VEGFR-2 antisense exhibited a specific inhibitory effect on VEGFR-2 expression with a 90% reduction of VEGFR-2 at concentration of 10 μm without affecting VEGFR-1 expression, whereas scrambled VEGFR-2 antisense did not affect VEGFR-2 expression (Fig. 2d). VEGFR-2 antisense caused significant reduction of VEGF-induced tubule formation (tubule length and capillary connection) of BRMECs in the presence or the absence of growth factors (VEGF/or PEDF) (Fig. 3c). To elucidate whether the involvement of VEGFR-1 in PEDF inhibitory activity is associated with a change in VEGFR-1 receptor density, whole cell lysates from BRMECs treated with VEGF and/or PEDF were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then probed by an antibody against VEGFR-1. VEGFR-1 was seen as a single band at the expected molecular mass of 180 kDa. Relative ratio of VEGFR-1 to α-tubulin showed no significant change under all conditions tested (Fig. 4a). To assess the subcellular distribution of VEGFR-1 following PEDF stimulation of endothelial cells, we extracted cells in 1% Triton X-100 and separated the TX-sol from the TX-insol fractions. Western blot analysis showed that full-length VEGFR-1 was found only in the insoluble fractions in negative controls, VEGF or PEDF treatment alone. PEDF in the presence of VEGF demonstrated the appearance of a significant amount of a cleaved 80-kDa C-terminal domain of VEGFR-1 in the TX-sol fraction (Fig. 4b). PEDF did not appear to affect the extracellular N-terminal domain of VEGFR-1 in either the presence or absence of VEGFR. These observations lead us to conclude that PEDF may induce cleavage of VEGFR-1 either within the transmembrane or the intracellular juxtamembrane region, resulting in the intracellular domain of VEGFR-1 being released from the plasma membrane. A neutralizing antibody against VEGFR-1 added prior to VEGF/PEDF treatment abolished translocation of the C-terminal domain, whereas neutralization with VEGFR-2 reduced but did not completely block cleavage compared with the control (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the finding that PEDF levels change in hypoxia-induced retinal neo-vascularization (19Chan C.K. Pham L.N. Zhou J. Spee C. Ryan S.J. Hinton D.R. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) allows us to predict that PEDF-induced cleavage of VEGFR-1 should occur at an early time. To test this hypothesis, the TX-insol fractions from BRMECs treated with PEDF over different times in the presence of VEGF were subject to Western blotting analysis of VEGFR-1 expression using antibody against the VEGFR-1 C-terminal domain. The data indicate that by 1 h after adding PEDF, a cleaved 80-kDa C-terminal domain of VEGFR-1 was present in the TX-sol fractions with a maximum level by 24 h post-treatment (Fig. 4c). Intrigued by the observation that PEDF+VEGF induce a relocation of the intracellular domain of VEGFR-1 to the TX-sol fraction, we went on to test whether the possible cleavage of VEGFR-1 might be processed by γ-secretase. We first sought to examine whether γ-secretase activity was affected by PEDF. Pretreatment of endothelial cells for 48 h in the presence of PEDF resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase of γ-secretase activity in the total cell lysate: up to ∼6-fold for PEDF treatment compared with VEGF treatment, which did not affect γ-secretase activity (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, combined PEDF and VEGF treatment did not increase γ-secretase activity above that achieved with PEDF alone. With the addition of a γ-secretase inhibitor, the inhibitory effect of PEDF on VEGF-induced tubule formation was completely abolished (Fig. 5b). Treatment of cells with γ-secretase inhibitor also blocked the translocation of the intracellular domain of VEGFR-1 to the TX-sol fractions induced by PEDF+VEGF (Fig. 5c). This indicates that PEDF appears to enhance γ-secretase activity leading to inhibition of angiogenesis, by way of cleaving VEGFR-1. γ-Secretase is a complex consisting of four molecules. APH-1 and nicastrin form the initial complex, to which PS binds followed by PEN-2 binding. This complex is trafficked to the plasma membrane from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi in a mature functional form (20Brunkan A.L. Goate A.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 769-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence has emerged to support an essential role for PS in the enzymatic activity of γ-secretase (20Brunkan A.L. Goate A.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 769-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We analyzed whether an increase in γ-secretase activity induced by PEDF resulted from an elevation in PS expression. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from BRMECs treat"
https://openalex.org/W2092240253,"We report the discovery of a checkpoint that monitors synapsis between homologous chromosomes to ensure accurate meiotic segregation. Oocytes containing unsynapsed chromosomes selectively undergo apoptosis even if a germline DNA damage checkpoint is inactivated. This culling mechanism is specifically activated by unsynapsed pairing centers, cis-acting chromosome sites that are also required to promote synapsis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Apoptosis due to synaptic failure also requires the C. elegans homolog of PCH2, a budding yeast pachytene checkpoint gene, which suggests that this surveillance mechanism is widely conserved."

Because mFPR2 was inducible in mouse microglial cells by proinflammatory stimulants, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a ligand for the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), we investigated the role of TLR2 in the regulation of mFPR2. We found that a TLR2 agonist, peptidoglycan (PGN) derived from Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, induced considerable mFpr2 mRNA expression in a mouse microglial cell line and primary microglial cells. This was associated with a markedly increased chemotaxis of the cells in response to mFPR2 agonist peptides. In addition, activation of TLR2 markedly enhanced mFPR2-mediated uptake of Aβ42 by microglia. Studies of the mechanistic basis showed that PGN activates MAPK and IκBα, and the effect of PGN on induction of mFPR2 was dependent on signaling pathways via ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs. The use of TLR2 on microglial cells by PGN was supported by the fact that N9 cells transfected with short interfering RNA targeting mouse TLR2 failed to show increased expression of functional mFPR2 after stimulation with PGN. Our results demonstrated a potentially important role for TLR2 in microglial cells of promoting cell responses to chemoattractants produced in lesions of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases in the brain.

Colombres M. Nunez M.T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), in particular 42 amino acids (Aβ42). Senile plaques are considered the foci of local inflammatory responses in AD brain, as evidenced by the presence of increased levels of acute phase proteins, pro-inflammatory cytokines, complement components, and proteases (2Eikelenboom P.

In addition, senile plaques are surrounded and often infiltrated by microglia, the monocytic phagocytes in the brain. Activated microglia in AD are thought to be major producers of proinflammatory mediators and neurotoxins (5Iribarren P. Zhou Y. Hu J. Le Y. Wang J.M. Immunol. Res. 2005; 31: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These cells have also been implicated in either promoting Aβ plaque formation or clearance under different experimental conditions (6Wegiel J. Wang K.C. Tarnawski M. Lach B.

Aβ42 has been reported to interact with microglial cells through several purported cell surface receptors (5Iribarren P. Zhou Y. Hu J. Le Y. Wang J.M. Immunol. Res. 2005; 31: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Among those, the G protein-coupled formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) and its mouse homologue mFPR2 have been shown to mediate the chemotactic activity of Aβ42 for cells of the myeloid lineage, including microglia, and thus may be involved in the recruitment of microglial cells in lesions of AD brain (10Tiffany H.L.

In human macrophages, FPRL1 has also been shown to be crucial for Aβ42 uptake, a process important for Aβ42 aggregation and degradation (5Iribarren P. Zhou Y. Hu J. Le Y. Wang J.M. Immunol.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 7078-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, FPRL1, on cells from the neuroblastoma origin, appears to be responsible for the cytoxicity of Aβ42 (15Ying G. Iribarren P. Zhou Y. Gong W. Zhang N. Yu Z.X. Le Y. Cui Y. Wang J.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7078-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that FPRL1 may play an important role in the inflammatory amyloidosis and neurodegeneration in AD. The expression of the FPRL1 counterpart mFPR2 in mouse microglial cells is subject to regulation by proinflammatory stimulants. We reported recently that microglial cells isolated from newborn mice expressed markedly enhanced levels of mFPR2 upon activation by tumor necrosis factor-α and LPS, suggesting that microbial infection and pro-inflammatory stress may profoundly affect the pathogenic process of AD via the up-regulation of mFPR2 in microglial cells (16Cui Y.H.

Because TLR4 signals inducing mFPR2 in microglial cells play an important role in amplifying cell responses to Aβ42, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether TLR2, which is highly expressed by microglial cells, may exert stimulatory effects similar to TLR4. We report here that TLR2 in mouse microglial cells is activated by peptidoglycan (PGN), a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria. Activation of TLR2 in microglial cells induced the expression of mFPR2 by using ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK-dependent signaling pathways. In addition, microglial cells activated by TLR2 ligand exhibited a markedly increased capacity to endocytose Aβ42 through mFPR2. Reagents and Cells—PGN was purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). fMLF and LPS were purchased from Sigma. Palmitoyl-Cys((RS)-2,3-di(palmitoyloxy)-propyl)-Ala-Gly-OH (Pam-CAG) was from Bachem, King of Prussia, PA. SB202190, PD098059, and BAY117082 were obtained from Calbiochem. Mouse SDF-1α (stromal cell-derived factor 1α) was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The Aβ42 peptide was from California Peptide Research (Napa, CA). Antibodies specific for total ERK1/2, ERK1/2 phosphorylated at Tyr-204, phospho-p38 MAPK, total p38 MAPK, phosphorylated IκB, and total IκB were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Primary murine microglial cells were isolated from 1-day-old newborn C57BL/6 mice. The murine microglial cell line N9 was a kind gift from Dr. P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli (Universita Degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy). The cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol. Chemotaxis Assays—Chemotaxis assays for microglial cells were performed with 48-well chemotaxis chambers and polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size) (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) as described previously (15Ying G. Iribarren P. Zhou Y. Gong W. Zhang N. Yu Z.X. Le Y. Cui Y. Wang J.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7078-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the chemotaxis index (CI), which represents the fold increase in the number of migrated cells, counted in three high power fields (×400), in response to chemoattractants over spontaneous cell migration (to control medium). Calcium (Ca2+) Mobilization—Ca2+ mobilization was measured by incubating 20 × 106 N9 cells/ml in loading medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mm of glutamine) with 5 μl of Fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60 min at room temperature. The dye-loaded cells were washed and resuspended in saline buffer (138 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) at a density of 1 × 106/ml. The cells were then transferred into cuvettes (2 × 106 cells in 2 ml) that were placed in a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Stimulants were added in a volume of 20 μl to each cuvette, and the Ca2+ mobilization was measured by recording the ratio of the fluorescence excited at 340 and 380 nm in response to stimulants. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells with an RNeasy mini kit and depleted of contaminating DNA with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For amplification of the mFpr2 gene, primers 5′-TCTACCATCTCCAGAGTTCTGTTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACATCTACCACAATGTGAACTA-3′ (antisense) were designed to yield a 268-bp product. Specific primers for mouse Cxcr4 were as follows: 5′-GGCTGTAGAGCGAGTGTTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTAGAGGTTGACAGTGTAGAT-3′ (antisense), which yield a product of 390 bp. Mouse β-actin primers were as follows: sense, TGTGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCA, and antisense, TTTGATGTGACGCACGATTTCCC, which yield a product of 514 bp. RT-PCR was performed with 1.0 μg of total RNA for each sample (High Fidelity ProSTAR HF System, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), consisting of a 15-min reverse transcription at 37 °C, a 1-min inactivation of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 95 °C, 40 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C (45 s), annealing at 55 °C (52 °C for CXCR4) (45 s), and extension at 72 °C (1 min), with a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. All PCR products were resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. For quantitation, gels were scanned, and the pixel intensity for each band was determined using the ImageJ program (NIH Image, Bethesda, MD) and normalized to the amount of β-actin. Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy—N9 cells were seeded at 2.8 × 104 cells/well on eight-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) for 24 h. The cells were then treated at 37 °C with PGN at 20 μg/ml for 24 h. PGN-activated N9 cells were further treated in the presence or absence of G-protein receptor deactivator pertussis toxin (PTX), mFPR2 agonist W peptide, or another G-protein receptor deactivator cholera toxin, and Aβ42 (50 μg/ml) was added to the cells, which were then fixed at different time points in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and incubated with 5% normal goat serum (Sigma) in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T-NGS) for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding of antibodies to the cell surface and for cell permeabilization. An anti-Aβ42 antibody (Sigma) was applied to the slides, which were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three rinses with PBS, the slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pharmingen) in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. After three washes with PBS, the slides were stained with propidium iodide for 20 min at room temperature. The slides were mounted with an anti-fade, water-based mounting medium and analyzed under a laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss LSM510 Meta, Jena, Germany). Excitation wavelengths of 488 (for FITC) and 561 (for propidium iodide) nm were used to generate fluorescence emission in green (for Aβ42) and red (for nuclei), respectively. Flow Cytometry—Murine microglia stimulated with PGN and LPS were examined for expression of TLR2 and CD14 by labeling with phycoerythrin or FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (Pharmingen). All staining procedures were completed at 4 °C in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and 1% FCS. After extensive washing, the cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Western Immunoblotting—N9 cells were grown in 60-mm dishes until subconfluency and then were cultured overnight in FCS-free medium. After treatment with PGN, the cells were lysed with 1× SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol), sonicated for 15 s, and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (4 °C) for 5 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by Micro BCA Protein Assay System (Pierce). Western blotting of phosphorylated p38, ERK1/2, and IκB was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using phospho-specific antibodies. Briefly, proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE precast gel (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred onto ImmunoBlot polyvinylidene membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat milk and then were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the protein bands were detected with a Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and BIOMAX-MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For detection of total p38, ERK1/2, and IκB, the membranes were stripped with Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) followed by incubation with specific antibodies. Establishment of N9 Cells Stably Transfected with TLR2-Short Interference (si) RNA—The siRNA targeting mouse TLR2 in a mammalian cell expression plasmid was purchased from InvivoGen. A plasmid containing scrambled nucleotides (psiRNA-h7SKgzScr) was used as a control. N9 cells were transfected with TLR2-siRNA plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cells were selected and maintained by Zeocin (InvivoGen) at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times, and the representative results were shown. For cell migration, the significance of the difference between test and control groups was analyzed with Student's t test, and p values equal to, or less than, 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Expression of TLR2 in Microglia and the Effect of PGN—We first examined the expression of TLR2 on murine microglial cell line N9 by flow cytometry. N9 cells constitutively expressed TLR2 on the cell surface, which was enhanced by treatment with PGN (Fig. 1A). PGN also increased N9 cell expression of CD14 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that PGN promotes the differentiation of N9 microglial cells into macrophage phenotype. Similarly LPS, a TLR4 ligand, also up-regulated TLR2 and CD14 expression by microglial cells (Fig. 1). These results are in agreement with previous reports (18Kielian T. Esen N. Bearden E.D. Glia. 2005; 49: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Kielian T. Mayes P. Kielian M. J. Neuroimmunol. 2002; 130: 86-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and indicate the capacity of microglial cells to respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognized by TLRs. Expression of Functional mFPR2 by PGN-stimulated Murine microglial Cells—We next examined whether activation of TLR2 on microglial cells might promote the expression of mFPR2. The mouse microglial cell line N9 and primary microglial cells treated with PGN increased the expression of mFpr2 mRNA. The effect of PGN was concentration- and time-dependent (Fig. 2, A and B), with optimal induction of mFpr2 mRNA by PGN at 20 μg/ml for 12 h. Although nonstimulated primary microglial cells expressed a relatively higher base-line level of mFpr2 mRNA as compared with nonstimulated N9 cells, PGN treatment also significantly enhanced the level of mFpr2 mRNA (Fig. 2C). In parallel experiments, we detected the expression of the gene encoding CXCR4, a G-protein-coupled receptor for the chemokine SDF-1α, in N9 cells and primary cells. However, unlike its effect on mFpr2 mRNA, PGN did not significantly affect the mRNA level of Cxcr4 in N9 cells and primary microglial cells, suggesting that PGN selectively up-regulated the mFpr2 gene. The increased mFpr2 mRNA expression in PGN-stimulated microglial cells is associated with the acquirement of cell responsiveness to chemotactic agonist peptides for mFPR2. As shown in Fig. 3, nonstimulated N9 cells did not migrate toward a wide concentration range of fMLF (Fig. 3, A and B), a peptide derived from Gram-negative bacteria and W peptide (Fig. 3A), a well defined synthetic mFPR2 agonist (20Le Y. Murphy P.M. Wang J.M. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 541-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In contrast, these cells showed a potent chemotactic response to the chemokine SDF-1α (data not shown). However, both fMLF and W peptide induced the migration of N9 cells treated with PGN (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas PGN treatment reduced the migration of these cells to SDF-1α (data not shown). We also observed a markedly increased migration induced by Aβ42 in N9 cells treated with PGN, and the results were confirmed with primary murine microglial cells isolated from the brains of newborn mice (Fig. 3C). Similarly, primary murine microglial cells treated with PGN showed significantly increased chemotactic response to fMLF, W peptide, and Aβ42 but reduced migration to SDF-1α (Fig. 3D). To examine further the function of mFPR2 in PGN-activated microglial cells, we measured Ca2+ mobilization. The nonstimulated N9 cells only responded to the chemokine SDF-1α with increased Ca2+ flux, but not to the mFPR2 agonists. In contrast, although Ca2+ flux induced by SDF-1α was diminished in PGN-treated N9 cells, these cells showed significantly increased responses to challenge by fMLF and W peptide (Fig. 3E). To ascertain if the stimulatory activity of PGN is independent of LPS contamination, polymyxin B, a LPS inhibitor, was tested. We found that polymyxin B (10 μg/ml) did not affect PGN-induced mFpr2 mRNA expression (data not shown) and mFPR2-mediated migration of N9 cells to mFPR2 agonists, including fMLF and W peptide. In contrast, polymyxin B inhibited LPS-induced mFpr2 mRNA expression and mFPR2-mediated migration of N9 cells to mFPR2 agonists (Fig. 3F). Thus, PGN used in this study is free of LPS. These results indicate that activation of TLR2 in mouse microglial cells enhanced the expression of functional mFPR2. Increased Uptake of Aβ42 by PGN-activated Microglial Cells—We then investigated whether mFPR2 expressed by PGN-activated microglial cells mediates the internalization of Aβ42. Fig. 4A shows that N9 cells treated with PGN for 24 h increased their capacity to endocytose Aβ42 peptides as demonstrated by markedly increased Aβ42 fluorescence measured with confocal microscopy. This process was dependent on mFPR2 because PTX, an inhibitor of Gαi protein-coupled receptors and W peptide, another mFPR2 agonist, each abrogated the uptake of Aβ42 by PGN-activated microglial cells. In contrast, cholera toxin, a Gαs protein inhibitor, failed to show any inhibition of Aβ42 uptake by PGN-activated microglial cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that activation of Gαi protein coupled to mFPR2 is essential for PGN-activated microglial cells to ingest Aβ42. Requirement of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK Pathways for Induction of mFPR2 by PGN in Microglial Cells—Because the MAPK pathway has been implicated in the induction of mFPR2 in microglial cells via activation of TLR4 by LPS (16Cui Y.H. Le Y. Gong W. Proost P. Van Damme J. Murphy W.J. Wang J.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and also because PGN has been reported to increase Il-1Ra gene expression in macrophages via p38 MAPK activation (21Carl V.S. Steinke K.B. Nicklin M. Smith M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 77: 17448-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we assessed the role of MAPKs in PGN induction of mFPR2 in microglial cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, PGN induced a rapid and potent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in N9 cells. However, in cells pretreated with SB202190, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, the level of mFpr2 mRNA induced by PGN was significantly reduced (Fig. 5B), and the cells failed to migrate in response to mFPR2 agonists (Fig. 5C). PGN additionally induced increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in N9 cells (Fig. 6A), and the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 reduced the expression of mFpr2 mRNA induced by PGN with decreased cell chemotaxis to mFPR2 agonists (Fig. 6, B and C). These results indicate that p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs play an essential role in PGN induction of the mFpr2 gene and function in mouse microglial cells.FIGURE 6Involvement of ERK1/2 MAPK in PGN induction of mFPR2. A, N9 cells were cultured in the presence of PGN (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C and lysed at the indicated time points, and the cell lysates were measured for phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2. B, N9 cells were cultured in the presence of PD98059 (PD) for 1 h at 37 °C before stimulation with PGN (20 μg/ml) for an additional 24 h. Total RNA was examined for mRNA expression of mFpr2 and β-actin by RT-PCR. C, N9 cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PD98059 for 1 h at 37°C before stimulation with PGN (20 μg/ml) for an additional 24 h. The cells were examined for migration in response to fMLF (10-5 m). * indicates statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in cell migration compared with cells treated with PGN alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Requirement of NF-κB Activation in PGN Induction of mFPR2 in Microglial Cells—We further determined the activation of IκB, a regulatory molecule of NF-κB in microglial cells induced by PGN. Stimulation of N9 cells with PGN elicited a biphasic increase in IκBα phosphorylation, which peaked at 5 min followed by an apparent degradation and then a marked phosphorylation at 30 min (Fig. 7A), suggesting de novo synthesis of IκB (22Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). To study whether NF-κB activation was essential for the up-regulation of mFPR2 by PGN, N9 cells were treated with PGN in the presence of a highly selective IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor BAY117082. As shown in Fig. 7, B and C, PGN-induced mFpr2 gene expression in N9 cells and cell chemotaxis in response to mFPR2 agonists were attenuated by BAY117082. Because the phosphorylation of IκB implies release of NF-κB for nuclear translocation, our results suggest a key role for NF-κB in PGN-mediated induction of mFPR2 in mouse microglial cells. In mouse microglial cells, PGN did not increase the phosphorylation of JNK, in contrast to p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs (data not shown). Involvement of TLR2 in PGN-mediated Microglial Activation—To clarify whether PGN indeed utilized TLR2 to promote the expression of functional mFPR2 in microglial cells, we examined the effect of siRNA targeting TLR2. As shown in Fig. 8, N9 cells stably transfected with TLR2-siRNA expressed lower levels of TLR2 in the nonstimulated state as shown by moderately reduced mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on the cell surface (Fig. 8A). Upon stimulation with PGN, N9 cells containing TLR2-siRNA did not exhibit substantially increased levels of TLR2 MFI. This is in contrast to N9 cells without TLR2-siRNA, which showed a markedly increased MFI for TLR2 on the cell surface. The decreased expression of TLR2 level on PGN-stimulated N9 cells transfected with TLR2-siRNA was associated with substantially reduced expression of mFpr2 mRNA (Fig. 8B) as well as attenuated cell chemotaxis induced by the mFPR2-specific agonist peptide Aβ42 (Fig. 8C). N9 cells containing TLR2-siRNA responded normally to the TLR4 agonist LPS by exhibiting increased mFpr2 mRNA as well as Aβ42-induced cell chemotaxis (Fig. 8, B and C), indicating that TLR2 is essential for the effect of PGN on microglial cells. We also tested another reported TLR2 agonist, PamCAG, and we found that PamCAG induced the expression and function of mFPR2 in both N9 and primary microglial cells (Fig. 8, D and E). Furthermore, in HEK-293 cells transfected with mouse Tlr2 (from InvivoGen), PamCAG as well as PGN induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, a kinase well known to be a component of the TLR2 signaling cascade. These results indicate that TLR2 in microglial cells can be activated by PamCAG and PGN and thus plays an important role in the induction of mFPR2 by molecular patterns. We have shown that activation of TLR2 promoted the expression of functional mFPR2 in murine microglial cells through a MAPK-dependent signaling pathway in this study. PGN concomitantly down-regulated the chemotactic response of microglia to SDF-1α without significantly affecting the mRNA expression of the receptor CXCR4. The induction of mFPR2 by PGN in microglial cells is associated with a markedly increased Aβ42 internalization, which was inhibited by PTX and another mFPR2 agonist W peptide. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the capacity of TLR2 to potentiate the microglial interaction with Aβ42, a key pathogenic factor in AD, via the induction of the G-protein-coupled receptor mFPR2. Microglia are resident mononuclear phagocytes in the CNS and are key mediators of innate immune responses and inflammation in the brain (23Rock R.B. Genya G. Shuxian H. Wen S.S. Maxim C.

We have initially cultured human corneal endothelial cells on type IV collagen-coated dishes and, after several passages, expanded cells were then seeded onto novel temperature-responsive culture dishes. Four weeks after reaching confluence, these cultured endothelial cells were harvested as intact monolayer cell sheets by simple temperature reduction without enzymatic treatment. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that these cells were primarily hexagonal with numerous microvilli and cilia, similar to the native corneal endothelium. The Na+, K+-ATPase pump sites were located at the cell borders as in vivo. Moreover, cell densities and numbers of pump sites were identical to those of in vivo human corneal endothelium under optimized conditions. A 3H-ouabain binding analysis demonstrated a linear proportionality for cell pump density between confluent cell densities of 575 cells/mm2 and 3070 cells/mm2. We also confirmed Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the sheets in vitro. Xenograft transplantation results showed that the fabricated sheets retain their function of maintaining proper stromal hydration in vivo. We have established a regimen to culture and proliferate human corneal endothelial cells and fabricate endothelial sheets ex vivo morphologically and functionally similar to the native corneal endothelium. Our results support the value of harvested cell sheets for clinical applications in ocular reconstructive surgery in patients with ocular endothelial decompensation."

Despite the empirical correlation between the ""electron number"" of the solute and the change in strength of the material to which it is added, the mechanism responsible for softening is poorly understood. Using state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods, we studied the direct interaction of transition-metal solutes with dislocations in molybdenum. The interaction increases dramatically with increasing electron number and strongly influences the mechanisms responsible for plasticity in these materials. Our quantitative model explains solution softening of metals by using changes in energy and stress scales of plasticity from solutes."

Although many studies explored the functions of Parkin, its biochemical character is poorly understood. To address this issue, we established an E3 assay system using maltose-binding protein-fused Parkin purified from Escherichia coli.

Recessive mutations in the human PARKIN gene are the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, the common form of familial Parkinson disease (PD). 2The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein. 2The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein. It has been shown that almost 50% of patients with familial autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism carry a series of exon rearrangements or point mutations in PARKIN. Moreover, recent findings of the haploinsufficiency of parkin and S-nitrosylation also imply its association in sporadic PD (1Moore D.J. West A.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 57-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The causal gene PARKIN encodes a double RING finger protein with ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity (2Giasson B.I. Lee V.M.

Periquet M. Bonifati V. Wood N.W. De Michele G. Bonnet A.M. Fraix V. Broussolle E. Horstink M.W. Vidailhet M. Verpillat P. Gasser T. Nicholl D. Teive H. Raskin S. Rascol O. Destee A. Ruberg M.

To date, numerous biochemical studies have been performed to understand how mutations in Parkin lead to its dysfunction and to pathogenic outcome. However, because the biochemical characterization of E3 activity of Parkin has been difficult, it is still controversial whether the disease-relevant Parkin mutants lose their E3 activity or not. For example, one group of investigators implied that Parkin harboring K161N mutation loses its E3 activity (7Ren Y. Zhao J. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas another group suggested the same mutation dose not impair E3 activity (8Corti O. Hampe C. Koutnikova H. Darios F. Jacquier S.

In the case of other PD mutations, the situation is even more complex (see supplemental Table 1). Thus, the mode of Parkin-catalyzed ubiquitylation remains poorly understood to date.Little is known about the reconstituted ubiquitylating experiment using recombinant Parkin. Almost all of the biochemical analyses reported so far have been performed using in vitro translated Parkin or immunoprecipitated Parkin. However, it is difficult to avoid trace contaminants of other proteins that could physically interact with Parkin. Indeed it has been reported that Parkin interacts with other E3s such as CHIP (9Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and Nrdp1/FLRF (10Zhong L. Tan Y. Zhou A. Yu Q. Zhou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9425-9430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and thus the results of experiments using immunoprecipitated or in vitro translated Parkin require careful interpretation. To study the E3 activity of intrinsic Parkin, a biochemical approach using bacterially expressed recombinant Parkin that is free from other contaminating E3 enzyme(s) is obviously required. We thus attempted to reconstitute a sensitive E3 assay system using Parkin purified from Escherichia coli.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of Recombinant Proteins—To express Parkin in E. coli, it was important to use a modified E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon-plus (RIL) strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), because Parkin possesses many rare codons for E. coli that might cause low expression and/or amino acid misincorporation. For example, Parkin contains eight AGA codons that lead to mistranslation of lysine for arginine in E. coli (11You J. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). pMAL-p2T, in which the thrombin recognition site was inserted into pMALp2 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), was prepared to purify maltose-binding protein (MBP)-LVPRGS-Parkin. Parkin cDNAs of wild type and various mutants/deletions were subcloned into BamHI site of pMAL-p2 and pMAL-p2T. All mutants/deletions were generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (details of the plasmid construction processes can be provided upon request). All recombinant fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysate applying the method advocated by the supplier (New England BioLabs) using a column buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ZnSO4. The eluted fraction containing 10 mm maltose was not dialyzed because Parkin tends to lose its E3 activity during dialysis. Instead, it was subjected to the ubiquitylation assay directly. We attempted to purify sole IBR-RING2 region of Parkin also by splitting MBP-IBR-RING2 (see “Results”). Specifically, we added E2, various detergents and stabilizers during the cleavage process expecting that they solubilize and/or stabilize free IBR-RING2 in solution. Even in all the above experimental conditions, however, we could not obtain soluble-free IBR-RING2 (data not shown). Six histidine-tagged proteins such as Uev1/Ubc13 were purified by the conventional method and dialyzed by a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Glycerol of 6% was added as a stabilizer for preservation of recombinant MBP-Parkin and E2 proteins at –80 °C.In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—The in vitro ubiquitylation assay was performed as described previously (12Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Imai N. Matsuda N. Tanaka K. Nakano A. Matsumoto S. Kang W. J.

Briefly, the purified MBP-Parkin (20 μg of MBP-Parkin/ml) was incubated in a reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm ATP) with 50 μg of ubiquitin/ml (Sigma), 1.6 μg of recombinant mouse E1/ml and 20 μg of purified E2 or 100 μg of various E2-expressing E. coli lysate/ml at 32 °C for 2 h and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-MBP antibody (New England BioLabs), anti-parkin (1A1) antibody (15Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Yoshikawa M. Kitada T. Matsumine H. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Yamamura Y. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), or anti-ubiquitin antibody (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). In some cases, GST-ubiquitin or methylated ubiquitin (BostonBiochem, Cambridge, MA) was used instead of native ubiquitin. The subsequent thrombin cleavage was performed by incubation on ice for 3 h in the presence of thrombin and 2 mm CaCl2.RESULTSAutoubiquitylation by MBP-Parkin Fusion Protein—In 2001, Rankin et al. (16Rankin C.A. Joazeiro C.A. Floor E. Hunter T. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 8: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Parkin purified from E. coli possesses E3 activity. However, we found that the E3 activity of this GST-Parkin is very weak (Fig. 1F), and thus there is a need for a more sensitive E3 assay system for bacterially expressed recombinant Parkin. During studies of other RING finger proteins, we recognized the superiority of the MBP-tag relative to GST-tag in purifying RING finger proteins that retain their E3 activities (12Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Imai N. Matsuda N. Tanaka K. Nakano A. Matsumoto S. Kang W. J.

Plant J. 2002; 30: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and hence decided to use MBP-Parkin. MBP-Parkin was purified using a modified E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon-plus-RIL (Fig. 1A) and then incubated with ATP, ubiquitin, E1, and one of the E2 enzymes indicated in Fig. 1B, and we subjected it to immunoblotting with anti-MBP antibody. High molecular mass ladders derived from autoubiquitylation (see below) were observed when MBP-Parkin was incubated with Ubc7, UbcH7, and Uev1-Ubc13 (Fig. 1B, highlighted by the solid circles). Note that the slower migrating bands of more than 160 kDa observed even at reaction time zero (Fig. 1B, asterisks) or without ubiquitin (Fig. 1, A and C, asterisks) are derived from MBP-Parkin oligomerization. To test whether the modification acquired by MBP-Parkin is due to ubiquitylation, the same reaction products were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody. When Ubc7 was used as E2 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–6), only modified MBP-Parkin was detected by anti-ubiquitin antibody (lane 6, double asterisks), indicating that the modification acquired by MBP-Parkin was indeed autoubiquitylation. When Uev1-Ubc13 was used, a polyubiquitylation signal was observed even in the absence of MBP-Parkin (Fig. 1D, lanes 9 and 10), because Uev1-Ubc13 complex itself can catalyze polyubiquitin chain formation (19Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Also in this case, modified MBP-Parkin reacted with anti-ubiquitin antibody, confirming the above conclusion (see Fig. 1D, double asterisks in lane 12; note that the difference between lanes 10 and 12 corresponds to the autoubiquitylation signal of MBP-Parkin). Moreover, the replacement of ubiquitin with GST-ubiquitin retarded the mobility of these ladders (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4), and the exclusion of ubiquitin completely quenched such ladders (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Based on these results, we concluded that MBP-Parkin catalyzes autoubiquitylation in cooperation with Ubc7, UbcH7, and Uev1-Ubc13. Interestingly, autoubiquitylation became evident when the pH of the reaction buffer was increased to 8.0 and 8.8, indicating that Parkin prefers weak alkaline conditions to exhibit its E3 activity in vitro (Fig. 1E). Because MBP-Parkin possesses stronger E3 activity than GST-Parkin, as shown in Fig. 1F, we used MBP-Parkin in the following experiments.Fused MBP Is a Good Pseudo-substrate to Monitor E3 Activity of Parkin—We next determined whether the MBP portion or Parkin portion (or both) is ubiquitylated. To check this, we purified MBP-LVPRGS-Parkin, in which a thrombin-digestion sequence is inserted between MBP and Parkin. As depicted in Fig. 2A, if the MBP moiety is ubiquitylated, its molecular weight would increase by ubiquitylation and subsequent digestion, but if not ubiquitylated, its molecular weight would remain unchanged. First we tried to split MBP-LVPRGS-Parkin by thrombin; however, this recombinant protein was hardly digested for some unknown reason (data not shown). We next fused the C-terminal IBR-RING2 region of Parkin to MBP-LVPRGS (hereafter dubbed IBR-RING2, see Fig. 4A), and this construct was cleaved moderately (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). When IBR-RING2 was subjected to an ubiquitylation assay and subsequently separated into MBP and IBR-RING2 portions by thrombin digestion, the molecular weight of MBP moiety was clearly increased (see the asterisks in Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4), meaning that the MBP portion is ubiquitylated. Does this result mean that bacterial MBP protein is the substrate for Parkin? The answer is no. When sole MBP protein was incubated with IBR-RING2, this free MBP was not ubiquitylated at all, even though IBR-RING2 was autoubiquitylated as described (Fig. 2, compare C with B). This result indicates that the IBR-RING2 region of Parkin ubiquitylates fused-MBP, but not unbound MBP, and strongly suggests that Parkin recognizes MBP as a substrate not because of its amino acid sequence but because of its physical vicinity to Parkin. As depicted in Fig. 2D, when the same experiment was repeated using an anti-Parkin antibody, the molecular weight of the IBR-RING2 moiety was also increased meaning that both MBP and IBR-RING2 portions were ubiquitylated (Fig. 2E). Although many putative substrates of Parkin have been reported, the lack of a good in vitro substrate makes any biochemical study difficult. Our study revealed that fused MBP could be a good pseudo-substrate to monitor the E3 activity of Parkin.FIGURE 2In-frame-fused MBP can be a good pseudosubstrate of Parkin. A, a schematic diagram of Parkin catalyzed ubiquitylation of MBP. If the MBP portion is ubiquitylated, a change in its mobility would be recognized by immunoblotting after cleavage. B, the MBP-(IBR-RING2) fused protein (see Fig. 4) was subjected to in vitro ubiquitylation, subsequent cleavage into MBP moiety, and immunoblotting with anti-MBP antibody. The MBP portion of IBR-RING2 was ubiquitylated (asterisks). C, MBP can be ubiquitylated only when it is in the physical vicinity of Parkin. Note that free MBP in solution was not ubiquitylated. D, a schematic diagram of Parkin-catalyzed autoubiquitylation. E, IBR-RING2 portion is also ubiquitylated. Asterisks in lane 4 show the ubiquitylated IBR-RING2 moiety (compare lane 4 with 2).

Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We confirmed that our Uev1-Ubc13 complex is functional (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 1A). Motivated by the findings that Parkin catalyzes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation (20Doss-Pepe E.W. Chen L. Madura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Lim K.L. Chew K.C. Tan J.M. Wang C. Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Tanaka Y. Smith W. Engelender S. Ross C.A.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2002-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and Parkin cooperates with Uev1-Ubc13 in our assay (Fig. 1B), we investigated the mode of Parkin-catalyzed ubiquitylation. Parkin could either catalyze multiple monoubiquitylation, Lys-48-linked polyubiquitylation, or Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation. Lys-48-linked polyubiquitylation has been studied most and it essentially directs the substrate to degradation by the proteasome. In contrast, the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation and monoubiquitylation serve as a signal other than proteasomal-proteolysis (22Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 23Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 24Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We first used methylated ubiquitin (hereafter referred to as Met-Ub) in which all lysine residues are blocked by methylation and is incapable of polyubiquitylation. If Parkin catalyzes polyubiquitylation, the use of Met-Ub would shorten the ladder of ubiquitylation but if not, the ubiquitylation pattern would remain unchanged. Unexpectedly, the use of Met-Ub and Uev1-Ubc13 did not change the ubiquitylation pattern, indicating that Parkin catalyzes multiple monoubiquitylation in vitro (Fig. 3A). The same result was observed when Ubc7 was used as E2 (Fig. 3B), and these results were more evident when IBR-RING2 (Fig. 4A) was utilized (Fig. 3, C and D). Repeated experiments using lysine-less ubiquitin, in which all lysine residues were changed to arginine, showed it cannot form a polyubiquitin chain, again confirmed the consequence (Fig. 3E). It is noteworthy that sole Ubc13 itself assisted autoubiquitylation of Parkin as well as the Uev1-Ubc13 complex (supplemental Fig. 1B), again supporting this conclusion. These results allowed us to conclude that the mode of ubiquitylation catalyzed by intrinsic Parkin in vitro is multiple monoubiquitylation rather than polyubiquitylation (see “Discussion”).FIGURE 3Parkin catalyzes multiple monoubiquitylation. A and B, in vitro ubiquitylation assay was performed in the absence (–) or presence of ubiquitin (Ub) or methylatedubiquitin (Met-Ub; cannot form polyubiquitylation chain). Uev1-Ubc13 was used as E2 in A and Ubc7 in B. Almost identical ubiquitylation patterns were observed in Ub and Met-Ub, indicating that Parkin catalyzes multiple monoubiquitylation. C and D, the result was more evident when IBR-RING2 (see Fig. 4) was utilized. Uev1-Ubc13 was used as E2 in C and Ubc7 in D. E, the same experiment was performed using lysine-less ubiquitin.

However, it is still contentious whether Parkin with PD-causing mutation loses its E3 activity or not (see supplemental Table 1), primarily because of the absence of a sensitive E3-activity assay system using recombinant Parkin. To settle this problem, we examined the E3 activity of MBP-Parkin harboring various mutations and deletions. Three in-frame exonic deletions and 19 PD-linked mutations distributed throughout Parkin were selected (Fig. 4A). In addition, two Parkin species, one lacks its Ubl domain (ΔUbl) and the other possesses only C-terminally IBR-RING2 domain (IBR-RING2), were also generated. When these MBP-Parkin mutants were incubated with Ubc7 as E2, only mutations neighboring the second RING finger motif (Fig. 4A, solid circles) abolished the E3 activity completely (Fig. 4B). A nonsense mutation lacking the rear RING finger motif had no E3 activity and sole IBR-RING2 retained the E3 activity (Fig. 4, light gray circles), indicating that the second RING finger motif is the catalytic core for the E3 activity of Parkin. Contrary to what was assumed, all disease-relevant mutations other than those in RING2 still possessed E3 activities equivalent to that of the wild-type Parkin (Fig. 4B). The same results were observed when UbcH7 or Uev1-Ubc13 was used as E2 (data not shown). In these assays, we used a bacterially expressed recombinant Parkin, and to our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence that E3 activity of the strictly pure Parkin harboring various pathogenic mutations is not compromised.DISCUSSIONTo date, numerous biochemical studies have been performed to understand the E3 activity of Parkin. However, it is difficult to rule out the possible involvement of other E3s (see Introduction). Furthermore, the lack of a good model substrate spurs the difficulty to check the intrinsic E3 activity of Parkin. We thus set up a sensitive E3 assay system using bacterially expressed recombinant Parkin. Our assay system has some advantages; namely, we can obtain a large quantity of MBP-Parkin with higher E3 activity than GST-Parkin (Fig. 1). In addition, this fusion protein was already primed for ubiquitylation even in the absence of model substrate, because fused MBP can work as a good pseudo-substrate (Fig. 2). More importantly, because MBP-Parkin is purified from E. coli, it is free from possible contamination of other E3(s). The establishment of this assay allowed us to perform a thorough biochemical characterization of Parkin protein.Interestingly, sole Parkin catalyzes multiple monoubiquitylation in vitro (Fig. 3). Moreover, although Doss-Pepe et al. (20Doss-Pepe E.W. Chen L. Madura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) reported that Parkin accelerates polyubiquitin chain formation, the MBP-Parkin in our assay did not stimulate the assembly of polyubiquitin chain (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 4 and 6, and 10 and 12, respectively). These results seemingly suggest that the ubiquitylation catalyzed by Parkin functions not for proteasomal degradation but for non-proteasomal-proteolytic function(s), such as transcriptional regulation and/or membrane trafficking in vivo. However, it is still premature to make such conclusion. Although we showed that pure Parkin catalyzes multiple monoubiquitylation in vitro (Fig. 3), some additional factor(s) like E4 can work together in vivo, and this needs to be considered. E4 can extend the ubiquitin chain by recognizing the ubiquitin moiety of a ubiquitylated-protein as a substrate (25Richly H. Rape M. Braun S. Rumpf S. Hoege C. Jentsch S. Cell. 2005; 120: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). If such an E4-like factor(s) cooperates with Parkin in vivo, it is still possible that monoubiquitylation catalyzed by Parkin is used as the scaffold for further polyubiquitylation and finally functions for proteasomal degradation. All things considered, further studies are obviously required; in particular, the authentic substrate and the function of Parkin-catalyzed ubiquitylation need to be addressed.Another unexpected result was that most of the PD-relevant missense mutations do not abrogate E3 activity of Parkin (Fig. 4). Only missense mutations in the rear RING finger motif abolished the E3 activity, revealing that not the first but the second RING finger motif is the catalytic core of Parkin. Recently, several studies that focused on the pathophysiological mechanisms of Parkin have been published (26Cookson M.R. Lockhart P.J. McLendon C. O'Farrell C. Schlossmacher M. Farrer M.J. Hum. Mol.

Although our results on enzymatic activities of mutant Parkin are not fully consistent with previous reports (see supplemental Table 1), methodological differences in the E3 assay may account for the conflicting observation. For example, in one study immunoprecipitated Parkin was used as the source of E3 in vitro (31Staropoli J.F. McDermott C. Martinat C. Schulman B. Demireva E. Abeliovich A. Neuron. 2003; 37: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and in other studies, E3 activity of Parkin was checked by whether or not coexpression of Parkin in cells enhances the ubiquitylation of the putative substrate (7Ren Y. Zhao J. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sriram S.R. Li X. Ko H.S. Chung K.K. Wong E. Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2571-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although there is little discrepancy, recent studies and our present work drew the same conclusion that the dysfunction of Parkin is not simply attributable to catalytic impairment of its E3 activity. Indeed, several missense mutations cause Parkin to be sequestered into an aggresome-like structure, and this phenomenon may be involved in disease pathogenesis (27Gu W.J. Corti O. Araujo F. Hampe C.

We think that disease-relevant mutations cause not only attenuation of E3 activity but also a variety of primary defects such as sequestration into aggresome and dissociation from its partner protein, and possibly a complex of such defects may eventually lead to Parkin dysfunction and autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism.PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and thus, analysis of Parkin is important in terms of public welfare. Indeed, a large number of articles on Parkin have been published; however, because of fierce scientific competition, not all Parkin-related phenomena were critically scrutinized although there remains room for close examination. For example, Pawlyk et al. (32Pawlyk A.C. Giasson B.I. Sampathu D.M. Perez F.A. Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Palmiter R.D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol.

Upon intoxication, the NMJ enlarges and has a reduced content of synaptic vesicles, and primary neuronal cultures show synaptic swelling with surface exposure of the lumenal domain of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin I. Concomitantly, these neurotoxins induce exocytosis of neurotransmitters. We found that an equimolar mixture of lysophospholipids and fatty acids closely mimics all of the biological effects of SPANs. These results draw attention to the possible role of local lipid changes in synaptic vesicle release and provide new tools for the study of exocytosis."

This led to the hypothesis that a hexosaminidase acts during the course of N-glycan maturation. To determine whether the Drosophila melanogaster genome indeed encodes such an enzyme, a cDNA corresponding to fused lobes (fdl), a putative β-N-acetylglucosaminidase with a potential transmembrane domain, was cloned. When expressed in Pichia pastoris, the enzyme exhibited a substrate specificity similar to that previously described for a hexosaminidase activity from Sf-9 cells, i.e. it hydrolyzed exclusively the GlcNAc residue attached to the α1,3-linked mannose of the core pentasaccharide of N-glycans. It also hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-glucosaminide, but not chitooligosaccharides; in contrast, Drosophila HEXO1 and HEXO2 expressed in Pichia cleaved both these substrates but not N-glycans. The localization of recombinant FDL tagged with green fluorescent protein in Drosophila S2 cells by immunoelectron microscopy showed that this enzyme transits through the Golgi, is present on the plasma membrane and in multivesicular bodies, and is secreted. Finally, the N-glycans of two lines of fdl mutant flies were analyzed by mass spectrometry and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The ratio of structures with terminal GlcNAc over those without (i.e. paucimannosidic N-glycans) was drastically increased in the fdl-deficient flies. Therefore, we conclude that the fdl gene encodes a novel hexosaminidase responsible for the occurrence of paucimannosidic N-glycans in Drosophila.

Insect cells are considered to be an interesting alternative to mammalian, yeast, or bacterial cells for the expression of recombinant proteins (1Altmann F. Staudacher E. Wilson I.B.H. März L.

Biotechnol. 2000; 16: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), because the potentially high levels of expression are associated with the ability to perform many eukaryotic post-translational modifications. Nevertheless, glycoproteins produced in insects and insect cells have been mainly found to carry paucimannosidic N-glycans, i.e. glycans consisting of the pentasaccharide core with or without α1,6- and/or α1,3-linked fucose (1Altmann F.

In addition to the possible presence of the immunogenic core α1,3-linked fucose, the lack of complex type N-glycans with complete, sialylated antennae as found on mammalian glycoproteins makes insect cells unsuitable for the production of many therapeutic glycoproteins (6Tomiya N. Betenbaugh M.J. Lee Y.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Only in a few cases have substitutions of the terminal mannose residues of insect N-glycans been described. The most common substitution is the presence of terminal GlcNAc on the α1,3-linked mannosyl residue (GlcNAc-1) 3The abbreviations used are: GlcNAc-1, the non-reducing terminal GlcNAc on the α1,3-linked mannosyl residue of the N-glycans core; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; RT, reverse transcription; GlcNAc3-PA, GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc-PA; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; GFP, green fluorescent protein; pNP, p-nitrophenyl; NACS, mannosamine, 6-acetamido-6-deoxycastanospermine. added by GlcNAc-transferase I, although in a few cases further modifications such as galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, and aminoethylphosphonate (i.e. phosphorylethanolamine) have been found linked to this GlcNAc residue (7Wagner R.

Chem. 2001; 382: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In most instances, however, the α1,3-linked mannosyl residue was found as terminal residue, even though the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of other features of the glycan structures found in insects require the presence of GlcNAc-1. Indeed in Sf-9 cells, in the same way as previously found in mammals (12Schachter H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), all the activities of relevant enzymes such as α-mannosidase II (13Altmann F. März L. Glycoconj.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were found to depend upon this GO signal; similar results have been obtained with recombinant forms of the Drosophila core α1,3- and α1,6-fucosyltransferases FucTA and FucT6 (5Fabini G.

Wilson I.B.H. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of significant levels of the GlcNAc-transferase I has been demonstrated in several insect cell lines (15Altmann F. Kornfeld G. Dalik T. Staudacher E. Glössl J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas the Drosophila GlcNAc-transferase I cDNA has been cloned and shown to encode an active enzyme (17Sarkar M. Schachter H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was therefore hypothesized that in insect cells, as in plant cells, the GlcNAc-1 is cleaved off at some stage. In the case of phytohemagglutinin, it appears that removal of GlcNAc residues occurs after the arrival of the protein in the vacuoles of the plant cell (18Vitale A. Chrispeels M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, it appears that in plants only proteins resident in the glycosidase-rich vacuolar compartment lack the GlcNAc-1 residue, whereas in insects this residue is absent from the vast majority of glycoproteins, including those that are secreted (19Kim Y.K. Shin H.S. Tomiya N. Lee Y.C. Betenbaugh M.J. Cha H.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2005; 92: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus hexosaminidase trimming could constitute a regular and deliberate event during glycoprotein maturation occurring within the insect secretory pathway. In fact, in 1995, Sf-9 cells (as well as Bm-N and MB0503 cells) were reported to contain a membrane-bound N-acetylglucosaminidase possibly residing in the Golgi apparatus (20Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glössl J. März L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this enzyme could not hydrolyze Man5Gn, 4Abbreviations of N-glycan structures (GnGn, MMF6, etc.) are explained in Fig. 3. but acted only further “downstream” on MGn and GnGn where it specifically removed GlcNAc-1 (20Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glössl J. März L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) corroborated the putative existence of a processing hexosaminidase. It is obvious, therefore, that this enzyme interferes in strategies to produce glycoproteins with human-like glycosylation in insect cells. Various attempts have been made to overcome this problem. For instance, the heterologous overexpression of mammalian GlcNAc-transferase I was performed, but, because of the competition with the endogenous hexosaminidase, most of the N-glycans still did not carry GlcNAc-1 (24Wagner R. Liedtke S. Kretzschmar E. Geyer H. Geyer R. Klenk H.D. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Another approach is to overexpress β1,4-galactosyltransferase (25Hollister J. Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Conradt H. Jarvis D.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15093-15104Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which has the effect of “capping” the substrate for the hexosaminidase, or to inhibit the latter using inhibitors (26Donaldson M. Wood H.A. Kulakosky P.C. Shuler M.L. Biotechnol. Prog. 1999; 15: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the most elegant approach would be to specifically knock down or knock out the hexosaminidase gene. To perform any specific ablation of the hexosaminidase, it is necessary to identify the relevant gene. To this end, we have identified and recombinantly expressed the three obvious homologues of family 20 glycohydrolases in the fruit fly. Furthermore, we have determined the substrate specificity, molecular function, and subcellular localization of one of them, which we conclude to be the D. melanogaster processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Fly Strains—The wild-type flies used in this study were of the Canton Special (CS) strain. The hypomorphic fdl mutant, due to the insertion of a transposable P-element, was recovered after a screen for adult brain anatomical mutants (27Boquet I. Hitier R. Dumas M. Chaminade M. Préat T. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Df(2R)achi2 strain, which lacks six genes, including fdl (28Ayyar S. Jiang J. Collu A. White-Cooper H. White R.A. Development. 2003; 130: 2841-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Robert A. H. White. Cloning and Expression of cDNAs Encoding N-Acetylglucosaminidases from Drosophila—The sequences encoding the putative Drosophila N-acetylglucosaminidases were found by searching for homologues of human lysosomal hexosaminidase within assembled gene products of the Drosophila genome data base (www.flybase.org/). The predictions of the subcellular location and transmembrane topology were performed using, respectively, WoLF PSORT (wolfpsort.seq.cbrc.jp) and TMPRED (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html) (29Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from Drosophila S2 cells using TRIzol reagent, and RT-PCR was performed using Expand polymerase (Roche Applied Science). For the soluble form of FDL (amino acids 30-660), the primers 5′-GGAATTCCAAGGAGTCACCAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTCAAATGCATTCGC-3′ were used; for HEXO1 and HEXO2, the primer pairs 5′-GGAATTCAGCTCGGATGACTTGGTTTAC-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTCAGGCAGAGAGCGTTGTG-3′ or 5′-GGAATTCGATGACGTCGGCAGC-3′ and 5′-TCCCCGCGGGGATTAGAGGCACTGT-3′, respectively, were employed. The PCR products were digested with the relevant restriction enzymes and cloned into the pPICZαA expression vector (Invitrogen). The integrity and reading frames of the constructs, as well as 5′- and 3′-ends of full-length RT-PCR products, were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator Sequencing Ready Mix and ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Nucleic acid sequences were analyzed using NCBI BLAST and BLAST2 programs (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Predicted protein sequences were aligned and phylogenetically analyzed using Multalin (prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html) (30Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4343) Google Scholar). The hexosaminidase homologues were then expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 as previously described for various glycosyltransferases (31Bencúrová M. Rendic D. Fabini G. Kopecky E.M. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Assay of Recombinant N-Acetylglucosaminidase Activity—The supernatants of yeast expressing soluble forms of the N-acetylglucosaminidases were incubated with the different substrates at 37 °C for 1-20 h. For experiments with p-nitrophenyl-GlcNAc, the substrate concentration was 5 mm in a total volume of 0.04 ml of 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer at pH 3-8. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.26 ml of 0.4 m glycine/NaOH buffer at pH 10.4, and absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a microtiter plate reader. Pyridylaminated oligosaccharides were used at a final concentration of 0.1 mm in a total volume of 0.02 ml of 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer at pH 3-8. Incubation was terminated by the addition of 0.18 ml of 20 mm ice-cold sodium borate. Aliquots of 0.05 ml were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (15Altmann F. Kornfeld G. Dalik T. Staudacher E. Glössl J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glössl J. März L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Analysis of N-Glycan of Wild-type and Mutant Drosophila—Adult flies, either Canton S wild-type (0.65 g), fdl mutant (0.41g), or Df(2R)achi2 (0.107 g), were collected and anesthetized with CO2 before addition of 4 ml of water and boiling for 10 min. The preparation of N-glycans was then performed basically as previously described (32Altmann F. Fabini G. Ahorn H. Wilson I.B.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using peptide N-glycosidase A digestion of peptic peptides. The released glycans were dried and suspended in water prior to either analysis of the underivatized N-glycans by MALDI-TOF MS or pyridylamination, which was performed according to Yamamoto et al. (33Yamamoto S. Hase S. Fukuda S. Sano O. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the case of fdl mutant, pyridylaminated oligosaccharides were then fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography as previously described (20Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glössl J. März L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected, dried, resuspended in water, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. For both underivatized and pyridylaminated N-glycans, MALDI-TOF MS was performed using a linear instrument (Dynamo, ThermoBioanalysis) using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix. Immunoelectron Microscopy—The full-length fdl cDNA was cloned in-frame with a gfp sequence at the 3′-end into a derivative of the pRMHA3 vector, which includes a metallothionein promoter. Drosophila S2 cells were then transfected using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol for adherent cells with minor modifications. The cells (4 × 105 cells per 35-mm well) were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid using 16 μl of Enhancer solution and 50 μl of Effectene reagent. 48 h post-transfection, CuSO4 was added to 1 mm final concentration, and cells were induced for 18 h followed by a 2-h chase. Medium was then aspirated, and the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and processed for immunoelectron microscopy as described earlier (34Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). 60- to 80-nm cryosections were cut on an UltraS (Leica) and immunolabeled using the anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) followed by protein A conjugated to 10 nm gold particles. Identification and Cloning of Drosophila N-Acetylglucosaminidases— Our hypothesis was that the putative insect Golgi hexosaminidase would be homologous to known hexosaminidases. Thus we performed tBLASTn searches of the Drosophila genome and found three obvious fly homologues (CG1318, CG1787, and CG8824) of the human lysosomal hexosaminidases HEXA and HEXB. Indeed, these homologues have been previously assigned to the glycohydrolase family 20 in the CAZy data base (35Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). The first two have been previously named HEXO1 and HEXO2, encoded by genes localized on chromosomes 3L and X, respectively, and seem to be most related to a chitooligosaccharidolytic β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Bombyx mori (36Nagamatsu Y. Yanagisawa I. Kimoto M. Okamoto E. Koga D. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and possibly correspond to two proteins with both β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity purified from Drosophila sperm (37Cattaneo F. Ogiso M. Hoshi M. Perotti M.E. Pasini M.E. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 929-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The third sequence is encoded by the recently identified fdl gene, located on chromosome 2R, so named because of the mushroom body fused lobes phenotype of the corresponding Drosophila mutant (27Boquet I. Hitier R. Dumas M. Chaminade M. Préat T. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Subsequently, all three cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from Drosophila S2 cells. The RT-PCR products were of the expected size (∼2000 bp), and sequencing revealed no differences between the PCR product and the data bank sequences. The fdl cDNA contains a predicted open-reading frame encoding a protein of 660 amino acids (Mr 75,485). The comparison of the cDNA sequence with that of the corresponding genome sequence indicates that the fdl open reading frame spans five exons. On the other hand, hexo1 and hexo2 share a common open reading frame organization with only three exons and both encode proteins of around Mr 70,000. At the amino acid level, the Drosophila FDL sequence, which is predicted to be a type II transmembrane protein, shares 33% amino acid sequence identity and 64% sequence similarity with the fly HEXO1 and 31% sequence identity and 62% sequence similarity with the fly HEXO2 (Fig. 1). The predictions by WoLF PSORT would suggest that both HEXO1 and FDL are plasma membrane proteins, whereas HEXO2 is most likely to be secreted. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that amongst insect hexosaminidases there are two major groups. The first is composed of enzymes related to the aforementioned β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from B. mori (36Nagamatsu Y. Yanagisawa I. Kimoto M. Okamoto E. Koga D. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and includes DmHEXO1 as well as DmHEXO2. The second group contains the homologues of DmFDL for which we could find predicted sequences from honeybee Apis mellifera, tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans, and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Fig. 2). Of all the available putative insect N-acetylglucosaminidase sequences, FDL is most similar to the incomplete mosquito sequence, AgFDL, sharing 64% sequence identity and 90% sequence similarity over a stretch of 449 amino acids. All insect hexosaminidase sequences are phylogenetically distant from the lysosomal mammalian hexosaminidases (38Wang A.M. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21859-21866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and even more distant from the group of NagA hexosaminidases previously characterized in fungi (39Matsuo I. Kim S. Yamamoto Y. Ajisaka K. Maruyama J.I. Nakajima H. Kitamoto K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2003; 67: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Phylogenetic tree of the hexosaminidase family.

Similarly, the two other Drosophila N-acetylglucosaminidase homologues, HEXO1 and HEXO2, were also expressed as soluble forms in P. pastoris lacking, respectively, the N-terminal 22 and 35 amino acids. In an initial screen, the culture supernatants of transformed yeast were tested for their hexosaminidase activity using p-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide and indeed all three homologues utilized this substrate. A Myc-tagged form of FDL (estimated Mr 70,000) was also active when expressed in insect cells, as judged by a 4-fold increase in the cleavage of pNP-GlcNAc and GnGn-PA in comparison to mock-transfected cells (data not shown). To determine the specificities toward natural substrates, the enzymatic activities of HEXO1, HEXO2, and FDL were subsequently evaluated by reversed-phase HPLC with N-glycans, such as GnGn-PA (see Fig. 3 for structure). Based on previous analyses (40Tomiya N. Lee Y.C. Yoshida T. Wada Y. Awaya J. Kurono M. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the removal of the GlcNAc residue from the α1,3-arm to generate GnM is predicted to result in a shift to longer retention times, whereas removal of the residue from the α1,6-arm to generate MGn causes a reduction in retention time as compared with GnGn. After 1 h of incubation of FDL with this substrate, a small peak of greater retention time could be observed that co-eluted with a GnM standard (Fig. 4C); after 16 h the reaction was complete (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, the formation of GnM-PA was not observed when the supernatant of untransformed P. pastoris was used in the reaction (Fig. 4A), indicating that the conversion observed is due to the recombinantly expressed protein. Furthermore, there is no formation by FDL of either MM-PA or MGn-PA from GnGn-PA, which illustrates its branch specificity and its ability to remove exclusively the GlcNAc linked to the α1,3-mannose residue of the core structure. A mass spectrometric assay was used to demonstrate that a single GlcNAc residue was removed by FDL; using a dabsylated GnGn glycopeptide as substrate, a reduction in m/z of 203 Da, which is equivalent to one GlcNAc residue, was observed (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the recombinant Drosophila FDL N-acetylglucosaminidase specifically removed the GlcNAc residue linked to the α1,3-mannose from the biantennary oligosaccharide. This is consistent with the previous data on the insect Golgi hexosaminidase (20Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glössl J. März L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to data on the Sf-9 microsomal hexosaminidase activity, FDL did not digest chitotriose, as judged by an HPLC-based assay using chitotriose-PA (GlcNAc3-PA) as substrate. This discrepancy might be due to the presence of a distinct hexosaminidase activity in the Sf9 microsome preparation. Our present results, therefore strongly indicate that FDL is not involved in chitin degradation. On the other hand, both HEXO1 and HEXO2 displayed chitotriose-degrading activity. All assays performed consistently indicated that N-glycans are not substrates for either HEXO1 or HEXO2 (data not shown). This result was expected considering their close relationship to the B. mori hexosaminidase (36Nagamatsu Y. Yanagisawa I. Kimoto M. Okamoto E. Koga D. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As a result of the data showing that only FDL possessed the activity most reminiscent of the Golgi hexosaminidase from Sf9 cells, we concentrated our subsequent studies on this protein. The recombinant FDL was, therefore, tested for its ability to degrade an extended range of substrates such as GnM-PA, MGn-PA, pNP-GalNAc, and pNP-GlcNAc under different pH conditions (Fig. 5). Amongst the oligosaccharide substrates, GnGn-PA was found to be the most suitable substrate, followed by MGn-PA, whereas GnM was not digested. Other data indicated that FDL did not degrade Man5Gn-PA, thus illustrating that FDL requires the prior action of mannosidase II, whereas a dabsylated MGnF6 glycopeptide was a substrate (data not shown). This latter result shows that core fucosylation, which requires the presence of GlcNAc-1, does not prevent the action of FDL. When an artificial substrate carrying only one GlcNAc, i.e. pNP-GlcNAc, was used, the pH optimum (pH 4.5) was one unit lower than that determined when using a pyridylaminated N-glycan (pH 5.5); this is also consistent with the previous data on the insect microsomal hexosaminidase (20Altmann F.

Apatite 4 He/ 3 He thermochronometry tightly constrains the timing and rate of glacial erosion within one of the largest valleys in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. Five proximate samples require accelerated denudation of the Klinaklini Valley initiating 1.8 ± 0.2 million years ago (Ma). At least 2 kilometers of overlying rock were removed from the valley at ≥5 millimeters per year, indicating that glacial valley deepening proceeded ≥6 times as fast as erosion rates before ∼1.8 Ma.

The atherogenic potential of LDL particles at the arterial wall is expressed through a spectrum of activities, such as susceptibility to structural modification on which relies their ability to affect cellular responses, including apoptosis and gene expression (4.Kontush A.

We reported previously that diabetic LDL affects endothelial cell fate by increasing the expression of p21 (7.Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Pavan M. Rosso A. De Cesaris M.G. Garbarino G. Camussi G. Pagano G. Pegoraro L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). p21 belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors that, in concert with various tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53 and pRb, induce inhibition of DNA replication and control antiproliferative programs (8.Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). However, p21 together with the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb is not only an important mediator of quiescence-like growth arrest but also of senescence (9.Itahana K. Campisi J. Dimri G.P.

So far a large body of evidence from animal studies indicates that p21 and p53 are key modulators of neointimal lesion development by efficiently attenuating neointimal thickening (12.Andres V. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13.Tanner F.C. Yang Z.Y. Duckers E. Gordon D. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Circ.

Barr E. Lu M.M. Barton K. Leiden J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Remarkably, conditional overexpression of p21 has been reported to be associated with growth arrest and phenotypic features of senescence (16.Chang B.D. Watanabe K. Broude E.V. Fang J. Poole J.C. Kalinichenko T.V. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4291-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Moreover, senescent endothelial cells have been detected in atherosclerotic, but not in nonatherosclerotic, vessels (17.Miyauchi H. Minamino T. Tateno K. Kunieda T. Toko H. Komuro I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Vasculature remodeling does not rely exclusively on proliferation of resident endothelial cells but also involves circulating progenitor cells (EPC) (18.Hibbert B. Olsen S. O'Brien E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19.Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Recent works demonstrated that in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes, the number of EPC that can be isolated from peripheral blood is reduced, and their function is impaired (20.Hill J.M. Zalos G. Halcox J.P. Schenke W.H. Waclawiw M.A. Quyyumi A.A. Finkel T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Moreover, despite culturing EPC under normoglycemic conditions, functional differences between EPC recovered from diabetic patients and normal subjects exist (20.Hill J.M. Zalos G. Halcox J.P. Schenke W.H. Waclawiw M.A. Quyyumi A.A. Finkel T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Therefore the reduced number and the impaired function of EPC in diabetes can rely on adverse metabolic stress factors, different from hyperglycemia (21.Loomans C.J. de Koning E.J. Staal F.J. Rookmaaker M.B. Verseyden C. de Boer H.C. Verhaar M.C. Braam B. Rabelink T.J. van Zonneveld A.J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that native oxidized LDL by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production activates a cascade of molecular events that mainly contribute to accelerate atherosclerosis in diabetic patients (22.Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In vivo small and dense LDL, because of their qualitative abnormalities, are more susceptible than natural occurring LDL to undergo oxidation and to activate the oxidative stress pathways. In this study we investigated the effects of in vitro oxidized diabetic LDL on EPC fate and in particular the molecular mechanisms activated by oxidized small and dense LDL which can contribute to EPC dysfunction in diabetes. We found that in vitro oxidized small and dense diabetic LDL accelerate the onset of senescence of EPC recovered from normal subjects via a p53-mediated signaling pathway. Moreover, we demonstrate that depletion of endogenous p53 in EPC recovered from diabetic patients prevents the accelerated onset of senescence, indicating that a p53-mediated pathway contributes to the impaired EPC function in this setting. Patients and Controls—Blood from nine type 2 diabetic patients who arrived in our patient clinic (sex, M/F 4/5; HbA1c, 6.4 ± 0.6%; age-years, 50.0 ± 5; creatinine, 1 ± 1 mg/dl; no retinopathy, no hypertension: blood pressure ≤ 140/90 mm Hg; Chol/apoB, 1.3 ± 0.1). None of them was under insulin, and all were treated only with diet (no other medicaments were used by diabetic patients). Ten blood donors were used as controls (sex, M/F 5/5; HbA1c, 5 ± 01.0%; age-years, 50.0 ± 1; creatinine, 0.7 ± 0.4 mg/dl, no retinopathy, no hypertension: blood pressure ≤ 140/90 mm Hg, Chol/apoB, 1.6 ± 0.1).

Isolation, Characterization, and Oxidation of LDL—Blood from diabetic patients or healthy controls was processed according to Redgrave and Carlson (24.Redgrave T.G. Carlson L.A. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 217-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma was brought to a density of 1.10 g/ml and processed as described previously (7.Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Pavan M.

The density of the LDL was measured in the tubes where the highest levels of cholesterol were found. LDL was dialyzed against 0.02 m EDTA-free phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. LDL was adjusted to 0.2 mg/ml protein concentration. CuSO4 was added for 24 h (37 °C) at a ratio of 25 μm/mg LDL protein (25.Vedie B. Myara I. Pech M.A. Maziere J.C. Maziere C. Caprani A. Moatti N.

The pSUPER retro containing p53 siRNA and the scramble p53 siRNA were gently provided by Dr. S. Soddu. 60 h later whole cell extracts were prepared, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibody against p53. To obtain inactivation of Akt EPC cultured as above were transiently transfected with purified duplex siRNAs for Akt and for a scramble control purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine according to the vendor's instructions. Cell viability was evaluated at the end of the experiment. Flow Cytometry—EPC treated as indicated were fixed with 70% ethanol. After digestion with RNase, DNA was stained with propidium iodide and analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). In selected experiments NAC, SB203580, or LY294002 inhibitors were used. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME). FACS was used for analyzing VE-cadherin, CD146, or CD34 expression. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was used as secondary antibody. Detection of ROS—DCF-DA (20 mm final concentration) was added to EPC in the various cultured conditions. At the times indicated the cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis and processed as described previously (7.Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Pavan M. Rosso A. De Cesaris M.G. Garbarino G. Camussi G. Pagano G. Pegoraro L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α was used as positive control. A lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence assay was also performed. Briefly, EPC were resuspended in a glass tube containing phenol red-free basal medium and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min. 5 μm lucigenin and 250 μm NADPH were then added and immediately placed inside the luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold Technologies, Pforzheim, Germany). The lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence assay was measured for a 10-min period. EPC were then stimulated with saline (0.1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline), ox-dmLDL, or dm-LDL as indicated, and LDLCL was monitored for 30 min. In a few experiments 30 mm/liter NAC, 30 μm/liter DPI, or 10 μm/liter LY294002 was used. Western Blot Analysis—EPC were cultured in the presence of dmLDL or ox-dmLDL in combination with VEGF as indicated. Cells were lysed (in lysis buffer including a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 200 mm/liter sodium vanadate, and 20 μm/liter sodium fluoride), and the protein concentration was obtained as described previously (7.Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Pavan M. Rosso A. De Cesaris M.G. Garbarino G. Camussi G. Pagano G. Pegoraro L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29.Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Gambino R. Cabodi S. Cassader M. Castelli A. Defilippi P. Pegoraro L. Pagano G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3311-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 50 μg of proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. In selected experiments 10 μm/liter SB203580, 10 μm/liter LY294002, or 30 mm/liter NAC was used. To evaluate the p21 half-life EPC were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated intervals. 50 μg of whole cell lysates were prepared at each time point and assayed for the expression of p21 and β-actin by Western blotting. Reaction with antibodies and detection with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) were performed as described previously (7.Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Pavan M. Rosso A. De Cesaris M.G. Garbarino G. Camussi G. Pagano G. Pegoraro L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For dot blot experiments a sheet of nitrocellulose was clamped between the gasket and the 96-well sample template. 200 μg of LDL sample was allowed to filter through the membrane. After the antigen was immobilized, the nitrocellulose was incubated in 4% albumin blocking solution. Nitrocellulose was subsequently incubated with rabbit IgG anti-AGE at room temperature for 1.5 h and then with goat IgG anti-rabbit IgG labeled with alkaline phosphatase. Dots were visualized with the procedure contained in the Immun-Blot Assay kit (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Angiogenesis—EPC cultured with dmLDL or ox-dmLDL were prelabeled with a permanent green fluorescent dye (PKH2 from Sigma). In vitro angiogenesis was studied on Matrigel-coated surface as described by Montesano and Orci (30.Montesano R. Orci L. Cell. 1985; 42: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). VEGF was added to the medium or incorporated into the Matrigel. To evaluate cell viability, trypan blue exclusion staining was used (31.Brizzi M.F. Battaglia E. Montrucchio G. Dentelli P. Del Sorbo L. Garbarono G. Pegoraro L. Camusi G. Circ. Res. 1999; 8: 785-796Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In vitro angiogenesis was expressed as the percentage ± S.D. of the tube-like structure area to the total Matrigel area. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed accordingly to standard methods (32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The filter was hybridized to 32P-random priming-labeled cDNA probes corresponding to cyclin D1, p21, and β-actin. EPC Senescence—Senescence was evaluated on EPC recovered from normal subjects cultured for 15 days with VEGF plus dmLDL or with ox-dmLDL or on EPC recovered from diabetic patients after 10 days of culture in EGM endothelial growth medium. Acidic β-gal activity was used for these assays (27.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Briefly, EPC were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 3 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde, washed, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with fresh SA-β-gal stain solution: 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 5 mm/liter potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm/liter ferricyanide, 150 mm/liter NaCl, 2 mm/liter MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. SA-β-gal-positive cells were also quantified on cells cultured in the presence of NAC or LY294002 as indicated. The number of blue cells was counted manually from a total of 200 cells. Statistical Analysis—All in vitro results are representative of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Densitometric analysis using a Bio-Rad GS 250 molecular imager was used to calculate the differences in the -fold induction of protein activation or expression (* and § p < 0.05, statistically significant between experimental and control values). Significance of differences between experimental and control values was calculated using analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls multicomparison test. LDL Preparation and Characterization—In all diabetic subjects the peak of cholesterol was in the LDL subfractions with a density ranging from 1.037 to 1.044 g/ml. In healthy subjects the highest level of cholesterol was found in the LDL subfractions of density ranging from 1.028 to 1.035 g/ml. In diabetic samples LDL were constantly smaller and denser than normal LDL, and this effect was confirmed by the density gradient ultracentrifugation profile (data not shown) and by a lower cholesterol: apoB ratio found in these subjects (1.6 versus 1.3). Our previous findings that unlike 8% glycated LDL, 10 and 15% glycated LDL inhibit cell cycle progression (29.Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Gambino R. Cabodi S. Cassader M. Castelli A. Defilippi P. Pegoraro L. Pagano G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3311-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicate that the level of glycation is crucial to elicit damaging signals in primary endothelial cells. To rule out the possibility that the biological effects exerted by oxidized diabetic LDL could rely on LDL glycation, AGE immunoreactivity on LDL was evaluated. To this end a dot blot assay using an anti-AGE antibody was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A no significant difference in AGE immunoreactivity was detected in LDL recovered from normal subject (HbA1c = 5%) and diabetic patients in good metabolic control (HbA1c = 7%). By contrast, AGE immunoreactivity increased in LDL recovered from patients with HbA1c above 8%. Thus, only LDL recovered from diabetic patients with HbA1c <7% were subjected to oxidation. Before in vitro oxidation lipid peroxidation of natural occurring diabetic LDL used in our study was also assayed by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), assay and capillary electrophoresis and compared with that of the native LDL (nLDL). Consistent with our previous results (7.Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Pavan M. Rosso A. De Cesaris M.G. Garbarino G. Camussi G. Pagano G. Pegoraro L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) we failed to detect differences in TBARS and conjugates dienes between dmLDL or nLDL (data not shown). ox-dmLDL Increases p21 Expression and Induces Growth Arrest—Cell cycle events induced by in vitro ox-dmLDL on EPC were first evaluated. The results reported in Table 1 demonstrate that the fraction of cells in S and G2/M decreases when cells are cultured with ox-dmLDL. This effect was not observed in EPC cultured in the presence of dmLDL not subjected to oxidation. Indeed, cells in S phase were reduced to 13% compared with cells cultured with VEGF alone or in combination with dmLDL (38 and 36%, respectively). ox-dmLDL were used at a dose of 10 μg/ml because higher doses such as 50 μg/ml induced an apoptotic phenotype in 10% of the cells. To dissect the molecular events leading to growth arrest, cell cycle-related proteins were analyzed. The dose-response curve shown in Fig. 1B demonstrates that treatment with increasing concentrations of ox-dmLDL is associated with an increase of p21 expression. Moreover, we failed to detect a significant difference between 10 and 50 μg/ml ox-dmLDL. On the contrary, the level of p21 is not affected by the same concentrations of dmLDL. Consistent with the increased level of p21 expression also a decreased level of cyclin D1 expression occurs (Fig. 1C). A sustained increasing level of p21 can be mediated by various mechanisms, including regulation of protein stability (8.Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D this possibility is ruled out by the finding that the p21 half-life in EPC cultured in the presence of dmLDL or ox-dmLDL is similar. In addition (Fig. 1E) the level of p21 mRNA, but not that of cyclin D1, is significantly increased in EPC cultured in the presence of ox-dmLDL, and pretreatment with actinomycin D abrogates the effect of ox-dmLDL on both p21 mRNA and protein expression. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than protein accumulation account for our results.TABLE 1ox-dmLDL-mediated cell cycle events EPC cultured with 20 ng/ml VEGF, 10 μg/ml VEGF + dmLDL, or 10 or 50 μg/ml VEGF + ox-dm-LDL were washed and fixed with ethanol and processed by FACS. 0.5 μm/liter doxorubicin was used as a positive control for apoptosis.Cell cycle phasesPercentage of cellsap < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGFVEGFox-dmLDL 10 μg/mlox-dmLDL 50 μg/mldmLDL 50 μg/mlDoxorubicinG0/G142 ± 373 ± 4ap < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGF68 ± 4ap < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGF45 ± 410 ± 3ap < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGFS38 ± 217 ± 3ap < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGF12 ± 3ap < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGF36 ± 3/G2/M20 ± 110 ± 2ap < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGF10 ± 2ap < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGF19 ± 2/Apoptosis//10 ± 3/90 ± 5a p < 0.05 experimental groups versus VEGF Open table in a new tab It is known that oxidized LDL exert their effects by interacting with membrane receptor structure different from the canonical LDL receptor (33.Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The possibility that ox-dmLDL affects EPC by interacting with receptors other than that of dmLDL is sustained by competition experiments (Fig. 1F). Indeed, addition of an excess of dmLDL or of LDL recovered from normal subjects (nLDL) does not change the level of p21 in EPC. On the contrary the induction of p21 expression is abrogated by blocking the receptor LOX-1 but not by blocking RAGE, indicating that p21 expression is mediated by LDL oxidation rather that by LDL glycation. p21 Expression and Growth Arrest Are Dependent on Accumulation of p53 and the Presence of Unphosphorylated Rb Protein—p21 is a well known target of p53 (34.Boulaire J. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Pathol. Biol. 2000; 48: 190-202PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Jascur T. Brickner H. Salles-Passador I. Barbier V. El Khissiin A. Smith B. Fotedar R Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear accumulation of p53 was first evaluated in EPC cultured in the presence of ox-dmLDL or dmLDL. Moreover, to exclude further the possibility that glycation of LDL can account for our results in selected experiments CML-BSA was used. As shown in Fig. 2A p53 accumulates in the nucleus in EPC cultured with ox-dmLDL but not with dmLDL or CML, strongly supporting the role of LDL oxidation in this event (Fig. 2B). Consistently phosphorylated Rb protein can be only detected in EPC cultured with dmLDL. To confirm the involvement of p53 in mediating this signaling pathway EPC were depleted of endogenous p53 by siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2D ox-dmLDL fails to induce both accumulation of p53 and p21 expression in EPC transfected with p53 siRNA (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, depletion of endogenous p53 also prevents the effect of ox-dmLDL on Rb protein (Fig. 2E) and of ox-dmLDL-induced"

Crisps are two domain proteins with a structurally similar yet evolutionary diverse N-terminal domain and a characteristic cysteine-rich C-terminal domain, which we refer to as the Crisp domain. We presented the NMR solution structure of the Crisp domain of mouse Tpx-1, and we showed that it contains two subdomains, one of which has a similar fold to the ion channel regulators BgK and ShK. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time that the ion channel regulatory activity of Crisp proteins is attributed to the Crisp domain. Specifically, the Tpx-1 Crisp domain inhibited cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR) 2 with an IC50 between 0.5 and 1.0 μm and activated the skeletal RyR1 with an AC50 between 1 and 10 μm when added to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. This activity was nonvoltage-dependent and weakly voltage-dependent, respectively. Furthermore, the Tpx-1 Crisp domain activated both RyR forms at negative bilayer potentials and showed no effect at positive bilayer potentials when added to the luminal domain of the receptor. These data show that the Tpx-1 Crisp domain on its own can regulate ion channel activity and provide compelling evidence for a role for Tpx-1 in the regulation of Ca2+ fluxes observed during sperm capacitation.

The Crisp proteins have a characteristic C-terminal sequence containing 10 absolutely conserved cysteines. The Crisp domain is unique and is only observed in association with the CAP domain. Previously, there has been no biological activity attributed specifically to this domain. In mammals, there are at least four Crisp proteins, Crisp-1, Tpx-1 (or Crisp-2), Crisp-3, and Crisp-4. Crisp-1 proteins are expressed predominantly in the epididymides where they coat the surface of sperm during epididymal maturation (12.Haendler B. Kratzschmar J. Theuring F. Schleuning W.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in sperm oocyte binding and the regulation of capacitation (13.Busso D. Cohen D.J. Da Ros V.

Tpx-1 is expressed only in the testis and localized to specific regions in the spermatozoa, notably the acrosome of the head, the outer dense fibers, and longitudinal columns of the fibrous sheath in the sperm tail and the connecting piece of the neck (3.Foster J.A. Gerton G.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18.O'Bryan M.K. Sebire K. Meinhardt A. Edgar K. Keah H.H. Hearn M.T. De Kretser D.M. Mol. Reprod.

Transfection experiments have also suggested that Tpx-1 is involved in adhesion between germ cells and Sertoli cells within the seminiferous epithelium (19.Maeda T. Nishida J. Nakanishi Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crisp-3 is expressed more widely, including the salivary gland, pancreas, prostate, and B-cells (12.Haendler B. Kratzschmar J.

Huhtaniemi I. Poutanen M. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 1268-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). No clear biological function has been attributed to any mammalian Crisp protein, and characterizations have historically focused on expression location and timing to infer function. Nonmammalian Crisp proteins have, however, provided preliminary biochemical data. XCrisp expression occurs exclusively in the hatching gland of Xenopus and is associated with cellular membranes (24.Schambony A. Hefele J.A. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The XCrisp Crisp domain is indirectly required for the degradation of the vitelline envelope through activation of the degradation pathway. Helothermine, a Crisp protein from the venom of the Mexican beaded lizard, causes the reversible concentration-dependent blockage of voltage-gated Ca2+ and K+ channels and ryanodine receptors (RyR) (25.Mochca-Morales J.

Morita T. Toxicon. 2004; 44: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). PsTx is one of the more comprehensively characterized Crisp proteins and has been shown to block CNGA2 channels through interaction with regions in or near the channel pore (35.Brown R.L. Lynch L.L. Haley T.L. Arsanjani R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Investigations on venom Crisp proteins were performed using full-length native proteins containing both the CAP and Crisp domains. As such, it remains unclear whether the ion channel inhibition activity can be attributed to the CAP domain, the Crisp domain, or to both. Recently the crystal structures of Stecrisp and Triflin, Crisps proteins from the venom of the snake Trimersurus stejnegeri and Trimersurus flavoviridis, respectively, were determined (9.Guo M.

The CAP domains had the same α-β-α fold as other CAP proteins P14a, Ves V5, and GAPR-1 (7.Fernandez C. Szyperski T. Bruyere T. Ramage P. Mosinger E. Wuthrich K. J. Mol.

The Crisp domains included a linker region, containing two crossed disulfide bridges, and a domain with structural homology to the BgK (38.Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B.

As a first step toward defining the in vivo function of Tpx-1, we have determined the structure of the Crisp domain of recombinant mouse Tpx-1 by using NMR, and based on its homology with several ion channel inhibitors and published reports of RyR in mammalian sperm (40.Chiarella P.

Zygote. 1998; 6: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we tested its ability to regulate RyR activity. We show that the Tpx-1 Crisp domain can elicit the activation of RyR1 and the inhibition of RyR2 when added to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor and the activation of both forms when added to the luminal domain of the receptor. These data show the first structural representation of a mammalian Crisp domain and its structural homology to vertebrate and invertebrate toxins. We also show, for the first time, direct evidence that the Crisp domain is responsible for the ion channel inhibition activity previously observed in full-length Crisp proteins of lizard and snake origin. Cloning Expression and Purification of 15N-Labeled Tpx-1 Crisp Domain—The cDNA fragment encoding the Crisp domain of mouse Tpx-1 (beginning at CASCP) was subcloned into pTriEx4 (Neo) (Novagen), and the recombinant protein containing an N-terminal His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site was expressed in Escherichia coli ORIGAMI B(DE3) pLacI (Novagen), which facilitated the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. 15N incorporation was carried out according to the method of Marley et al. (44.Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) in M9 minimal medium. Briefly, cultures were incubated in LB medium at 37 °C until mid-log phase, and cells were subsequently washed twice in 15N M9 minimal medium, concentrated 4-fold, and equilibrated to 30 °C prior to the induction of protein expression with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The His:Tpx-1 Crisp domain was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-immobilized metal affinity chromatography affinity resin (Calbiochem). 49 mg of His:Tpx-1 was purified from 4 liters of the original culture volume. The His6 tag was proteolytically removed by thrombin cleavage, and the Tpx-1 Crisp domain was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (to remove the His6 tag) and semi-preparative reversed phase HPLC to separate folded and mis-folded forms. The Tpx-1 Crisp domain was at least 95% pure, and ∼98% of the purified recombinant Tpx-1 Crisp domain contained 15N as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Unlabeled protein was prepared using the same method, except expression was carried out in LB medium. Generation of Denatured Tpx-1 Crisp Domain for RyR Channel Control Experiments—Mis-folded Tpx-1 Crisp domain was reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) overnight and subsequently alkylated with 30 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 90 min in the dark. The completeness of the alkylation reaction was assessed by mass spectroscopy. Alkylated protein was purified by reversed phase HPLC and freeze-dried. Immediately prior to use, proteins were resuspended in the required buffer, denatured by heating at 50 °C for 10 min, followed by rapid cooling on ice. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz and 25 °C on a Bruker DRX500 equipped with a triple resonance TXI cryoprobe. Three-dimensional 15N-TOCSY-HSQC and 15N-NOESY-HSQC (45.Kay L.E. Marion D. Bax A. J. Magn.

The sample was lyophilized and resuspended in 2H2O prior to the acquisition of the following two-dimensional experiments: double quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy (46.Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar), TOCSY (47.Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn.

Open table in a new tab Spectra were processed using XWINNMR and were analyzed using the program SPARKY (49.Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3.

Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK2000: 12390-12411Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Initial rounds of structure calculation were performed using the CANDID module as implemented in CYANA 1.0.6 (51.Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The final round of structure calculations was performed using by XPLOR-NIH (52.Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) using experimental NOE-derived distance constraints and C-α and C-β chemical shifts supplemented with Ramachandran data base potentials that were turned on during the annealing protocol. Structures were calculated using a simulated annealing protocol in torsion angle space (53.Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and finally subjected to energy minimization. RyR Channel Activity Measurements—All methods for RyR channel activity measurements, including the preparation of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, single channel techniques, analysis of channel activity, and the statistical analysis were performed as described previously (54.Dulhunty A.F. Curtis S.M. Watson S. Cengia L. Casarotto M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11853-11862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Tpx-1 Crisp domain was added to the cis chamber containing the cytoplasmic domain of RyR at concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 50 μm. Tpx-1 Crisp domain was added to the trans chamber containing the luminal domain of RyR at 10 μm. All channel recordings using denatured Tpx-1 Crisp domain were done using 10 μm protein. NMR Spectroscopy—1H and 15N resonances were assigned from NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC experiments using standard procedures (50.Craik D.J. Scanlon M.J. Myers R.A. Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK2000: 12390-12411Google Scholar). A single peak was obtained for each 1H-15N pair in the HSQC experiment (Fig. 1) consistent with a single set of conformations in solution. Assignment of Tpx-1 Crisp Domain Disulfide Bonds—The disulfide bond connectivity in the Tpx-1 Crisp domain was determined from analysis of the NOESY spectra, which were examined for the presence of CAHα–CBHβ and CAHβ–CBHβ correlations (55.Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4601-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 56.O'Leary J.M. Hamilton J.M. Deane C.M. Valeyev N.V. Sandell L.J. Downing A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53857-53866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The absence of such NOEs was used to exclude potential disulfide bonds. This analysis suggested the disulfide bonding arrangement in the recombinant Tpx-1 Crisp domain to be Cys189–Cys196, Cys192–Cys201, Cys205–Cys238, Cys214–Cys232, and Cys223–Cys236. No anti-diagnostic NOEs were observed between CAHα and CBHN, which indicated that all cysteines were disulfide-bonded (57.Klaus W. Broger C. Gerber P. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This analysis was supported by the recently reported crystal structure of a native Crisp domain from Stecrisp (9.Guo M. Teng M. Niu L. Liu Q. Huang Q. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12405-12412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The Tpx-1 Crisp Domain Structure Determination—Final structure calculations using XPLOR-NIH generated 894 distance constraints, including 230 long range NOEs, 226 medium range NOEs, 251 short range NOEs, 187 intra-range NOEs, and 39 CBCA shifts. Following structural refinement, a family of 23 structures (from a total of 49) with the lowest energies and least residual violations of the experimental restraints were chosen to represent the structure of the Tpx-1 Crisp domain. A summary of the structural statistics for this family of structures is given in Table 2. The structures have no violations of distance or dihedral restraints greater than 0.2 Å or 5°, respectively. They have good covalent geometry and favorable nonbonded contacts. 75% of the backbone ϕ/ψ angles are in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot.TABLE 2Structural statistics for the family of Tpx-1 Crisp domain structuresStatistics for the family of 23 Tpx-1 Crisp structuresMean r.m.s.d. from experimental restraints NOE (Å)0.0154 ± 0.0024 δ Cα (ppm)1.051 ± 0.089 δ Cβ (ppm)0.748 ± 0.117Mean r.m.s.d. from idealized covalent geometry Bonds (Å)0.0019 ± 0.0002 Angles (°)0.313 ± 0.018 Impropers (°)0.298 ± 0.0191Mean energies (kJ mol-1) NOE6.5 ± 1.86 δ Cα/Cβ21.39 ± 3.99 Bond3.02 ± 0.68 Angle22.17 ± 2.57 Improper5.39 ± 0.70 L-J–123.67 ± 12.53 Total–-65.19 ± 13.73 Open table in a new tab The positional root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of the backbone heavy atoms and angular order parameters are shown in Fig. 2. From these data it is apparent that the Tpx-1 Crisp domain contains two distinct and folded subdomains; one includes two short β-strands and the other contains three shortα-helices (Fig. 3A). The subdomains are linked via a poorly ordered loop encompassing residues Asn203–Ser204, and Fig. 3B highlights the relative rotational freedom of each subdomain. Stereoviews of the family of structures superimposed over the heavy atoms of the individual subdomains are presented in Fig. 3, C and D.

No NOEs are observed between the two domains, suggesting that there is little or no interaction between them in solution.

The positional r.m.s.d. of backbone heavy atoms (N, C, C-α) of the Tpx-1 Crisp domain and Stecrisp is 1.4 Å over amino acids Cys192 to Thr202 and 1.2 Å over amino acids Ser206 to Cys238. Structural comparisons using the DALI server (58.Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) showed the region from Ser204 to His243 of Tpx-1 Crisp to be homologous to the voltage-sensitive K+ ion channel toxins BgK (38.Dauplais M.

We undertook experiments to test this hypothesis. The Tpx-1 Crisp Domain Shows a Subtype-specific Regulation of the Cytoplasmic Domain of RyR—The Tpx-1 Crisp domain, at concentrations between 0.1 and 50 μm, was added to the cis solution bathing the cytoplasmic side of RyR channels in lipid bilayers. The activity of the channels changed rapidly in a RyR subtype-specific manner when the protein was added. Cardiac RyR2 channels were inhibited, whereas skeletal RyR1 channels were activated. The addition of 10 μm denatured Tpx-1 Crisp domain to the cytoplasmic domain of RyR1 and RyR2 had no effect on the mean current at positive or negative applied bilayer potentials (Table 3).TABLE 3Relative mean current after addition of 10 μm Tpx-1 Crisp domain to the luminal and cytoplasmic domains of RyR subtypesFolded Tpx-1 Crisp domainDenatured Tpx-1 Crisp domainApplied potentialLuminal domainCytoplasmic domainLuminal domainCytoplasmic domain+40 mV-40 mV+40 mV-40 mV+40 mV-40 mV+40 mV-40 mVRyR11.10 ± 0.271.81 ± 0.511.46 ± 0.132.41 ± 0.260.61 ± 0.211.27 ± 1.021.01 ± 0.211.13 ± 0.50p = 0.36p = 0.09p = 0.0039p = 0.00019n = 3n = 3p = 0.140p = 0.308n = 6n = 6n = 11n = 11n = 5n = 5RyR21.11 ± 0.342.72 ± 0.750.36 ± 0.160.35 ± 0.140.81 ± 0.660.81 ± 0.861.04 ± 0.321.05 ± 0.36p = 0.377p = 0.032p = 0.0077p = 0.0024n = 2n = 2p = 0.362p = 0.095n = 7n = 7n = 8n = 8n = 6n = 6 Open table in a new tab The data in Fig. 5A show the decline in activity of a single RyR2 channel after addition of 1 μm Crisp domain to the cytoplasmic domain of RyR2 and further inhibition when the concentration was increased to 10 μm. The inhibition, apparent in the 3-s segments of activity and in the all-points histograms obtained from 30-s recordings, occurred within the 15-s stirring period after the protein was added to the solution. The inhibition was rapidly reversible when the 10 μm protein was perfused from the chamber (Fig. 5A) but did not reverse when 50 μm protein was removed, presumably because washout of the protein was incomplete, and the remaining Crisp domain after perfusion was sufficient to inhibit the channels. Although occasional full conductance openings were observed, most openings in the presence of the Tpx-1 Crisp domain were brief and poorly resolved. The average data obtained at bilayer potentials of +40 and –40 mV (Fig. 5, B and C, respectively) show the following: (a) the effects of the Tpx-1 Crisp domain on RyR2 inhibition were not voltage-dependent, (b) the IC50 was between"
https://openalex.org/W2001553948,"Although members of the Hedgehog (Hh) family were initially described as morphogens, many of these early conclusions were based on experiments that used non-physiologically relevant forms of Hh. Native Hh is modified by cholesterol (HhNp) and palmitate. These hydrophobic modifications are responsible for the ability of Hh to associate with cellular membranes, a property that initially appeared inconsistent with its ability to act far from its site of synthesis. Although it is now clear that Hh family members are capable of acting directly in long-range signaling, the form of Hh capable of this activity remains controversial. We have previously provided evidence for a freely diffusible multimeric form of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) termed s-ShhNp, which is capable of accumulating in a gradient fashion through a morphogenic field. Here, we provide further evidence that s-ShhNp is the physiologically relevant form of Shh. We show that the biological activity of freely diffusible ShhNp resides in its multimeric form and that this multimeric form is exceedingly stable, even to high concentrations of salt and detergent. Furthermore, we now validate the Shh-Shh interactions previously observed in the crystal structure of human Shh, showing that a highly conserved amino-terminal domain of Shh is important for the formation of s-ShhNp. We also conclusively show that palmitoylation is required for s-ShhNp formation. Thus, our results identify both protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that are required for s-ShhNp formation, and provide the first structural analyses supporting the existence of Shh multimers.

McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2439) Google Scholar). More recently, the human Hh family members Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and Indian Hedgehog were shown to play an important role as mitogens and survival factors for the growth of numerous types of tumor cells (2.Robbins D.J.

Although the physiological responses and signaling pathway of Hh are well studied, less is known about how Hh family members function as biological ligands. Questions as to the state of the physiologically relevant ligand, how the ligand moves through extracellular space, and even how it exits cells to reach the plasma membrane, remain unanswered (5.Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Zeng X. Robbins D.J. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6.Torroja C. Gorfinkiel N. Guerrero I. J. Neurobiol. 2005; 64: 334-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One reason for these remaining questions is the unusual biochemistry of the Hh family of proteins. Hh is synthesized as a protein of ∼45 kDa, which subsequently undergoes an intramolecular proteolytic cleavage into an amino-terminal domain (HhN) and a carboxyl-terminal domain (HhC) (7.Lee J.J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). During this cleavage, the amino-terminal domain is post-translationally modified by the covalent addition of cholesterol (HhNp), with the carboxyl-terminal domain acting as a cholesterol transferase (9.Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). HhNp is sufficient to activate all known Hh-dependent processes (10.Lai C.J. Ekker S.C. Beachy P.A.

Thus, the initial characterization of Hh family members was performed using a recombinant form of Shh (ShhN) that was not lipid-modified, which could mimic many of the biological activities thought to be Shh-dependent (10.Lai C.J.

However, the potency of recombinant ShhN was much less than that of ShhNp, which had been purified from the membranes of cells over expressing full-length Shh (16.Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14037-14045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Although ShhNp was more potent than ShhN, it did not initially appear to be freely diffusible, a requirement necessary for ShhNp to act as a morphogen (26.Porter J.A. Ekker S.C. Park W.J. von Kessler D.P. Young K.E. Chen C.H. Ma Y. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We have described a potent freely diffusible form of Shh we called s-ShhNp, which migrates as a complex of ∼120 kDa. This form of ShhNp appears to be multimeric, because wt Shh can co-immunoprecipitate with an epitope-tagged form of Shh (27.Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). ShhN is not able to form such multimers, suggesting that multimer formation requires one or both of its lipid modifications. We suggested that s-ShhNp is the physiologically relevant form of Shh, because a gradient of this soluble form of Shh could be detected across tissue expressing endogenous levels of Shh. The exact number of Shh molecules in s-ShhNp is unknown, as is the requirement, if any, of additional factors that may act as intermediates between the various Shh molecules. More recently, it has been suggested that palmitoylation of ShhNp may be required for multimerization (23.Chen M.H. Li Y.J. Kawakami T. Xu S.M. Chuang P.T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 641-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, it has also been proposed that s-ShhNp may actually be a lower activity form ShhNp and that palmitoylation is not required for multimerization (28.Feng J. White B. Tyurina O.V. Guner B. Larson T. Lee H.Y. Karlstrom R.O. Kohtz J.D. Development. 2004; 131: 4357-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Beyond these seemingly opposite analyses of s-ShhNp, a structure-function analysis of s-ShhNp has not been performed.The crystal structure of human recombinant ShhN protein is very similar to that of mouse ShhN (29.Hall T.M. Porter J.A. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30.Pepinsky R.B. Rayhorn P. Day E.S. Dergay A. Williams K.P. Galdes A. Taylor F.R. Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Garber E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10995-11001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the structure of human ShhN differs from that of mouse ShhN in one significant way; the structure of a highly conserved amino-terminal domain was visible in human ShhN. This amino-terminal domain of ShhN is among the most highly conserved regions of Hh family members, exhibiting ∼90% conservation across various homologs (Table 1). Of particular relevance to this work, the amino terminus of ShhN extended ∼30 Å away from the rest of the more globular molecule, where it appeared to be stabilized by interactions with adjacent symmetry related molecules. Although it has been suggested that the palmitoylation of ShhNp is required to form s-ShhNp, the human ShhN in this crystal structure was not palmitoylated. To test the hypothesis that the Shh-Shh crystal contacts observed in the human ShhN structure mimic those present in s-ShhNp, we mutated amino acids in this amino-terminal domain of Shh to perform a structure function analyses of s-ShhNp. Here, we provide evidence that large amounts of s-ShhNp can be produced from a stable cell line expressing full-length Shh under the control of an ecydysone-inducible promoter. This s-ShhNp is multimeric, highly active, and stable, remaining multimeric in the presence of high concentrations of salt and detergent. Underlying this stability of s-ShhNp, we show that a number of protein-protein interactions, as well as protein-lipid interactions are required for the formation of s-ShhNp. Furthermore, our results provide the first evidence based on the structure of Shh for the existence of Shh multimers, supporting the biological relevance of s-ShhNp.TABLE 1Conservation of the amino-terminal domain of Hedgehog* * ** *rShhCGPGRGFG-KRQHP-KKLTPLAYKQFIPNmShhCGPGRGFG-KRRHP-KKLTPLAYKQFIPNhShhCGPGRGFG-KRRHP-KKLTPLAYKQFIPNgShhCGPGRGIG-KRRHP-KKLTPLAYKQFIPNxShhCGPGRGIG-KRRHP-KKLTPLAYKQFIPNtShhCGPGRGYG-RRRHP-KKLTPLAYKQFIPNhIhhCGPGRVVGSRRRPP-RKLVPLAYKQFSPNmIhhCGPGRVVGSRRRPP-RKLVPLAYKQFSPNhDhhCGPGRGPVGRRRYARKQLVPLLYKQFVPGmDhhCGPGRGPVGRRRYVRKQLVPLLYKQFVPSHhCGPGRGLG-RHR-A-RNLYPLVLKQTIPNΔ1CG———QHP-KKLTPLAYKQFIPNΔ2CG——————LAYKQFIPNΔ3CG————————–N Open table in a new tab EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Shh Mutants—A cDNA expressing full-length rat Shh (Vhh-1), and various Shh mutations, were inserted into a pMT21 vector (11.Roelink H. Augsburger A. Heemskerk J. Korzh V. Norlin S. Ruiz i Altaba A. Tanabe Y. Placzek M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Dodd J. Cell. 1994; 76: 761-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The various point mutations of Shh were made by altering its cDNA sequence using the QuikChange II kit (Stratagene), as per the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were used in the mutagenesis: 1) ShhΔ1, 5′-CCG GAC TGG CCT GTG GGC AAC ACC CCA AAA AGC TG-3′, which deletes amino acids 27–34; 2) ShhΔ2, 5′-CCG GAC TGG CCT GTG GGT TAG CCT ACA AGC AG-3′, which deletes amino acids 27–42; 3) ShhΔ3, 5′-CCG GAC TGG CCT GTG GGA ACG TAG CCG AGA AGA CC-3′, which deletes amino acids 27–50; 4) ShhC25A, 5′-CGG ACT GGC AGC TGG GCC CGG CAG-3′, which mutates Cys-25 to Ala; 5) ShhC25S, 5′-CGG ACT GGC ATC GGG GCC CGG CAG-3′, which mutates Cys-25 to Ser; 6) ShhP27T, 5′-GGC CTG TGG GAC CGG CAG GGG GT-3′, which mutates Pro-27 to Thr; 7) ShhG30R, 5′-GGG CCC GGC AGG AGG TTT GGA AAG AGG-3′, which mutates Gly-30 to Arg; 8) ShhF31H, 5′-CGG CAG GGG GCA TGG AAA GAG GC-3′, which mutates Phe-31 to His; 9) ShhF48H, 5′-GCC TAC AAG CAG CAT ATC CCC AAC GTA GCC GAG-3′, which mutates Phe-48 to His; 10) ShhL140R, 5′-CAT TCA GAG GAG TCT CGA CAC TAT GAG GGT C-3′, which mutates Lys-140 to Arg; 11) ShhW173E, 5′-GTG GAG GCT GGC TTC GAC GAG GTC TAC TAT GAA TCC-3′, which mutates Trp-173 to Glu; and 12) ShhH183A, 5′-GAA TCC AAA GCT CGC ATC GCC TGT TCT GTG AAA GCA GAG-3′, which mutates His-183 to Ala. The correct sequence of the various Shh mutants was verified by DNA sequencing. For simplicity, we always use the rat Shh numbering system when comparing similar amino acids from human, mouse, or rat Shh molecules.Transfection and Analysis of Shh Mutants—Plasmids were transfected into HEK (Bosc 23) cells using Lipofectamine 2000 as per manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the addition of DMEM lacking serum. The cells were cultured overnight, then lysed and prepared for immunoblotting as described (31.Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Therond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The conditioned media of these cells was collected and centrifuged to clear any cellular debris in preparation for analysis. Aliquots of the media were analyzed directly by TCA precipitation and immunoblotted for the presence of ShhNp, bioassayed on Shh-Light2 cells, or analyzed by gel filtration to determine its multimeric state (see below). All activity assays were done in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of two times. The activity data for all the replicates is presented as mean ± S.D.Sizing Analysis of Shh Conditioned Media—Conditioned media was collected and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 60 min. The cleared media was then concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20. This concentrated media was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min and loaded onto a calibrated Superose-12 column, as previously described (27.Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The molecular mass standards used to calibrate the Superose-12 column were catalase, 232 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa, ovalbumin, 43 kDa; chymotrypsin, 25 kDa; and RNase A, 13.7 kDa. The column was equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Every two fractions were pooled and immunoprecipitated using the Shh monoclonal antibody 5E1, followed by immunoblotting with the Shh polyclonal antibody H-160 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). There is a strong correlation between the ability of the 5E1 monoclonal antibody to recognize a Shh mutant and the ability of that mutant to bind to Ptc (32.Fuse N. Maiti T. Wang B. Porter J.A. Hall T.M. Leahy D.J. Beachy P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10992-10999Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because all the mutants analyzed here were recognized by the 5E1 monoclonal antibody, we assume that their overall structure is intact.Prior to bioassay analyses of the Superose-12 fractions, Shh-Light2 cells were treated with serial dilutions of detergent in the presence of conditioned media to determine their ability to respond to Shh in the presence of detergent. After establishing that Shh-Light2 cells are unaffected by Nonidet P-40 concentrations <0.006%, we performed sizing analysis of wt Shh conditioned media on a Superose-12 column equilibrated in DMEM and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Every two fractions were pooled and diluted 1:1 with fresh DMEM to yield a 0.005% final concentration of Nonidet P-40, then assayed for Shh activity using Shh-Light2 cells as previously described (33.Taipale J. Chen J.K. Cooper M.K. Wang B. Mann R.K. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar).RESULTSStability and Activity of s-ShhNp—Beyond being multimeric, very little characterization of s-ShhNp has been described. Here, we determine the stability and activity of s-ShhNp under a variety of conditions, information that is required prior to purifying this freely diffusible form of ShhNp to homogeneity. In particular, we characterize a cell line that has been engineered to produce large amounts of ShhNp under the control of an inducible ecdysone promoter (ShhI cells), as such a cell line will be a convenient source of s-ShhNp (Fig. 1). ShhI cells were treated with various concentrations of the synthetic ecdysone derivative Ponasterone A to activate Shh expression. Conditioned medium from these cells was then isolated and used to examine the presence and activity of Shh. Active Shh was produced in cell media in a dose-dependent manner, up to 5 μg/ml Ponasterone A (Fig. 1A). Although Shh was expressed in the absence of Ponasterone A, its addition increased ShhNp levels in conditioned media ∼10-fold. The ShhNp in the conditioned media was active (Fig. 1B), showing dose-dependent activation of, a cell line stably expressing an Shh-responsive promoter driving luciferase expression (Shh-Light2 cells) (33.Taipale J. Chen J.K. Cooper M.K. Wang B. Mann R.K. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). We fractionated the conditioned media from ShhI cells on a Superose-12 column, to verify that the conditioned media contained s-ShhNp. Every two Superose-12 column fractions were pooled, immunoprecipitated using the Shh monoclonal antibody 5E1, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for Shh. ShhNp from the conditioned media of ShhI cells migrated in a similar sized peak to that previously described for s-ShhNp, with the majority of Shh migrating as a multimer at fraction #31 (Fig. 1C), with a molecular size of ∼120 kDa. A minor peak of ShhNp was also observed in fraction #41, migrating with a molecular size consistent with it being monomeric. The ratio of multimeric to monomeric ShhNp produced in the conditioned medium by ShhI cells was ∼11:1.We next tested the ability of s-ShhNp to withstand high salt or high detergent concentrations, to determine the stability of s-ShhNp under standard purification conditions. For the high salt experiment, both the ShhI-conditioned media and the Superose-12 column running buffer were adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl. Under these conditions, s-ShhNp migrated through the Superose-12 column in a manner similar to that of s-ShhNp fractionated under isotonic conditions, with a major peak at fraction #30 and a minor monomeric peak at fraction #40 (Fig. 2A). To test the stability of s-ShhNp in a non-ionic detergent we performed sizing analysis of ShhI-conditioned media in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40. Under these conditions, the majority of Shh in the conditioned media still migrated as a multimer, with the s-ShhNp peak appearing slightly larger than s-ShhNp fractionated under low detergent conditions (Fig. 2B). Thus, ShhI cells produce large amount of s-ShhNp in a form that is very stable to both high concentrations of salt and detergent.FIGURE 2s-ShhNp is biologically active. ShhI cells were incubated for 16 h with DMEM containing 2.5 μg/ml Ponasterone A. Conditioned media from these cells was fractionated over a gel-filtration column, and the various fractions were analyzed to determine the stability of s-ShhNp (A and B) or for their ability to activate a Hh-dependent reporter assay (C). A, NaCl was then added to the Shh-conditioned media, to a final concentration of 500 mm. This media was fractionated over a Superose-12 column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. B, Nonidet P-40 was added to the Shh-conditioned media, to the final concentration of 1%. This media was fractionated over a Superose-12 column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40. C, when used to assay Shh activity, the Superose-12 column was equilibrated with DMEM containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Every two fractions were pooled, diluted 1:1 with DMEM containing no detergent, and then added to Shh-Light2 cells to determine Shh activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although we have previously shown that ShhNp in conditioned media is active, it remains unclear as to whether this activity corresponds to s-ShhNp or whether the monomeric form of ShhNp present in the conditioned media is the sole contributor of this activity. To resolve this issue, we took conditioned media from the ShhI cells and fractionated it over a Superose-12 column equilibrated with a running buffer consisting of DMEM with reduced Nonidet P-40 (0.01%). The fractions were then diluted with an equal volume of DMEM containing no detergent, for a final Nonidet P-40 concentration of 0.005%, and added to Shh-Light2 cells to assay for Shh activity. Under these conditions, the peak of Shh activity isolated from the Superose-12 column fractions migrated in a manner that correlated well with Shh immunoreactivity, with a large peak around fraction #30 and a smaller peak around fraction #42 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the activity of ShhNp found in conditioned media resides predominantly in the Shh multimer, demonstrating that s-ShhNp represents the majority of activity in Shh conditioned media.Analysis of Shh Palmitoylation Site Mutants—Two recent reports have provided conflicting results on the role palmitoylation plays in s-ShhNp formation (23.Chen M.H. Li Y.J. Kawakami T. Xu S.M. Chuang P.T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 641-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28.Feng J. White B. Tyurina O.V. Guner B. Larson T. Lee H.Y. Karlstrom R.O. Kohtz J.D. Development. 2004; 131: 4357-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As we intended to analyze the role the amino-terminal domain of Shh plays in its multimerization, and this encompasses the site of palmitoylation, we began our structure-function analyses of s-ShhNp by examining mutations at the palmitate acceptor site (Cys-25), ShhC25S and ShhC25A. Both of these mutants were processed to their faster migrating cholesterol modified forms in a manner comparable to wt Shh (Fig. 3A). These mutants were also more highly expressed in conditioned media than wt Shh, consistent with palmitoylation playing a role in tethering Shh to cellular membranes. Furthermore, conditioned media from cells expressing these two Shh mutants had significantly less activity than that of wt Shh (Fig. 3B), consistent with palmitoylation of Cys-25 playing an important role in Shh activity. Sizing analysis of ShhC25S and ShhC25A conditioned media showed that these two proteins migrate in a manner comparable to ShhN, predominantly as a monomeric form at fraction 41 (Fig. 3C). These results are consistent with palmitoylation of Shh playing an important role in the formation of s-ShhNp.FIGURE 3s-ShhNp formation requires palmitoylation. The lysates of HEK cells expressing wt Shh, ShhC25S, ShhC25A or a control vector, were analyzed by immunoblotting for the expression of full-length Shh (u-Shh), the processed form of Shh (ShhNp), or tubulin (Tub) (A, top panel). Shh present in the conditioned media of these cells was analyzed by immunoblotting (A, bottom panel), assayed for its ability to activate a Hh-dependent reporter assay (B), or fractionated over a gel-filtration column to determine the presence of s-ShhNp. The fractions in which molecular mass standards (kDa) elute are marked (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of Shh Crystal Contact Mutations—In the crystal structure of ShhN (Fig. 4), specific amino acids that appeared to coordinate the intermolecular interaction of adjacent Shh molecules could be identified (30.Pepinsky R.B.

These amino acids include Pro-27, Phe-31, and Phe-48 on its amino-terminal domain as well as a number of amino acids surrounding the Zn+2-binding domain. To determine the role these amino acids play in Shh multimerization and activity we made non-conservative mutations in Shh, ShhP27T, ShhF31H, and ShhF48H, to alter the properties of the amino acid at that position. Plasmids expressing these Shh mutants, or wt Shh, were transfected into HEK cells, and the conditioned media were examined for Shh expression, activity, or multimeric state (Fig. 5). We also examined the lysates from these cells, which showed that all the mutant proteins expressed to similar levels as wt Shh, for both full-length (u-Shh) and processed forms of Shh (ShhNp). The amount of Shh in conditioned media of ShhP27T, ShhF31H, or ShhF48H transfected cells was comparable to that of wild-type Shh transfected cells. The activity of these Shh point mutants did not correlate well with Shh protein levels. ShhP27T had decreased activity relative to wt Shh, having activity similar to that of media from vector transfected cells, while ShhF31H and ShhF48H had activity that on average was comparable to that of wt Shh, demonstrating that these latter two mutations did not have significant effects on the processing, secretion, or activity of Shh. Based on these results we made an additional mutation between ShhP27T and ShhF31H, mutating the highly conserved Gly-30 to an Arg (ShhG30R). Interestingly, given the location of this conserved amino acid, this Shh mutant"

In developing hippocampal neurons, expression of the tail domain of myosin Vb, but not myosin Va, enhanced GluR1 accumulation in the soma and reduced its surface expression. These changes were accompanied by reduced GluR1 clustering and diminished frequency of excitatory but not inhibitory synaptic currents. Similar effects were observed upon expression of full-length myosin Vb lacking a C-terminal region required for binding to the small GTPase Rab11. In contrast, mutant myosin Vb did not change the localization of several other neurotransmitter receptors, including the glutamate receptor subunit NR1.

Proper sorting and transport of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors and associated proteins is essential for neuronal activity and plasticity. Recent studies have identified several proteins that regulate clustering of neurotransmitter receptors at the synapse (1Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown what proteins mediate sorting and delivery of receptors from the soma to postsynaptic sites. Molecular motors that regulate cargo trafficking on both actin filaments and microtubules have been implicated in initial transport and delivery to specific subcellular sites (2Bridgman P.C. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar).

Three known members of the myosin V family have been detected in brain extracts. The most studied member, myosin Va, is widely expressed in the brain (5Tilelli C.Q. Martins A.R. Larson R.E.

Myosin Vb and myosin Vc are two additional members of the myosin V family that are also expressed in the brain; however, their exact localization in neurons remains unclear (10Zhao L.P. Koslovsky J.S. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Witt A.E. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Rodriguez O.C.

All of these motors share ∼42% identity and contain a conserved N-terminal motor domain followed by a coiled-coil region and a globular C-terminal tail.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A similar strategy has been used to delineate the involvement of myosin Vb in recycling of several receptors in non-neuronal cells. These include the M4 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in PC12 cells (15Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Fang G. Goldenring J.R. Levey A.I. J.

Members of the Rab family of small GTPases have recently emerged as potential mediators of vesicle transport by members of the myosin V family (4Langford G.M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Association of myosin Vb with Rab 11a has also been reported to regulate plasma membrane recycling (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In contrast, the association of myosin Vc with Rab8-positive endosomes is involved in transferrin trafficking in HeLa cells (11Rodriguez O.C. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that coupling of individual members of the myosin V family to a particular subset of endosomal proteins may control the specificity of cargo transported by these motors. Although these studies revealed some of the mechanisms underlying myosin V-mediated trafficking, the identity of cargo transported by these proteins in neurons remains unknown. Also unclear is whether various members of the myosin V family share similar mechanisms for delivering cargo to specific subcellular locations. In this study we show that myosin Vb is widely distributed in the brain and that it is expressed in several neuronal populations. In brain tissue myosin Vb associates with the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1. Expression of the tail region of myosin Vb reduced surface expression and clustering of GluR1. These observations correlated with a decrease in the frequency of excitatory currents. Using myosin V mutants lacking regions required for coupling to Rab11, we further report that the effects of myosin Vb on GluR1 require coupling to Rab11. Taken together, these results uncover a novel role for myosin Vb in trafficking of a specific subunit of the AMPA-type excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in neurons. Antibody Generation and Immunohistochemistry—Myosin Vb expression in tissue sections was detected using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the coiled-coil region (amino acids 895-1221) of rat myosin Vb. Adult female Wistar rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4. Brain sections (15 μm) were incubated for 1 h with 2 μg/ml anti-myosin Vb antibodies, and the ABC technique (Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) was used for detection. cDNA Cloning and Mutagenesis—The cDNA encoding rat MyoVa was a gift from Dr. P. Bridgman (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). GFP-tagged mutant myosin Va (MyoVa CT) was generated by subcloning GFP in-frame with amino acids 1005-1830 of MyoVa in pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The truncated form of myosin Vb (MyoVb CT) was generated by subcloning GFP in-frame with amino acids 1221-1846 of rat myosin Vb into pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The truncated form of myosin Vb lacking the Rab11 interacting region was generated by deleting the last 49 amino acids at the C terminus of the GFP-tagged myosin Vb tail mutant (MyoVb CT ΔRab11; 1221-1797). The generation of full-length myosin Vb construct fused to GFP was described earlier (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Full-length myosin Vb lacking the Rab11 interacting region was generated by deleting 15 amino acids corresponding to 1797-1811 (MyoVb FL ΔRab11; 1-1796, 1812-1846) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The generation of hemagglutinin-tagged wild type GluR1 and flag-tagged full-length BERP was previously described (26Man H.Y. Ju W. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27El-Husseini A.E. Vincent S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19771-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The generated constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfections—Dissociated primary neuronal cultures were prepared from the hippocampi of E18/E19 rats. Briefly, hippocampi were dissociated by papain enzymatic digestion. Cells were coated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-treated coverslips. Cultures were maintained in neurobasal media (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine as described elsewhere (28Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). COS-7 or HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin. PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 mm l-glutamine and penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol or calcium phosphate method (Clontech) as previously described (29Jiang M. Deng L. Chen G. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Neurons were transfected at least 3 days before fixation and immunostaining. For COS-7, PC12 and HEK cells, immunostaining or biochemistry were performed 24 to 48 h post-transfection. Immunocytochemistry—Coverslips were fixed at room temperature for 10 min in 2% paraformaldehyde or in -20°C methanol when staining for synaptic proteins. Cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton-X-100 before and after each antibody incubation. The following primary antibodies were used (immunoreactivity and dilution as indicated): GluR1 (rabbit, 1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology); GluR2/3 (rabbit, 1:1000; Chemicon International); γ-amino butyric acid-type A γ2 (rabbit, 1:2000; Alomone); Rab11 (rabbit, 1:500; Zymed Laboratories Inc. and mouse, 1:200; BD Transduction Laboratories); calnexin (rabbit, 1:200; Sigma); Rab5 (mouse, 1:200; BD Transduction Laboratories); NR1 (mouse, 1:1000; Synaptic Systems); GluR2 (mouse, 1:500; MAB397; Chemicon); PSD-95 (mouse, 1:200; Affinity Bioreagents); synaptophysin (mouse, 1:500; Pharmingen); microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2) (mouse, 1:500; BD Pharmingen); GM130 (mouse, 1:200; Transduction Laboratories); hemagglutinin (mouse, 1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology); acetylcholine receptor α4 (guinea pig, 1:1000; Chemicon); GFP (guinea pig, 1:1000; custom made by Affinity Bioreagents). All antibody incubations were performed in blocking solution containing 2% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution containing the appropriate Cy3- or Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:1000; Molecular Probes). Coverslips were then mounted on slides (Frost Plus; Fisher) with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). GluR1 surface labeling experiments were carried out using antibodies directed against an extracellular region of GluR1 under non-permeabilized conditions (rabbit: 1:15; Oncogene Research) as previously described (30Swayze R.D. Lise M.F. Levinson J.N. Phillips A. El-Husseini A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 764-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Imaging and Analysis—Images of neurons and cell lines used in this study were taken using a 63× objective affixed to a Zeiss Axiovert M200 motorized microscope and AxioVision software. For analysis of total and surface cluster density (number), the images were analyzed in Northern Eclipse (Empix Imaging, Missassauga, Canada) by using custom written software routines as described elsewhere (31Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, dendrites of cells of interest were manually outlined using fluorescent signal. Puncta were defined as sites of intensities at least 1.5 times the dendritic background. The average puncta number per dendrite length in transfected cells was compared with either GFP-transfected or untransfected cells present in the same field. For changes in perinuclear accumulation in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, a minimum of 30 transfected cells per group was analyzed from at least 3 independent experiments. Image J 1.33u software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health) was used to represent graphically the fluorescence intensity patterns per μm. Statistical analysis were performed using Student's t test. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Subcellular Fractionation—For immunoprecipitation, whole brains from adult or postnatal day 16-19 Wistar rats were quickly removed. Brain tissue was homogenized in TEEN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mmNaCl) supplemented with 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm Na3Va4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml (Roche Applied Science). For myosin Vb immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in TEEN by the addition of 0.1% SDS, 0.8% Triton X-100. For GluR1 immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in TEEN containing 0.5% deoxycholate and 1% Nonidet P-40. After rotation for 1 h at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5μg of anti-myosin Vb or anti-GluR1 polyclonal antibodies raised against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of coiled-coil region of myosin Vb and carboxyl tail of GluR1, respectively. After the addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences), samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h or overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with TEEN buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 10%β-mercaptoethanol for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blots signals were detected with Odyssey machine (Li-Cor) as previously described (30Swayze R.D. Lise M.F. Levinson J.N. Phillips A. El-Husseini A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 764-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitations from HEK-293 cells were performed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and samples were processed as described above. For subcellular fractionation, cerebral cortices from seven adult rats were homogenized and fractionated as previously described (32Fleisig H. El-Din El-Husseini A. Vincent S.R. Neuroscience. 2004; 127: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 10 μg of each fraction was loaded on gel (P1, debris and nuclei; S1, postnuclear supernatant; P2, crude synaptosomal fraction; S2, small compartments; P3, microsomal pellet; S3, soluble protein fraction; LP1, synaptosomal membrane-enriched fraction; LS1, supernatant; LP2, synaptic vesicle-enriched fraction; LS2, presynaptic cytosol). Electrophysiology—Recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were performed 3 days post-transfection. Hippocampal neurons on coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber continuously perfused with extracellular solution (pH 7.4; 320-330 mosm)) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes, 33 mm glucose, and 0.0005 mm tetradotoxin (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel). Transfected cells with GFP signal were identified under a fluorescent upright microscope. Intracellular solution (pH 7.2; 300-310 mosm) was composed of 115 mm cesium gluconate, 17.5 mmCsCl, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm ATP, 0.4 mmGTP, and 0.1% lucifer yellow (Sigma-Aldrich). A MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for recording. Access resistance was monitored, and recordings where series resistance varied by >10% were rejected. No electronic compensation for series resistance was used. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed in voltage clamp mode while maintaining the membrane potential either at the reversal potential for γ-amino butyric acid-type A receptor-mediated miniature postsynaptic currents (-60 mV) to isolate mEPSCs or at the reversal potential for ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated miniature PSCs (+10 mV) to isolate mIPSCs. Recorded mEPSCs and mIPSCs were antagonized completely by the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (Sigma-Aldrich) and the γ-amino butyric acid-type A receptor antagonist bicuculline (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively (data not shown). Recordings were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz, sampled at 10 kHz, and stored in a computer by using CLAMPEX 8.0 (Axon Instruments). Myosin Vb Localization in the Brain—Previous in situ hybridization studies revealed that myosin Vb is present in the brain; however, its exact subcellular distribution remained unknown (10Zhao L.P. Koslovsky J.S. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Witt A.E. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether myosin Vb is expressed in neurons, we raised specific anti-bodies against the coiled-coil domain of myosin Vb, the region least conserved among members of the myosin V family (2Bridgman P.C. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis confirmed that the generated antibodies specifically recognize the coiled-coil region of myosin Vb but not myosin Va (Fig. 1A). A major band of ∼200 kDa was detected in homogenates obtained from various brain regions of juvenile P17 (postnatal day 17) and adult rats (Fig. 1B). Myosin Vb was mainly detected in neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, septum, striatum, midbrain, and in specific neuronal subpopulations in the brain stem and cerebellum (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Intense myosin Vb immunoreactivity was also found in the posterior dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex (Fig. 1D). In both adult neurons in brain slices and hippocampal neurons in culture, myosin Vb showed a prominent punctate staining in the perinuclear region and dendrites (Fig. 1D and Supplemental Fig. 1). Myosin Vb staining was also more intense in GAD-65-positive interneurons present in the hippocampus and cortex (data not shown). To further characterize the subcellular distribution of myosin Vb in neurons, we compared the localization of myosin Vb to the synaptic markers PSD-95 and synaptophysin at days in vitro (DIV) 7 and 14 as well as in mature (DIV 21-28) neurons. In DIV 7-14 neurons, myosin Vb was present in the soma and dendrites but was mainly lacking from synaptic sites (Fig. 1E and Supplemental Fig. 1). In DIV 21-28, myosin Vb was mainly observed in the soma. However, at this stage myosin Vb was also detected in dendritic spines and at sites positive for synaptophysin and PSD-95 (Fig. 1E and Supplemental Fig. 1). The enrichment of myosin Vb in the perinuclear region in both developing and adult neurons indicates that myosin Vb participates in initial cargo transport from the soma to neuronal processes (Supplemental Fig. 1). Moreover, the modest localization of myosin Vb in dendritic spines in mature neurons suggests that myosin Vb also regulates some aspects of local cargo delivery and/or recycling at the synapse. Expression of a Mutant Form of Myosin Vb Alters the Distribution of Specific Glutamate Receptor Subunits—It is well established that the tail domains of myosin Va-Vc are critical for cargo transport (2Bridgman P.C. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Karcher R.L. Deacon S.W. Gelfand V.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Truncated forms expressing the tail domain of either myosin Va or myosin Vb accumulate in a perinuclear vesicular compartment that co-localizes with recycling endosomal markers and alters cargo transport in non-neuronal cells (13Hales C.M. Vaerman J.P. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50415-50421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Fang G. Goldenring J.R. Levey A.I. J.

To assess their role in neuronal protein trafficking, we transfected DIV 9 hippocampal neurons with GFP fusion constructs containing the tail domain of either myosin Va (MyoVa CT) (33Bridgman P.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or myosin Vb (MyoVb CT) (10Zhao L.P. Koslovsky J.S. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Witt A.E. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 3-4 days post-transfection, neurons were fixed, and the distribution of several neuronal proteins was assessed using immunocytochemistry. Remarkably, neurons expressing MyoVb CT but not MyoVa CT showed a striking perinuclear accumulation of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 (Fig. 2, A-C). In contrast, no significant change in the accumulation of several other neurotransmitter receptors was observed, including the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-type glutamate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B, γ-amino butyric acid-type A γ2, and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α4 (Fig. 2, D-G and J). Moreover, MyoVb CT did not alter the distribution of microtubule-associated protein MAP-2 or synaptophysin, suggesting a specific involvement of myosin Vb on GluR1 trafficking from a site emanating from the perinuclear region (Fig. 2, H and J). Consistent with previous studies, the truncated form of myosin Vb did not induce a gross rearrangement of internal organelles such as the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Supplemental Fig. 2) (11Rodriguez O.C. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Moreover, the perinuclear compartment containing GluR1 and myosin Vb mutant did not colocalize with either the ER marker calnexin or with the Golgi marker GM130, indicating that the accumulation of GluR1 with MyoVb CT is not due to aberrant trapping of GluR1 in these compartments. Altered GluR1 localization suggests that myosin Vb exists in a protein complex containing GluR1. To assess this, myosin Vb was immunoprecipitated from brain tissue lysates, and possible binding partners were probed for using Western blotting. This analysis revealed that GluR1 co-immunoprecipitates with myosin Vb; however, neither NR1 nor the presynaptic protein synaptotagmin I was detected (Fig. 2K). Conversely, myosin Vb was also detected in GluR1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2L). To further characterize the relation between myosin Vb and GluR1 in developing hippocampal neurons, we next assessed GluR1 localization in DIV 7 and DIV 14 neurons at synaptic and non-synaptic sites (Supplemental Fig. 1). GluR1 was weakly clustered at DIV 7 neurons. Moreover, synaptophysin-positive puncta mainly lacked GluR1. This pattern resembles the distribution of myosin Vb in these young neurons. In DIV 14 neurons, GluR1 showed an accumulation at synaptic sites, which was more prominent t"

The accuracy of prediction further improved to 83.74% when split amino acid composition (25 N-terminal, 25 C-terminal, and remaining residues) of proteins was used. Then BLAST search and support vector machine-based method were combined to get 88.22% accuracy. Finally we developed a hybrid approach that combined hidden Markov model profiles of domains (exclusively found in mitochondrial proteins) and the support vector machine-based method. We were able to predict mitochondrial protein with 100% specificity at a 56.36% sensitivity rate and with 80.50% specificity at 98.95% sensitivity. The method estimated 9.01, 6.35, 4.84, 3.95, and 4.25% of proteins as mitochondrial in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and human proteomes, respectively. MitPred was developed on the above hybrid approach. Mitochondria are considered as one of the core organelles of eukaryotic cells hence prediction of mitochondrial proteins is one of the major challenges in the field of genome annotation. This study describes a method, MitPred, developed for predicting mitochondrial proteins with high accuracy. The data set used in this study was obtained from Guda, C., Fahy, E. & Subramaniam, S. (2004) Bioinformatics 20, 1785–1794. First support vector machine-based modules/methods were developed using amino acid and dipeptide composition of proteins and achieved accuracy of 78.37 and 79.38%, respectively.

MitPred was developed on the above hybrid approach. The mitochondrion, popularly known as the power house of the cell, is the central unit of eukaryotic cells. 2MitPred was developed on a hybrid approach to predict mitochondrial proteins, and additional data are available upon request. It is a double membrane-bounded organelle with two spaces, the outer intermembrane space and inner matrix. Due to the presence of an explicit mitochondrial genome, unlike other organelles, its function is regulated by two genomes. It performs a plethora of biochemical reactions like oxidative phosphorylation, Krebs cycle, β-oxidation of fatty acids, DNA replication, transcription, translation, etc., some of which occur in mitochondria only. In addition mitochondria are also involved in apoptosis (1Gottlieb R.A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2000; 10: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and ionic homeostasis (2Jassem W. Fuggle S.V. Rela M. Koo D.D. Heaton N.D. Transplantation. 2002; 73: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because of their multidimensional utility, mitochondrial proteins are associated with several human diseases, including Alzheimer disease (3Hutchin T. Cortopassi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6892-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), Type II diabetes (4Gerbitz K.D. Gempel K. Brdiczka D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 113-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Parkinson disease (5Orth M. Schapira A.H. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A majority of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in cytoplasm from where they are transported inside mitochondria. But a small number of mitochondria-resident proteins are also synthesized inside mitochondria by the mitochondrial genome. Proteins that are imported to mitochondria contain a leader sequence at the N terminus that contains all the information needed to localize to mitochondria (6Alberts B. Johnson A. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Walter P. Molecular Biology of the Cell.4th Ed. Garland Science, New York2000: 678Google Scholar). But this is not true for all mitochondrial proteins. In many cases the leader sequence is altogether absent. This poses a major challenge in predicting mitochondrial proteins in silico. In the past, a number of methods have been developed to predict the mitochondrial proteins, although most were not intended exclusively for mitochondrial proteins. Existing prediction methods can be divided into four categories. The similarity search-based techniques fall under the first category in which the query sequence is searched against experimentally annotated proteins. If the query protein has significant sequence similarity with any mitochondrial protein then it is predicted as a mitochondrial protein. But this method fails to predict new/novel proteins if these proteins do not have similarity with known proteins. Although the similarity-based method is very informative and considered to be best, it becomes severely handicapped when no apparent homology is found (7Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In the second category, the methods are based on predicting signal sequences in proteins. A number of methods fall under the second category where sorting signals, present on the protein itself, are used for prediction. This category includes TargetP (8Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar), SignalP (9Bannai H. Tamada Y. Maruyama O. Nakai K. Miyano S. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and PSORT II (10Gardy J.L. Spencer C. Wang K. Ester M. Tusnady G.E. Simon I. Hua S. deFays K. Lambert C. Nakai K. Brinkman F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3613-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Although these methods are quite popular, their major limitation is that not all proteins have signals; for example, only around 25% of yeast mitochondrial proteins have “matrix-targeting signals” particularly at the N terminus (11Marcotte E.M. Xenarios I. van Der Bliek A.M. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12115-12120Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because of this, these methods fail to predict the proteins that do not have a signal. In the third category, methods attempt to predict subcellular localization on the basis of sequence composition. Some popular methods in this category are ESLpred (12Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W414-W419Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), HSLpred (13Garg A. Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14427-14432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), NNPSL (7Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and LOCSVMPSI (14Xie D. Li A. Wang M. Fan Z. Feng H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although their overall performance is very good, accuracy of prediction of mitochondrial proteins is much lower than for proteins in other locations. It shows that mitochondrial protein localization is much more complex than seen otherwise. Hence prediction of mitochondrial proteins warrants special attention. Recently Guda et al. (15Guda C. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) developed a method, MITOPRED, which falls under the fourth category of prediction methods. This method is exclusively developed for predicting mitochondrial proteins with a maximum accuracy of 92.3% (Mathews’ correlation coefficient (MCC), 3The abbreviations used are: MCC, Mathews' correlation coefficient; SVM, support vector machine; HMM, hidden Markov model; SAAC, split amino acid composition. 0.638). Its output is the combined score of two scoring methods that assign an arbitrary score on the basis of existence of Pfam domains, differences in the amino acid composition, and the pI value of the protein. In the present study we tried to improve the prediction accuracy of mitochondrial proteins. First we carried out systematic analysis of amino acid composition of both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins, and then on the basis of the conclusion drawn we developed the prediction method. In our study we used a powerful machine learning technique, support vector machine (SVM), for classifying proteins instead of the pI score used in MITOPRED. Data Sets and Evaluation—We used the same data set that was constructed to develop MITOPRED by Guda et. al (15Guda C. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This data set contain 1432 mitochondrial and 8940 non-mitochondrial sequences. First both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins were randomly divided into five parts. Each of these five sets consists of one-fifth of mitochondrial (∼ 287) and one-fifth of non-mitochondrial (∼ 1788) proteins. For training and for testing and evaluating our methods, we used a 5-fold cross-validation technique in which four sets were used for training and the remaining set was used for testing. This process was repeated five times so that each set was used once for testing (16Kaur H. Raghava G.P.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Amino Acid and Dipeptide Composition—The aim of calculating the composition of proteins is to transform the variable length of protein sequences to fixed length feature vectors. This is an important and most crucial step during classification of proteins using machine learning techniques because they require fixed length patterns. In addition the conversion of a protein sequence to a vector of 20 dimensions using amino acid composition will encapsulate the properties of the protein into the vector. In addition to amino acid composition, dipeptide composition was also used for classification that gave a fixed pattern length of 400. The advantage of dipeptide composition over amino acid composition is that it encapsulates information about the fraction of amino acids as well as their local order. The amino acid as well as dipeptide composition was calculated as described by Garg et al. (13Garg A. Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14427-14432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both compositions were used as input to classify mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins using SVM. Split Amino Acid Composition (SAAC)—In the case of SAAC, variable length protein sequences were represented by a fixed length pattern of 60 instead of 20 in the case of standard amino acid composition. In SAAC each protein is divided into three parts: (i) 25 amino acids of the N terminus, (ii) 25 amino acids of the C terminus, and (iii) the region between these two. The rationale behind using this is the fact that percent composition of the whole sequence does not give proper weight to compositional bias, which is known to be present in mitochondrial protein termini. Hence the advantage of SSAC over standard amino acid composition is that it provides greater weight to proteins that have a signal at either the N or C terminus. N-terminal Signal—It is a well reported fact that mitochondrial proteins contain signal sequence at their N termini, and this is used in TargetP for prediction (8Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). In this work we adopted a different strategy to model N-terminal signal. It was represented by a binary vector of 525 (25 × 21) representing the N-terminal 25 residues. This binary vector was used to classify the proteins using SVM. Combination of SVM-based Method and BLAST Search—BLAST (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) is the most commonly used tool for similarity search. In this study we computed the performance of BLAST in detecting mitochondrial proteins using default parameters at an e value of 0.1. In this, proteins of the test sets were used as the query against a data base containing the proteins of corresponding training sets. The performance of BLAST was calculated in terms of correct hits for mitochondrial proteins. In the next step the search result was combined with the SVM-based method. Although BLAST remains the final referee, SVM predictions were used only for proteins where either BLAST did not find any significant hit or the most significant hit was a non-mitochondrial protein and vice versa. We also repeated the same procedure at different cutoff e values. If a protein has a hit with e value less than the cutoff then the BLAST prediction was used; otherwise the SVM-based prediction was considered. Occurrence of Pfam Domains Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)—HMMs are a class of probabilistic models that are generally applicable to time series or linear sequences. It describes probability distribution over a potentially infinite number of sequences. Basically it is a more advanced and sophisticated version of the Markov chain. In this study, HMM was implemented using HMMER (hmmer.wustl.edu/). The HMM-based sequence search was done using the Pfam data base (release 17.0) (18Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a data base of multiple sequence alignment of proteins belonging to the same family. It contains 7868 families, each representing a Pfam domain. Each mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial protein in our data set was searched against the Pfam data base using the HMM search at an e value threshold of 1e–5. Search results were analyzed to detect three type of domains: (i) exclusively mitochondrial domains occurring only in mitochondrial proteins, (ii) exclusively non-mitochondrial domains occurring only in non-mitochondrial proteins, and (iii) shared domains occurring in both type of proteins. A protein was assigned as a mitochondrial protein if it contains even one exclusive mitochondrial domain. Hybrid Approach—In the hybrid approach SVM and the HMM search were combined to exploit the benefits of both de novo prediction by SVM and the highly sophisticated HMM-based similarity search technique in a well annotated and curated domain data base, Pfam. Because domains are structural, functional, and evolutional units of proteins, it is well known that all proteins are made up of either single or multiple domains. Hence searching domain(s) can be a major step toward determining the localization of a protein that may give a new insight on probable function of a protein. But because all the domains are not characterized yet, instances where not even a single hit is found can be a real challenge. In these cases incorporation of SVM-based prediction can be a good alternative. In this way the hybrid approach should be a better way of prediction. First proteins in the test set were searched against a data base of exclusive mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial domains. A protein was assigned as a mitochondrial protein if it has an exclusive mitochondrial domain and was assigned as a non-mitochondrial protein if it has an exclusive non-mitochondrial domain. But if the protein does not have any exclusive domain then the SVM-based method was used for prediction. Evaluation on Independent Data Set—Cross-validation is the most popular method to evaluate performance of a prediction method. But it has been shown in the past that performance of n-fold cross-validation is not completely unbiased (19Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To assess the unbiased performance of any method one needs to evaluate it on an independent data set. Keeping this in mind we evaluated the performance of our method on an independent data set generated from “OrganelleDB,” which is a curated data base of mitochondrial proteins (20Wiwatwattana N. Kumar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D598-D604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It contains 723, 412, 352, 320, and 99 mitochondrial proteins of yeast, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, human, and mouse, respectively. Annotation of Proteomes—Five complete eukaryotic proteomes were downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/integr8) representing three non-vertebrates (S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster) and two vertebrates (human and mouse). On these proteomes, by using the hybrid approach of the Pfam search and SVM, an estimation of the total number of mitochondrial proteins was carried out. Support Vector Machine—In this study we implemented SVM by using the SVMlight package (21Joachims T. Advances in Kernel Methods—Support Vector Learning.in: Scholkopf B. Burges C. Smola A. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1999Google Scholar), which allows us to choose a number of parameters and kernels (e.g. linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid) or any user-defined kernel. Assuming that we have a number of patterns Xi ∈ Rd (i = 1,2,.... n) with corresponding target values yi ∈{target value}. Here the target value is either +1 (representing a mitochondrial protein) or –1 (for non-mitochondrial proteins). SVM maps the input vectors xi into higher dimensional space with minimum error on the training set. The decision function implemented by SVM can be written as Equation 1.F(x)=sign(∑i=1NyiαiK(xixj+b))(Eq. 1) The value of αi is given by the task of quadratic programming, thus maximizing the subject to 0 ≤ αi ≤ C. C is the regulatory parameter that controls the trade-off between the margin and the training error, and b is the threshold for defining the hyperplane. The selection of kernel is very important in SVM, analogous to choosing architecture in artificial neural network. In this study, learning was carried out using three kernels: linear, polynomial, and sigmoid. Evaluation Parameters—To assess the performance of methods we used several parameters routinely used in these types of studies (22 and 13). The following is a brief description of these parameters. (i) The sensitivity or percent coverage of mitochondrial proteins is the percentage of mitochondrial proteins correctly predicted as mitochondrial proteins. (ii) The specificity or percent coverage of non-mitochondrial proteins is the percentage of non-mitochondrial proteins correctly predicted as non-mitochondrial proteins. (iii) The accuracy is the percentage of correctly predicted proteins. These parameters can be calculated using Equations 2, 3, 4,Sensitivity=TPTP+FN×100(Eq. 2) Specificity=TNTN+FP×100(Eq. 3) Accuracy=TP+TNTP+TN+FP+FN×100(Eq. 4) where TP and TN are truly or correctly predicted positive (mitochondrial) and negative (non-mitochondrial) proteins, respectively (Fig. 1). FP and FN are falsely or wrongly predicted mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins, respectively. MCC is considered to be the most robust parameter of any class prediction method. An MCC equal to 1 is regarded as a perfect prediction, whereas 0 is for a completely random prediction.MCC=(TP×TN)-(FP×FN)(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)(Eq. 5) All the measures described above have a common drawback that they give the performance at a given threshold. A known threshold-independent parameter is receiver operating characteristic, which is a plot between true positive proportion (TP/TP + FN) and false positive proportion (FP/FP + TN). The area under the curve gave a single value to evaluate the performance of a method. Sequence Similarity Search—One of the common practices for predicting the function of a new protein is to perform a similarity search against a data base of well annotated proteins. In this study we used BLAST for predicting mitochondrial proteins using 5-fold cross-validation where four sets of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins were used to create a BLAST data base, and mitochondrial proteins of the corresponding test set were searched against this BLAST data base. This process was repeated five times so the BLAST search was performed once for each mitochondrial protein. As shown in Table 1, the performance of BLAST at default threshold varies from 38.67 to 82.16% with an average of 62.15%. This demonstrates that BLAST alone cannot predict all mitochondrial proteins.TABLE 1Result of BLAST search on data set used for MitPredData setNumber of mitochondrial proteinsSummary of BLAST hitsPercent coverageNo hitTotal hitsCorrect hit%Test12863125523582.16Test228710518211138.67Test32876622117460.62Test42864224420672.03Test52868620016457.34Total/average1432330110289062.15 Open table in a new tab SVM Modules of Amino Acid and Dipeptide Composition—It has been shown in the past that amino acid composition can be use to classify proteins. We analyzed amino acid composition of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 2). It was observed that amino acid composition of mitochondrial proteins was significantly different from that of non-mitochondrial proteins. Thus it is possible to discriminate mitochondrial proteins from other proteins. Thus an SVM-based classifier was developed using amino acid composition as input vector of dimension 20. Different kernels and parameters of SVM were tried and achieved accuracy of 78.37% with an MCC of 0.43 using radial basis function kernel where sensitivity and specificity is nearly the same (Table 2). It has also been observed in the past that dipeptide composition-based methods are more successful than amino acid composition-based methods in classification of proteins (23Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23262-23266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, an SVM-based module was developed to predict mitochondrial proteins using dipeptide composition as input vector of dimension 400. But contrary to our expectation, the performance of the dipeptide composition-based method was only marginally better than the amino acid composition-based method (Table 2). Although the receiver operating characteristic plot was also found to be far above the base line of random prediction (Fig. 3), still there are chances of improvement. We also computed area under the curve for SVM modules and achieved areas under the curve of 0.85 and 0.86 for amino acid and dipeptide composition, respectively.TABLE 2Performance of SVM with different inputsInput parametersParameterThresholdSensitivitySpecificityAccuracyMCCAUC%%%Amino acid compositionJ = 5, g = 0.001, c = 100-0.378.4978.3678.37 (88.23)0.43 (0.46)0.85Dipep. comp.J = 5, t = 1, d = 3-0.377.0379.7579.38 (88.09)0.44 (0.47)0.86NT-25J = 8, t = 1, d = 4-0.273.3873.0673.10 (88.69)0.34 (0.44)0.82CT-25J = 6, d = 4,-0.264.4064.3363.48 (86.22)0.19 (0.20)0.69NT-25+RJ = 5, t = 2, g = 0.0001, c = 75-0.482.4082.4582.44 (90.426)0.51 (0.56)0.89SplitJ = 3, g = 0.0001, c = 10-0.482.7582.7483.74 (90.39)0.52 (0.57)0.90 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Average percent composition of the first 15 N-terminal amino acid residues of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Combination of BLAST Search and SVM Module—Both the similarity search-based method (BLAST) and the machine learning method have their strengths and weaknesses. Similarity-based methods are better than any other method if the query sequence has significant similarity with any experimentally annotated protein. But it fails in the absence of similarity. On the other hand the machine learning method SVM is a general method in which the performance does not depend on similarity between target and query sequences. To improve the performance both the BLAST search and SVM were combined. In this, the training set was taken as the data base, and the proteins from test set were used as query proteins to search against this data base. Each protein from the test set was used to query against the corresponding data base. Among all the hits only the top hit (minimum e value) was considered as significant. If the hit corresponded to a mitochondrial protein then the query protein was directly assigned as a mitochondrial protein. Similarly if the hit corresponded to a non-mitochondrial protein then the query protein was directly assigned as a non-mitochondrial protein. Although the overall performance of the similarity search was quite good, it was observed that there was no hit for a large number of proteins. For these proteins SVM was used to predict whether it is a mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial protein. In this study different e values from BLAST were used to assign location. The maximum accuracy using this strategy was around 89% with MCC around 0.63 (Table 3), which is better than the performance of the BLAST search or SVM module alone. This demonstrates that the combination of the similarity search and machine learning techniques can achieve very high accuracy if used to supplement each other (24Bhasin M. Garg A. Raghava G.P.S. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2522-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).TABLE 3Performance of the combined approach of BLAST and SVMe value thresholdSensitivitySpecificityAccuracyMCC%%%1e—177.95091.40489.2660.6381e—278.29890.83888.8460.6321e—378.64890.50888.6220.6261e—478.85689.99688.2240.6201e—578.85689.99688.2240.6201e—1078.72089.05887.4160.6061e—2078.43887.71483.2380.5801e—3078.15886.87085.4860.5641e—4078.43886.48885.2080.560 Open table in a new tab Analysis of N-terminal and C-terminal Residues—In previous studies it has been shown that around 25% of proteins have an N-terminal signal; thus it is pertinent to analyze the amino acid composition of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins. Recently Guda et al. (15Guda C. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) analyzed the 25 residues of the N terminus and the remaining protein (after removing the 25 residues of the N terminus) for proteins of different cellular locations. They observed a strong bias in amino acid composition among them. It was also found that the composition of N-terminal residues and remaining residues of mitochondrial proteins was different. We extended their study to analyze the amino acid composition of mitochondrial proteins as follows: (i) 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 N-terminal residues (supplemental Fig. S2a); (ii) remaining residues of the protein (after removing the 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 N-terminal residues) (supplemental Fig. S2b); (iii) 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 C-terminal residues (supplemental Fig. S2c); and (iv) remaining residues of the protein (after removing the 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 C-terminal residues) (supplemental Fig. S2d). It was observed that the composition of N-terminal residues from 15 to 35 shows the same trend (Fig. 4). This was also the case when composition was determined without taking into consideration the N-terminal 15–35 residues. When these two compositions were compared, it was found that there is a clear difference between the composition at the N terminus of the protein and the remaining part of the protein. Although residues at the C terminus have a different composition then the rest of the protein, it is not as significant as for the N-terminal residues. We performed similar amino acid composition analysis for non-mitochondrial proteins. We did not find any significant difference between amino acid composition of N-terminal, C-terminal, and remaining residues of non-mitochondrial proteins. We also compared the composition of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, N-terminal residues of mitochondrial proteins are quite different from those of non-mitochondrial proteins. SVM Module Based on N-terminal Sequences—Based on the above observations, we developed a method using N-terminal residues. Sequences were represented by binary matrix; for example for 25 N-terminal residues, a matrix of 25 × 21 was used in which a residue at a given position will be represented by vector of 21 (23Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23262-23266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The SVM modules based on 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 N-terminal residues were developed and achieved a maximum MCC from 0.28 to 0.31. SVM Modules Based on Composition of N-terminal, C-terminal, and Remaining Protein Residues—It was observed that the amino acid composition of the N-terminal, C-terminal, and remaining mitochondrial protein residues was different from that of non-mitochondrial proteins. Thus we developed SVM modules based on the following: (i) composition of N-terminal residues with input vector 20, (ii) N-terminal residues and remaining residues with input vector 40; and (iii) N-terminal residues, C-terminal residues, and remaining residues using input vector 60. The maximum MCC of SVM modules based on composition of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 varies from 0.4 to 0.5, which is much better than the SVM module based on N-terminal sequence. This was surprising to us as the N-terminal sequence is supposed to contain complete information, whereas the composition has the total number of residues without order information. It seems that order of residues is not important for mitochondrial signals, but their presence is important; this is opposite to the known biological fact. This may be because all mitochondrial proteins do not have a leader signal, which is ultimately restricting the SVM to map the relationship between the N-terminal sequence and their localization. The performance of SVM modules with N-terminal residue composition and remaining residue composition (input vector 40) varies from an MCC of 0.5 to 0.6 that is better than SVM modules based on N-terminal residues or full protein. Because the performance of SVM modules using 15–35 C-terminal residues was very poor (MCC ∼ 0.20), we dropped it from further analysis. The performance of SVM module-based split amino acid composition (N-terminal, C-terminal, and remaining residues) called SAAC, where input vector was 60, had an MCC from 0.5 to 0.6. Hybrid Method: Pfam Domain and SVM Modules—In the method developed by Guda et al. (15Guda C. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) prediction of mitochondrial proteins was done on the basis of occurrence of Pfam domains. We adopted a similar strategy in this study (see “Materials and Methods”). All proteins in our data set were searched using HMMER against the Pfam data base and a total of 1662 domains was found. Among 1662 domains 206 were found exclusively in mitochondrial, 1162 were found exclusively in non-mitochondrial, and 147 were found in both type of proteins. A data base called MitoPfam, was built that consists of all three types of domains. To predict whether a protein can be localized in mitochondria or not, we performed an HMM search against the MitoPfam data base. A protein was assigned as mitochondrial if it has an exclusive mitochondrial domain or as non-mitochondrial protein if it has an exclusive non-mitochondrial domain. Using this approach 798 mitochondrial and 5732 non-mitochondrial proteins were assigned. It was found that there was no hit for a large number of proteins either due to the absence of an exclusive mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial domain or to no domain present at all. Thus we developed a hybrid method that combines the SVM module based on split amino acid composition and the occurrence of Pfam domain. In the hybrid method a protein is predicted to be mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial if it has an exclusive domain. In the case where a protein does not have any exclusive domain the SVM module based on SAAC was used for prediction. The performance of this hybrid method was evaluated at various thresholds of SVM module ranging from –2 to +2 (Table 4).TABLE 4Combined result of Pfam search and SVMThresholdSensitivitySpecificityAccuracyMCC%%%-2.099.58077.40880.9340.596-1.899.23078.77082.0220.610-1.698.95080.49883.4320.628-1.498.11482.54285.020.648-1.296.92685.48887.3080.676-1.094.97288.31489.3740.708-0.892.73891.62691.8040.748-0.688.20294.52293.5180.778-0.484.01496.55494.5600.800-0.279.40498.13895.1600.8120.075.21698.97095.1940.8120.271.09899.3494.8500.7960.467.32699.68494.5400.7820.663.83899.76494.0520.7620.860.83499.89493.6840.7461.059.44099.93293.4940.741.257.83099.95893.2640.731.456.92299.97293.1280.7221.656.362100.00093.0620.7221.856.152100.00093.0280.7182.055.942100.00092.9960.716 Open table in a new tab Performance on Independent Data Set—In our previous study (19Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we observed a bias in the performance of a method on data used for testing and training despite jackknife testing (e.g. 5-fold cross-validation). Thus it is important to evaluate a newly developed method on an independent data set for unbiased evaluation. The independent data set used in this study consists of 723 yeast, 412 Drosophila, 352 C. elegans, 320 human, and 99 mouse mitochondrial proteins obtained from OrganelleDB (20Wiwatwattana N. Kumar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D598-D604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our method predicted 571, 361, 198, 277, and 76 proteins corresponding to yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans, human, and mouse, respectively, of this data set as mitochondrial at default parameters. When the same sequences were submitted for prediction on the MITOPRED server at default parameters (confidence cutoff, 85%), for yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans, human, and mouse, 480, 304, 160, 249, and 71, proteins, respectively, were predicted as mitochondrial proteins (Table 5). It has been demonstrated by Guda et al. (15Guda C. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that MITOPRED is better than existing methods like PSORT and TargetP. In their study they have clearly shown that MITOPRED shows better performance than other prediction methods like PSORT and TargetP. But the performance on the independent data set clearly shows that our method has performed even better than MITOPRED despite the fact that both are developed on the same data set. The possible reason behind this may be the fact that we have used both N- and C-terminal composition of proteins along with the composition of the remaining protein (SAAC), which is clearly a better parameter than terminal amino acid composition as shown by the performance of SVM modules.TABLE 5Performance of MitPred and MITOPRED servers on mitochondrial proteins retrieved from OrganelleDBOrganismTotal number of proteinsNumber of proteins predicted as mitochondrialMitPredMITOPREDYeast723571480C. elegans352198160Drosophila412361304Mouse997671Human320277249 Open table in a new tab Annotation of Proteomes—We chose six complete proteomes, ranging from single celled budding yeast to more complex Drosophila, C. elegans, human, and mouse, for annotation. The number of proteins predicted as mitochondrial is shown in Fig. 5. For yeast, MitPred predicted 561 proteins as mitochondrial among the total 6226, which is ∼9% of the total proteome. This is less than what others have estimated (like Guda et al. (15Guda C. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and Marcotte et al. (11Marcotte E.M. Xenarios I. van Der Bliek A.M. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12115-12120Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) who estimated 10% of the total proteomes or ∼750 proteins as determined experimentally (25Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar)), but the difference is obviously due to the fact that we adopted the most stringent condition during annotation to filter out the false positives. For Drosophila and C. elegans, the number of mitochondrial proteins predicted was 1027 (6.3%) and 1071 (4.8%), respectively, from the complete proteome of 16,177 and 22,137 proteins. In Drosophila MITOPRED has estimated that ∼6.35% is mitochondrial protein; this tallies closely with that of our estimate. For C. elegans although Guda et al. (15Guda C. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) estimated 4%, Marcotte et al. (11Marcotte E.M. Xenarios I. van Der Bliek A.M. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12115-12120Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) reported 4.3%. On the other hand for mouse and human 1144 and 1514 proteins were predicted as mitochondrial proteins from the complete proteome set of 28,936 and 35,595 proteins, respectively. In the case of human our method is consistent with the estimation of 1500 proteins by Taylor et al. (26Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Ghosh S.S. Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), Lopez et al. (27Lopez M.F. Kristal B.S. Chernokalskaya E. Lazarev A. Shestopalov A.I. Bogdanova A. Robinson M. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3427-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and Guda et al. (15Guda C. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recently Cameron et al. (28Cameron J.M. Hurd T. Robinson B.H. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1825-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have predicted the mitochondrial proteins in human by using a very novel and intelligent approach. Using MitoProt, they first predicted the proteins of yeast whose subcellular localization was likely to be mitochondria. Taking these proteins as the query, by using TBLASTN they identified the human proteins that are likely to be mitochondrial. In addition by using several stringent filters they predicted 361 human mitochondrial proteins that share close homology with yeast mitochondrial proteins. We propose that one of the main reasons behind the difference in the number of predicted mitochondrial proteins between the current method and MITOPRED is the difference between the numbers of proteins in the data downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute.

Activation of S1P1 receptors in the vascular endothelium triggers the activation of signaling cascades via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (3Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). S1P1 receptor-mediated activation of Rac1 GTPase appears to be required for many S1P-mediated cellular responses including proliferation, migration, cytoskeletal organization, trans-monolayer permeability, adherens junction assembly, and morphogenesis (4Lee M.J.

Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases and functions as a molecular switch by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form (9Kinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9786-9794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Activation of Rac1 is tightly regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that promote dissociation of GDP from Rac1, the rate-limiting step in protein activation (11Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 12Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Once activated, GTP-bound Rac1 is slowly inactivated through its intrinsic GTPase activity, a process that is enhanced by interactions between Rac1 and specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (12Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both GEFs and GAPs are themselves activated in response to extracellular stimuli, and stimulus-specific activation of Rac1 by different GEFs may help to confer specificity to Rac1-mediated cellular responses. There is a complex and incompletely understood relationship between Rac1 and its associated GEFs with inositol phosphates and phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases. The GEFs that activate Rho family proteins are characterized by a Dbl homology domain and by a pleckstrin homology domain that can bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bis-phosphate (PIP2) or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) (12Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Not only are Rac1 GEFs activated by phosphoinositides, but Rac1 itself can interact with and activate both PI 4,5-kinase and PI 3-kinase (13Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible feedback loop between Rac1 activity and PIP2 and PIP3 synthesis. Furthermore the roles of lipids and lipid kinases in Rac1 signaling appear to be stimulus- and cell type-dependent. For example, we have recently shown that down-regulation of caveolin-1, the key scaffolding protein of caveolae membrane domains, enhances S1P-mediated activation of both Rac1 and PI 3-kinase/Akt pathways (14Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the existence of common upstream modulators of S1P-mediated activation of Rac1 and of PI 3-kinase/Akt in endothelial cells. In the present study, we pursued both pharmacological approaches and siRNA-mediated protein knockdown methodologies to study the role of Rac1 in S1P-mediated PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling, and we have identified key pathways involved in Rac1 and Akt activation in response to S1P in endothelial cells.

Cell Culture and Transfections—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were obtained from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with FBS (10% v/v) as described (17Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32363-32370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 0.2% gelatin-coated culture dishes and studied prior to cell confluence between passages 5 and 9. In some cultures, BAEC were transfected with indicated plasmids (0.5 μg/plasmid) using FuGENE 6, following the instructions provided by the supplier, and were analyzed 48 h after transfection. siRNA transfections were carried out as we have described previously in detail (14Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). BAEC maintained in DMEM/10% FBS were transfected with siRNA (30 nm) using Lipofectamine 2000 (0.15% v/v), following the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Fresh medium was added 5 h post-transfection, and experiments were conducted 48 h after transfection. Drug Treatment, Cell Lysates, and Immunodetection—Culture medium was changed to serum-free medium, and incubations proceeded overnight prior to all experiments (18Igarashi J Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36281-36288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol.

S1P was solubilized in methanol and stored at –20 °C; the same volume of methanol was used as a vehicle control, and the final concentration of methanol did not exceed 0.4% (v/v). Wortmannin and PP2 were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide and kept at –20 °C; where indicated, dimethyl sulfoxide 0.1% (v/v) was used as vehicle control. After drug treatments, BAEC were washed with PBS and incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Cells were harvested by scraping and then centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. For immunoblot analyses, 20 μg of cellular protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies using protocols provided by the suppliers. Densitometric analyses of the Western blots were performed using a ChemiImager 4000 (Alpha-Innotech). Rac Activity Assay—BAEC in 100-mm dishes were stimulated with S1P in the presence or absence of inhibitors, and cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Pull-down of GTP-bound Rac was performed by incubating the cell lysates with GST fusion protein corresponding to the p21-binding domain of PAK-1 bound to glutathione-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C following instructions provided by the suppliers. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the protein bound to the beads was eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed for the amount of GTP-bound Rac by immunoblotting using a Rac monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed using a Transwell cell culture chamber containing polycarbonate membrane inserts with 8-μm pore size (Corning Costar Corp.) BAEC were transfected with control or Rac1-specific siRNA and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 0.4% FBS for 18 h before the experiments. Experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. Polycarbonate filters were coated with 0.2% gelatin. Cells were briefly incubated with trypsin to obtain a single-cell suspension, and 5 × 104 cells in DMEM/0.4% FBS were added to the upper chamber. The bottom chamber was filled with 600 μl of medium, and the assembly was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. S1P (100 nm) was added to the lower chamber, and the chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow cell migration. Membranes were washed with PBS, and cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min, and stained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells that did not migrate through the membrane were gently removed from the upper surface, and the membranes were mounted between slide and coverslips using the SlowFade® Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes Inc.) Cell migration was scored in four random fields, and each group was carried out in duplicate. Cell Growth Curves—BAEC in 12-well dishes (105 cells/well) were transfected with control or Rac1-specific siRNA, and cell growth was measured by counting the number of cells in three independent wells for each condition every 24 h using an hemocytometer. At every time point the culture medium was replaced in all samples that were not counted. S1P-mediated Rac1 Activation Is Impaired by Sequestration of Gβγ Subunits but Is Unaffected by PI 3-Kinase Inhibition—We first used pharmacological inhibitors to analyze the role of Gi proteins and PI 3-kinase in S1P-mediated activation of Rac1 and protein kinase Akt. BAEC were stimulated with S1P following treatment with pertussis toxin, with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, or with vehicle (Fig. 1A). Activation of Rac1 was measured by pull-down of active GTP-Rac1 from cell lysates using a GST-fused p21-binding domain of PAK-1; active and total Rac1 were then detected in immunoblots probed with a Rac1-specific antibody. Akt phosphorylation was detected in cell lysates in immunoblots probed with a phospho-Akt-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, pretreatment with pertussis toxin completely blocked S1P-induced Rac1 activation as well as Akt phosphorylation, consistent with previous reports showing that S1P1 receptors are coupled to Gi proteins (3Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of BAEC with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin completely blocked S1P-induced Akt phosphorylation, but S1P-mediated Rac1 activation was not significantly affected by this treatment, suggesting that activation of Rac1 by S1P does not require PI 3-kinase stimulation. Having previously observed that Gβγ subunits are required for S1P-induced Akt phosphorylation (18Igarashi J Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36281-36288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we now analyzed whether S1P-mediated Rac1 activation is also mediated by Gβγ subunits. BAEC were cotransfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged Rac1 plus βARKct, a previously described chelator of Gβγ subunits (15Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or with an empty vector. After S1P stimulation, HA-Rac1 activation was analyzed in the cell lysates by pull-down of GTP-HA-Rac1. Active and total HA-Rac1 were detected in immunoblots using a specific antibody against the HA epitope. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, overexpression of βARKct significantly impaired basal (80 ± 19% reduction compared with cells not expressing βARKct, n = 3, p < 0.05) as well as S1P-mediated Rac1 activation (76 ± 23%, n = 3, p < 0.05), suggesting an important role for G protein βγ subunits in the modulation of Rac1 activity in BAEC. Inhibition of Src Kinase Impairs S1P-mediated Rac1 Activation and Akt Phosphorylation—It has been reported previously that Gβγ subunits can interact with Src tyrosine kinase to activate members of the Rho GTPase family (20Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Chan A.S. Wong Y.H. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We explored the role of Src tyrosine kinase in S1P-mediated Rac1 activation in endothelial cells. BAEC were stimulated with S1P in the presence or absence of the Src inhibitor PP2, and activation of Rac1 was measured in the cell lysates by pull-down of GTP-Rac1 as described above. As shown in Fig. 2, pretreatment of BAEC with the Src inhibitor PP2 completely abolished S1P-mediated Rac1 activation. We also observed that the Src kinase inhibitor impaired S1P-mediated Akt phosphorylation in BAEC. By contrast to the marked inhibition by PP2 of Rac1 or Akt activation, this Src inhibitor had no substantive effect on S1P-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Previous reports have suggested that Src-mediated transactivation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2, also known as KDR) is required for S1P-mediated Akt/eNOS phosphorylation (22Tanimoto T. Jin Z.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42997-43001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To further explore a role for VEGFR2 in S1P-mediated Rac1 activation, we designed a duplex siRNA specific for the bovine isoform of VEGFR2 and analyzed the effects of siRNA-mediated VEGFR2 knockdown on S1P-induced Akt and Rac1 activation (Fig. 2C). As shown in this figure, transfection with VEGFR2-specific siRNA efficiently down-regulated the expression of VEGFR2 (∼90%), with no effect on the expression levels of Rac1 or Akt. BAEC treated with control or VEGFR2-specific siRNA were stimulated with S1P, and activation of Rac1 and phosphorylation of Akt was analyzed in the cell lysates. We observed that, despite a nearly complete abrogation of VEGFR2 expression, S1P-mediated Rac1 activation and Akt phosphorylation were not affected (Fig. 2C). These data support a role for Src kinase on S1P-mediated Akt and Rac1 activation but argue strongly against a requirement for Src-mediated VEGFR2 transactivation in this process. Effect of Rac1 Mutants on Akt Phosphorylation—We were intrigued by our observations that S1P-mediated Rac1 and Akt activation in BAEC shared similar upstream modulators, and thus we further explored the relationship between these signaling molecules. Because blocking PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling with wortmannin did not inhibit S1P-induced Rac1 activation (Fig. 1A), it seemed improbable to us that PI 3-kinase/Akt would act upstream of Rac1 in S1P-mediated signaling. To confirm this hypothesis using an alternative experimental approach, we analyzed the effects of a dominant negative (N17Rac1) or a constitutively active (V12Rac1) Rac1 mutant (23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar) on Akt phosphorylation. BAEC were cotransfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged Akt (Myc-Akt) and HA-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (HA-N17Rac1) or an HA-tagged constitutively active mutant of Rac1 (HA-V12Rac1). The transfected Myc-tagged Akt can be distinguished by its slower mobility on SDS-PAGE relative to the endogenous wild type Akt (Fig. 3). This distinctive feature of Myc-tagged Akt permits us to restrict our analyses of Akt phosphorylation to the small subset of BAEC that undergoes plasmid transfection. Phosphorylation of Akt in the cell lysates was detected by immunoblotting using a phospho-Akt-specific antibody. As expected, there was only a nominal effect of the Rac1 mutants on phosphorylation of endogenous Akt, consistent with the known low plasmid transfection efficiency in these cells. However, analysis of the slower migrating transfected Myc-Akt construct proved to be informative. As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (N17Rac1) attenuated the phosphorylation of Myc-Akt in transfected BAEC. siRNA-mediated Down-regulation of Rac1 Impairs S1P-induced Akt Signaling—We next used siRNA approaches to explore the role of endogenous Rac1 in S1P-mediated Akt activation in BAEC. In the context of prior studies of caveolin regulation, we had previously designed and validated a siRNA duplex targeted against bovine Rac1 mRNA (Rac1 siRNA); these experiments suggested that Rac1 knockdown impairs Akt phosphorylation (14Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The present studies have analyzed in greater detail the effect of Rac1 knockdown on S1P-induced Akt phosphorylation in BAEC. As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection of BAEC with Rac1 siRNA efficiently and specifically reduces expression of Rac1 protein by ∼90%. In time course experiments (Fig. 4), we found that siRNA-mediated Rac1 knockdown significantly attenuates basal and S1P-induced Akt phosphorylation compared with control siRNA-treated cells, suggesting that Rac1 is required for S1P-induced Akt activation. By contrast, we observed that siRNA-mediated Rac1 knockdown had no effect on S1P-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4), indicating a differential effect of Rac1 on ERK1/2 versus Akt activation by S1P. We next analyzed whether Rac1 knockdown would affect the phosphorylation pattern of signaling proteins downstream of Akt. We analyzed the kinase Akt substrates GSK3β and eNOS, as well as the downstream Akt effector, p70S6 kinase (24Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). BAEC were transfected with control or Rac1 siRNA, and 48 h after transfection cells were stimulated with S1P. Phosphorylations of Akt and its downstream targets were analyzed in immunoblots using phospho-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, the S1P-promoted increase in phosphorylation of eNOS, GSK3β, and p70S6 kinase was significantly attenuated in Rac1 siRNA-treated cells. Rac1 knockdown inhibited S1P-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS (33 ± 10%), GSK3β (50 ± 15%), and p70S6 kinase (94 ± 30%) when compared with control siRNA-treated cells (in each case n = 3, p < 0.05). Rac1 Knockdown Impairs Endothelial Cell Growth and S1P-mediated Endothelial Cell Migration—S1P-mediated activation of Rac1 and the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway has been correlated with a broad range of cellular effects including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and endothelial barrier enhancement (4Lee M.J.

Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17320-17328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To directly analyze the effect of Rac1 knockdown on S1P-induced endothelial cell migration we used a Transwell cell culture chamber. As shown in Fig. 6, S1P induced cell migration was significantly reduced in Rac1 siRNA-treated cells (41 ± 15%, n = 3, p < 0.01 relative to control siRNA-treated cells). We also analyzed the effect of Rac1 knockdown on endothelial cell growth (Fig. 6B) and found that siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Rac1 significantly reduced the growth rate of BAEC (48 ± 8% decrease in Rac1 siRNA-treated cells compared with control siRNA-treated BAEC, p < 0.001). Overexpression of an Inactive Mutant of Tiam1 Impairs S1P-mediated Rac1 Activation—A key step in the activation of the small GTPases of the Rho family is the recruitment of specific GEFs that allow the exchange of GDP for GTP, promoting the formation of GTP-bound active state of these GTPases. Although several molecules have been shown to have GEF activity toward Rac1, including DOCK180 (26Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), Vav2 (27Turner M Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and Tiam1 (28van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O.W. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), the specific GEF(s) involved in S1P-mediated Rac1 activation has not been yet described. Tiam1 is a ubiquitously expressed Rac1 GEF and has been found in mouse endothelial cells (29Ehler E. van Leeuwen F. Collard J.G. Salinas P.C. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tiam1 modulates the Rac1 activation mediated by lysophosphatidic acid receptors (30van Leeuwen F.N. Olivo C.

We therefore analyzed the effect of Tiam1 overexpression in the activation of Rac1 in response to S1P in bovine aortic endothelial cells. In our preliminary experiments (not shown), we found that Tiam1 is expressed in BAEC, although the commercially available Tiam1 antibody did no"

However, the administration of selective COX-2 inhibitors paradoxically increases the frequency of adverse cardiovascular events potentially through the loss of anti-inflammatory prostanoids and/or disturbance in the balance of pro- and anti-thrombotic prostanoids. To avoid these collateral effects of COX-2 inhibition, a strategy to identify and block specific prostanoid-receptor interactions may be required. We previously reported that macrophage engagement of vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) triggers proteinase expression through a MAPKerk1/2-dependent increase in COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis. Here we demonstrate that elicited macrophages express the PGE2 receptors EP1–4. When plated on ECM, their expression of EP2 and EP4, receptors linked to PGE2-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase, is strongly stimulated. Forskolin and dibutryl cyclic-AMP stimulate macrophage matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression in a dose-dependent manner. However, an EP2 agonist (butaprost) has no effect on MMP-9 expression, and macrophages from EP2 null mice exhibited enhanced COX-2 and MMP-9 expression when plated on ECM. In contrast, the EP4 agonist (PGE1-OH) stimulated macrophage MMP-9 expression, which was inhibited by the EP4 antagonist ONO-AE3-208. When compared with COX-2 silencing by small interfering RNA or inhibition by celecoxib, the EP4 antagonist was as effective in inhibiting ECM-induced proteinase expression. In addition, ECM-induced MMP-9 expression was blocked in macrophages in which EP4 was silenced by small interfering RNA. Thus, COX-2-dependent ECM-induced proteinase expression is effectively blocked by selective inhibition of EP4, a member of the PGE2 family of receptors.

A substantial body of evidence has identified cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 as a targetable component of the signaling pathway responsible for increased proteinase expression by macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions.

Finally, a naturally occurring polymorphism in the COX-2 promoter that is associated with reduced expression appears to protect against myocardial infarction and stroke (25Cipollone F. Toniato E.

Cuccurullo F. Mezzetti A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2004; 291: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that selective inhibition of COX-2 would lead to reduced PGE2 and MMP expression, resulting in greater plaque stability. However, recent data indicate that administration of COX-2-selective inhibitors increases adverse cardiovascular events (26Ray W.A. Stein M. Daugherty J.R. Hall K. Arbogast P.G. Griffin M.R. Lancet. 2002; 360: 1071-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 27Mukherjee D.M. Nissen S.E. Topol E.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). The explanation for this effect is not fully understood; however, inhibition of COX-2 results in the loss of all downstream PGs, some of which have anti-inflammatory functions (28De Gaetano G. Donati M.B. Cerletti C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Likewise, it has been suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors block PGI2 production by vascular endothelium, without inhibiting COX-1-dependent platelet thromboxane A2 expression, thereby supporting a pro-thrombotic state (29McAdam B.F. Catella-Lawson F. Mardini I.A. Kapoor S. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar, 30Cheng Y. Austin S.C. Rocca B. Koller B.H. Coffman T.M. Grosser T. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Science. 2002; 296: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Finally, several cyclooxygenase-independent effects of the COX-2 inhibitors have been described (31Hwang D.H. Fung V. Dannenberg A.J. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 91-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may contribute to adverse cardiovascular events. Despite the adverse cardiovascular events associated with selective COX-2 inhibition, the COX-2-PGE2-MMP-9 axis remains an attractive target to block macrophage proteinase expression at sites of chronic inflammation. In this regard, we previously reported that macrophage engagement of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived ECM triggers proteinase expression through a protein kinase C-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2, which leads to increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis (32Khan K.M. Howe L.R. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22039-22046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Selective inhibition of macrophage COX-2 activity blocked ECM-induced proteinase expression and ECM-induced PGE2 production, and MMP-9 expression was markedly reduced in COX-2–/– macrophages compared with wild type macrophages (32Khan K.M. Howe L.R. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22039-22046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In studies reported here, we have determined whether selective inhibition of the PGE2 receptor family (EP1–4) can attenuate ECM-induced MMP-9 expression by macrophages. We demonstrate that thioglycollate-elicited macrophages express EP1–4. When plated on ECM, their expression of EP2 and EP4, receptors linked to PGE2-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase (33Regan J.W. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), is strongly stimulated. Although forskolin and dibutryl cAMP stimulate macrophage MMP-9 expression in a dose-dependent manner, the selective EP2 agonist (butaprost) has no effect on macrophage MMP-9 expression, and macrophages from EP2 null mice exhibited enhanced COX-2 and MMP-9 expression when plated on ECM. In contrast, a selective EP4 agonist (PGE1-OH) stimulated macrophage MMP-9 expression, which was inhibited by the EP4 antagonist ONO-AE3-208. Finally, preincubation of macrophages with the EP4 antagonist or inhibition of their EP4 expression by siRNA was as effective in inhibiting ECM-induced MMP-9 expression as treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib or inhibition of COX-2 expression by siRNA. Thus, COX-2-dependent ECM-induced proteinase expression is markedly attenuated by selective inhibition of EP4, a member of the PGE2 family of receptors. Isolation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained from Swiss Webster, EP2 wild type, and EP2 null mice (34Kennedy C.R. Zhang Y. Brandon S. Guan Y.

Physiol. 1988; 135: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mice were injected intraperitoneally (3 ml/mouse) with 3% Brewer thioglycollate medium containing 0.3 mm thioglycollate (Difco). Four days later cells were harvested by lavage with cold DPBS. Peritoneal cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Cellect Gold fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 4 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) and plated into tissue culture flasks or multiwell plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 4 h and then were washed free of nonadherent cells. Experiments to determine the effect of matrix on macrophage proteinase expression were carried out in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% low endotoxin bovine serum albumin. Murine Macrophage Cell Line—RAW264.7 macrophages (37Raschke W.C. Baird S. Ralph P. Nakoinz I. Cell. 1978; 15: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained as adherent cultures in DMEM-10% FBS. Preparation of Extracellular Matrix-coated Dishes—SMC-derived matrices were prepared as previously described (38Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Vergilio J.-A. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11951-11958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC; VEC Technologies, Inc.) were plated into 6-, 12-, or 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with supplied growth medium. 3–4 days after reaching confluence, the cell layer was removed by sequential exposure to 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS (2 min at room temperature) and 0.2 mm NH4OH in DPBS (2 min at room temperature). The remaining insoluble matrices were washed 3× with DPBS and stored at 4 °C. RT-PCR—RNA was prepared using RNeasy Mini kits from Qiagen. RNA (2 μg) was reversed-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) and oligo d(T)16 primer. The resulting cDNA was then used for amplification. The PCR reaction volume was 25 μl and contained 5 μl of cDNA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 400 nm forward primer, 400 nm reverse primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in a thermocycler under the following conditions. For EP1, denature for 30 s at 95 °C, anneal for 30 s at 60 °C, and extend for 45 s at 70 °C; repeat for 35 cycles with a final extension for 10 min at 70 °C. For EP2 and EP4, denature for 30 s at 95 °C, anneal for 30 s at 62 °C, and extend for 45 s at 70 °C; repeat for 35 cycles with a final extension for 10 min at 70 °C.

For COX-2, denature for 20 s at 94 °C, anneal for 20 s at 65 °C, and extend for 30 s at 72 °C; repeat for 35 cycles with a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Primers for murine EP1 were: sense, 5′-TTAACCTGAGCCTAGCGGAT-3′ (nucleotides 311–331), and antisense, 5′-CGCTGAGCGTATTGCACACTA-3′ (nucleotides 955–976); primers for murine EP2 were sense, 5′-GTGGCCCTGGCTCCCGAAA GTC-3′, (nucleotides 446–468) and antisense, 5′-GGCAAGGAGCATATGGCGAAGGTG-3′ (nucleotides 957–981); primers for murine EP3 were sense, 5′-CCGGGCACGTGGTGCTTCAT-3′ (nucleotides 538–557), and antisense, 5′-TAGCAGCAGATAAACCCAGG-3′ (nucleotides 956–975); primers for murine EP4 were sense, 5′-TTCCGCTCGTGGTGCGAGTGTTC-3′ (nucleo-tides 1074–1097), and antisense, 5′-GAGGTGGTG TCTGCTTGGGTCAG-3′ (nucleotides 1539–1562).

Primers for murine COX-2 were sense, 5′-GGTCTGGTGCCT GGTCTGATGATG-3′ (nucleotides 935–958), and antisense, 5′-GTCCTTTCAAGGAGAATGGTGC-3′ (nucleotides 1637–1658). The primers for β-actin were forward, 5′-GGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGATGCCACAGGACTCCATGC-3′. PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Macrophages were lysed in Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were recovered, normalized for protein, mixed with SDS sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of cell lysates were applied to gels based on protein content. Determination of Metalloproteinase Activity—The presence of metalloproteinase activity in cellular-conditioned media was determined utilizing enzyme zymography as previously described (39Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were mixed with SDS sample buffer (without mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples and molecular weight markers were electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. The gel was then washed (2×) in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS. The gel was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in 200 mm NaCl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.5) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The presence of gelatinolytic activity was identified as clear bands on a uniform blue background after destaining. Western Blot Identification of MMP-9—Macrophage-conditioned media were electrophoresed in 4–15% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After transfer, the membrane was placed in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed in PBS (1×), and incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer containing rabbit anti-mouse MMP-9 IgG (Chemicon). The membrane was washed (2×) in 25 mm Tris buffer (pH 8) containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.5% Tween (TTBS) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP (Transduction Laboratories). The membrane was washed (3×) in TTBS, and bound HRP was visualized utilizing enhanced chemiluminescence. Western Blot Identification of Phosphorylated MAPKerk1/2 and p38— Cell lysates were electrophoresed in gradient gels, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then blocked. Following 1 wash in TTBS, the membrane was incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 75 ng/ml rabbit anti-phosphospecific p44/p42 MAPK IgG or rabbit anti-phosphospecific p38 MAPK IgG (Cell Signaling Technology). The membranes were washed (2×; TTBS) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP. After visualization of bound HRP, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.7) containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C, washed, and probed for total MAPKerk1/2 or p38 (Cell Signaling Technology). Western Blot Identification of COX-2—Cell lysates were electrophoresed in gradient gels, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After transfer, the membrane was blocked, washed in PBS (1×), and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml rabbit IgG raised against a peptide containing amino acids 584–598 of murine COX-2 (Cayman Chemical). The membrane was washed (2×; TTBS) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP. COX-2 siRNA Transfection—RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected with COX-2 siRNA (Santa Cruz) or mock-transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol, which was modified as follows. Macrophages (T-75 flask) were washed 3× with DPBS to remove serum, and medium was replaced with antibiotic-free DMEM. The cells were mechanically harvested, recovered by centrifugation, and resuspended in antibiotic-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells (2 × 106/well) were separated into aliquots in a 6-well plate and incubated overnight. The next morning, 9.1 μl of 10 μm COX-2 siRNA was added to 152 μl of transfection medium (Santa Cruz) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. In another tube 9.1 μl of the transfection reagent (Santa Cruz) was added to the transfection medium and incubated for 5 min. The two tubes were combined and incubated for 20 min to form the siRNA transfection reagent complex. Immediately before transfection, macrophage medium was removed and replaced with 1.5 ml of antibiotic-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The plate was placed on a rocker plate in the laminar flow hood, and the transfection reagent complex was added dropwise. Cells were incubated for 30 h at 37 °C. EP4 siRNA Transfection—RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected with EP4 or control siRNA (Dharmacon RNA Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol, which was modified as follows. Macrophages (0.5 × 106/well) were separated into aliquots into a 6-well plate and incubated overnight in serum and antibiotic-free DMEM. The next morning 200 μl of 1 μm siRNA was added to 200 μl of diluted (1:50) DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent, incubated for 20 min, and added to 1.6 ml of DMEM containing antibiotics and 10% FBS. Immediately before transfection, macrophage medium was removed and replaced with 2 ml of the transfection medium. Cells were incubated 24 h at 37 °C. ECM Stimulates Macrophage Expression of EP2 and EP4 Prostanoid Receptors—The diverse physiological and pathophysiological effects of PGE2 are mediated by engagement of the EP family of G-protein-coupled prostanoid receptors (40Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 41Hata A.N. Breyer R.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 147-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The EP family is comprised of four subtypes (EP1–4), which exhibit varying affinities for PGE2 and trigger distinct signaling pathways. Differential expression of PGE2 receptors has been reported for macrophages stimulated with LPS (42Hubbard N.E. Lee S. Lim D. Erickson K.L. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2001; 65: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43Ikegami R. Sugimoto Y. Segi E. Katsuyama M. Karahashi H. Amano F. Maruyama T. Yamane H. Tsuchiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the influence of ECM on macrophage PGE2 receptor expression is unknown. Therefore, we cultured thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages on an ECM deposited in situ by rat vascular smooth muscle cells and determined its effect on EP1–4 receptor mRNA utilizing RT-PCR (Fig. 1). Elicited macrophages cultured on tissue culture plastic expressed all PGE2 receptors (EP1–4). When plated on vascular ECM, macrophage EP2 and EP4 expression were markedly induced, whereas EP1 and EP3 expression was unchanged. Similar results were observed utilizing the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (data not shown). Macrophage engagement of ECM triggers protein kinase C-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2, which leads to the stimulation of COX-2 expression and MMP-9 synthesis (32Khan K.M. Howe L.R. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22039-22046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and activation with LPS triggers the p38-dependent increase in COX-2 expression and MMP-9 synthesis (44Chen B.C. Chen Y.H. Lin W.W. Immunology. 1999; 97: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, signaling through the MAPK cascade regulates COX-2 and MMP-9 expression by macrophages. Therefore, we determined whether the observed ECM-dependent increase in EP2 and EP4 expression (Fig. 1) was also dependent on the MAPK cascade. As observed in Fig. 2A, levels of phosphorylated MAPKerk1/2 and p38 were increased when cells were plated on SMC-ECM (Fig. 2A). Preincubation of cells with an inhibitor of protein kinase C (calphostin C) or MEK-1 (U0126) blocked ECM-induced activation of MAPKerk1/2. In contrast, ECM-induced levels of phosphorylated p38 were slightly increased in cells preincubated with calphostin C and decreased in cells incubated with U0126. Equal protein loading was confirmed by probing for total MAPKerk1/2 and p38. The causal relationship between MAPKerk1/2 activation and ECM-induced MMP-9 expression is shown in Fig. 2B. As previously reported, the expression of MMP-9 by macrophages cultured on SMC-ECM was markedly elevated as compared with that in cells cultured on plastic (32Khan K.M. Howe L.R. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22039-22046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Virtually all the MMP-9 secreted by murine macrophages was in the pro form (105 kDa), which is slightly larger than that expressed by human cells (92 kDa). High molecular weight multimers of MMP-9 are also visible in some preparations. Preincubation of macrophages with U0126 completely blocked ECM-induced MMP-9 expression; in contrast, proteinase expression was partially attenuated by exposure to a p38 inhibitor (SB202190; Calbiochem). We next determined the role of MAPKerk1/2 and p38 on ECM-induced EP2 and EP4 expression. RNA isolated from elicited macrophages plated on ECM in the presence of a MEK-1 or p38 inhibitor was probed for expression of EP2 and EP4 utilizing RT-PCR. ECM-induced expression of the PGE2 receptors was blocked by preincubation with the MEK-1 inhibitor, whereas inhibition of p38 had no effect (Fig. 2C). Taken together with earlier studies (32Khan K.M. Howe L.R. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22039-22046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), these data demonstrate that ECM-induced activation of MAPKerk1/2 after macrophage engagement"
https://openalex.org/W2020552978,"MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the proteasomal degradation and activity of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma and the transcription factor E2F1. Although the effect of several MDM2 targets on cardiomyocyte survival and hypertrophy has already been investigated, the role of MDM2 in these processes has not yet been established. We have, therefore, analyzed the effect of overexpression as well as inhibition of MDM2 on cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury and hypertrophy. Here we show that isolated cardiac myocytes overexpressing MDM2 acquired resistance to hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death. Conversely, inactivation of MDM2 by a peptide inhibitor resulted in elevated p53 levels and promoted hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this, decreased expression of MDM2 in a genetic mouse model was accompanied by reduced functional recovery of the left ventricles determined with the Langendorff ex vivo model of ischemia/reperfusion. In contrast to cell survival, cell hypertrophy induced by the α-agonists phenylephrine or endothelin-1 was inhibited by MDM2 overexpression. Collectively, our studies indicate that MDM2 promotes survival and attenuates hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes. This differential regulation of cell growth and cell survival is unique, because most other survival factors are prohypertrophic. MDM2, therefore, might be a potential therapeutic target to down-regulate both cell death and pathologic hypertrophy during remodeling upon cardiac infarction. In addition, our data also suggest that cancer treatments with MDM2 inhibitors to reactivate p53 may have adverse cardiac side effects by promoting cardiomyocyte death.

Yang-Feng T. Francke U. George D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Fakharzadeh S. Trusko S. George D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the mdm2 gene product was shown to lead to transformation, which requires the binding of MDM2 to the tumor suppressor p53 (3Oliner J. Kinzler K. Meltzer P. George D. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Through this protein-protein interaction, MDM2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 (4Momand J. Zambetti G. Olson D. George D. Levine A. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). In addition, MDM2 also promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p53 by functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (5Kubbutat M. Jones S. Vousden K. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar, 6Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). p53 exerts its tumor suppressor effect by transcriptionally activating many target genes, including p21 and PUMA/Noxa, thereby promoting growth arrest both at G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle and programmed cell death (apoptosis), respectively (7Harris S. Levine A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Another transcriptional target of p53 is MDM2 itself, providing an autoregulatory negative feedback loop with a significant role in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis (7Harris S. Levine A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 8Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The importance of the MDM2/p53 interaction has been convincingly demonstrated by in vivo studies. Mice lacking mdm2 are embryonic lethal and die before implantation as early as the blastocyst stage (9Iwakuma T. Lozano G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is completely rescued by concomitant deletion of p53 (10Jones S. Roe A. Donehower L. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 11Montes D.O.L.R. Wagner D. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), suggesting that the embryo lethality was due to active p53. In recent studies a mouse model with a hypomorphic allele has been developed that expresses ∼30% of the total MDM2 levels (12Mendrysa S. McElwee M. Michalowski J. O'Leary K. Young K. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), providing an excellent tool to examine the effects of the loss of MDM2 on adult animals. These mice have decreased body weight and defects in hematopoiesis and are more sensitive to γ-irradiation than normal mice (12Mendrysa S. McElwee M. Michalowski J. O'Leary K. Young K. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of the hearts from these mice to ischemia/reperfusion, however, has not yet been characterized. In addition to transcriptional regulation, several proteins interact with MDM2, leading to its posttranslational modification and changes in its ability to interact with p53 (9Iwakuma T. Lozano G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar). One of these upstream regulators is the protein serine/threonine kinase Akt. It phosphorylates MDM2 at two consensus sites that results in stabilization of MDM2 via decreased ubiquitination (13Feng J. Tamaskovic R. Yang Z. Brazil D. Merlo A. Hess D. Hemmings B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35510-35517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 14Zhou B. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, insulin-like growth factor 1 was suggested not only to induce MDM2 but also to down-regulate p53, leading to attenuation of the renin-angiotensin system and stretch-mediated apoptosis (28Leri A.

The role of MDM2 in ischemia/reperfusion injury and hypertrophy, however, has not yet been investigated. In the current study we, therefore, analyzed the effect of MDM2 on cell survival and hypertrophy by using isolated cardiac myocytes as well as a genetic mouse model with reduced expression of MDM2. To our knowledge, these experiments demonstrate for the first time that the endogenous MDM2 plays a role in protection against cell death of ischemic/reperfused cardiomyocytes and negatively regulates hypertrophy. MDM2, therefore, emerges as a novel regulator of cardiac cell survival and growth and potentially may serve as a target for cardiac gene therapy. Preparation of Adenoviruses—MDM2 adenovirus was generated by using the Adeno-X Tet-Off gene expression system (Clontech Laboratories). First, a Tet-responsive expression cassette was made by cloning the mouse mdm2 cDNA (2Fakharzadeh S. Trusko S. George D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number X58876) into the pTRE-Shuttle plasmid. Then it was amplified in Escherichia coli, and the expression cassette was excised from pTRE-Shuttle with PI-SceI and I-CeuI and ligated into pAdeno-X Viral DNA (the adenoviral genome). The recombinant pAdeno-X was selected upon transformation of E. coli, then purified and linearized with PacI digestion. This linearized recombinant vector was packaged into infectious adenoviral particles by transfecting human embryonic kidney 293 cells (Microbix Biosystems) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Recombinant adenoviruses were finally harvested by lysing transfected cells. Isolation of Primary Cardiomyocytes and Adenoviral Infections— Neonatal cardiac myocytes were prepared using a Percoll gradient method as described earlier (32Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V. Ross J. Brown J. Han J. Chien K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Myocytes from 1-2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured in a serum-containing medium (4:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:medium 199, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm glutamine). In accordance with literature data (33Soonpaa M. Kim K. Pajak L. Franklin M. Field L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2183-H2189PubMed Google Scholar), bromodeoxyuridine staining showed that less than 5% of the neonatal cardiomyocytes were cycling. Cardiac myocytes were infected with adenoviruses (multiplicity of infection of 10-50 plaque-forming units/cell) encoding MDM2 and tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) (AdtTA) or β-galactosidase (Adβ-gal) and tTA for the indicated times (Fig. 1). In Vitro Hypoxia/Reoxygenation—Two days after isolation, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured in glucose- and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under hypoxic conditions as described earlier, with some modifications (34Yue T. Wang C. Gu J. Ma X. Kumar S. Lee J. Feuerstein G. Thomas H. Maleeff B. Ohlstein E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Hypoxia was achieved by incubating cells in a humidified environment at 37 °C in a 3-gas incubator maintained at 5% CO2 and 1% O2 for 12 h or for 4 h when it was combined with MDM2 inhibitor treatments (Fig. 1). Subsequently, half of the samples were reoxygenated for 16 h in maintenance medium. Certain samples were pretreated overnight with MDM2 adenoviruses or with an MDM2 inhibitor (PNC-28; 100 μg/ml; Calbiochem), which is a peptide mimicking the MDM2 binding domain of p53 and carries a penetratin sequence to help the inhibitor enter the cells (35Kanovsky M. Raffo A. Drew L. Rosal R. Do T. Friedman F. Rubinstein P. Visser J. Robinson R. Brandt-Rauf P. Michl J. Fine R. Pincus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12438-12443Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have used this MDM2-binding peptide domain of p53 because the x-ray structure of its complex with the MDM2 protein has been elucidated (36Kussie P. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A. Pavletich N. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). The PNC-28 peptide corresponds to the specific region of human p53 between residues 12-26 (PLSQETFSDLWKLL) that contacts MDM2 (36Kussie P. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A. Pavletich N. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). These data indicate that PNC-28 specifically binds to MDM2. After treatment, the samples were processed for immunocytochemistry or Western blots. In Vitro Hypertrophy—Hypertrophy was analyzed as previously described with minor modifications (37Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). After isolation, cardiac myocytes were cultured in a serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% Nutridoma (Roche Applied Science). Cells were infected with the indicated adenoviruses 24 h after initial plating. 36 h after infection, cells were stimulated with phenylephrine (PE, 100 μm) or endothelin-1 (ET-1, 100 nm) for an additional 36 h. Subsequently, the samples were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and processed for immunocytochemistry. Alternatively, in the last 24 h of the experiment, cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to measure protein synthesis. Radioactivity incorporated into the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. Immunocytochemistry—Cardiac myocytes were grown on laminin-coated glass coverslips. Apoptotic cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) method (Roche Applied Science). Sections were co-stained with anti-MDM2 (Ab2, Calbiochem) or anti-sarcomeric actinin (Sigma) antibodies, and the nuclear stains TO-PRO-3 or Syto-16 (Molecular Probes). Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was demonstrated by staining the cells with antibodies against sarcomeric actinin and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (Peninsula Laboratories) together with TOPRO-3. Images were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed as described earlier (38Erhardt P. Schremser E. Cooper G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5308-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells or tissues were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer complemented with protease inhibitors. Protein samples (10-20 μg) were electrophoresed in 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies specific for actin (Sigma), MDM2, p53 (Roche Applied Science), p21 (Pharmingen), cleaved caspase-3, Akt, and phospho-Akt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The proteins were identified using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Generation of a Hypomorphic mdm2 Mouse Line—Mendrysa et al. (12Mendrysa S. McElwee M. Michalowski J. O'Leary K. Young K. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have recently developed a mouse model with a hypomorphic mdm2 allele. The mice in this model system may carry different combinations of three alleles. Besides the fully active wild-type allele (mdm2wt), these include the partially active hypomorphic mdm2puro, which contains a puromycin resistance cassette, and the inactive mdm2del7-9, in which exons 7-9 have been deleted by Cre recombination. As a result, the mdm2wt/del7-9 and mdm2puro/del7-9 mice exhibited decreased MDM2 expression (∼50 and 30% of total MDM2, respectively) throughout the body whenwt/puro compared with the levels expressed in mdm2wt/wt and mdm2 mice (12Mendrysa S. McElwee M. Michalowski J. O'Leary K. Young K. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We obtained mouse breeding pairs from the National Cancer Institute Mouse Repository and mated them according to a protocol published earlier (12Mendrysa S. McElwee M. Michalowski J. O'Leary K. Young K. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, mdm2wt/del7-9 (B6.Cg genetic background) and mdm2wt/puro (129/SvEv genetic background) mice were crossed gave birth mdm2wt/wt, mdm2wt/puro, mdmwt/del7-9, and mdm2puro/del7-9 mice. These mice were genotyped using the previously published primers (12Mendrysa S. McElwee M. Michalowski J. O'Leary K. Young K. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and the MDM2 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblots using mouse heart lysates (see Fig. 4A). All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Langendorff Heart Perfusion—The heart perfusion protocol we published earlier for rats was adapted for mice using a system purchased from ADInstruments (39Toth A. Halmosi R. Kovacs K. Deres P. Kalai T. Hideg K. Toth K. Sumegi B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal), and the hearts were rapidly excised and placed into ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Hearts were retrograde perfused at a constant pressure (80 mm Hg) with a flow rate of 1-3 ml/min. The perfusion buffer was a modified phosphate-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer that contained 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose. The perfusate was equilibrated at 37 °C with 95% O2, 5%CO2 through a glass oxygenator to achieve pH 7.4. Hearts were exposed to a 20-min base-line perfusion, then subjected to 15-min no-flow ischemia and subsequently reperfused for 120 min. Hearts were paced at 7 Hz through platinum wires placed on the epicardial surface of the right ventricle; however, the pacer was turned off during ischemia. To measure left ventricular function, a small custom-made polyvinyl chloride balloon was inserted into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and filled to achieve an end-diastolic pressure of 8-12 mm Hg. Functional data of mouse hearts (left ventricular developed pressure, dP/dtmax, and dP/dtmin) were monitored during the entire perfusion using a data acquisition system (Powerlab, ADInstruments). To determine the infarct size, 2-mm-thick slices of the ventricle were immersed into 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution (TCI America) in phosphate buffer at 37 °C for 10 min (18Matsui T. Tao J. del M.F. Lee K. Li L. Picard M. Force T. Franke T. Hajjar R. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To detect necrotic membrane damage, coronary effluent was collected during base-line perfusion and reperfusion for lactate dehydrogenase activity measurement (U. S. Biological). For histological analysis, hearts were collected, fixed overnight in 10% formalin buffered with phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in ethanol, and transferred to xylene and then into paraffin. Paraffin-embedded hearts were sectioned at 4 μm and subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The cardiac myocyte cross-sectional area was determined with the Image J software at the same magnification in the midventricular sections of each heart. The myocyte cross-sectional area was measured per nucleus, and only myocytes that were cut in the same direction were included in the measurement. MDM2 Overexpression Protects Cardiac Myocytes against Hypoxia/Reoxygenation-induced Apoptosis—To investigate the potential prosurvival activity of MDM2 in cardiac myocytes, isolated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing MDM2 in a tetracycline-regulated manner using the Tet-Off system (see Fig. 1 for treatment protocol). Under these circumstances a high level of MDM2 expression was achieved in the absence of tetracycline (-Tet) in most cells, with a transduction efficiency of 90% or more (Fig. 2, A-C). This high level of MDM2 expression was accompanied with increased Akt activity (Fig. 2A) and maintained at least for 72 h (not shown). In contrast, overexpression of MDM2 was completely eliminated by the addition of tetracycline (+Tet) to the culture medium (Fig. 2, A-C). The ability of the overexpressed MDM2 to promote p53 degradation has also been demonstrated (Fig. 2A). In control cells without adenoviral infection or with MDM2 virus infection under +Tet conditions, hypoxia resulted in ∼50% apoptosis scored by TUNEL assay (Fig. 2, C-D). Most importantly, MDM2 over-expression reduced the rate of apoptosis elicited by hypoxia by approximately half, resulting in 23% TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 2, C-D). Hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis followed a similar pattern; however, the cells were more sensitive and more than 90% of them underwent apoptosis. This was partially prevented by overexpression of MDM2, allowing 43% of the cells to survive (Fig. 2, C-D). In both cases the protective effect was attributable to elevated levels of MDM2 because infection with an MDM2 virus in the presence of tetracycline (or treatment with Adβ-gal + AdtTA + Tet) did not prevent either hypoxia- or hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2, C-D). The specificity of the TUNEL assay for apoptosis in this model was confirmed by examining nuclear morphology using the DNA stain TOPRO-3 (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that MDM2 attenuates cardiac myocyte apoptosis in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Because earlier studies reported that targeted deletion of p53 is not sufficient to block the apoptotic response of cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia/reperfusion (40Bialik S. Geenen D. Sasson I. Cheng R. Horner J. Evans S. Lord E. Koch C. Kitsis R. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 41Webster K. Discher D. Kaiser S. Hernandez O. Sato B. Bishopric N. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our findings also suggest that the ectopically overexpressed MDM2 does not exclusively act on p53 but also suppresses p53-independent cell death pathways. MDM2 Inhibition Exacerbates Hypoxia/Reoxygenation-induced Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis—Because adenoviral delivery of MDM2 facilitated the survival of hypoxic/reoxygenated cardiac myocytes, we asked whether endogenous MDM2 is required for cardiomyocyte survival. To this end, we have analyzed the effect of MDM2 inhibition on the viability of cardiomyocytes during hypoxia/reoxygenation. To block MDM2 activity, we applied a peptide inhibitor (PNC-28) described earlier that mimics the MDM2 binding domain of p53 (35Kanovsky M. Raffo A. Drew L. Rosal R. Do T. Friedman F. Rubinstein P. Visser J. Robinson R. Brandt-Rauf P. Michl J. Fine R. Pincus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12438-12443Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is thought to exert its effect primarily by occupying the p53 binding pocket of MDM2, thereby leading to stabilization of p53, followed by proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. We administered PNC-28 to cardiac myocytes exposed to normoxia, hypoxia, or hypoxia/reoxygenation (see Fig. 1 for the treatment protocol). In these experiments we decreased the duration of the hypoxic period from 12 to 4 h because of the enhanced sensitivity of cells to double treatments. When the MDM2 inhibitor was used under normoxic conditions, ∼30% of the cells died by apoptosis as opposed to less than 5% death of the non-treated cells (Fig. 3, A-B). This was accompanied by only a small increase in p53 levels and caspase-3 cleavage, similar to that observed under hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation without the MDM2 inhibitor (Fig. 3C). When PNC-28 was combined with hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation, the two treatments potentiated each other, leading to apoptosis in ∼90 and 95%, respectively (Fig. 3, A-B), and a stronger increase in p53 and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3C). In addition, we detected similar levels of MDM2 expression in all samples except for a decrease upon hypoxia/reoxygenation, probably because of the cleavage of MDM2 by caspases (42Erhardt P. Tomaselli K. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15049-15052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that blocking MDM2 activity in cardiac myocytes can exacerbate hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Our results imply that the endogenous MDM2 at least partially controls p53 in cardiac myocytes under both normoxic and hypoxic/reoxygenated conditions and promotes cardiomyocyte survival. Impaired Tolerance of Hearts with Reduced MDM2 Expression to Ischemia/Reperfusion—Because inhibition of MDM2 activity sensitizes cardiac myocytes to hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death in vitro, we hypothesized that the endogenous MDM2 might be required for preserving the functional performance and cardiomyocyte viability of intact hearts challenged by ischemia/reperfusion. To test this hypothesis in adult animals, we utilized a transgenic mouse model with reduced MDM2 expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). We have chosen this hypomorphic mdm2 system because mdm2 knock-out mice are embryonic lethal, and generation of viable littermates without functional mdm2 gene is only feasible with simultaneous p53 gene deletion (9Iwakuma T. Lozano G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jones S. Roe A. Donehower L. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 11Montes D.O.L."

Arrestins also bind active unphosphorylated and inactive phosphorylated receptors. Binding to the non-preferred forms of the receptor is important for visual arrestin translocation in rod photoreceptors and the regulation of receptor signaling and trafficking by non-visual arrestins. Given the importance of arrestin interactions with the various functional forms of the receptor, we performed an extensive analysis of the receptor-binding surface of arrestin using site-directed mutagenesis. The data indicated that a large number of surface charges are important for arrestin interaction with all forms of the receptor. Arrestin elements involved in receptor binding are differentially engaged by the various functional forms of the receptor, each requiring a unique subset of arrestin residues in a specific spatial configuration. We identified several additional phosphate-binding elements in the N-domain and demonstrated for the first time that the active receptor preferentially engages the arrestin C-domain. We also found that the interdomain contact surface is important for arrestin interaction with the non-preferred forms of the receptor and that residues in this region play a role in arrestin transition into its high affinity receptor binding state.

Receptor-bound arrestin can serve as an adaptor linking the complex to the internalization machinery of the coated pit through its binding to clathrin and AP2 (1Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E.

The molecular mechanism that governs arrestin-receptor interaction was first elucidated on the visual arrestin-rhodopsin model. Visual arrestin binds light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin (P-Rh*) 3The abbreviations used are: P-Rh*, light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin; Rh, light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin; P-Rh, inactive phosphorhodopsin. with remarkable selectivity, whereas its binding to an equal amount of dark (inactive) phosphorhodopsin (P-Rh) or light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin (Rh*) is 10-20 times lower (7Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A model of sequential multisite binding was proposed to explain the selectivity of arrestin for P-Rh*. This model posits that arrestin has two “sensor” sites, detecting the phosphorylation and activation status of the receptor, respectively, and that simultaneous engagement of both sensors causes a global conformation change in arrestin, i.e. its transition into the active high affinity receptor binding state (reviewed in Ref. 11Gurevich V.V.

It was shown that receptor-attached phosphates must break the salt bridge between Arg-175 and Asp-296 to destabilize the polar core and make high affinity arrestin binding possible (9Vishnivetskiy S.A.

Although the “activation sensor” has yet to be identified, it has been proposed to be at the contact point between the N- and C-domains since it is the only stabilizing intramolecular interaction in arrestin that is not affected by phosphates (11Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 59-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).

The size of the receptor-binding surface indicates that either a small number of interacting residues are scattered throughout the whole span of the molecule or a large number of arrestin residues directly participate in receptor binding. Here we used site-directed mutagenesis to discriminate between these two possibilities and to determine the importance of individual charged residues on the surface of arrestin in its binding to rhodopsin. Our results showed that >25 charged residues are differentially involved in arrestin interactions with the various functional forms of the receptor and demonstrated for the first time that the stability of the interdomain region is important for high affinity arrestin binding. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP, [14C]leucine, and [3H]leucine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Sepharose 2B and all other chemicals were from sources previously described (17Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Ambion, and SP6 RNA polymerase was prepared as described (18Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 11-cis-retinal was generously supplied by Dr. R. K. Crouch. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Bovine visual arrestin cDNA was a gift from Dr. T. Shinohara. The plasmid pARR-VSP was constructed and modified as described (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J.

Mutations were introduced by PCR using an appropriate mutagenizing oligonucleotide as a forward primer and an oligonucleotide downstream from the far restriction site to be used for subcloning as a reverse primer. Resulting fragments of various lengths and an appropriate primer upstream of the near restriction site were then used as reverse and forward primers, respectively, for the second round of PCR. Sites BamHI and SacII were used for mutations in the N-domain, and sites SacII and HindIII were used for mutations in the C-domain. The resulting fragments were purified, digested with the appropriate enzymes, and subcloned into the appropriately digested pARR-VSP plasmid. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Evaluation of Mutant Stability—pGEM2-based plasmids with the arrestin coding sequence equipped with the “idealized” 5′-untranslated region (18Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) under the control of the SP6 promoter were linearized using the HindIII site downstream of the coding sequence before in vitro transcription. In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (17Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All arrestin proteins were labeled by the incorporation of [3H]leucine and [14C]leucine with the specific activity of the mix between 1.5 and 3 Ci/mmol, resulting in the specific activity of arrestin proteins within the range of 66-85 Ci/mmol (150-230 dpm/fmol). The translation of every mutant used in this study produced a single labeled protein band with the expected mobility on SDS-PAGE. The relative stability of all mutants (assessed as described (14Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)) exceeded 80%. Direct Arrestin Binding to Different Functional Forms of Rhodopsin—The assay was performed as described previously (17Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated radiolabeled arrestins (100 fmol) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm potassium acetate for 5 min at 37 °C with 0.3 μg of the indicated form of rhodopsin in room light (Rh* and P-Rh*) or in the dark (Rh and P-Rh) and then quickly cooled on ice. Rhodopsin-containing membranes along with bound arrestin were separated by size-exclusion chromatography on 2-ml columns of Sepharose 2B-CL at 4 °C. Parallel samples with arrestin alone served as controls. The rhodopsin with bound arrestin eluted between 0.5 and 1.1 ml directly into scintillation vials, and bound arrestin was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Exposed charges in arrestin are remarkably concentrated on the putative receptor-binding surface (6Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Moreover, arrestin binding to all forms of rhodopsin (P-Rh*, P-Rh, Rh*, and Rh) is very sensitive to high salt inhibition, indicating the involvement of ionic interactions in this process (7Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the importance of individual charges in the arrestin-receptor interaction, we performed charge reversal mutagenesis of almost all of the exposed positive charges and reversal or neutralization of selected negative charges and then introduced several additional surface charges into the arrestin molecule. All mutants were expressed in radiolabeled form in cell-free translation, and their binding to the four functional forms of rhodopsin was measured in our direct binding assay (7Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Arrestin Charge Reversal Mutants to Rhodopsin—We found that as many as 22 point mutations (in 18 different positions) of the surface charges in arrestin reduce its binding to P-Rh* by 15-47%, and one substitution (R291E) appreciably increases it (Fig. 2, A and D). These mutations are spread across the molecule clustering in two distinct “patches”, one in each domain (Fig. 3A). The effects of some mutations on arrestin binding to the non-preferred forms of rhodopsin tend to be more dramatic: eight mutations (in five positions) increase binding to dark P-Rh 1.9-3.4-fold (Fig. 2, B and E), and four mutations enhance binding to light-activated unphosphorylated Rh* 1.8-4.5-fold (Fig. 2, C and F). In addition, removal of several other individual positive charges significantly reduces binding to dark P-Rh and/or Rh* (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). In contrast to P-Rh* binding, the mutations affecting binding to dark P-Rh are evenly spread over the entire length of the arrestin molecule on the receptor-binding side, clustering at the distal tips of both domains and around the central “crest” where the two domains meet (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, mutations affecting Rh* binding are located exclusively in the C-domain (with the exception of K141E, which is located in a loop projecting toward the C-domain) (Fig. 3C), implicating the positive charges in this region as important for recognition of the activated form of the receptor.FIGURE 3Map of exposed charged residues implicated in receptor binding.

Right panel, top view.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mutations of several positive charges in the C-domain cluster were the most detrimental to P-Rh* binding (Fig. 2D). Element swapping between visual arrestin and the non-visual arrestin2 has shown that β-strands XV and XVI (residues 237-268) in this region of the C-domain are partially responsible for the receptor specificity of arrestin proteins (Fig. 1) (19Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1262-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Within this region, there are three exposed sites where the surface charge differs between the two arrestins (visual residues Glu-242, Ile-256, and Lys-267, corresponding to Arg-236, Lys-250, and Thr-261 in arrestin2). When these residues were mutated in visual arrestin, only charge reversal of Lys-267 had any significant effect, decreasing binding to all forms of rhodopsin (Fig. 2, D-F). Effects of charge reversal mutations adjacent to these sites that are also different between the two arrestins (Thr-319, Gln-328, and Arg-354, corresponding to Glu-313, Lys-322, and Thr-350 in arrestin2) were more dramatic. The R354E mutation significantly reduced binding to all forms of rhodopsin and T319E reduced binding to both dark P-Rh and Rh*, whereas Q328K increased binding to Rh* (Fig. 2, D-F). Collectively, these results suggest that specific charges present in the C-domain of arrestin are important for recognizing the activated form of the receptor (Fig. 3C). The cluster of mutations affecting P-Rh* in the N-domain is located near previously identified phosphate-binding residues (Fig. 1) (8Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V.

Raman D. Knox B.E. Kono M. Navarro J. Gurevich V.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), such as Arg-18 and Arg-171 (Fig. 2, A and B). Our data indicate that mutations of positively charged residues Lys-20, Lys-55, Arg-56, and Lys-166 in this region, as well as Lys-300 near the polar core, result in reduced binding to P-Rh* and dark P-Rh, whereas removal of a negative charge (D162A) or addition of an extra positive charge (D162K) in this region significantly increases arrestin binding to dark P-Rh (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that several previously unidentified positive charges may participate in phosphate binding and further demonstrate the importance of the N-domain in the recognition of receptor-attached phosphates. Mutations Affecting the Interdomain Contact—The data also show that several of the mutations that affected arrestin binding to the non-preferred forms of the receptor, especially dark P-Rh, are clustered at the point of contact between the two arrestin domains (Fig. 3B). These residues include Arg-81, Lys-141, Asp-138, Lys-257, Arg-288, Arg-291, Thr-319, and Lys-392. This suggests that the interaction between the two domains is important for low affinity arrestin binding to dark P-Rh and Rh*. Residues Asp-138 and Lys-257 actually form a salt bridge between the two domains. When these charges are neutralized (D138A) or reversed (D138R or K257E), binding to dark P-Rh (and Rh* in the case of K257E) is dramatically enhanced (Fig. 2, B and E). These data support the notion that destabilization of the interdomain contact is important for the global conformational change that takes place in arrestin upon receptor binding. Aside from this salt bridge, the interdomain contact is almost exclusively mediated by hydrophobic interactions and H-bonds. To further test the hypothesis that the stability of this region may be important for receptor binding, we mutated two hydrophobic residues (Phe-65 and Tyr-250) that interact with a number of partners at the interdomain contact point. We also introduced different mutations reversing the charges of the salt bridge partners, D138K and K257D, so that their combination in a double mutant (D138K,K257D) would recreate this important salt bridge in the opposite configuration (Fig. 4A). The disruption of the salt bridge by D138K and K257D enhanced arrestin binding to dark P-Rh (and to Rh* in the case of K257D) (Fig. 4B), similar to the D138R and K257E mutations (Fig. 2). Interestingly, even the combination mutant (D138K,K257D), in which the salt bridge is restored, demonstrated increased dark P-Rh binding. We also found that although F65A alone had no effect on rhodopsin binding, the Y250A mutation and F65A,Y250A combination significantly reduced P-Rh* binding (by 25-40%; Fig. 4B). These data suggest that either the exact structure of the contact between domains is important for high affinity receptor binding or that Tyr-250 and Phe-65 in the active form of arrestin are exposed and directly participate in P-Rh* interaction.

However, the contribution of individual residues on these surfaces to its binding to the various functional forms of the receptor has never been systematically tested. Ionic interactions play an important role in arrestin binding to the receptor (7Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed targeted mutagenesis of virtually all of the positive charges and selected negative charges on the arrestin surface (Fig. 2). We found that a subset individual charges spanning the entire length of the molecule is important for phosphoreceptor binding (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas binding to the activated unphosphorylated receptor was only significantly affected by mutations in the C-domain (Fig. 3C), implicating this region as a possible point of first contact with the active form of the receptor. These data indicate that the receptor-binding surface of arrestin is indeed extensive, directly involving a large number of residues on the concave surfaces of the entire molecule (rather than a small number of key residues). Several phosphate-binding residues in visual arrestin have been identified previously including Arg-171, the phosphate sensor Arg-175 (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), Lys-14, Lys-15 (8Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V. Velez M.G. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41049-41057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and Arg-18 (16Sutton R.B. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Robert J. Hanson S.M. Raman D. Knox B.E. Kono M. Navarro J. Gurevich V.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), all of which are localized to a small region in the arrestin N-domain (Fig. 1). In this study, we identified several adjacent positive charges including Lys-20, Lys-55, Arg-56, Lys-166, and Lys-300, which are important for both P-Rh* and dark P-Rh binding. These data suggest that these additional N-domain residues may also interact with receptor-attached phosphates (Fig. 2, A, B, D, and E). In contrast, several charges in the C-domain were found to be important for Rh* interaction. Some of these residues are different from the corresponding residues in arrestin2. Replacement of Lys-267, Thr-319, and Arg-354 was detrimental to Rh* (and in some cases P-Rh*) binding, whereas the Q328K mutation actually helps visual arrestin bind Rh* better. These results suggest that several specific residues in the C-domain participate in binding to the active form of the receptor and support the idea that this region is important for determining receptor preference of arrestin (which is independent of phosphate interaction and therefore must be mediated solely by the binding to the active conformation of the receptor) (19Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1262-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Several C-domain positive charges important for Rh* binding were also found to affect P-Rh* interaction. These include the cluster of lysines 232, 235, 236, 267, and 330 on three adjacent β-strands. To test the importance of this concentrated positive patch, we removed and reversed a nearby negative charge (mutations E346A and E346K, respectively). Both mutations severely impede P-Rh* binding but dramatically increase dark P-Rh and Rh* binding (Fig. 2, D-F). This effect likely indicates that disruption of this network of charges “loosens up” the C-domain, causing increased binding to the non-preferred forms of the receptor, whereas the reduction in P-Rh* binding suggests that Glu-346 directly participates in interaction with the light-activated phosphorylated form of the receptor. These data further demonstrate the importance of having particular charges in arrestin in a specific spatial configuration for its differential interaction with the various forms of the receptor. Binding of several mutants was of particular interest. First, charge reversal of Arg-291 was the only mutation to increase binding to all forms of the receptor (P-Rh*, P-Rh, and Rh*) (Fig. 2, D-F). This result was not surprising since this arginine forms a salt bridge with Glu-390 in the acidic arrestin C-tail. Several indirect lines of evidence suggest the C-tail is released upon binding (5Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V. Velez M.G. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Truncated mutants of arrestin that lack the C-tail, as well as mutants in which the three-element interaction between β-strand I, α-helix I, and the C-tail (Fig. 1) is destabilized, demonstrate enhanced binding to all forms of the receptor (14Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, charge reversal of Arg-291 likely destabilizes the interaction of the loop containing this arginine with the C-tail, thereby facilitating its release and increasing binding to the receptor. Interestingly, two mutations on the “back” of the molecule reduce arrestin binding to P-Rh* without affecting binding to any other functional form (Fig. 3). The first, K109E, is located in α-helix I. The α-helix is part of the three-element interaction that stabilizes the basal conformation of arrestin (Fig. 1) (8Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V. Velez M.G. Gurevich V.V.

Eidne K.A. Thomas W.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); therefore, it is not surprising that mutation in this helix affects binding. The second, Arg-189, is at the edge of the interdomain hinge and is next to several other charges including Glu-191 and Lys-211. Charge reversal at 189 could affect the flexibility of the hinge, which is important for high affinity P-Rh* binding (10Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hirsch J.A. Velez M.G. Gurevich Y.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43961-43968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The sequential multisite model of arrestin-receptor interaction explains the remarkable selectivity of arrestin for P-Rh* over other forms of the receptor by the existence of “sensor sites,” which recognize the phosphorylated and activated state of the receptor, respectively. Only when both sensors are engaged will arrestin assume its active high affinity receptor binding conformation (11Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 59-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The phosphate sensor has been extensively studied. Residues in the polar core, as well as several positive charges on the concave surface of the N-domain, have been shown to be critical for phosphoreceptor recognition (Figs. 1, 2 and 3) (6Hirsch J.A.

In contrast, the activation sensor has remained elusive, although it has been proposed that the point of contact between the N- and C-domains might play a role in this process (11Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 59-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Mutations that turn the activation sensor “on” would be expected to enhance arrestin binding to the phosphorylated inactive receptor. The interface between domains is hydrophobic, making this site highly adaptable. Both N- and C-domain elements that determine the receptor specificity of arrestin proteins extend to this interdomain contact point (19Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. J.

We found that breaking a salt bridge connecting the two domains (Asp-138-Lys-257) results in increased binding to the non-preferred forms of the receptor, especially dark P-Rh (Figs. 2 and 4), supporting the hypothesis that the interdomain contact point may serve as the activation sensor in arrestin. To further test this idea, we mutated two residues, Phe-65 and Tyr-250, each of which participates in multiple interdomain interactions. We found that Y250A and the F65A,Y250A combination significantly reduce P-Rh* binding (Fig. 4B), although neither affects dark P-Rh binding or Rh* binding. It is possible that Phe-65 and Tyr-250 directly participate in receptor interaction. Although these residues are buried in the basal state, they may become exposed when arrestin undergoes its conformational change into its active receptor-bound form. This would explain why their removal reduces P-Rh* interaction but does not affect binding to other forms of the receptor. Our data indicate that disruption of the interdomain contact is important for arrestin transition into its high affinity receptor binding state, but whether it serves specifically as the activation-recognition site in arrestin remains to be elucidated. Visual arrestin binds to dark P-Rh and Rh* with very low affinity such that the absolute level of binding in our direct assay is ∼10-20 times lower than to P-Rh*. However, the concentration of visual arrestin in rod photoreceptors is ∼150 μm (29Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), enabling even these low affinity interactions and making them biologically relevant. Visual arrestin moves between compartments of the rod photoreceptor cell in a light-dependent manner (30Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I. Vishnivetskiy S.A.

We recently demonstrated that the presence of Rh* (even in the absence of its high affinity target P-Rh*) is sufficient to induce arrestin movement to the outer segments of rods. Similarly, the presence of dark P-Rh and phosphoopsin keeps arrestin from moving back to the inner segments in the dark (30Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I.

Both non-visual arrestins interact with various unphosphorylated G-protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref. 31Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Their interaction with phosphorylated inactive receptors regulates receptor trafficking and the ultimate fate of the internalized receptor (32Pan L. Gurevich E.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11623-11632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of different arrestins to the non-preferred forms of their cognate receptors is biologically important. Our results demonstrate for the first time that different elements of visual arrestin are engaged by phosphorylated (P-Rh), activated (Rh*), and activated-phosphorylated (P-Rh*) receptors and identify a unique subset of residues that are important for arrestin binding to each form of the receptor. We are grateful to Dr. Jeffrey L. Benovic for purified receptor kinases, Dr. T. Shinohara for bovine visual arrestin cDNA, and rotation students Todd Townsend and Courtney Frederick for the construction of some of the arrestin mutants used in this study."

TSH then initiates thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis and release from the thyroid gland. Although opposing TRH and TH inputs regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, TH negative feedback is thought to be the primary regulator. This hypothesis, however, has yet to be proven in vivo. To elucidate the relative importance of TRH and TH in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, we have generated mice that lack either TRH, the β isoforms of TH receptors (TRβ KO), or both (double KO). TRβ knock-out (KO) mice have significantly higher TH and TSH levels compared with wild-type mice, in contrast to double KO mice, which have reduced TH and TSH levels. Unexpectedly, hypothyroid double KO mice also failed to mount a significant rise in serum TSH levels, and pituitary TSH immunostaining was markedly reduced compared with all other hypothyroid mouse genotypes. This impaired TSH response, however, was not due to a reduced number of pituitary thyrotrophs because thyrotroph cell number, as assessed by counting TSH immunopositive cells, was restored after chronic TRH treatment. Thus, TRH is absolutely required for both TSH and TH synthesis but is not necessary for thyrotroph cell development.

Thyroid hormone (TH) 3The abbreviations used are: TH, thyroid hormone; HPT, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid; KO, knock out; LoI/PTU, low iodine diet containing 0.15% 5-propyl-2-thiouracil; MMI, methimazole; PVN, paraventricular nucleus; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; WT, wild-type. thyroxine (T4) and its biologically active derivative triiodothyronine (T3) play a critical role in development, growth, and cellular metabolism. T3 acts by binding to specific nuclear receptor proteins that modify gene transcription. Free TH levels are regulated by negative feedback at the hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) neuron and pituitary thyrotroph. The synthesis of TRH, produced in the hypothalamus, and the α and β subunits of thyrotropin (TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone), produced in the anterior lobe of the pituitary, are inhibited at the transcriptional level by TH (1Cohen R.C.

TH also inhibits post-translational modification of TSH as well as TSH release (1Cohen R.C. Wondisford F.E. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar’s The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 9th Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2005: 159-175Google Scholar). Furthermore, TH also modulates TSH expression by altering pituitary levels of TRH receptors and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) (3Lean A.D. Ferland L. Drouin J. Kelly P.A. Labrie F. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1496-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 4Hinkle P.M. Goh K.B. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although hypothalamic TRH stimulates TSH synthesis and release, TH negative feedback at the pituitary is believed to be the most important physiological regulator of serum TSH levels (5Shupnik M.A. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2000; 1: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thyroid hormones have both genomic and non-genomic effects (6Bassett J.H. Harvey C.B. Williams G.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 213: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 7Scalan T.S. Suchland K.L. Hart M.E. Chiellini G. Huang Y. Kruzich P.J. Frascarelli S. Crossley II, D.A. Bunzow J.R. Ronca-Testoni S. Lin E.T. Hatton D. Zucchi R. Grandy D.K. Nat. Med. 2004; 6: 638-642Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar), although most workers believe that thyroid hormones act predominantly through a genomic mechanism. Genomic action is mediated by different TR isoforms that are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-modulated transcriptional factors (8Lazar M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing and alternative transcription initiation of two genes produce all known ligand binding TR isoforms: TRα1, TRβ1, TRβ2, and TRβ3. The expression and regulation of the TRs vary with isoform and tissue type. Whereas both TRα1 and TRβ1 are expressed in most cell types, TRβ2 mRNA is selectively expressed in the anterior pituitary, specific areas of the hypothalamus, and in the developing brain and middle ear (9Bradley D.J. Towle H.C. Young III, W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 2: 439-443Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Lechan R.M. Yanping Q.I. Jackson I.M. Madhavi V.

Investig. 2001; 107: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRH is the major stimulator of TSH synthesis and release from the anterior pituitary (21Harris A.R. Christianson D. Smith M.S. Fang S.L. Braverman L.E. Vagenakis A.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1978; 61: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Steinfelder H.J. Hauser P. Nakayama Y. Radovick S. McClaskey J.H. Taylor T. Weintraub B.D. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previous data have shown that TRH administration to dams stimulated fetal pituitary and thyroid function and that in vitro addition of TRH activated embryonic pituitary cells. These data suggested that TRH is involved in regulation of pituitary development and differentiation (23D'Angelo S.A. Wall N.R. Neuroendocrinology. 1971; 9: 197-206Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Kojima A. Hershman J.M. Endocrinology. 1974; 94: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In mice deficient in TRH (TRH KO mice), however, a different conclusion was reached. Histological examination of the embryonic anterior pituitary of these KO mice revealed that the number of TSH-β immunopositive cells was not affected in pups born to TRH-deficient mothers (25Shibusawa N. Yamada M. Hirato J. Monden T. Satoh T. Mori M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, neither embryonic nor maternal TRH is required for normal development of pituitary thyrotrophs. Adult animals lacking TRH have slightly increased levels of TSH and lower levels of thyroid hormones, suggesting a decrease in the bioactivity of TSH and central hypothyroidism (26Yamada M. Saga Y. Shibusawa N. Hirato J. Murakami M. Iwasaki T. Hashimoto K. Satoh T. Wakabayashi K. Taketo M.M. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10862-10867Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To understand the relative importance of TRH and thyroid hormone feedback in regulation of the HPT axis, we studied TRH, TRα, and both TRH and TRβ KO mouse models. Generation of TRH and TRβ Knock-out (KO) Mice—TRH KO and complete TRβ KO mice were generated as described previously (26Yamada M. Saga Y. Shibusawa N. Hirato J. Murakami M. Iwasaki T. Hashimoto K. Satoh T. Wakabayashi K. Taketo M.M. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10862-10867Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 27Shibusawa N. Hashimoto K. Nikrodhanond A.A.

The two lines were crossed to generate heterozygous mice for both the TRH and TRβ KO loci. These heterozygous mice were then crossed to generate the following genotypes: 1) normal mice (TRH+/+TRβ+/+, WT), 2) mice lacking the TRH locus (TRH-/-TRβ+/+, TRH KO), 3) mice lacking the TRβ locus (TRH+/+TRβ-/-, TRβ KO), and 4) mice lacking both loci (TRH-/-TRβ-/-, double KO). Genotyping of TRH and TRβ gene KO animals was performed on tail extracts of genomic DNA, using Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (26Yamada M. Saga Y. Shibusawa N. Hirato J. Murakami M. Iwasaki T. Hashimoto K. Satoh T. Wakabayashi K. Taketo M.M. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wondisford F.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Animals were maintained under light/dark cycles of 12:12 h (lights on at 0600 h), weaned after 21 days, and fed chow and water ad libitum. All mice used in these experiments were of the same mixed background strain (129svj/C57BL/6), and wild-type (WT) littermate mice served as normal controls. All animal experiments were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Chicago. Serum Thyroid Hormone and TSH Measurements—Serum thyroid hormone levels (total T3 and T4) were measured by solid phase radioimmunoassay (Coat-A-Count; DPC). Mouse serum TSH levels were measured by a sensitive heterologous radioimmunoassay as described previously (35Pohlenz J. Maqueem A. Cua K. Weiss R.E. Van Sande J. Refetoff S. Thyroid. 1999; 9: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Serum TSH bioactivity was determined by measuring cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with a human TSH receptor cDNA as previously described (36Perret J. Lugate M. Libert F. Gerard C. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Bioch. Biophys. Res. Com. 1990; 171: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 37Moeller L.C. Kimura S. Kusakabe T. Liao X.-H. Van Sande J. Refetof S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Serum was depleted of TSH by treatment of mice with 5 μg of T4 for 10 days and used as a blank in all assays (35Pohlenz J. Maqueem A. Cua K. Weiss R.E. Van Sande J. Refetoff S. Thyroid. 1999; 9: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mouse serum TSH standard was produced by rendering WT mice hypothyroid as described (35Pohlenz J. Maqueem A. Cua K. Weiss R.E. Van Sande J. Refetoff S. Thyroid. 1999; 9: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Hypothyroid mouse serum was diluted in TSH-depleted serum to generate the standard curve. The standard curve was linear over the entire concentration range, indicating lack of an interfering substance. This serum was also not contaminated with other pituitary glycoproteins present in pituitary extracts. The TSH standard had identical immunological and biological activity as serum TSH derived from congenitally hypothyroid Pax-8 KO mice (37Moeller L.C. Kimura S. Kusakabe T. Liao X.-H. Van Sande J. Refetof S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone suppression was induced in animals at 8 weeks of age with a low iodine diet (LoI) containing 0.15% 5-propyl-2-thiouracil, (PTU; Harlan Teklad Co., Madison, WI) and 0.05% methimazole (MMI; Sigma) in water. After 5 weeks, animals received daily subcutaneous injections of either vehicle or L-T3 (Sigma) at a low (0.2 μg/100 g of body weight/day), medium (0.5 μg/100 g body weight/day), or high (1.0 μg/100 g body weight/day) dose for 7 days each. The LoI/PTU diet and MMI in water were given throughout the L-T3 treatment period. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection of L-T3. A group of animals was also sacrificed after LoI/PTU diet, and these pituitaries were subjected to immunohistochemistry as described below. TRH Treatment—Animals were given a LoI/PTU diet and MMI in water for a total of 24 days to induce hypothyroidism. After 14 days of LoI/PTU and MMI treatment, placebo pellets or pellets containing 10 mg of TRH (Innovative Research of America) were implanted subcutaneously. Blood samples were collected from the orbital vein 0, 5, and 10 days after pellet implantation, and TSH was assayed as described above. Animals were sacrificed and pituitary glands subjected to immunohistochemistry as described below. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted by standard methodology (TRIzol reagent; Invitrogen). For quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (real-time RT-PCR) analysis, reverse transcription (RT) was carried out on 2 μg of total pituitary RNA. Real-time RT-PCR analyses were performed in a fluorescent temperature cycler (MyiQ, single color real-time PCR detection system; Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Briefly, after initial denaturation at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, reactions were cycled 40 times using the following parameters for all genes studied: 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. SYBR Green I (Bio-Rad) fluorescence was detected at the end of each cycle to monitor the amount of PCR product formed during that cycle. Primers used for the amplification of cDNAs of interest were synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies). The sequence of the forward and reverse primers was, respectively: 5′-GTGTATGGGCTGTTGCTTCTCC-3′ and 5′-GCACTCCGTATGATTCTCCACTCTG-3′ for the TSH α-subunit, 5′-TCTCGCCGTCCTCCTCTCCGTGCTT-3′ and 5′-AGTTGGTTCTGACAGCCTCGTG-3′ for the TSH β-subunit, 5′-TTCTCTCCTTCCTCCCATCCTTT-3′ and 5′-GGCTGGAGGGTCTGAGGG-3′ for TRα1, and 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′ and 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3′ for the 18 S ribosomal subunit. Relative mRNA levels (2ΔCt) were determined by comparing the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) between groups. The purity of the PCR products was checked by analyzing the melting curves. Each sample was measured in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. All the results were expressed relative to WT expression considered as 100%. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization histochemistry was performed following a previously described protocol (38Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar) with adjustments described below. Animals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially following protocol with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific). Brains were removed to a 10% sucrose solution in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking to be sectioned the next day. Coronal sections 30-μm thick were cut using a Leica SM 2000R sliding microtome (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Sections were collected free floating in cold phosphate-buffered saline treated with diethylpyrocarbonate and mounted as previously described onto Fisher Scientific Superfrost Plus slides (38Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar). After drying, slides were treated with a 0.001% proteinase K solution. Hybridization was carried out overnight (16–18 h) at 65 °C on a slide warmer using 1 × 107 cpm of probe/ml of hybridization solution prepared according to the protocol. To prepare the riboprobe used in hybridization, bases 272–629 of exon 3 of the mouse thyrotropin-releasing hormone gene (NCBI accession number NM_009426) were PCR amplified from WT mouse genomic DNA using the forward primer, 5′-TCCTGGATCCCAAAACGCCAGCAT-3′, with the change of a single base to create an internal BamHI site. The reverse primer, 5′-AGCTTCTTTGGAGCTCAGGATCTA-3′, contained an internal SacI site. The PCR product was ligated into pGEMT (Promega Corp.) and sequenced. To linearize the vector for in vitro transcription, 5 μg of DNA was digested with SalI and phenol/chloroform extracted. Transcription was completed using 1 μg of DNA template with the Promega riboprobe in vitro transcription system, which included 35S-UTP. Post-hybridization washes and film signal detection of sections followed protocol with exposure of slides for 3 days to Kodak BioMax-MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Slides were then coated with NTB emulsion (Kodak) and protected from light in an aluminum foil-covered microscope slide box at 4 °C for 3 weeks. Images of sections after development were captured and quantitated using the software Image Pro Plus, version 4.5.1.22 for Windows (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD) and an Olympus BH2-RFCA microscope (Olympus America Inc.) equipped with a Sony DXC-960MD color analog video camera (Sony Corp). After subtracting background measurements, the mean values for the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and for the lateral hypothalamus of each animal were calculated. The TRH expression within PVN is regulated by T3 (39Abel E.D. Moura E.G. Ahima R.S. Campos-Barros A. Pazos-Moura C.C. Boers M.E. Kaulbach H.C. Forrest D. Wondisford F.E. Mol.

Ratios were then calculated of the mean PVN value to the mean lateral hypothalamic (area not affected by T3) value for each animal to determine the relative degree of difference in TRH mRNA expression of the TRH-regulated PVN relative to the lateral hypothalamus. Immunohistochemistry—Animals were anesthetized and then perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. Pituitaries were excised and post-fixed overnight at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 10% sucrose and gently shaken. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned in 3-μm-thick slices sagittally. Sections were prepared and blocked with 2% normal goat serum (Vector Labs) for 1 h at room temperature and hybridized with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-rat TSH-β antibody obtained from Dr. A. F. Parlow of the National Hormone & Peptide Program (rTSH-β-IC-1, lot AFP1274789) overnight (16–18 h) at 4 °C. After sections were washed and biotinylated goat, anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Labs) applied for 1 h at room temperature, sections were washed. Avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase, provided in the Standard Elite Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs), was applied according to standard protocol. Sections were diaminobenzidine tetrachloride stained with nickel enhancement or diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (Vector Labs) and hematoxylin to visualize TSH positive cells, or thyrotrophs, for the purpose of counting cell number. Three non-overlapping areas in the anterior pituitary of 3–5 animals/group were observed under ×400 magnification and the images captured (Image Pro Plus). The total number of cells and the number of TSH-β-positive-stained cells were counted for the entire field-of-view of each area. To determine the relative amount of TSH-β immunopositive cells, the ratio of the number of TSH-positive-stained cells to the total number of cells for each field-of-view was calculated. Histology—Thyroid glands were excised, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections 6-μm thick were prepared and stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test was employed for assessment of significance when comparisons were made within the same genotype. Two-way analysis of variance was employed when mice of different genotypes and treatment were compared (GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were repeated at least three times except for the experiment with TRH treatment, which was repeated twice. To compare the relative importance of TRH and TRβ in feedback regulation of the HPT axis, we generated three groups of KO mice, each deficient in either or both protein(s). To establish that double KO mice were not expressing TRH, we measured hypothalamic TRH mRNA using in situ hybridization histochemistry (Fig. 1A). As expected, TRH mRNA was absent in TRH KO and double KO mice, whereas TRβ KO mice demonstrated an increase in the TRH expression in the PVN when compared with WT animals (Fig. 1B). The latter result is consistent with a defect in negative T3 regulation of the TRH neuron as reported previously (20Abel E.D. Ahima R.S. Boers M.E. Elmquist J.K. Wondisford F.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double KO mice were born with no gross anatomic or functional abnormalities and were viable through adulthood. Both male and female mice displayed normal fertility. As previously reported, the absence of TRβ results in a defect in negative feedback regulation of the HPT axis, resulting in higher TH levels in these mice. As shown in Fig. 2, total serum T3 and T4 levels were highest in the TRβ KO mice, reaching statistical significance versus WT mice (15Forrest D. Erway L.C. Ng L. Altschuler R. Curran T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16Abel E.D. Boers M.E. Pazos-Moura C. Moura E. Kaulbach H. Zakaria M. Lowell B. Radovick S. Liberman M.C. Wondisford F.E. J. Clin.

Wondisford F.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, TRH KO mice presented with decreased serum T4 levels when compared with WT animals (p <0.001). Interestingly, double KO mice displayed reduced T4 levels similar to that observed in TRH KO mice (p <0.001, Fig. 2). Serum T3 levels in both TRH KO and double KO were similar to WT mice, perhaps reflecting an increase in serum 5′-deiodinase activity in these animals. We also measured TH levels in animals with heterozygous genotypes generated from our breeding strategy (data not shown). TRH haploinsufficiency alone or combined with homozygous TRβ deletion was insufficient to change basal thyroid hormone levels compared with WT and TRβ KO animals, respectively. Furthermore, TRβ haploinsufficiency alone or combined with homozygous TRH deletion was insufficient to change basal thyroid hormone levels compared with WT and TRH KO animals, respectively. Therefore we excluded these heterozygous genotypes from further study. As expected, TRβ KO animals showed resistance to TH and presented with elevated serum TSH levels (an 8-fold increase) when compared with all other groups (p <0.001, Fig. 2). TRH KO mice and double KO, in contrast, had only a 3-fold increase in serum TSH levels compared with WT animals. Because TRβ was deleted in three of the four genotypes, we wanted to confirm that expression of the remaining TRα1 isoform was not altered in these animals. We found no significant differences in TRα1 mRNA levels in the pituitary of all genotypes studied (data not shown). To determine serum TSH bioactivity in these animals, an in vitro cAMP assay was utilized. Fig. 3A, upper panel, demonstrates that serum from all three KO genotypes increased cAMP levels in this assay when compared with WT mice. TSH bioactivity (middle panel) was then determined by correcting for serum TSH levels (cAMP/TSH ratio). After this correction, TSH bioactivity was decreased in all KO groups when compared with the WT mice and was significantly decreased in TRH and double KO mice. Another measure of TSH bioactivity is the serum T4/TSH ratio (28Lado-Abeal J. Dumitrescu A.M. Liao X.H. Cohen R.N. Pohlenz J. Weiss R.E. Lebrethon M.C. Verloses A. Refetoff S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 4S. Refetoff, unpublished results. The T4/TSH ratio (Fig. 3A, lower panel)ofall KO groups showed a significantly decreased ratio compared with WT animals. This assay, however, underestimates TSH bioactivity when TSH values are markedly elevated due to the linear-log relationship between changes in T4 and TSH. A third measure of TSH bioactivity is a histological assessment of thyroid gland size (Fig. 3B). Thyroid glands were smaller in TRH and double KO mice (Fig. 3C, lower panel), consistent with a decrease in TSH bioactivity (based on two assays) in these mice versus WT mice. In contrast, these animals were of normal body weight (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Because of the younger age of our animals, we did not observe an increase in thyroid gland size in TRβ KO mice, which is typically found after 6 months of age. To investigate further the regulation of the HPT axis in these animals, all four groups were examined in both a thyroid hormone deficient and an excess state. After 35 days of a LoI/PTU diet supplemented with MMI in the water, all mice except the double KO animals presented with undetectable T4 levels (data not shown) and markedly elevated TSH levels (>10,000 milliunits/liter, Fig. 4A). In the double KO group, serum T4 levels were undetectable but serum TSH levels did not increase as much during hypothyroidism (<10% of hypothyroid WT levels, Fig. 4, A and B). L-T3 treatment was then administered by daily subcutaneous injections at three different concentrations. At the end of the low dose period, serum TSH decreased in all groups but the decline was more marked in the TRH KO mice. After the highest L-T3 dose, all groups had serum T3 levels of ∼200 ng/dl, with no significant differences among the groups (data not shown). Serum TSH levels, however, were statistically significantly lower in the WT and TRH KO mice versus TRβ and double KO mice (Fig. 4A, inset). Thus, L-T3 treatment reduced serum TSH in every group, but both the double KO mice and, as reported previo"

MPI mutations in humans impair protein glycosylation causing congenital disorder of glycosylation Ib (CDG-Ib), but oral mannose supplements normalize glycosylation. To establish a mannose-responsive mouse model for CDG-Ib, we ablated Mpi and provided dams with mannose to rescue the anticipated defective glycosylation. Surprisingly, although glycosylation was normal, Mpi-/- embryos died around E11.5. Mannose supplementation even hastened their death, suggesting that man-nose was toxic. Mpi-/- embryos showed growth retardation and placental hyperplasia. More than 90% of Mpi-/- embryos failed to form yolk sac vasculature, and 35% failed chorioallantoic fusion. We generated primary embryonic fibroblasts to investigate the mechanisms leading to embryonic lethality and found that mannose caused a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of Man 6-P in Mpi-/- fibroblasts. In parallel, ATP decreased by more than 70% after 24 h compared with Mpi+/+ controls. In cell lysates, Man-6-P inhibited hexokinase (70%), phosphoglucose isomerase (65%), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (85%), but not phosphofructokinase. Incubating intact Mpi-/- fibroblasts with 2-[3H]deoxyglucose confirmed mannose-dependent hexokinase inhibition. Our results in vitro suggest that mannose toxicity in Mpi-/- embryos is caused by Man-6-P accumulation, which inhibits glucose metabolism and depletes intracellular ATP. This was confirmed in E10.5 Mpi-/- embryos where Man-6-P increased more than 10 times, and ATP decreased by 50% compared with Mpi+/+ littermates.

Because Mpi ablation is embryonic lethal, a murine CDG-Ib model will require hypomorphic Mpi alleles. Mannose (Man) is a major component of many glycans. Man activation first requires conversion to mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P), which occurs by two routes: direct phosphorylation of Man by hexokinase (HK) 6The abbreviations used are: HK, hexokinase; 2AB, 2-aminobenzamide; AEC, aminoethylcarbazole; CDG-Ib, congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ib; ConA, concanavalin A; 2-[3H]DG, 2-[3H]deoxyglucose; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IUGR, intrauterine growth retardation; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; PMI, phosphomannose isomerase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. or interconversion from fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) via phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) (EC 5.3.1.8), the latter linking glycolysis to protein glycosylation. Man-6-P is converted to Man-1-P and then to GDP-mannose (GDP-Man), the central activated Man donor in glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1). PMI is encoded by the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (MPI) gene, which has been cloned from several sources, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, mouse and human (1Smith D.J.

Loss of pmi40, the yeast homolog of MPI, is lethal unless Man is provided in the growth medium (5Payton M.A. Rheinnecker M. Klig L.S. DeTiani M. Bowden E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, mutations in MPI cause congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ib (CDG-Ib, OMIM 602579) and result in inefficient glycosylation caused by a limited amount of precursors (6Niehues R.

Although Man is beneficial for CDG-Ib patients, it is toxic to honeybees and becomes teratogenic to mid-stage rat embryos when given in high concentrations (10Sols A. Cadenas E. Alvarado F.

The toxicity appears to stem from an accumulation of Man-6-P which cannot efficiently enter glycolysis, instead becoming trapped in a cycle of dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation resulting in depletion of intracellular ATP. This “honeybee effect” occurs in cells with HK:PMI activity ratios greater than 7, where most cells typically have ratios of 2-3 (11de la Fuente M. Penas P.F. Sols A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 2001; 1528: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but its rapid intracellular metabolism through PMI prevents Man-6-P accumulation and toxicity. CDG-Ib patients have 3-20% residual PMI activity and suffer from hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, protein-losing enteropathy, and liver fibrosis (17Freeze H.H.

Encouraged by these results, we sought to generate a mouse model of CDG-Ib in which the predicted pathology would respond to nontoxic Man therapy. Mpi Targeting and Generation of Mice—Embryonic stem cells from a 129/SvEV background bearing a retroviral gene trap vector (VICTR48) inserted into the Mpi locus (Omnibank OST90588) were obtained from Lexicon Genetics (The Woodlands, TX). Incorporation of the VICTR48 vector, based on VICTR20 (22Zambrowicz B.P. Friedrich G.A. Buxton E.C. Lilleberg S.L. Person C. Sands A.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), into actively transcribing genes splices 5′-exonic sequences to a neomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 2A) while simultaneously preventing splicing of the normal gene product. Retroviral insertion site was identified by sequence analysis (data not shown) to lie in intron 1 of Mpi. Neomycin-resistant embryonic stem cell clones were selected with G418 and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts following standard protocols (23Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting. The Practical Approach Series.in: Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Oxford University Press, Oxford, U. K.1993Google Scholar). Chimeric females (F0) were bred to C57BL/6 males to produce F1 offspring, with subsequent heterozygous interbreedings to produce experimental mice. All mice were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. PCR Genotyping of Embryos and Adult Mice—Genomic DNA from adult tail clips was isolated using a commercially available kit (Promega) following the suggested protocol. For embryo analysis, DNA was collected from lysed embryonic or yolk sac tissues. Multiplex PCR was performed for routine genotyping with the following primers and conditions (Fig. 2): Mpi primer set: P1 (oVW252), 5′-GGCAACTGGGATGGCGAGTC-3′, and P2 (CDmpi-R1), 5′-CCACCTTCCCCCAGGCATACT-3′; neo primer set: P3 (CDneo-F1), 5′-GATCCGGCTACCTGCCCATTC-3′, and P4 (CDneo-R1), 5′-AAAGCGGCCATTTTCCACCAT-3′. Conditions for amplification were 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min. Occasionally, long range PCR with only the Mpi primer set was performed (Fig. 2B, bottom) to confirm genotype, using the following cycle conditions: 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 4 min + 20 s/cycle increase after the first 10 cycles and 68 °C for 7 min. Production of Primary Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)—MEF were prepared from cultures were prepared from individual E11.5 Mpi+/+, Mpi+/-, and Mpi-/- embryos. The head, limbs, and internal tissues were removed from each sample, and the remaining carcass was minced in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen) with a sterile razor blade and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Trypsin was inactivated with an equal volume of complete medium (low glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen), 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen)). Cells were plated in either 60-mm (Mpi+/+ and Mpi+/-) or 35-mm (Mpi-/-) plates in complete medium with 100 μm Man added. Subsequent maintenance of spontaneously immortalized lines was in complete medium containing 20 μm Man. PMI Enzymatic Activity Assay—PMI enzymatic assays were performed as described previously (6Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the assay was run at 37 °C. Results are expressed as relative activities compared with Mpi+/+. In addition, PMI activity was measured by conversion of [2-3H]Man-6-P to 3HOH (6Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of protein from MEFs was incubated with ∼200,000 cpm of [2-3H]Man-6-P in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.1) for 30 and 60 min producing 3HOH, which was evaporated in the SpeedVac. The difference in cpm between evaporated and nonevaporated samples determines the 3HOH content and is proportional to PMI activity. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Western Blot Analysis of PMI—Total RNA was isolated from either whole embryos or MEFs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. For reverse transcription-PCR, serial dilutions of total RNA were used, with 10 times the amount of RNA in null reactions. Reverse transcription was run for 30 min at 50 °C, followed by amplification of 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 10 min. Primers were OVW252 (see above) and Mpi-5′RACE, 5′-GTGCTGTGGCATCATCTCCAATCAG-3′. For loading control, primers for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase were used: GAPDH-FOR, 5′GTCCATGCCATCACTGCCAC-3′ and GAPDH-REV, 5′-AGGTGGAGGAGTGGGTGTCG-3′. Immunohistochemistry—Paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue sections were stained with either hematoxylin and eosin for structural analysis or with a polyclonal PMI antibody (0.5 μg/ml) for immunolocalization (3Davis J.A. Wu X.H. Wang L. DeRossi C. Westphal V. Wu R. Alton G. Srikrishna G. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Deparaffinized and peroxide-quenched tissues were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were developed using a histostain kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). For concanavalin A (ConA) staining, deparaffinized and peroxidequenched tissue sections were incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated ConA (Vector Laboratories, Birlingame) for 1 h at room temperature. Coincubation with 100 mm methyl mannoside served as negative control. Afterward, tissue sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and developed with AEC (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Embryonic apoptosis was analyzed using the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis detection Kit (CHEMCOM International, Inc.). Cell Proliferation Assays and Apoptosis—MEFs were seeded in 96-well plates at 2,500 cells/well and grown for 1-3 days. Proliferation was determined using crystal violet staining in glutaraldehyde-fixed cells. Staining intensity was measured at 600 nm and is proportional to the number of cells present in the well. Swainsonine, deoxymannojirimycin (both from Sigma), and kifunensine (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, ON, Canada) were added for α-mannosidase inhibition experiments. The annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection Kit (BD Pharmingen) was used to determine quantitatively the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. Measurement of Man-6-P and ATP in Embryos and MEFs—25 μg of embryo or MEF lysate were desalted over a carbograph column as described earlier (24Packer N.H. Lawson M.A. Jardine D.R. Redmond J.W. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The dried eluates were incubated with 0.35 m 2-aminobenzamide (2AB, Sigma) dissolved in 30% acetic acid in dimethyl sulfoxide containing 1.0 m NaCNBH4 at 65 °C for 2 h. Free 2AB and 2AB-labeled sugars were separated over a silica gel column. 2AB-labeled sugars were separated by HPLC using a gradient with 480 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.0 (buffer) and water as the mobile phase. For the first 12 min, the buffer concentration was increased from 40 to 60%, then immediately increased to 100%, held for 10 min, and immediately returned to 40% to reequilibrate the column for another 8 min. 2AB-labeled sugars were detected at 330 nm (ext)/420 nm (em). Man-6-P eluted at 20.5 min, Glc-6-P eluted at 23 min. Man-6-P amounts in the samples were calculated according to the recovery of internal standards. Man-6-P amounts normalized to protein content in fibroblasts were adjusted to cell volumes to calculate intracellular Man-6-P concentrations. Cell volumes in Mpi+/+ and Mpi-/- fibroblasts were determined using a method based on exclusion of [3H]inulin but not [14C]urea (25Oehler R. Hefel B. Roth E. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The ATP content in embryos and fibroblasts was determined using a modified method according to Stocchi et al. (26Stocchi V. Cucchiarini L. Canestrari F. Piacentini M.P. Fornaini G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts or embryos were lysed and deproteinized with 0.5 m KOH on ice for 3 min. The pH of the lysate was adjusted to 6.5 by addition of a 1 m KH2PO4 solution. Analysis was performed on a 5-μm C18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter). The mobile phase used for separation consisted of two eluants: 0.1 m KH2PO4, pH 6.0, containing 8 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (buffer A) and buffer A containing 30% (v/v) methanol (buffer B) with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The chromatographic conditions were 4 min in 100% buffer A, 4 min 0-20% buffer B, 8 min 20-40% buffer B, 6 min 40-100% buffer B and hold for 8 min. The gradient was then immediately returned to 100% buffer A and the column reequilibrated for 7 min. Nucleotides and nucleosides were detected at 254 nm. ATP eluted at 23 min. HK, Phosphoglucose Isomerase (PGI), Glc-6-P Dehydrogenase, and 6-Phosphofructo-1-kinase Activities in Cell Lysates—The effect of Man-6-P on the activities of HK, PGI, and Glc-6-P dehydrogenase were determined using an enzymatic method based on production of NADPH, measured as increasing absorbance at 340 nm. HK, PGI, and Glc-6-P dehydrogenase activities were measured by incubating cell lysates with Glc, Fru-6-P, and Glc-6-P, respectively, with saturating amounts of PGI and Glc-6-P dehydrogenase for the HK assay and Glc-6-P dehydrogenase for the PGI assay. No other enzymatic additions were needed for the Glc-6-P dehydrogenase assay. For 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activities, a method based on the coupled enzymatic conversions of Fru-6-P to glycerol-3-P with the subsequent oxidation of NADH to NAD+ and decreased absorbance at 340 nm was used (27Sola-Penna M. dos Santos A.C. Alves G.G. El-Bacha T. Faber-Barata J. Pereira M.F. Serejo F.C. Da Poian A.T. Sorenson M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2002; 50: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HK Activity in MEFs—The effect of Man supplementation on HK activity in MEFs was determined by measuring intracellular phosphorylation of 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglucose (2-[3H]DG). Briefly, after a 6-h incubation with either Man or Glc, 35 μCi of 2-[3H]DG was added to the MEFs. Cells were trypsinized and cell lysates were applied to QAE columns. Unphosphorylated 2-[3H]DG was eluted with 2 mm Tris buffer. Phosphorylated 2-[3H]DG was eluted with 2 mm Tris containing 125 mm NaCl. Ablation of Mpi—PMI deficiency in humans causes CDG-Ib, and the clinical symptoms can be mostly corrected with Man supplementations (6Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effects of PMI deficiency and Man treatment, we aimed at generating a mouse model of CDG-Ib. We obtained a commercial line of mice harboring a disruption of Mpi (Fig. 2A). The VICTR48 retroviral insertion prevents normal splicing of exons 1 and 2, instead producing an exon1-neor fusion protein, and is predicted to eliminate completely, the normal Mpi gene product. Mpi+/+, Mpi+/- and Mpi-/- offspring were identified by multiplex PCR, with occasional long range PCR to confirm genotypes (Fig. 2B). To determine the efficiency of gene disruption, we collected mid-stage embryos (E11.5) from heterozygous matings and analyzed them for PMI expression and enzyme activity (Fig. 3). Both PMI mRNA (Fig. 3, A and B) and protein levels (Fig. 3C) were reduced by ∼50% in Mpi+/- compared with Mpi+/+. Neither PMI mRNA nor protein expression could be detected in Mpi-/- embryos (<0.1% of Mpi+/+). Although measurement of PMI enzymatic activities using a traditional in vitro coupled assay (6Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that Mpi-/- samples had ∼5% of Mpi+/+ activity, a highly sensitive PMI assay that measures the conversion of [2-3H]Man-6-P to 3HOH (6Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the activity in Mpi-/- samples was less than 0.01% compared with Mpi+/+ samples. Mpi+/- samples had 49.1% remaining activity (Fig. 3D). Phenotypic Effects of Mpi Ablation—Animals heterozygous for Mpi ablation were viable and fertile and generally appeared normal compared with wild type littermates. Serum chemistry (blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, bicarbonate, chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium, total protein) and hematological (white blood count, red blood count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, platelet count) parameters were normal. Mice used for intercrosses were maintained on normal water and chow or were placed on 10% Man for 2 weeks prior to mating. Consistent with previous studies in wild type mice (16Davis J.A. Freeze H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Man treatment did not affect the average litter size or male:female ratios of pups that survived to weaning (Table 1). Additionally, normal Mendelian ratios between Mpi+/+ and Mpi+/- pups were observed. In contrast, no Mpi-/- mice were recovered of 380 pups without Man treatment, or 126 mice born to females maintained on 10% Man supplements during gestation (Table 1). These data indicate a prenatal loss of Mpi-/- embryos which does not respond to Man supplementation.TABLE 1Genotypic distribution and litter sizes from heterozygous matingsSampleGenotypeMean litter sizeaFor embryos, includes resorption sites and litters not genotyped.

Open table in a new tab We examined prenatal litters of various stages to determine when embryonic lethality commenced. Normal Mendelian ratios were observed up to E9.5 with very few resorptions (Fig. 4A and Table 1). However, resorptions began to increase at E11.5 with a corresponding decrease in the number of recoverable Mpi-/- embryos. Analysis at E13.5 revealed a total absence of Mpi-/- embryos with a further increase in resorptions (31%), which was consistent with the lack of Mpi-/- pups at term. Embryonic lethality caused by Mpi ablation prompted us to provide Man to the dams, anticipating prolonged survival of Mpi-/- embryos. Contrary to expectations, providing females with water containing 10% Man before mating and during development significantly increased the number of resorptions and eliminated Mpi-/- embryos from the E11.5 population (Fig. 4, B and C). Initiating 3% (n = 54) or 10% Man (n = 41) supplements at E9.5 to rescue the embryos did not reduce the number of resorptions at E11.5 (data not shown). These results suggest that early Man supplementation accelerates embryonic lethality in Mpi-/- mice. Gross inspection of Mpi-/- embryos revealed normal development up to E8.5. However, at E9.5 intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) occurred, represented by two general phenotypes. One set of Mpi-/- embryos (group 1) appeared similar to the E9.0 stage of development (15-18 pairs of somites) (Fig. 5C). A second group (19% of all E9.5 Mpi embryos) resembled unturned E8.5 embryos (data not shown). The IUGR continued to E11.5 where the first group of Mpi-/- embryos was developmentally similar to E10.0-10.5 (30-35 pairs of somites), whereas the second group, 35% of all E11.5 Mpi-/- embryos, resembled E8.5-9.0. At this stage some of the embryos from this second group did complete axial turning, these a developmental milestone. However, all of group 2 Mpi-/- embryos displayed posterior axial truncation and apparent failure of chorioallantoic fusion. Yolk sac vascular branching was abnormal in more than 90% of E11.5 Mpi-/- embryos, with complete absence in all of the group 2 Mpi-/- embryos. The IUGR and chorioallantoic/yolk sac abnormalities observed in Mpi-/- embryos are similar to those that develop from insufficient placentation (28Sapin V. Blanchon L. Serre A.F. Lemery D. Dastugue B. Ward S.J. Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 377-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We therefore examined placentas from Mpi-/- embryos that completed chorioallantoic fusion (group 1). E11.5 Mpi-/- placentas showed decreased lateral extension with increased placental bed thickness compared with control littermates (Fig. 5, J and K), with a substantial decrease in lateral extension. Histological analysis revealed hypertrophic expansion of the trophoblast giant cell, spongiotrophoblast, and, to a lesser extent, labyrinthine layers (Fig. 5M). Embryonic vascular penetration into the labyrinthine layer (as evidenced by vessels containing immature, nucleated red blood cells) was comparable to control littermates (Fig. 5L), but the overall architecture of the placental layers was more disorganized (Fig. 5M). ConA staining was identical in Mpi-/- and control placentas (data not shown). Defective embryonic vascular patterns are also often associated with IUGR and problems with placentation (29Copp A.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 87-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Analysis of embryonic vas culature in Mpi-/- embryos utilizing whole mount CD31 immunohistochemistry revealed cephalic vasculature abnormalities defined by premature termination of the vessels (Supplemental Fig. S1B, arrow), which likely produces the cephalic hemorrhage sometimes seen in group 1 embryos (Fig. 5E). However, despite the cranial vascular defects, overall vascular patterning appeared normal (Supplemental Fig. S1D). E9.5 group 1 embryos displayed normal development of the cranial primary vascular plexus (data not shown), suggesting that the problems noted at E11.5 resulted from defective angiogenesis and not a vasculo genic problem. In contrast, Mpi-/- group 2 embryos displayed extensive vascular deficiencies, with fragmented vessels throughout the embryos (Supplemental Fig. S1E). Histological and immunohistochemical comparisons between Mpi-/- embryos and control littermates at E10.5 suggested that organogenesis proceeded correctly in group 1 embryos (Fig. 6B), but the stage of organ development was retarded. However, the organogenic delay was consistent with the IUGR. PMI antigen is normally expressed ubiquitously in embryos at this stage (Fig. 6C, inset), with increased levels in the heart (Fig. 6C). As expected, PMI was not detected in Mpi-/- embryos (Fig. 6D). However, loss of PMI had no effect on N-glycosylation because ConA binding was comparable with that of control littermates (Fig. 6, E and F). Apoptosis was minimal in gro"
https://openalex.org/W2000754762,"A key agent in the anabolic actions of growth hormone (GH) is insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a 70-amino acid secreted protein with direct effects on somatic growth and tissue maintenance and repair. GH rapidly and potently stimulates IGF-I gene transcription by mechanisms independent of new protein synthesis, and recent studies have linked the transcription factor Stat5b to a regulatory network connecting the activated GH receptor on the cell membrane to the IGF-I gene in the nucleus. Here we analyze two distinct conserved GH response elements in the rat IGF-I locus that contain paired Stat5b sites. Each response element binds Stat5b in vivo in a GH-dependent way, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and consists of one high affinity and one lower affinity Stat5b site, as determined by both qualitative and quantitative protein-DNA binding studies. In biochemical reconstitution experiments, both response elements are able to mediate GH-stimulated and Stat5b-dependent transcription when fused to a reporter gene containing either the major IGF-I promoter or a minimal neutral promoter, although the paired Stat5b sites located in the second IGF-I intron were more than twice as effective as the response element that mapped ∼73 kb 5′ to the IGF-I exon 1. Taken together, our results define the initial molecular architecture of a complicated GH-regulated transcriptional pathway, and suggest that apparently redundant hormone response elements provide a mechanism for amplifying GH action at a physiologically important target gene.

Daughaday W.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1957; 49: 825-836PubMed Google Scholar). Much is now known about the physiology, biochemistry, and signal transduction pathways of both proteins (2Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their interdependent roles in regulating growth during childhood, stimulating tissue regeneration in the adult, and maintaining tissue integrity during aging have been both confirmed and refined in intervening years (4Schoenle E. Zapf J. Humbel R.E. Froesch E.R. Nature. 1982; 296: 252-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 5Guler H.P. Zapf J. Scheiwiller E. Froesch E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GH initiates its physiological effects after binding to its membrane-bound receptor, leading to activation of Jak2, a receptor-associated intracellular tyrosine-protein kinase (2Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and setting into motion a series of protein phosphorylation steps that stimulate the activity of several transcription factors, including Stats1, 3, 5a, and 5b, among others (7Rotwein P.

Metab. 2004; 286: E393-E401Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been known for over a dozen years that GH potently induces IGF-I gene transcription (9Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), causing the sustained accumulation of IGF-I mRNAs and protein (9Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol.

A. 1984; 81: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), yet the signaling pathways connecting the GH receptor and cytoplasmic Jak2 to the nuclear IGF-I gene have been elucidated only recently (2Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Contributing to this challenge is the fact that the IGF-I gene is more complicated than would have been predicted from its simple protein sequence. In mammals, the gene is transcribed from tandem promoters, each with distinct leader exons, and its initial transcripts undergo both differential RNA splicing and alternative polyadenylation to yield multiple mature mRNA species encoding distinct IGF-I precursor proteins that are secreted and processed into a single mature bioactive 70-residue IGF-I (12Rotwein P. Rosenfeld R. Roberts C.J. The IGF System. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 19-35Crossref Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory have implicated the transcription factor Stat5b as a key component in acute GH-stimulated IGF-I gene activation in rats (11Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), thus extending previous observations pointing to effects of Stat5b and to a lesser extent Stat5a on regulating postnatal somatic growth in mice (13Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 14Teglund S. McKay C.

More recently, a key role for Stat5b in normal growth in humans was inferred through identification of an individual with a homozygous point mutation in the Stat5b gene, profound short stature, absent clinical responses to exogenous GH, and diminished expression of IGF-I (15Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J.J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). At the same time we reported the characterization of a putative GH response element in the second intron of the rat IGF-I gene, termed HS7, that contains tandem Stat5 binding sites and functions as a cis-regulatory region capable of mediating GH-induced and Stat5b-mediated IGF-I gene transcription (16Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here we use a combination of in vivo analyses in GH-deficient rats, biochemical reconstitution experiments in tissue culture cells, and protein-DNA binding studies in vitro to evaluate a second potential GH response element in the IGF-I locus. We show that this DNA segment also binds Stat5b in a GH-dependent way, and can mediate GH-activated IGF-I gene transcription. Our observations begin to elucidate the molecular architecture of a complex transcriptional pathway and suggest that redundant hormone response elements provide a mechanism for sustaining and amplifying GH action at a physiologically critical target gene. Materials—Antibodies to Stat5 (C17X) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma, and anti-T7 from Novagen (San Diego, CA). Recombinant rat GH was purchased from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the OHSU Core Facility in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology. Transit-LT1 was from Mirus (Madison, WI), the Qia-Quick PCR DNA purification kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), and protein A-agarose beads were from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from commercial suppliers. Recombinant Plasmids—An expression plasmid for the mouse GH receptor in pcDNA3 has been described previously, as have expression plasmids for wild-type and constitutively active rat Stat5b (Stat5bCA, N642H), each modified with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag (11Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter gene plasmids containing the HS7 region of rat IGF-I intron 2 fused to the TK promoter or to rat IGF-I promoter 1 also have been described (16Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A 352-bp fragment of rat genomic DNA located ∼73 kb 5′ to IGF-I exon 1 was added 5′ to each promoter by standard molecular cloning methods. Point mutations were introduced into this plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assays—COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were incubated in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and were co-transfected with expression plasmids for the mouse GH receptor and wild-type or constitutively active rat Stat5b, using Transit-LT1 and a protocol from the supplier. After incubation for 24 h, serum-free medium was added containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 4 h, followed by addition of recombinant rat GH (40 nm final concentration) or vehicle for 60 min. Cells were then harvested, and nuclear proteins isolated (17Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For reporter gene assays, cells on 6-well tissue culture dishes were co-transfected with mouse GH receptor (100 ng) and wild-type Stat5b (100 ng), and the promoter-reporter plasmids indicated in Figs. 3 and 4 (250 ng). Cells were incubated for 24 h, followed by addition of serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and either vehicle or rat GH for 18 h. Cells were then harvested and lysates used for luciferase assays. All results were normalized for total cellular protein concentrations.FIGURE 4RE-1 of the distal 5′ region mediates GH-stimulated, Stat5b-dependent gene transcription. Results of luciferase assays in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids for the mouse GH receptor and rat Stat5b and incubated with rat GH (40 nm)(dark bars) or vehicle (light bars) for 18 h. Luciferase reporter genes contained the minimal TK promoter, with addition of either an 84-bp sequence spanning GHRE-1 and GHRE-2 of HS7, or a 352-bp segment from the distal 5′-region containing either wild-type or mutant versions of putative Stat5b sites 1 or 2 (open circles). Each mutant DNA sequence is indicated by an X (for site 1, TTCTAAGAA was changed to GTCTAAGTA, and for site 2, TTCTTAGAA was changed to GTCTTAGTA). The graph summarizes results of four independent experiments (mean ± S.E.), each performed in duplicate (* p < 0.02; ** p < 0.05 versus vehicle).

Animals were housed at the OHSU Animal Care Facility on a 12-h light/dark schedule with free access to food and water, and received care according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Replacement doses of glucocorticoids (cortisol phosphate, 400 μg/kg/d) and thyroxine (10 μg/kg/d) were given daily by subcutaneous injection, and GH deficiency was confirmed by failure to grow during a 2-week observation period. Following this period, rats were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle (saline) or 1.5 μg/g of recombinant rat GH. At intervals, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and sacrificed. Liver nuclear proteins were isolated as described (17Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RNA and DNA as outlined below. All procedures were approved by the OHSU Committee on Animal Care and Use. DNA-Protein Binding Studies—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as indicated (11Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol.

After incubation of proteins and DNA for 30 min at 4 °C, products were separated by electrophoresis through non-denaturing 4 or 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris borate/EDTA (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 200 V for 25–35 min at 20 °C. Results were analyzed using an Odyssey infrared imaging system and v1.2 analysis software (LiCoR Biosciences, Lincoln, NB). Antibody supershift and competition experiments were as described (17Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The top strand of the nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide is as follows: Oct-1: 5′-TTTTAGAGGATCCATGCAAATGGACGTACG-3′. Quantitative DNA-protein binding studies were performed with a constant amount of protein (2.8 μg of COS-7 cell nuclear extract) and increasing concentrations of 5′-IRDye™700-labeled probes (0.5–25 nm). After electrophoresis, gels were dried, and the bands representing protein-bound DNA and free probe measured using a LiCoR Odyssey infrared scanner and v1.2 analysis software. The dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from these data as the negative reciprocal of the slope after results were graphed by Scatchard plot analysis. RNA Analysis—Hepatic nuclear RNA was isolated as described (9Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Nuclear RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers in a final volume of 20 μl using an RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were then performed with 0.5 μl of cDNA (11Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

Identification of a Second GH-regulated Stat5 Binding Site within the Rat IGF-I Gene—In recent studies, we characterized a DNA segment within the second intron of the rat IGF-I gene that was able to confer GH responsiveness to the major IGF-I promoter in vitro, and that could bind Stat5b in vivo in a GH-dependent way (16Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). More recently, by a shotgun cloning approach, a different putative Stat5 binding element was mapped to the human IGF-I locus ∼77 kb 5′ to exon 1 (19Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10955-10963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment when fused to reporter genes containing otherwise neutral promoters could confer responsiveness to constitutively active Stat5a or Stat5b. As this DNA sequence was conserved among several mammalian species (19Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10955-10963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether it was a cis-acting element in a GH-regulated IGF-I gene transcriptional pathway. As a first step, we asked whether this DNA element was a bona fide GH-activated Stat5b binding site in vivo. Shown in Fig. 1 is a map of the rat IGF-I locus, illustrating the six exons of the gene, its two promoters, P1 and P2, and the locations of HS7, our previously defined Stat5b binding site and GH response element (16Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the rat homologue of the 5′ distal region identified in the human IGF-I locus (19Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10955-10963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We used ChIP experiments to determine if the 5′ distal region was capable of binding Stat5b in vivo in a GH-dependent way. As seen in Fig. 2A, little Stat5b could be detected in hepatic chromatin from GH-deficient rats in association with any of the genes illustrated in the absence of hormone. Within 30 min of systemic GH injection, Stat5b was found at the IGF-I HS7 site, and binding persisted for the 60-min duration of the experiment. Identical kinetics of induction of Stat5b binding were observed on chromatin at the IGF-I 5′ distal region, and at the promoters of two other known GH-activated and Stat5b-regulated genes, acid labile subunit (ALS) and Cis (20Ooi G.T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), while putative Stat sites in the Socs-3 promoter remained unoccupied by Stat5b, as did a region of the non-GH-regulated β-actin gene, and intron 3 of the rat IGF-I gene. GH-stimulated gene transcription was assessed in parallel with ChIP assays, using nuclear RNA isolated from the same livers to confirm that there were functional consequences of hormone treatment. The accumulation of nascent transcripts was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay. As pictured in Fig. 2B, transcription directed by the IGF-I promoters was stimulated within 30 min of systemic GH treatment and remained enhanced at 60 min. A similar rate and extent of activation was seen for ALS, Cis, and Socs-3 genes, while β-actin gene expression remained constant. Thus, in vivo GH treatment rapidly stimulates binding of Stat5b to at least two sites within the IGF-I locus, coincident with potent stimulation of IGF-I gene transcription. Response Element 1 of the 5′ Distal Region Can Mediate GH-activated and Stat5b-dependent Gene Transcription—The 5′ distal region of the rat IGF-I locus contains two potential Stat5 binding sites, here termed RE-1 and RE-2, that are separated by 228 nt of intervening DNA. We evaluated the transcriptional properties of the 5′ distal region and RE-1 and RE-2 by performing reconstitution experiments in COS-7 cells with luciferase reporter genes containing IGF-I P1 without or with either a 352-nt segment of the 5′ distal region or 825 nt HS7. Cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids for the mouse GH receptor and wild-type rat Stat5b, and individual luciferase reporter genes. As seen in Fig. 3, GH treatment had no effect on IGF P1 as shown previously (16Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), stimulated a 4-fold increase in gene expression of IGF P1 plus HS7, and ∼2-fold rise in reporter activity of IGF P1 when the 5′ distal region was present. To extend this observation of GH-stimulated gene transcription via the 5′ distal region of the IGF-I locus, additional experiments were performed with luciferase reporter genes containing a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. As pictured in Fig. 4, in the presence of HS7, GH and Stat5b induced a nearly 8-fold increase in gene transcription, whereas with a fusion gene containing the 5′ distal region, GH and Stat5b stimulated a ∼3-fold rise in luciferase activity. The importance of the two REs for hormonal regulation was next examined after engineering point mutations into each site that would potentially eliminate binding of Stat5b. As also shown in Fig. 4, a ∼3-fold increase in gene expression by GH and Stat5b was maintained when RE-2 was modified but the hormonal response declined to nearly background levels when either RE-1 or both sites were mutated. Thus, based on these results, HS7 appears to be a more potent GH response element than the 5′ distal region, potentially because in HS7 both Stat5b binding sites are needed for full transcriptional activity (16Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), while in the 5′ region, only RE-1 appears necessary for GH-induced gene transcription in the presence of Stat5b. DNA Binding Properties of RE-1 and RE-2—We used gel mobility shift experiments to determine if Stat5b could bind directly to RE-1 or RE-2 of the 5′ distal region. Fig. 5 shows results using IR-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides for each element, and nuclear protein extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with expression plasmids for the mouse GH receptor and either wild-type or constitutively-active rat Stat5b, and treated with GH or vehicle for 60 min. As depicted in the figure, GH induced binding of wild-type Stat5b to both DNA probes, with two discrete protein-DNA complexes being formed for each oligonucleotide. Binding of Stat5b to RE-1 appeared to be stronger than to RE-2, particularly to the complex showing faster mobility. Constitutively active Stat5b was able to bind to both oligonucleotides in the absence of hormone. Competition experiments using either homologous DNA or an unrelated sequence confirmed specific binding to each protein-DNA complex, whereas antibody supershift experiments showed that Stat5b interacted with each oligonucleotide. We next evaluated binding of endogenous liver proteins to the putative REs in the 5′ distal element in comparison to GHRE-1 and GHRE-2 of HS7. Illustrated in Fig. 6 are results of time course experiments using hepatic nuclear protein extracts from GH-deficient rats acutely treated with hormone. Inducible binding was observed with all four DNA probes beginning by 15 min after systemic GH injection, and reached a maximum by 30 to 60 min. Under the conditions used in these experiments, binding to RE-1 and GHRE-1 oligonucleotides was stronger than for RE-2 or GHRE-2, implying that the latter are lower affinity sites. A similar kinetic pattern of first one, and then three inducible protein-DNA complexes was observed for RE-1, RE-2, and GHRE-1 DNA, whereas only a single complex was seen for GHRE-2. As a control, gel mobility shift assays were performed with a double-stranded probe that recognizes members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors (23Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 117-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which are not regulated by GH. As expected, protein-DNA binding was constant over the same time course, demonstrating that both the quantity and quality of nuclear protein extracts were comparable a"

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of severe malaria. Each year up to two million human deaths and enormous economic losses are attributed to this parasite. Drug resistance in P. falciparum has been aggravating the problem in many parts of the world during the last two decades, which considering the lack of a protective vaccine, is the major obstacle to combat the disease. Hence, new antimalarials are urgently needed. Requirements for nutrients and vitamins have previously been discussed as possible novel targets (1Kirk K. Physiol.

It is required for the maintenance of physical as well as mental health. The term “vitamin B6” collectively refers to the vitamers pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine, and their respective phosphate esters.

In contrast to mammals, which have to take up vitamin B6 from their diet, bacteria, fungi, plants, and the protozoan P. falciparum have the ability to synthesize the vitamin de novo. Analyses of a number of available genomes has demonstrated that most organisms, including all archaea, fungi, plants, and protozoa and most eubacteria use a class I glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) composed of two domains, a glutaminase and its associated acceptor/synthase domain to generate vitamin B6 (8Bean L.E.

Structural knowledge on classI GATases in general demonstrates a common fold for the glutaminase subunit, whereas structure and function of the interacting synthase subunits vary (14Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). The synthase subunit appears to have a protein tunnel, which connects the glutaminase and synthase active sites and shields the labile ammonia produced by the glutaminase. The glutaminase is dependent on the interaction with the synthase, and both active sites are structurally and biochemically linked (14Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

In contrast to Escherichia coli, which possesses an alternative enzymatic machinery for vitamin B6 biosynthesis (11Mittenhuber G. J. Mol. Microbiol.

Furthermore, we report the three-dimensional-structure of Pdx2 and compare it with those of known class I GATases. In view of the absence of vitamin B6 biosynthesis in the mammalian host, this study is aimed to obtain further insights into the suitability of this metabolic pathway for the design of new antimalarials. Parasites—P. falciparum isolate K1 (Thailand), adapted to growth in horse serum, was a gift of Dr. Matile (F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel). P. falciparum HB3 and 3D7 were provided by Prof. Lanzer (University of Heidelberg, Germany). P. falciparum K1 was cultured as described (20Graeser R. Wernli B. Franklin R.M. Kappes B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). P. falciparum HB3 and 3D7 were cultivated according to Trager and Jensen in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% human serum A+ under reduced oxygen (21Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). The techniques of parasite synchronization, isolation, lysis, and protein preparation as well as the separation of the cellular fractions were performed as described previously (22Suetterlin B.W. Kappes B. Franklin R.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The concentration of acivicin required to inhibit parasite growth by 50% after 48 h (IC50) was determined by the method of [G-3H]hypoxanthine incorporation (23Chulay J.D. Haynes J.D. Diggs C.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1983; 55: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), using cultures of 1% hematocrit and 0.8% initial parasitemia. Data Base Searches and Sequence Analyses—Genes apparently encoding Pdx1 and Pdx2 were identified in the Plasmodium genome data base PlasmoDB (PlasmoDB.org (24The Plasmodium Genome Database CollaborativeNucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 66-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) by performing TBLASTN searches using the protein sequences from B. subtilis (accession numbers: P37527 for YaaD, B. subtilis Pdx1 ortholog; P37528 for YaaE, B. subtilis Pdx2 ortholog). Molecular Biological Methods—The full-length Pdx1 and Pdx2 genes and/or cDNAs of P. falciparum were amplified by PCR using sequence-specific sense and antisense oligonucleotides and P. falciparum 3D7 genomic or cDNA as template. To express the predicted full-length proteins, the PCR fragments were cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-21a(+) (Novagen). Cloning into the NdeI site allows the use of the native methionine for expression. Two extra amino acids plus a His6 tag are added to the C terminus by using the XhoI site. The Plasmodium berghei Pdx2 cDNA was amplified from cDNA of the P. berghei NK56 strain by PCR using sequence-specific sense and antisense oligonucleotides derived from the PbPdx2 gene of the P. berghei ANKA strain. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing. Recombinant Expression, Purification, and Enzyme Assays—Pdx1 and -2 were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus ®(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) using standard protocols. After 3 h (Pdx1) or 5 h (Pdx2) bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine), flash-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the suspension was cleared by centrifugation. The crude supernatant was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen), washed with 600 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing either 10 (Pdx2) or 40 mm imidazole (Pdx1) and eluted with 300 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For storage, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%, and the protein was frozen at -80 °C. Pdx2 was further purified on a Superdex™ 200 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Pdx2 eluted at a volume of 240 ml corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa consistent with Pdx2 being a monomer in solution. For crystallization, fractions containing monomeric Pdx2 were concentrated to >30 mg/ml. To investigate complex formation of Pdx1 and -2, the respective genes were cloned into pETDuet™-1 (Novagen). A stop codon and a PacI site were introduced at the 3′-end of Pdx1. In the case of Pdx2, a NcoI site was introduced at the 5′-end and a His6 tag, a stop codon, and a NotI site at the 3′-end. Pdx1 was cloned into the multiple cloning site 2 via NdeI/PacI and Pdx2 into multiple cloning site 1 via NcoI/NotI. The nucleotide sequence of the construct was confirmed by automated sequencing. Expression and purification of the complex were performed as described for Pdx2. Different molar ratios of Pdx1 and -2 were analyzed for glutaminase activity using a coupled enzymatic assay with glutamate dehydrogenase as described (17Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The reduction of NAD+ to NADH was monitored at 340 nm (ϵNAD = 6220 m-1 cm-1). Samples were prepared in a total volume of 300 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 9 μm Pdx2, and Pdx1 at varying concentrations covering a molar equivalent range of 0 to 2 (moles of Pdx1/moles of Pdx2). For kinetic analyses, glutaminase activity of Pdx2 was determined on-line using a modification of the above described method. For each measurement Pdx1 and -2 at equimolar concentrations were added to quartz cuvettes containing a freshly prepared mixture of 0.5 mm 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (APAD), an analog of NAD+, 30 units of bovine glutamate dehydrogenase, and buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The reaction was started by adding 0-30 mm l-glutamine to a final volume of 600 μl. Reduction of APAD to APADH was measured at 363 nm (ϵapadh = 8900 m-1 cm-1) at 30°C. The activity of Pdx1 was monitored according to a previous study (19Raschle T. Amrhein N. Fitzpatrick T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32291-32300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C containing 20 μm of the isolated Pdx1 and/or -2 and 1 mm of the substrates; either ribose 5-phosphate or ribulose 5-phosphate and either dihydroxyacetone phosphate or d l-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (2 mm). As a nitrogen source either 10 mm glutamine or 10 mm ammonium sulfate was added. In all cases samples were preincubated for 30 min in the presence of all components of the reaction apart from the triose sugar. Acivicin inhibition was performed essentially as described before (19Raschle T. Amrhein N. Fitzpatrick T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32291-32300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The time course for the fraction of catalytic activity remaining displayed pseudo-first order kinetics from which the rate of inactivation (k) was determined by a fit of the data to the exponential function f = e-kt. The second order rate constant was calculated from a plot of k versus the initial acivicin concentration. Complementation Assay—pSWEET-bgaB was kindly provided by Amit P. Bhavsar, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (25Bhavsar A.P. Zhao X. Brown E.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To create pSWEET-expressing Pdx1, a PacI site and nucleotides -24 to -1 of the B. subtilis tagD gene providing a ribosomal binding site (RBS) were introduced at the 5′-end and a stop codon and a BamHI at the 3′-end of Pdx1 and cloned into the PacI/BamHI sites of pSWEET. As a control, the same construct without the RBS was generated. Integration into the B. subtilis chromosome at the amyE locus via double recombination was selected with chloramphenicol (10 μg ml-1) and confirmed by integration PCR. The B. subtilis 168 (trpC2) yaaD disruptant was grown at 37 °C in TMM (Spizizen's minimal medium supplemented with 0.5 mm l-tryptophan and 10 mg ml-1 FeSO4 × 7H2O) as described by Sakai and coworkers (26Sakai A. Kita M. Katsuragi T. Tani Y. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in the presence of erythromycin (0.3 μgml-1) and 0.05 mm pyridoxal (27Sakai A. Kita M. Katsuragi T. Ogasaswara N. Y T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). IPTG (0.05 mm) was added for expression of down-stream genes (27Sakai A. Kita M. Katsuragi T. Ogasaswara N. Y T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For complementation assays, the B. subtilis 168 yaaD disruptant plus RBS-Pdx1 strain and the control strain, B. subtilis 168 yaaD disruptant plus Pdx1 were grown under the above-mentioned conditions except that pyridoxal was omitted from the minimal medium. Expression of Pdx1 was induced by supplementation with 2% xylose. Immunological Methods—The recombinant Pdx1 and -2 proteins were used to raise polyclonal rabbit antisera by Sigma. For affinity purification, Pdx1 and -2 were purified as described above. The storage buffer was exchanged for coupling buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m Na2CO3, and 0.05 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3). Coupling to Epoxy-activated Sepharose™ 6B (Amersham Biosciences) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies were bound to the matrix at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5), and antibodies were eluted in 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, and neutralized by the addition of 3 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Western blots were performed according to Kyhse-Andersen (28Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with either an anti-His antibody (mouse monoclonal, Novagen) at a 1:1,000 dilution, the affinity-purified AbPdx1 at a 1:30,000 dilution, the affinity-purified AbPdx2 at a 1:500 dilution, and the AbPfPK5 at a 1:10,000. The blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Confocal immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described previously (2Fitzpatrick T. Ricken S. Lanzer M. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. Kappes B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Mohrle J.J. Zhao Y. Wernli B. Franklin R.M. Kappes B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Parasites were labeled with affinity-purified AbPdx1 at a dilution of 1:2000 and the affinity-purified AbPdx2 at a dilution of 1:100. The secondary antibody, a donkey anti-rabbit-Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was applied at a dilution of 1:400. Parasite DNA was stained with Hoechst dye (benzimide H33342, Calbiochem) at a concentration of 2 μg ml-1 during the secondary antibody incubation period. Microscope slides were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss). Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Purified Pdx2 was used for crystallization experiments using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 19 °C. Crystals grew overnight from 30% polyethylene glycol 200, 5% polyethylene glycol 3000 buffered with MES at pH 6.0. The dimensions of the crystals were ∼100 × 40 × 40 μm. Crystals were flash-frozen and stored under liquid nitrogen. Data to 1.62 Å were collected at 100 K at the beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 88.0 Å, b = 67.9 Å, and c = 70.3 Å with a β-angle of 92.3°.

For initial model update and refinement, the auto-building options of ARP/wARP were used (molecular replacement mode (32Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar)). ARP/wARP was able to trace and assign 421 out of 454 protein residues, among those the His6 tag of chain B, and placed 421 water molecules in the model. Untraced residues were residues A1 to A2, A103 to A107, A122 to A129, A175 to A179, and A221 to A227 in chain A and B1 to B2, B145 to B147, and B227 in chain B. Refmac5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar). The final model contains residues 2 to 123 and 129 to 221 in chain A and 2 to 227 in chain B. Sixteen double conformations have been modeled for chain A and 21 for chain B. One polyethylene glycol molecule containing four ethylene glycol monomers has been observed bound to the protein. The seven Ramachandran outliers (disallowed and generously allowed) include the catalytic cysteines Cys87A and Cys87B. Statistics of the final refined model can be seen from Table 1B. Pdx1 and -2 Are Expressed in P. falciparum Blood Stages and Reside in the Parasite Cytosol—To assess that Pdx1 and Pdx2 are expressed during the erythrocytic life stages of P. falciparum, stage-specific parasite lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies generated against both recombinant proteins. Both proteins were detectable as single bands of the expected sizes (33 kDa for Pdx1 and 25 kDa for Pdx2) in all intraerythrocytic stages as well as in gametocytes (Fig. 1). It appears that the level of both proteins increases during the intraerythrocytic development with highest protein levels found in schizonts and segmenters. The blots were re-probed with an antibody of a protein expressed at equal levels throughout the erythrocytic cycle of the parasites (PfPK5, P. falciparum protein kinase 5) to control for equal loading (35Ross-MacDonald P.B. Graeser R. Kappes B. Franklin R. Williamson D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A mixed stage parasite culture was fractionated into infected erythrocyte (iRBC) and parasite (Para), membrane/organelle (M), and cytosol (C) fraction to analyze the cellular distribution of Pdx1 and -2 in the parasites. Both proteins were exclusively detected in the parasite cytosol (Fig. 1B). An antibody against the control protein PfPK5 that is solely found in the parasite cytosol demonstrates the integrity of this fraction (35Ross-MacDonald P.B. Graeser R. Kappes B. Franklin R. Williamson D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To visualize the cytosolic localization of Pdx1 and 2, intraerythrocytic parasites were analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Both Pdx1 and -2 show a disperse distribution within the parasite that is characterized by the absence of any discrete organelle specific pattern (Fig. 1C). Although many proteins show an even distribution within the cytosol, Pdx1 and -2 concentrate in part to diffuse foci. This has also been observed for example with the cytosolic P. falciparum chorismate synthase (2Fitzpatrick T. Ricken S. Lanzer M. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. Kappes B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pdx1 and -2 Are Required for Their Respective Enzyme Activities— Glutaminase activity of Pdx2 is only observed in the presence of Pdx1 as has also been observed by Wrenger et al. (7Wrenger C. Muller S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A 1:1 molar ratio of the two proteins appeared to be optimal for glutaminase activity, indicative of a stoichiometric protein complex (Fig. 2A). Variation of the glutamine concentration produced typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (data not shown) from which the kinetic constants were determined (k as 0.11 s-1cat and Km as 0.56 mm). Both ribose 5-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, as well as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) are substrates for the plasmodial PLP synthase (Fig. 2C). The activity of the complex in the presence of G3P or DHAP was comparable when either ribose 5-phosphate (Fig. 2C, dashed and solid lines, respectively) or ribulose 5-phosphate (Fig. 2C, dashed-dotted and dotted lines, respectively) were used as the C5 sugars. Under the given assay conditions, the specific activity of the plasmodial PLP synthase was calculated to be 92.1 pmol min-1 mg-1 using ribose 5′-phosphate and G3P as substrates. When glutamine is used as the nitrogen donor (Fig. 2C), the activity of Pdx1 was found to be dependent on the presence of Pdx2 under all conditions. In the absence of Pdx2, however, ammonium sulfate can substitute for glutamine in the presence of either pentose sugar (Fig. 2D). However, ammonia could only be used by Pdx1 when G3P was used as the triose sugar (Fig. 2D: G3P plus ribose 5-phosphate (dashed line); G3P plus ribulose 5-phosphate (dashed and dotted line)). When DHAP was used, no reaction took place (Fig. 2D, solid and dotted lines), i.e. the reaction depended on complex formation with Pdx2. In addition, it was shown that the two plasmodial proteins form a stable complex when co-expressed in the prokaryotic expression system used. The presence of both proteins during the expression and purification procedure was verified by Western blotting using the affinity-purified Pdx1 antibody and a monoclonal His tag antibody for the detection of Pdx2 (Fig. 3B). Both proteins were expressed at comparable levels, and affinity purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resulted in the co-purification of His-tagged Pdx2 and untagged Pdx1 (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 4). Effect of Acivicin on Pdx2 Activity and Parasite Growth—Acivicin irreversibly inhibits glutaminases by covalent modification of an essential cysteine residue (14Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol.

X-ray structures of glucosamine-6P synthase have been determined at 2.05 Å resolution in the presence of fructose-6P and at 2.35 Å resolution in the presence of fructose-6P and 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, a glutamine affinity analog that covalently modifies the N-terminal catalytic cysteine, therefore mimicking the γ-glutamyl-thioester intermediate formed during hydrolysis of glutamine. The fixation of the glutamine analog activates the enzyme through several major structural changes: 1) the closure of a loop to shield the glutaminase site accompanied by significant domain hinging, 2) the activation of catalytic residues involved in glutamine hydrolysis, i.e. the α-amino group of Cys-1 and Asn-98 that is positioned to form the oxyanion hole, and 3) a 75° rotation of the Trp-74 indole group that opens the ammonia channel.

Because the end product of this pathway, UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine, is a major building block of the bacterial peptidoglycan and fungal chitin, inhibitors of the microbial enzymes have potential antifungal and antibiotics properties. More recently, the human enzyme, Gfat, has attracted significant attention because of the observation that hexosamine biosynthetic pathway plays a nutrient sensor role and is a mediator of insulin resistance (1.Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Indeed, transgenic mice overexpressing glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase in skeletal muscle and fat have been shown to develop insulin resistance with manifestations similar to that observed in type-2 diabetes (2.Hebert Jr., L.F. Daniels M.C. Zhou J. Crook E.D. Turner R.L. Simmons S.T. Neidigh J.L. Zhu J.S. Baron A.D. McClain D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibitors directed toward the human enzyme are expected to limit the renal and ocular complications associated with type-2 diabetes in diabetes treatment. Understanding at the molecular level the particular mechanisms of the different enzymes is essential to development of specific drugs against the human, fungal, or bacterial enzymes. GlmS belongs to the glutamine amidotransferase family that uses the nucleophilic attack of the thiol group of a cysteine residue on the δ-carbonyl group of glutamine to form ammonia, which is next transferred to an NH3 acceptor substrate that differs for each amidotransferase (3.Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Massière F. Badet-Denisot M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Glutamine amidotransferases provide the major route for incorporation of nitrogen into the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids, amino sugars, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, coenzymes, and antibiotics. Together with glutamate synthase, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, and asparagine synthetase B, GlmS belongs to the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) subclass of amidotransferases that uses the α-amino group of the terminal nucleophilic cysteine residue to activate its thiol group (5.Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). GlmS from Escherichia coli consists of a 27-kDa glutaminase domain (NGlmS, residues 1–239) that catalyzes glutamine hydrolysis and a 40-kDa synthase domain (CGlmS, residues 249–608) that catalyzes Fru6P amination and isomerization (Fig. 1) (6.Denisot M.A. Le Goffic F. Badet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7.Leriche C. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1797-1798Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of the individual domains have been previously determined for the glutaminase domain in the presence of l-glutamate or γ-glutamyl hydroxamate (8.Isupov M.N. Obmolova G. Butterworth S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Littlechild J.A. Teplyakov A. Structure. 1996; 4: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and for the synthase domain in the presence of glucosamine-6P, glucose-6P (Glc6P), or 2-amino-deoxyglucitol-6P (9.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The binding site residues were identified, and a mechanism at each active site was proposed (Fig. 1) in agreement with the biochemical data (11.Teplyakov A. Leriche C. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structures also revealed the homodimeric nature of the enzyme but could not give any information about the communication between the two domains. The next crystal structure at 3.1 Å resolution of the whole enzyme crystallized in the presence of Fru6P showed the existence of an 18 Å-long channel connecting the glutaminase and isomerase sites (12.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The walls of the ammonia channel were constituted by the side-chain of Trp-74 and the main-chain of Arg-26, both from the glutaminase domain, and by residues 601–607 belonging to the C-terminal nonapeptide (C-tail, residues 600–608), as well as a loop of the synthase domain of the neighboring subunit (residues 503*-505*). Unexpectedly, the channel was totally blocked by the Trp-74 indole group. This provided a clue to explain why GlmS, together with glutamate synthase, are the only amidotransferases that cannot use exogenous ammonia as a nitrogen donor instead of glutamine (13.Badet B. Vermoote P. Haumont P.Y. Lederer F. LeGoffic F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1940-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14.Marques S. Florencio F.J. Candau P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The solvent-inaccessible ammonia channel in the amidotransferase family provides a great advantage for catalysis as it prevents the formation of non-reactive ammonium ions and the loss of the reaction intermediates in solution. To achieve this goal, the enzymes must synchronize their catalytic sites through large domain movements triggered by substrate binding (15.Raushel F.M. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7891-7899Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16.Anderson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 111-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17.Huang X. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 149-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The different corresponding conformational states of the proteins can be visualized by the crystal structures of the enzymes in the presence of various ligands. GlmS uses an ordered bi-bi mechanism with Fru6P binding prior to glutamine (18.Badet B. Vermoote P. Le Goffic F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A model for substrate binding and enzyme activation through conformational changes has been proposed based on the crystal structure at 3.1 Å resolution of GlmS in complex with the sugar (12.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The rearrangement of the C-tail occurring upon Fru6P binding would close the synthase site and activate the glutaminase function. This scheme is supported by the half-of-the-site reactivity behavior of GlmS for affinity labeling in the absence of Fru6P (18.Badet B. Vermoote P. Le Goffic F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, this conformational change could be visualized only by comparing the structures of GlmS in the absence of the substrates and in the presence of Fru6P alone. Second, glutamine binding would trigger another conformational change that would result in the closure of the glutaminase site by a flexible loop from the glutaminase domain (glutamine loop or Q-loop, residues 73–81) and the opening of the channel. To verify this assumption and get a better understanding of the structural communication between the two active sites occurring upon glutamine binding, the crystal structure of GlmS at 2.05 Å resolution in the presence of Fru6P and the structure at 2.35 Å resolution in the presence of both Fru6P and the glutamine affinity analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) were determined and compared. The DON inhibitor is known to irreversibly alkylate the thiol group of the N-terminal cysteine in Ntn amidotransferases, and the resulting alkyl-enzyme 9 mimics the putative covalent γ-glutamyl-thioester intermediate 2 formed during glutamine hydrolysis (19.Krahn J.M.

Protein Preparation, Purification, and Crystallization—GlmS was purified from recombinant E. coli HB101 cells at 4 °C. After growth at 37 °C under strong aeration during 17 h in 4 liters of Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin, cells were resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A (20 mm Bis Tris Propane, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and sonicated. The supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose fast flow column (5 × 15 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A. Active fractions eluting at 0.35 m NaCl were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Hiload gel filtration column previously equilibrated in 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.2. The active fractions (972 mg) were pooled and concentrated. The DON-inactivated GlmS was formed by incubating GlmS with 2 mm DON and 10 mm Fru6P for 1 h in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.2, loaded onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 column, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 10 mm Fru6P, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Crystals were grown at 18 °C in hanging drops by vapor diffusion for several days. 1 μl of the DON-modified protein (7.5 mg ml-1 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm Fru6P, 0.3 m NaCl) was mixed with 1 μl of a 1-ml reservoir solution (12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m KCl, 5% glycerol). Although the crystals (0.05 × 0.1 × 0.4 mm) were obtained in the presence of Fru6P, the best fit of the electron density was for glucose-6P in its linear form, which likely resulted from the phosphoglucose isomerase activity of GlmS (7.Leriche C. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1797-1798Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This complex was called GlmS·Glc6P·DON. Crystals of the GlmS·Fru6P complex (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.8 mm) were obtained by mixing 5 μl of protein solution (30 mg ml-1 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Fru6P) with 5 μl of a 1-ml reservoir solution (3% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.8 m LiCl). X-ray Data Collection and Processing—Crystals were soaked for a few minutes in a cryoprotectant solution (25% glycerol, 16% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m KCl for the GlmS·Glc6P·DON crystal and 25% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m LiCl for the GlmS·Fru6P crystal) before flash freezing in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K. The diffraction data sets were collected on beam line ID14-EH2 for the GlmS·Glc6P·DON crystal or ID14-EH1 for the GlmS·Fru6P crystal at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (21.Otwinovsky Z.

Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) as model. Refinement and Model Building—In the GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure, the two monomers in the asymmetric unit are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis to form a compact dimer. In the GlmS·Fru6P structure, monomers B and C in the asymmetric unit form a dimer, whereas monomer A forms a dimer with its counterpart in the neighboring asymmetric unit. The refinement consisted of alternating rounds of manual fitting of the model to electron density maps using O (23.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. KjeldgaardActa Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and isotropic refinement in CNS (24.Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The relatively high R-factors and large differences in the mean isotropic B-factors for the different domains of the Glms·Fru6P structure (Table 1) prompted us to use translation libration screw parameterization in REFMAC (25.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) to take into account translations and librations of pseudo-rigid bodies within the asymmetric unit of the crystal (26.Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Each synthase and glutaminase domain was treated as different TLS groups. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used during the refinement of the GlmS·Fru6P structure in CNS and were released in REFMAC. Use of TLS parameters is reasonable as the GlmS·Fru6P structure is loosely packed with a solvent content of 60.8% and as the glutamine domain of chain C makes only one crystallographic contact with its symmetric molecule in the neighboring asymmetric unit. The analysis of the structures is based on monomer A, which is best defined in the electronic density in both structures. 99.7% of the residues in both structures are in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Residues in the disallowed regions include residues of the linker region between the two domains and Glu-91 (ϕ, 65.4°; Ψ, -116°), as previously observed (8.Isupov M.N. Obmolova G. Butterworth S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Littlechild J.A. Teplyakov A. Structure. 1996; 4: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), that is located at the edge between two β-sheets. Superposition of the structures have been made with SUPERPK. 3P. Alzari, unpublished data. The GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure is the first GlmS structure for which both sites contain a ligand, and this ternary complex represents the active conformation of the enzyme before the ammonia transfer step. The comparison of this structure to the GlmS·Fru6P structure solved at 2.05 Å resolution, which is the state of the enzyme just before the glutamine binding step, therefore gives information about the conformational changes taking place upon glutamine binding. Synthase Site—The refinement of the GlmS·Fru6P structure at 2.05 Å resolution using TLS parameters to account for the differences in mean isotropic B-factors between the different molecules in the asymmetric unit resulted in a structure of better quality compared with the previously determined structure at 3.1 Å resolution (12.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), as judged by the lower isotropic B-factors and the higher number of residues in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). In addition, it allows visualization of water molecules that might play a significant role in catalysis (Fig. 3A) and assignment of the previously undefined nature of the sugar (Fig. 2A). Indeed, the Fo - Fc omit maps indicate that the bound sugar is in the linear form in both structures. The GlmS phosphoglucose isomerase activity may isomerize Fru6P to Glc6P when GlmS is crystallized in the presence of Fru6P and DON or Fru6P alone (7.Leriche C. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1797-1798Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The difference between the open-chain forms of Glc6P and Fru6P resides in the hybridization state of C1 and C2, which is difficult to determine at the current resolutions. However, the modeling of the linear forms of Glc6P or Fru6P and the examination of both the positive and negative contours of the difference density support the majority presence of Fru6P in the absence of DON (GlmS·Fru6P structure) or Glc6P in its presence (GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure).FIGURE 2Comparison of the synthase sites of the GlmS·Fru6P and GlmS·Glc6P·DON structures. In all the figures drawn with PYMOL (www.pymol.org), the protein in the GlmS·Fru6P structure is drawn in cyan and Fru6P in blue, whereas the protein in the GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure is drawn in orange, Glc6P in yellow, and DON in off-white.

Hydrogen bonds <3.3 Å are indicated as dashed lines and water molecules as red spheres. A, GlmS·Fru6P structure. B, GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure. C, superposition of the synthase sites. The Cαs of the synthase domains (residues 300–600) were superimposed on each other (r.m.s.d., 0.48 Å). The C-tails (r.m.s.d., 1.2 Å over 9 Cαs) are indicated as coils. Only the water molecules and hydrogen bonds that explain the conformational changes occurring upon DON binding at the glutaminase site are indicated, respectively as blue spheres and green dashed lines for the GlmS·Fru6P structure and as orange spheres and gray dashed lines for the GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure. Together with the conformational changes of Arg-26 and Trp-74 from the glutaminase domain, the peptide bond of Lys-603 flips and the side-chains of Ser-604 and Lys-503* adopt different conformations in the two structures. OH of Ser-401 is hydrogen bonded to O2 of the sugar only in the GlmS·Fru6P structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overall structure of the synthase domain is very similar in the two structures, although some important differences are noticed at the synthase site (Fig. 2). First, the conformational change of Ser-401 is related to the different positions of the C2 oxygen of the sugar. Second, we observed conformational changes of some residues that constitute the walls of the channel: Lys503*, which participates to the channel of the neighboring subunit and the C-tail, in particular with the flipping of the peptide bond of Lys-603 and the conformational change of Ser-604 that are connected to the movements of Arg-26 and Trp-74 from the glutaminase domain. As discussed below, this opens the ammonia channel and activates the glutaminase function. Glutaminase Site—In addition to the nucleophilic thiol group of Cys-1, the key catalytic elements for glutamine hydrolysis in GlmS are the α-amino group of Cys-1 and an oxyanion hole formed by Nδ2 of Asn-98 and NH of Gly-99 in order to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate 6 (Fig. 1B). The electron density in the glutamine binding pocket of the GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure reveals that the thiol group of the nucleophilic cysteine residue is covalently modified by DON (Fig. 3B). In the GlmS·Fru6P structure, the thiol group of the nucleophilic Cys-1 is catalytically competent (Fig. 3A), although it does not point toward the active site in the NGlmS·Glu or NGlmS·Glu hydroxamate structures (8.Isupov M.N. Obmolova G. Butterworth S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Littlechild J.A. Teplyakov A. Structure. 1996; 4: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). Therefore, it is likely that the active orientation of the thiol group of Cys-1 is triggered by acceptor binding. The glutaminase site of Ntn amidotransferase is composed not only by several conserved residues from the glutaminase site (3.Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Van den Heuvel R.H. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but also by an oxygen atom of a residue of the synthase domain not conserved in this family that makes a direct hydrogen bond with the α-amino group of Cys-1 in the presence of glutamine. By making the corresponding hydrogen bond in GlmS through a conformational change upon DON binding (Fig. 3, B and C), Thr-606 enhances the nucleophilic character of the terminal α-amino group that acts as a general acid/base in glutamine hydrolysis (Fig. 1B) (5.Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In addition, the active conformation of Cys-1 is ensured by a hydrogen bond between its carbonyl oxygen atom and the guanidinium group of Arg-26 in the GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure (Fig. 3B), an interaction that is conserved in other Ntn amidotransferases where both sites are occupied (19.Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Burns M.R. Parry R.J. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11061-11068Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20.Van den Heuvel R.H. Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Coda A. Curti B. Ravasio S. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The positioning of the side-chain NH2 group of Asn-98 in order to form the oxyanion hole is another consequence of glutamine binding at the glutaminase site (Fig. 3, B and C). In the different structures of NGlmS (8.Isupov M.N. Obmolova G. Butterworth S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Littlechild J.A. Teplyakov A. Structure. 1996; 4: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D) and in the GlmS·Fru6P structure (Fig. 3A), the side-chain of Asn-98 does not adopt such a conformation. The proper structuring of the oxyanion hole requires occupation of both isomerase and glutaminase domains and is driven by a specific hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of Arg-26, the conformational change of which is linked to the restructuring of loop 24–29 (Fig. 3C). Thus, the conserved Arg-26-Gly-27 dipeptide previously defined as an “anchor” for both the backbone of Cys-1 and the side-chain of the asparagine involved in the oxyanion hole (3.Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar) is involved together with Thr-606 in the activation of the glutaminase function through specific hydrogen bonds. In addition, comparison of the glutaminase sites of the GlmS·Glc6P·DON and GlmS·Fru6P structures shows that DON binding at the glutaminase site leads to a large conformational change of the Q-loop (Fig. 3, C and E). It had been previously anticipated that the glutamine loop would act as a gate keeper in controlling access to the glutaminase site in Ntn amidotransferases (28.Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the present work is the first demonstration of the closure of the Q-loop upon DON binding to the acceptor-bound state of an amidotransferase. The most drastic structural change in the GlmS Q-loop concerns Trp-74, which adopts different conformations in the GlmS·Fru6P, GlmS·Glc6P·DON, and NGlmS·Glu structures (Fig. 3). These conformations are associated with different hydrogen binding patterns of its indole NH group as well as to a conformational change of Lys-503* resulting from steric hindrance (Fig. 2C). The 75° rotation of the indole ring of Trp-74 is crucial for ammonia transfer because the indole group blocks the channel in the GlmS·Fru6P structure but not in the GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure (see below). Trp-74 is therefore a major actor in coupling glutamine binding to ammonia transfer. In addition, the conformational change of the Q-loop upon DON binding allows a precise positioning of the glutamine analog in the active site. Indeed, it allows an ionic interaction between Arg-73 from the Q-loop and the α-carboxyl group of DON (Fig. 3B). Moreover, Asp-123, which belongs to loop 121–125 that is also involved in the closure of the glutaminase site, provides specific interactions with the α-amino group of the inhibitor (Fig. 3, B and E). Interdomain Coupling—The C-tail is highly conserved among glucosamine-6P synthases (9.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is a fingerprint of the enzyme and has a fundamental role in the enzymatic function. Role of the C-tail in Closing the Synthase Site—First, the C-tail makes contact between the glutaminase and the synthase domains and contributes to the sugar binding site through residues 603–605 (Fig. 4, A–C). The contact between the sugar and the C-tail is direct in the structures of CGlmS in complex with cyclic sugar (9.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas it is mediated by numerous water molecules in the structures of native GlmS in complex with the open ring sugars (Fig. 4, A and B). Second, the C-tail shields the sugar binding site from bulk solvent when Fru6P is bound (Fig. 4C). Actually, in all the GlmS structures determined so far (9.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the isomerase active site is occupied and in a closed conformation. The closure of the isomerase site is supposed to be triggered by Fru6P binding to the enzyme through a 20° rotation of the C-tail around the Cα-C bond of the conserved Pro-598 (Fig. 4C) (12.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Activation of the Glutaminase Function—The C-tail interacts with the glutaminase domain by providing binding pockets for Trp-74 and for the Tyr-28 hydroxyl group through hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl of Pro-598 (Fig. 4C). In addition, the activation of the glutaminase function upon DON binding is ensured by residues of the C-tail: Thr-606, which provides direct hydrogen bonds to the α-amino group of Cys-1 and to Asn-98, and Lys-603 and Ser-604, which undergo conformational changes coupled to that of Arg-26, which is involved in the positioning of these two catalytic residues (Fig. 4B). Opening of the Ammonia Channel—The x-ray structures of GlmS reveal that the glutaminase and synthase sites are separated by 18 Å. Residues 601–607 of the C-tail form part of an internal ammonia channel that connects the two active sites (Fig. 4D). In the GlmS·Fru6P structure, the channel is totally closed by the indole ring of Trp-74 (12.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and we have shown that DON binding induces the closure of the Q-loop together with a 75° rotation of the Trp-74 indole side-chain (Fig. 3). The consequence of these conformational changes upon glutamine analog binding is the opening of the ammonia channel, allowing the connection between the two active sites (Fig. 4D). Hinged Movement of the Glutaminase Domain Relative to the Synthase Domain—Another important change between the GlmS·Fru6P and GlmS·Glc6P·DON structures is a hinged movement of 21° between the glutaminase domains when the synthase domains are superimposed (Fig. 5A). The pivot point is near residue Asp-29 and the extremity of the Q-loop (Fig. 5B). Ala-75 and Thr-76 from the Q-loop participate in the dimer interface by interacting with the 524*-539* α-helix of the synthase domain of the neighboring monomer. Arg-539 is highly conserved in all known GlmS sequences, and the important salt bridge between Asp-29 and Arg-539* is conserved in the GlmS·Fru6P and GlmS·Glc6P·DON structures. Therefore, the hinged movement is necessary to allow the closure of the Q-loop without changing the dimer interface. In GlmS, the coupling between the two active sites is especially efficient because ammonia cannot be used as a nitrogen donor. Hydrolysis of glutamine occurs significantly only when Fru6P is bound to the synthase site. Thus, the enzyme is supposed to adopt at least three different states (12.Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar): (i) The two active sites are empty, the C-tail and the Q-loop are in open conformations, the glutaminase function is inactive, and the ammonia channel is not formed. (ii) The binding of the sugar at the synthase site initiates an interdomain signal transduction that activates the glutaminase function. The C-tail closes the synthase site and orients the thiol group of Cys-1 in an active conformation. A transient channel is formed that is, however, blocked by the side-chain of Trp-74. (iii) Upon glutamine binding, the glutaminase site is fully activated and the ammonia channel is open. In this work, we have visualized the conformational changes that take place during this step by comparing the GlmS·Fru6P and the GlmS·Glc6P·DON crystal structures. These x-ray experiments provide the first structural evidence of glutaminase activation and channel opening upon glutamine binding in amidotransferases. Indeed, the changes observed in GlmS upon glutamine analog binding to the acceptor-bound state of the enzyme were not seen in ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, which is the only other amidotransferase that has been crystallized in the presence of the acceptor alone and in the presence of both acceptor and glutamine analog, because of crystal packing (20.Van den Heuvel R.H. Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Coda A. Curti B. Ravasio S. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DON binding to GlmS induces the closure of the glutaminase site by a conformational change of the Q-loop accompanied by a 21° rotation of the glutaminase domain relative to the synthase domain, in order to maintain the dimer interface. These changes restrict the access of solvent to the glutaminase site, protect ammonia from protonation, and prevent it from escaping into the surrounding medium. The Q-loop is therefore a critical element in signaling between the two active sites. We have shown that glutamine analog binding to GlmS activates the glutaminase function by positioning Asn-98 to form the oxyanion hole and enhancing the nucleophilic character of the α-amino group of Cys-1.

https://openalex.org/W2100270286,"Intestinal apolipoprotein A-IV expression is highly regulated by dietary lipid in newborn swine, suggesting a role in lipid absorption. Constitutive overexpression of apoA-IV in newborn swine enterocytes enhances basolateral secretion of triacylglycerol (TG) in TG-rich lipoproteins 4.9-fold (Lu, S., Yao, Y., Meng, S., Cheng, X., and Black, D. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 31929-31937). To investigate the mechanism of this enhancement, IPEC-1 cells were transfected with a tetracycline-regulatable expression system (Tet-On). In cells incubated with oleic acid, a dose response relationship was observed between medium doxycycline concentration and basolateral apoA-IV and TG secretion. Similarly regulated expression of apoA-I did not enhance lipid secretion. The mean diameter of TG-rich lipoproteins secreted from doxycycline-treated cells was larger than from untreated cells (87.0 nm versus 53.4 nm). Basolateral apoB secretion decreased. Using the same expression system, full-length human apoA-IV (376 amino acids); a “pig-like” human apoA-IV, lacking the C-terminal EQQQ repeats (361 amino acids); and a “chicken-like” apoA-IV, further truncated to 343 amino acids, were expressed in IPEC-1 cells. With increasing protein secretion, cells expressing the full-length human apoA-IV displayed a 2-fold increase in TG secretion; in sharp contrast, cells expressing the pig-like human apoA-IV displayed a 25-fold increase in TG secretion and a 27-fold increase in lipoprotein diameter. When human apoA-IV was further truncated to yield a chicken-like protein, TG secretion was inhibited. We conclude that overexpression of swine apoA-IV enhances basolateral TG secretion in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the size of secreted lipoproteins. These data suggest that the region in the human apoA-IV protein from residues 344 to 354 is critical to its ability to enhance lipid secretion, perhaps by enabling the packaging of additional core TG into chylomicron particles. The EQQQ-rich region may play an inhibitory or modulatory role in chylomicron packaging in humans.

Investig. 2004; 114: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the preponderance of evidence points to a primary role in intestinal lipid absorption. Of all the intestinal genes associated with lipid absorption, the apoA-IV gene is the most responsive to intestinal lipid flux (13Kalogeris T.J. Rodriguez M.D. Tso P. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 537S-543SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the enterocyte, apoA-IV is incorporated into nascent chylomicrons at an early stage of biogenesis in the ER and is secreted on the surface of chylomicrons at the basolateral membrane (14Kumar N.S. Mansbach C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G378-G386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, most apoA-IV dissociates from the chylomicron surface and in humans circulates predominantly as a lipid-free protein (15Green P.H.R. Glickman R.M. Riley J.W. Quinet E. J. Clin. Investig. 1980; 65: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that apoA-IV is expressed in the small intestine of neonatal swine (4Black D.D. Rohwer-Nutter P.L. Davidson N.O. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In animals given a high fat intraduodenal lipid infusion for 24 h, jejunal apoA-IV mRNA expression increased 7-fold at mainly the transcriptional level in comparison to control animals given a low fat infusion (4Black D.D. Rohwer-Nutter P.L. Davidson N.O. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Black D.D. Wang H. Hunter F. Zhan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This observation, coupled with the fact that this lipid responsiveness decreases as the piglets are weaned from a high fat breast milk diet, suggests that apoA-IV may play a role in facilitating intestinal lipid absorption in the suckling newborn.To test the hypothesis that expression of apoA-IV enhances enterocyte chylomicron secretion in response to fatty acid absorption, we developed a stably transfected newborn swine intestinal epithelial cell line that synthesizes and secretes excess swine apoA-IV. We chose the IPEC-1 cell line for this purpose specifically, because we have extensively characterized the regulation of lipoprotein synthesis and secretion and apolipoprotein expression by lipid in these cells (17Gonzalez-Vallina R. Wang H. Zhan R. Berschneider H.M. Lee R.M. Davidson N.O. Black D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G249-G259PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang H. Berschneider H.M. Du J. Black D.D. Am. J.

Lu S. Du J. Yao Y. Berschneider H.M. Black D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1137-G1144Google Scholar). These cells have relatively low lipid transport efficiency and low background apoA-IV expression, compared with native enterocytes, enabling us to observe marked increases in lipid export should they occur. Using this cell line, we previously demonstrated that when cultured with oleic acid, high level constitutive overexpression and secretion of apoA-IV enhanced radiolabeled basolateral triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester secretion by 4.9-fold, and phospholipid by 2-fold, mainly as lipoproteins in the chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) density range (21Lu S. Yao Y. Meng S. Cheng X. Black D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31929-31937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).An acknowledged limitation of this approach is the fact that the level of constitutive apoA-IV overexpression was far higher than the normal physiologic range. To address this limitation, in the present studies, IPEC-1 cells were transfected with a tetracycline-regulatable transactivator and a full-length swine apoA-IV cDNA driven by the tetracycline response element, allowing regulation of apoA-IV expression and basolateral secretion in a physiologic range by culture medium doxycycline concentration. To identify protein structural components essential for this enhancement, we also performed similar experiments with human apoA-IV, as well as truncated mutants of human apoA-IV resembling swine and chicken apoA-IV.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[9,10-3H]oleic acid (26.3 Ci/mmol) and Pro-Mix® l-[35S]methionine/cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Oleic acid (C18:1n-9, OA) and essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma.Cloning of Full-Length Swine ApoA-IV and A-I cDNAs—The following PCR primers were generated from the published swine apoA-I (EMBL accession X69477) and apoA-IV (GenBank™ accession AJ222966) cDNA sequences: swine apoA-I, Forward: 5′-CACCCACGTCCCTTCAGGAT-3′ (sense, nt -19 to +1, before ATG); Reverse: 5′-CTGCTCCGGAACTGCTTATT-3′ (antisense, nt +867 to +896, 51 bp after stop codon). Swine apoA-IV Forward: 5′-AGGTGAGCTGCCTGAGAAC-3′ (sense, nt -80 to -62, before ATG); Reverse: 5′-GGTAGTGTCACGGTCCACTG-3′ (antisense, nt +1358 to +1377, 125 bp after stop codon).Total RNA was extracted from domestic pig intestinal cells and IPEC-1 cells; 2.5 μg was used for cDNA synthesis. In the PCR reaction, one-tenth of the generated cDNA was used for high fidelity PCR. Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was used as described in the manufacturer's protocol.Cloning of the apoA-I and A-IV cDNA fragments was carried out using the Zero Blunt® TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Kanamycin-resistant clones were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing to verify sequences.Cloning of Full-Length Human ApoA-IV and Mutants—Human apoA-IV cDNA was inserted into plasmid pTRE2hyg as follows: an apoA-IV cDNA plasmid, generated as described previously (22Gallagher J.W. Weinberg R.B. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1826-1834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was used as a template for PCR. The 5′ sense strand primer (5′-ATACGGAGATCTATGTTCCTGAAGGCCGTGGTCCTGACCCTGGCC-3′) contained a flanking BglII restriction site. The 3′ antisense primer (5′-TGACTTACGCGTTCAGCTCTCTTTCTCCTTGAAGGTGCTGAA-3′) contained a flanking MluI restriction site. The PCR product was digested with BglII and MluI and ligated to BamHII and MluI-digested pTRE2hyg. The resulting plasmid was named pTapoAIV. The pig-like variant of human apoA-IV (pTapoAIV-PL) was generated as described above with the exception that the following 3′ antisense mutagenic primer was used for PCR: 5′-TGACTTACGCGTTCAGCTCTCCAAAGGCATCTGCACCTCCAGCTCAGGGAGGGAGAGAGTCTGTC-3′. The chicken-like variant of human apoA-IV (pTapoAIV-CL) was generated as described above with the exception that the following 3′ antisense mutagenic primer was used for PCR: 5′-TGACTTACGCGTTCAGCTCTCTTTCTCCTTGAAGGTGCTGAA-3′. The validity of each cDNA clone was confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis.IPEC-1 Cell Culture—The derivation of the IPEC-1 cell line has been described previously (17Gonzalez-Vallina R. Wang H. Zhan R. Berschneider H.M. Lee R.M. Davidson N.O. Black D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G249-G259PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from passages 25 to 80 were used in these studies, and all cell culture was carried out at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Undifferentiated IPEC-1 cells were maintained in serial passage in plastic culture flasks (75 cm2, Corning Glass-works, Corning, NY) in growth medium (GM): Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), selenium (5 ng/ml) (ITS Premix®, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), epidermal growth factor (5 μg/liter) (BD Biosciences), penicillin (50 μg/ml), and streptomycin (4 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). To induce differentiation, undifferentiated cells were harvested by trypsinization, and 2 × 106 cells/well were plated on 75-mm diameter collagen-coated filters (3.0-μm pore size) in Transwell® culture plates (Costar, Corning, Inc.). Cells were maintained in serum containing GM for 48 h and then switched to the same medium containing 10-7 m dexamethasone (Sigma), but without FBS. Medium was then changed every 2 days. We have previously shown that after 10 days, IPEC-1 cells exhibit enterocytic features, including polarization with well defined microvilli facing the apical medium (17Gonzalez-Vallina R. Wang H. Zhan R. Berschneider H.M. Lee R.M. Davidson N.O. Black D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G249-G259PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular membrane integrity was assessed by measurement of apical medium lactate dehydrogenase activity (Sigma).Development of IPEC-1 Cells with Tetracycline-regulatable Apolipoprotein Expression—Undifferentiated IPEC-1 cells were plated and grown to 50% confluency in 60-mm culture dishes. After 24 h, cells were transfected with pTet-On® (BD Biosciences) using Lipofectamine 2000® (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were allowed to grow another 24 h and then plated in two 10-cm culture dishes, followed by G418 selection for 3 weeks. Clones were isolated and transferred to 24-well culture plates to allow an additional 2 weeks of growth. Individual clones were screened by luciferase assay with or without doxycycline after transfection with pTRE2hyg-Luc per the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). The clone (Tet-19) demonstrating the highest luciferase induction by 1 μg/ml doxycycline was selected for generating Tet-On/apolipoprotein cell lines.Tet-19 cells were transfected with the pTRE plasmids containing apolipoprotein cDNA using the same protocol as was used to develop the Tet-19 cell line. Both G418 (400 μg/ml) and hygromycin (300 μg/ml) were used for clone selection. After selection and expansion of clones demonstrating the highest induction of mRNA and protein secretion, as determined by real-time PCR and Western blot, the cells were used for triacylglycerol radiolabeling experiments. In preliminary experiments, induction of apolipoprotein secretion by differentiated cells was maximal at 6 h of incubation with each dose of doxycycline (data not shown).Analysis of Swine and Human ApoA-IV and Swine A-I mRNA by Quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted from cells (23Chomcyznski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar), and aliquots (2-10 μg) were treated with 0.5 units of DNase RQ1 (Promega) at 37 °C for 60 min in 50 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (RNAsin, Promega). The RNA was then sequentially extracted with phenol-chloroform and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, washed once (with 70% ethanol), and resuspended in 20-40 μl of H2O. For cDNA synthesis, 2 μg of total RNA was used with the Omniscript® RT kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with oligo-dT nucleotides at 37 °C for 1 h.The QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) was used for real-time PCR using the following primers: β-actin: Forward, 5′-CTCCTTCCTGGGCATGGA-3′ (sense, nt 426-443); Reverse: 5′-CGCACTTCATGATCGAGTTGA-3′ (antisense nt 470-490); swine apoA-I: Forward: 5′-CGTGTATGTGGATGCGATCAAA-3′ (sense, nt: 117-138); Reverse: 5′-CCCAGTTGTCCAGGAGTTTCAG-3′ (antisense, nt 199-220); swine apoA-IV: Forward: 5′-GGGCCACCTGAGCTTCCT-3′ (sense, nt 1011-1028); Reverse: 5′-CCTCTTTGAGGGTGCTGAAGA-3′ (antisense, nt 1061-1081). Human apoA-IV and mutants: Forward: 5′-TTGCCACCGAGCTGCATGAG-3′ (sense nt 248-267); Reverse: 5′-TGAGCTCCTCGGCGTTCTTC-3′ (antisense, nt 738-757).Following reverse transcription, real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The following PCR profile was used: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 90 °C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 60 s at 60 °C. The amount of SYBR Green was measured at the end of each cycle. Analyses were performed in duplicate. To generate the standard curves for apolipoproteins and β-actin, serially diluted cDNA was prepared, and real-time PCR was performed as above. Standard curves were generated by plotting the relative ratio of apolipoprotein gene expression.Western Blot Analysis of Apolipoproteins—Rabbit anti-swine apoA-IV and A-I antibodies were generated as described previously (4Black D.D. Rohwer-Nutter P.L. Davidson N.O. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Black D.D. Davidson N.O. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 207-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antisera were subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and used directly as a 1:1000 dilution for Western blot analysis.1 ml of basolateral culture medium was collected with added protease inhibitors (Complete®, Roche Applied Science) on ice, and medium was concentrated 4:1 (Centriplus YM-10®, Millipore, Austin, TX). Samples were electrophoresed on an 8% (apoA-I and A-IV) or 3-20% (apoB) SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE) gel followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters. Western blotting was conducted using the ECL Western blot kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The swine apoA-IV antibody was used for the human apoA-IV and mutant blots. The blots were scanned, and digital densitometry was carried out using NIH Image software.ApoB and A-IV Radiolabeling—At day 10 after plating on Transwell filters, differentiated cells were washed with Hank's Balanced salt solution, followed by incubation in methionine- and cysteine-free medium for 1 h. Radiolabeling was initiated by the addition of 500 μCi of Pro-Mix® l-[35S]methionine/cysteine with 0.8 mm oleic acid/albumin complex and with or without doxycycline to induce apoA-IV expression. Incubation was carried out for 24 h at 37 °C. Basolateral medium was then harvested for apoB and A-IV immunoprecipitation, and protease inhibitors (Complete®) were added.ApoB and A-IV Immunoprecipitation—5-ml aliquots of basolateral culture medium were precleared by incubation with 0.2 ml of IgGsorb® (10% solution, w/v; The Enzyme Center, Boston, MA) for 1 h at 4°C with constant agitation. The samples were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The amount of human apoB and swine apoA-IV antibody added to the supernatant was determined to be in excess by re-immunoprecipitation of samples. Swine apoA-IV antibody was used to immunoprecipitate human apoA-IV and mutants. Samples were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The antigen-antibody complexes were harvested by the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10%, w/v; Amersham Biosciences) and incubation for 2 h, followed by centrifugation to harvest the pellet. The pellet was washed six times with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm NaH2P04, 5 mm (Na2)EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine) followed by suspension of the pellet in 50 μl of reducing buffer. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 3-20% acrylamide gradient under reducing conditions (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 222: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206038) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were fixed in methanol-acetic acid-water (40:7:53, v/v) for 30 min, washed three times with distilled water, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, and dried at 80 °C for 4 h. Autoradiography was performed by exposing the gels to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 2-7 days. Apolipoprotein bands were identified by comparison to coelectrophoresed molecular weight standards (Invitrogen).Incubation of Cells with Oleic Acid—Differentiated cells (10 days post-plating Transwell filters in serum-free medium) were prepared, and fresh medium was added to both the apical and basolateral Transwell compartments. The apical medium contained 0.8 mm oleic acid complexed with albumin (4:1 molar ratio) (26Murthy S. Albright E. Mathur S.N. Davidson N.O. Field F.J. Arteriosclerosis Thromb. 1992; 12: 691-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fatty acid concentration is in the physiologic range, and above this concentration the basolateral secretion of triacylglycerol begins to plateau in IPEC-1 cells (17Gonzalez-Vallina R. Wang H. Zhan R. Berschneider H.M. Lee R.M. Davidson N.O. Black D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G249-G259PubMed Google Scholar). For Tet-On induction, doxycycline was added to the culture medium at the same time that the experimental incubation was started. Cells were incubated for 24 h followed by harvest of culture medium and cells. For measurement of protein and mRNA, cell lysates and basolateral medium were prepared and processed as described above.Triacylglycerol Radiolabeling with [3H]Oleic Acid—Cells were incubated for 24 h with 12 μCi of [3H]oleic acid/well, and cell lysates and basolateral medium were collected and processed as described above. The total lipid in the lysates and medium was extracted (18Wang H. Berschneider H.M. Du J. Black D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G935-G942PubMed Google Scholar), the extracts applied to silica gel G plates, and subjected to thin-layer chromatography using petroleum ether-diethyl ether-acetic acid 80:20:1 (V/V/V). The bands corresponding to triacylglycerol, cholesteryl ester, and phospholipid were identified by comparison to co-chromatographed standards by exposure to iodine vapor and scraped off the plate for liquid scintillation counting. Cellular content and secretion of radiolabeled lipid were expressed as DPM/well/24 h.Lipoprotein Size Determination by Negative Staining and Transmission Electron Microscopy—To isolate triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, comprising chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (d ≤ 1.006 g/ml), basolateral culture medium was subjected to density ultracentrifugation using a Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 17 °C (18Wang H. Berschneider H.M. Du J. Black D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G935-G942PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein suspensions were placed on Formvar® carbon-coated grids and allowed to partially dry for 20 min. Filter paper was used to remove any solution left on the grid. The grids were then placed on a drop of 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.0, for 2 min. The grids were viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA) at 60 kV. Images were captured at 20,000× using an AMT 2K digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA). Particle diameter measurements were made in a blinded manner using the digital imaging software from AMT.Lipoproteins secreted by IPEC-1 cells incubated with oleic acid and overexpressing pig-like human apoA-IV were so large that they could not be negatively stained. Therefore, they were visualized with an osmium vapor technique. Briefly, 5 μl of the sample was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid. Three 500-μl drops of 2% osmium tetroxide were placed in close proximity to the sample. A small glass Petri dish was placed on top of all solutions to create on osmium-rich atmosphere. After 20 min, the grids were blotted with filter paper and allowed to dry before transmission electron microscopy and measurement as described above.Statistical Analysis—Data in experimental groups were analyzed by Student's unpaired t test. Statistical significance was set at a two-tailed p value of < 0.05.RESULTSDoxycycline-regulatable Swine ApoA-IV mRNA Expression and Basolateral Secretion of ApoA-IV Protein and Labeled Triacylglycerol in IPEC-1 Cells—As shown in Fig. 1A, mRNA from IPEC-1 cells expressing doxycycline-regulatable swine apoA-IV demonstrated a progressive increase in apoA-IV mRNA levels as measured by real-time PCR with increasing medium doxycycline concentration. As shown in Fig. 1A, basolateral secretion of apoA-IV protein generally paralleled the increase in mRNA as the medium doxycycline concentration increased, although apoA-IV protein secretion reached a plateau above 800 ng/ml doxycycline. Fig. 1B shows that as secretion of apoA-IV increased with increasing doxycyline concentration, basolateral secretion of labeled triacylglycerol paralleled secretion of apoA-IV. The secreted porcine apoA-IV protein appears as a 42-kDa band in the Western blots of basolateral media (Fig. 1C).Doxycycline-regulatable Swine ApoA-I mRNA Expression and Basolateral Secretion of ApoA-I Protein and Labeled Triacylglycerol in IPEC-1 Cells—To determine whether the enhancement of basolateral labeled triacylglycerol secretion was specific for apoA-IV, IPEC-1 cells were transfected with a regulatable porcine apoA-I construct. As shown in Fig. 2A, as with the apoA-IV construct, apoA-I mRNA expression increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing medium doxycycline concentration. Likewise, basolateral apoA-I protein secretion increased in parallel with the increasing mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). However, in contrast to the behavior of cells transfected with apoA-IV, the increase in apoA-I secretion had no significant effect on basolateral-labeled triacylglycerol secretion (Fig. 2B). The corresponding Western blot showing a 26-kDa band of secreted porcine apoA-I protein is shown in Fig. 2C.FIGURE 2Basolateral labeled triacylglycerol secretion by tetracycline-regulatable apoA-I expression in differentiated IPEC-1 cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.8 mm [3H]oleic acid and varying concentrations of medium doxycycline. A, swine apoA-I mRNA and basolateral protein secretion (y-axis). Each point represents either mRNA abundance (determined by real-time PCR as apoA-I/β-actin ratio) or protein mass (quantitated by Western blot analysis as arbitrary densitometry units) at each concentration of doxycycline (x-axis) divided by the values with no added doxycycline.

Cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.8 mm oleic acid, either without doxycycline treatment or with 800 ng/ml of doxycycline added to the culture medium. Triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein particles secreted from the doxycycline-treated cells (Fig. 3B) were larger and had a wider size distribution than those secreted from untreated cells (Fig. 3A). The mean diameter of the particles from the treated cells, 87.0 ± 2.9 nm (mean ± S.E.), was significantly greater than that of the particles from the untreated cells, 54.3 ± 0.8 nm (p < 0.0001). Size distribution histograms show that the lipoproteins from the untreated cells formed a single discrete population (Fig. 3C), whereas lipoproteins from the treated cells comprised a more heterogeneous population (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Transmission electron microscopy of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins"

Multiple signaling pathways converge upon phospholipase D to modulate cellular actions, such as cell growth, shape, and secretion. We examined the kinetics of protein kinase C and G-protein regulation of mammalian phospholipase D1 (PLD1) in order to better understand interactions between PLD1 and its regulators. Activation by Arf-1, RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, protein kinase Cα, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate displayed surface dilution kinetics, but these effectors modulated different kinetic parameters. PKCα activation of PLD1 involves N- and C-terminal PLD domains. Rho GTPases were binding activators, enhancing the catalytic efficiency of a purified PLD1 catalytic domain via effects on Km. Arf-1, a catalytic activator, stimulated PLD1 by enhancing the catalytic constant, kcat. A kinetic description of PLD1 activation by multiple modulators reveals a mechanism for apparent synergy between activators. Synergy was observed only when PLD1 was simultaneously stimulated by a binding activator and a catalytic activator. Surprisingly, synergistic activation was steeply dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylcholine.

Phospholipase D (PLD 2The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; PLD1.d311, N-terminally truncated rat PLD1; β-OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; PA, phosphatidic acid (GP1001); PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (GP0801); PC, phoshatidylcholine (GP0101); PE, phosphatidylethanolamine (GP0201); PKC, protein kinase C; PH, pleckstrin homology; PX, phox homology. ; EC 3.1.4.4.) enzymes are phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze phospholipids to phosphatidic acid (PA) and their free head groups. In mammals, the principal substrate is phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the production of PA has broad biological impact (1Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94PubMed Google Scholar). PA regulates physical properties of cellular membranes, acts as a second messenger to alter the activity of many enzymes and proteins (2Andresen B.T. Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Romero G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and can be further metabolized to diacylglycerols and lysophosphatidic acid by lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase and phospholipase A2, respectively. Diacylglycerols derived from PC are important cellular signaling molecules, and lysophosphatidic acid is released as an intercellular messenger that affects many cell types. Recent evidence has supported a role for phospholipase D in exocytosis, cell proliferation, membrane trafficking, migration, and tumor formation (3Buchanan F.G. McReynolds M. Couvillon A. Kam Y.

Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 789-800PubMed Google Scholar). PLD has been cloned from animals, fungi, plants, and bacteria (5McDermott M. Wakelam M.J.O. Morris A.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Two mammalian PLD genes (PLD1 and PLD2) have been identified, and their products occur as several splice variants. The mammalian isozymes have a conserved primary sequence and domain structure but are differently regulated by upstream signals. Both enzymes are members of the PXPH-PLD subfamily that have putative pleckstrin homology (PH) and phox homology (PX) domains in tandem at their N termini (6Elias M. Potocky M. Cvrckova F. Zarsky V. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and are hypothesized to have pseudodimeric catalytic domains with invariant HXKX4D motifs (7Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 8Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because of the critical roles of PLD and its products, the enzymatic activity of PLD is tightly regulated by a variety of hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, cytokines, and other cellular signals. The PLD1 isozyme is under elaborate control in vitro and in vivo (1Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is an essential PLD1 activator, and most characterized eukaryotic PLD isoforms are regulated by PIP2. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate can partially substitute for PIP2, but other acidic phospholipids are ineffective or nearly so (9Liscovitch M. Chalifa-Caspi V. Pertile P. Chen C.S.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Bulk interaction between PLD and lipid vesicles is dependent on PIP2 in vitro (11Sciorra V.A. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J.

Whereas multiple PLD domains bind polyphosphoinositides directly (Fig. 1A), PIP2 interaction with a conserved polybasic region within a C-terminal PLD catalytic subdomain appears to be responsible for regulation by this lipid (12Sciorra V.A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Current work suggests that there are distinct yet interacting binding sites for major regulators. Mutational studies have identified PLD1 domains and amino acid sequences involved in interactions with many PLD1 effectors (Fig. 1A). PLD1 activity is regulated by conventional protein kinase C isozymes (PKCα,-β, and -γ). PKCα activates PLD1 via direct protein-protein interactions between PKC regulatory domains (15Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and multiple PLD domains (16Kook S. Exton J.H. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Sung T.C. Zhang Y. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3659-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PLD1 is also regulated by members of the Rho and Arf subfamilies of the Ras GTPase superfamily. RhoA activates PLD through direct interaction with a C-terminal PLD catalytic subdomain (18Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J.

Members of the Arf subfamily enhance PLD activity in vitro (21Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and in vivo (22Rumenapp U. Geiszt M. Wahn F. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but a direct interaction has not been demonstrated. A novel PLD1 expression construct allowed high level expression and efficient purification of highly active enzyme (>100-fold enhanced yields). Sufficient amounts of PLD1 now permit detailed characterization of PLD1 activity in vitro. To understand how allosteric modulators regulate catalysis, we performed kinetic analyses of regulated PLD1 activity. We report that PLD1 effectors enhanced PLD activity differently. PKCα activation of PLD1 involves N- and C-terminal PLD domains. Rho GTPases were binding activators, and Arf-1 was a catalytic activator. When PLD1 is simultaneously stimulated by multiple effectors, the combined response was greater than the sum of the responses to individual effectors (23Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Bokoch G.M.

A kinetic description of PLD1 activation by allosteric modulators reveals a mechanism for apparent synergy between activators. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that Arf-1, a catalytic activator, was required for synergistic activation of PLD1. PIP2 had concentration-dependent effects on membrane association of N-terminally truncated rat PLD1b (amino acids 312-1036) and biphasic effects on PLD activation. Surprisingly, synergy between activators was steeply dependent upon PIP2 concentration. A narrow range of PIP2 concentration and a combination of Arf and binding activators are required to produce synergistic activation of PLD1. Cellular locales where these signaling molecules converge on appropriate membranes experience dramatic remodeling of the lipid membrane, hydrolyzing PC to PA. These studies address open questions about the complex prerequisites for PLD activation. A greater understanding of activation mechanisms may help to pharmacologically dissect signaling pathways that converge upon PLD1.

Binding of PLD1.d311 to Sucrose-loaded Vesicles—The sucrose-loaded vesicle binding assay was adopted, with minor modifications, from the procedure of Buser and McLaughlin (29Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion (Lipex Biomembranes, Inc., Vancouver, Canada) of lipid dispersions through two 0.1 μm polycarbonate filters (Nuclepore). Lipid composition was identical to standard in vitro assay preparations (see below) or modified to replace PIP2 with PE. Vesicles were loaded with 176 mm sucrose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2. Sucrose-loaded vesicles were washed and resuspended in an isotonic buffer containing KCl. Sucrose-loaded vesicles were incubated with 10 nm PLD1.d311 for 30 min at 25 °C and sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 20 °C. PLD1 present in supernatant (PLDsup) and pellet (PLDpellet) was estimated by immunoblot, and vesicle-associated PLD1.d311 was calculated according to Equation 1, PLDvesicle=(β)PLDpellet(β−1)PLDsupα+β−1=(Bmax)[PL]TKsA+[PL]T(Eq. 1) where α is the fraction of sedimented vesicles determined by scintillation counting and β is the fraction of PLD immunoreactivity (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated αFLAG-M2 antibody; Sigma) in the supernatant fraction in the absence of lipid (accounts for PLD that precipitates without lipid). [PL]T is the total concentration of lipid, and KsA is a dissociation constant describing bulk association with lipid. Measurement of PLD Activity in Vivo—Activity assays were performed as described in Ref. 30Walker S.J. Brown H.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 89-97PubMed Google Scholar. Hemagglutinin-tagged RhoA.G14V was obtained from Guthrie Research Institute (available on the World Wide Web at www.cdna.org). Rat PLD1b and PLD1.d311 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). PLD1 and activators were transiently expressed in COS7 cells by liposome transfection (Fugene6; Roche Applied Science). PLD constructs (0.6 μg of DNA) were cotransfected 1:1 with RhoA.G14V or empty vector as ballast. Transfected cells were serum-starved (18 h) and treated (15 min) with phorbol myristate acetate (100 nm) as indicated. Expression of heterologous proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Measurement of PLD Activity in Vitro—Activity assays were performed with exogenous substrate as described previously (31Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, PLD activity was measured by the release of [methyl-3H]choline from [choline-methyl-3H]dipalmitoyl-PC. 1-10 nm PLD was reconstituted with phospholipid vesicle substrates as described under “Results and Discussion,” typically composed of 10 μm dipalmitoyl-PC, 100 μm PE (bovine liver), 6.2 μm PIP2 (porcine brain), and 1.4 μm cholesterol. Lipid solutions were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen and then resuspended in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 160 mm KCl, 6 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm DTT. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by bath sonication (6 × 1-min intervals at 80 watts). All assays were conducted for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 3.6 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm GTPγS. Reactions were stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid and bovine serum albumin. Free [methyl-3H]choline was separated from precipitated lipids and proteins by centrifugation and was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The enzymatic reactions were linear with time and protein concentration. Initial rates were determined from measurements between 5 and 25% PC hydrolysis. Data are presented as mean initial enzymatic rates ± S.E. (nmol of PC hydrolyzed/min/mg of PLD) measured in 3-12 independent experiments performed in duplicate. Analysis of Kinetic Data—Apparent dissociation constants and rate constants were determined from best fit parameters by nonlinear regression (sum of squares) using Equation 2 (32Carman G.M.

The present study reports the first detailed kinetic description of regulated phospholipase D activity toward PC substrate. Mammalian PLD activity is regulated by elaborate networks of upstream signaling molecules in vivo, and PLD1 is directly activated by multiple classes of proteins and lipids in vitro (1Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated basic components of this signaling network by reconstituting purified PLD1 with varied amounts of substrate and allosteric modulators. Steady-state kinetic analysis of PLD activity revealed important differences between PLD1 effectors. Activators exploit different properties of PLD catalysis to enhance activity. Distinct modes of activation provide a mechanistic basis for synergistic relationships between PLD1 effectors. A systematic investigation of PLD1 activation revealed several strict requirements for synergy between activators. Synergy requires appropriate lipid composition and particular combinations of protein effectors. These requirements are revealed in each of the kinetic terms that describe PLD1 activation. Phosphoinositides regulate the association of PLD1 and the lipid bilayer. This form of activation is represented by the dissociation constant, KsA. Synergy also requires modulation of kcat by Arf-1 and modulation of Km by PKC or Rho GTPases. Prior studies have characterized the enzymatic activities of bacterial and plant PLD enzymes in detail (34Waite M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35Leiros I. McSweeney S. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 805-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The inability to generate sufficient amounts of purified mammalian PLD has hindered the biochemical characterization of this enzyme. A novel PLD1 truncation mutant with greatly enhanced expression and stability was purified to homogeneity from recombinant sources. PLD1.d311 lacks N-terminal domains but retains full enzymatic activity (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, this catalytic domain fragment was regulated by all classes of PLD allosteric modulators. Purification of Phospholipase D1—Full-length PLD1b (amino acids 1-1036; Fig. 1A) and an N-terminally truncated PLD1b (amino acids 312-1036) were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both proteins efficiently bound to immobilized nickel columns, but full-length PLD1 failed to purify in a homogeneous manner over subsequent chromatographic steps. N-terminally truncated PLD1 (PLD1.d311) was expressed as a maltose binding domain fusion protein and purified by metal chelation and size exclusion chromatography. Typical yields of purified PLD1.d311 (30-40 mg/liter insect cells) were much greater than those of full-length PLD1 (0.2-0.5 mg/liter insect cells). Protein kinase Cα, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were purified from baculovirus infected insect cells and recombinant Arf-1 was purified from bacteria. Purified proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by colloidal Coomassie staining (Fig. 1B) and immunoblot. Regulated Activity of Phospholipase D1—To examine the enzymatic properties of purified PLD, we used standard in vitro methods (31Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to assay activity toward dipalmitoyl-PC substrate. PLD was reconstituted with purified effectors and lipid vesicles containing radiolabeled substrate. PLD1.d311 retained the full enzymatic activity of full-length PLD1 and was regulated by all classes of PLD activators (Fig. 1C). PLD1.d311 exhibited slightly elevated basal activity in the absence of activators, similar to other N-terminally truncated PLD mutants (17Sung T.C. Zhang Y. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3659-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 36Park S.K. Min D.S. Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recent work has mapped major sites of interaction with PKCα to the extreme N terminus and PH domain of PLD1 (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, potent activation by PKCα was still observed when these major PKC binding sites were deleted from the N terminus of PLD1. Maximal PLD1.d311 response to PKCα was 16% of the maximal response of full-length PLD1 to PKCα (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Monomeric G-protein activators were equally effective toward PLD1 and PLD1.d311, both in terms of potency and maximal activation.TABLE 1Activation of phospholipase D1 in vitroActivator(s)PLD1 (full-length)PLD1.d311EC50MaxEC50Maxnmnmol/min/mgnmnmol/min/mgUnstimulated7 ± 113 ± 1PKCα32 ± 1204 ± 1756 ± 2234 ± 4Arf-1>500>500RhoA29 ± 244 ± 567 ± 4337 ± 4Rac15 ± 217 ± 119 ± 1931 ± 6Cdc429 ± 423 ± 230 ± 2023 ± 1Arf-1 + RhoAaConcentrations of Arf-1 were varied, and RhoA or PKCα was held constant at 300 nm.346 ± 21346 ± 21Arf-1 + PKCαaConcentrations of Arf-1 were varied, and RhoA or PKCα was held constant at 300 nm.731 ± 24731 ± 24PKCα + RhoAbConcentrations of PKCα are varied, RhoA was held constant at 300 nm, and Arf-1 was held constant at 1 μm.14 ± 4177 ± 9PKCα + Arf-1bConcentrations of PKCα are varied, RhoA was held constant at 300 nm, and Arf-1 was held constant at 1 μm.22 ± 12716 ± 25a Concentrations of Arf-1 were varied, and RhoA or PKCα was held constant at 300 nm.b Concentrations of PKCα are varied, RhoA was held constant at 300 nm, and Arf-1 was held constant at 1 μm.

This generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the Pasteurellaceae member Haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain Gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed GshF), as has been reported recently for the Gram-positive firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes. Here, we show that yet another member of the Pasteurellaceae family, Pasteurella multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and GshF-driven biosynthesis. Domain architecture analysis shows that this P. multocida GshF bifunctional ligase contains an N-terminal γ-proteobacterial γ-ECL-like domain followed by a typical ATP-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known GS ligases. Recombinant P. multocida GshF overexpresses as an ∼85-kDa protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. The γ-ECL activity of GshF is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (Ki = 13.6 mm). Furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of GshF proteins.

Glutathione (GSH; l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) is the predominant low molecular weight peptide thiol present in many Gram-negative bacteria and in virtually all eukaryotes, except those that lack mitochondria (1.Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Arrick B. Overdank-Bogart T. Aley S.B. Science. 1984; 224: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Glutathione is made in a highly conserved two-step ATP-dependent biosynthesis pathway by two unrelated peptide bond-forming enzymes (3.Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar). In the first and rate-limiting reaction, γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase (γ-ECL) 2The abbreviations used are: γ-ECL, γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase; γ-EC, γ-glutamylcysteine; GS, glutathione synthetase; TS-DHFR, bifunctional thymidylate synthase/dihydrofolate reductase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PK, pyruvate kinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.2The abbreviations used are: γ-ECL, γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase; γ-EC, γ-glutamylcysteine; GS, glutathione synthetase; TS-DHFR, bifunctional thymidylate synthase/dihydrofolate reductase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PK, pyruvate kinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. (EC 6.3.2.2) condenses the γ-carboxylate of l-glutamic acid with l-cysteine to form the dipeptide γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-EC), according to -Glu+ -Cys+ATP→Me2+γ-EC+ADP+Pi where Me2+ can be magnesium or manganese (4.Kelly B.S. Antholine W.E. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5.Abbott J.J. Pei J. Ford J.L. Qi Y. Grishin V.N. Pitcher L.A. Phillips M.A. Grishin N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42099-42107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the second step, γ-EC is condensed with glycine in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.2.3), according to γ-EC+Gly+ATP→Me2+GSH+ADP+Pi where Me2+ again can be magnesium or manganese. The activity of eukaryotic γ-ECL is precisely controlled by nonallosteric glutathione feedback inhibition, the limited availability of cellular l-Cys, and the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of the expression and activity of the enzyme under various physiological conditions (6.Griffith O.W. Free Radic Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Bacterial glutathione homeostasis is less well characterized, although glutathione feedback inhibition appears to be of major importance, as Escherichia coli expresses its γ-ECL constitutively (7.Apontoweil P. Berends W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 399: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and because the E. coli γ-ECL Ki for glutathione is about 3 mm (8.Murata K. Kimura A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1982; 44: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a value consistent with feedback regulation at physiological glutathione levels. Recently, the structure of the monomeric γ-ECL of E. coli has become available (9.Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15052-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which confirms its predicted structural homology with glutamine synthetases (5.Abbott J.J. Pei J. Ford J.L. Qi Y. Grishin V.N. Pitcher L.A. Phillips M.A. Grishin N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42099-42107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By comparing the crystal structures of unliganded ligase and ligase complexed with a sulfoximine-based transition-state analog inhibitor, the cysteine binding site was identified to be formed inductively at the transition state (9.Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15052-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The basis for this induced fit mechanism is a conformational change of a switch loop consisting of residues 240–249. Moreover, this loop forms the starting point of a 58-amino acid stretch that covers the active site and that has been termed the central variable arm, as it varies widely among γ-ECL family members. Analogously, crystal structures of the unrelated dimeric GS from yeast, unliganded and complexed with its substrate γ-EC, the ATP analog AMP-PNP, and two magnesium ions, revealed substantial conformational changes in which the free enzyme, which adopts an open conformation, grasps the substrate and ATP analog by forming new secondary structure elements (10.Gogos A. Shapiro L. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1669-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, the structural studies indicate that glutathione formation requires certain conformational rearrangements in the two unrelated ligases of the pathway, which, however, do not play a role in cooperative or allosteric mechanisms. The reported negative homotropic cooperativity of rat GS toward γ-EC appears to be the exception to this rule (11.Luo J.L. Huang C.S. Babaoglu K. Anderson M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GS ligases can be grouped into bacterial and eukaryotic protein families, for which pairwise sequence comparisons indicate no significant relationship (12.Copley, S. D., and Dhillon, J. K. (2002) Genome Biol. 2002, 3/research0025Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the E. coli (13.Yamaguchi H. Kato H. Hata Y. Nishioka T. Kimura A. Oda J. Katsube Y. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3204-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and yeast (10.Gogos A. Shapiro L. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1669-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) GS ligases, however, adopt a similar fold, which extends across two domains, collectively referred to as the ATP-grasp fold (16.Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Other members of the ATP-grasp enzyme superfamily include, among others, biotin carboxylase α-chain (17.Levert K.L. Lloyd R.B. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), succinate-CoA ligase (18.Joyce M.A. Fraser M.E. Brownie E.R. James M.N. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7273-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), carbamoylphosphate synthetase (19.Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), cyanophycin synthetase (CphA (20.Krehenbrink M. Steinbuchel A. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2599-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), and d-Ala-d-Ala ligase (DdlB (21.Fan C. Moews P.C. Walsh C.T. Knox J.R. Science. 1994; 266: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)), from which it can be appreciated that ATP-grasp enzymes carry out ATP-dependent carboxylate to amine/thiol ligase reactions in a number of unrelated biosynthetic pathways, accepting a wide variety of donor and acceptor substrates. In the course of evolution, ATP-grasp folds have therefore been independently recruited to provide the catalytic scaffold for specialized non-ribosomally encoded peptide bond-forming reactions. Glutahione is considered to play a key role in protecting cells against oxidative toxicity, yet its production among prokaryotes appears to be largely confined to the Gram-negative cyanobacteria and proteobacteria (22.Fahey R.C. Brown W.C. Adams W.B. Worsham M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a number of Gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococci, enterococci, and clostridiales, collectively classified as firmicutes, have been found to accumulate glutathione (1.Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other aerobic Gram-positive genera may produce alternative cysteine derivatives to functionally substitute for glutathione, such as streptomycetes, which accumulate the cysteine/sugar condensate mycothiol (23.Sakuda S. Zhou Z.Y. Yamada Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1347-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, Janowiak and Griffith (24.Janowiak B.E. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11829-11839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reported that glutathione synthesis occurs atypically in Streptococcus agalactiae, as they identified the functional gene responsible for glutathione accumulation as coding for a bifunctional protein catalyzing bothγ-ECL and GS reactions. Shortly after the Janowiak and Griffith report (24.Janowiak B.E. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11829-11839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Gopal et al. (25.Gopal S. Borovok I. Ofer A. Yanku M. Cohen G. Goebel W. Kreft J. Aharonowitz Y. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3839-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) ascribed glutathione synthesis in Listeria monocytogenes to a similar bifunctional protein, termed GshF, which, by genetic inactivation, was shown to be essential for aerobic growth and virulence. The GshF fusions consist of a γ-ECL-like N-terminal domain fused to an ATP-grasp domain. Interestingly, inspection of the genome data base of lactococci, streptococci, and enterococci revealed that not all glutathione-accumulating strains possess a gshF-like sequence in their genomes (such as Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus) and, conversely, that Streptococcus mutans, which possesses a gshF-like gene, takes up rather than synthesizes glutathione (1.Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Janowiak B.E. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11829-11839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The present study originated from our interest into the role and metabolism of glutathione in Gram-negative Pasteurellaceae, which, as a consequence of their adaptation to a parasitic life style, are characterized by a reduction in genome information compared with their free-living ancestors (26.May B.J. Zhang Q. Li L.L. Paustian M.L. Whittam T.S. Kapur V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3460-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In an earlier report, we have shown that Haemophilus influenzae does not accumulate glutathione by biosynthesis but efficiently imports the tripeptide from the growth medium (27.Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Vaneechoutte M. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast to other Gram-negatives such as E. coli, the imported glutathione was found to be crucial for H. influenzae, as it scavenges its interior from a wide variety of peroxide chemicals (28.Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29.Pauwels F. Vergauwen B. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the study of glutathione accumulation by Pasteurella multocida, which forms part of the normal flora in the nasopharynx of many domestic and wild animals. Most human P multocida infections are soft tissue infections caused by animal bites (30.Yaqub S. Bjornholt J.V. Hellum K.B. Steinbakk M. Enger A.E. Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen. 2004; 124: 3194-3196PubMed Google Scholar). We show that P. multocida accumulates glutathione both by import and biosynthesis. Inspection of the genome data base of P. multocida revealed the presence of a gshF homologous sequence, which was probed as a candidate for glutathione biosynthesis. We show that the P. multocida gshF gene codes for a bifunctional ligase that is functional inside E. coli and carries out complete synthesis of glutathione. Finally, purified recombinant GshF was subjected to steady-state kinetic studies to provide insights into the significance of the bifunctionality of GshF proteins. Biochemical Reagents—All biochemical reagents used in this study were from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated otherwise. Strains and Media—E. coli strain K12 (wild type) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (New Haven, CT). E. coli strains BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and TOP10 (Invitrogen) were used for the overexpression of recombinant P. multocida GshF and as host for cloning, respectively. The E. coli strains were routinely grown in 37 °C Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, supplemented with either, or a combination of, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin or 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, as appropriate, on an orbital shaker rotating at 200 rpm. The P. multocida and S. agalactiae clinical isolates used in this study were kind gifts of Dr. Mario Vaneechoutte (Dept. of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium). P. multocida were routinely grown aerobically in BHI (brain-heart infusion broth), which was prepared from a dehydrate (BD Biosciences). To study glutathione accumulation by P. multocida, cells were grown in chemically defined MIc medium, prepared as described by Herriott et al. (31.Herriott R.M. Meyer E.Y. Vogt M. Modan M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 513-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This medium contains 100 μm cystine as the source of organic sulfur. S. agalactiae was grown without agitation at 37 °C in Todd Hewitt broth (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% yeast extract (THY media). To prepare agar plates, 1.8% agar was added to the BHI or MIc liquid growth media before autoclaving. DNA Manipulations—All nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) unless indicated otherwise. Plasmid isolations, ligations, and transformations were performed as described (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA for ligation experiments was prepared on a 30-ml scale using the Qiagen (Crawley, UK) plasmid purification kit. The sequences of final construct inserts were routinely confirmed by DNA sequencing at GEXbyweb (GENOME express, Meylan, France). P. multocida and S. agalactiae genomic DNA was prepared using the Qiagen genomic tip-100/G protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions. To verify the in vivo function of the γ-ECL·ATP-grasp fusion protein (referred to as GshF in this study), a 2,628-bp subgenomic fragment spanning the promoter and terminator regions of the P. multocida gshF gene (see Fig. 1) was amplified via PCR using P. multocida genomic DNA, Taq GoldStar® DNA polymerase (Eurogentec Ltd., Southampton, UK), and the following primer pair: forward primer 5′-GTGATTCAATTATTAGTGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTGTTCTTCGTCAATTGC-3′. The PCR fragments were ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), thereby constructing pGEM-gshFSG. To overexpress P. multocida GshF in an E. coli background, we amplified the gshF gene (open reading frame Pm1048) by PCR using P. multocida genomic DNA as a template, the forward primer 5′-TTCCATATGAAAATTCAACATATC-3′, and the reverse primer 5′-TTACTCCAGTTCAGGAA-3′, hereby introducing an NdeI site (underlined) at the 5′ end. The 2,280-bp amplified product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and the resulting plasmid was digested with PstI. The linearized plasmid was made blunt-ended with VentR® DNA polymerase and was subsequently digested with NdeI. Similarly, the expression plasmid pET-11a (Novagen, Madison, WI) was digested with BamHI, blunt-ended, and digested with NdeI. Then vector and insert were ligated to each other, thereby constructing expression plasmid pET-GshFPm. To overexpress S. agalactiae GshF in an E. coli background, we amplified the gshF gene (open reading frame SAG1821 and 71 bp of terminator region) by PCR using S. agalactiae genomic DNA as a template, the forward primer 5′-CAGCATATGATTATCGATCGACTGTTAC-3′, and the reverse primer 5′-GCGAAGCTTCTAGTGATGACAAGGGAT-3′, hereby introducing an NdeI site (underlined) at the 5′ end and a HindIII (underlined) site at the 3′ end. The 2,339-bp amplified product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and the resulting plasmid was double digested with NdeI/HindIII. Similarly, the expression plasmid pET-GshFPm was NdeI/HindIII double digested, and vector and insert were ligated to each other, thereby constructing expression plasmid pET-GshFSa. Construction of a gshA-gshB-E. coli K12 Double Mutant—In E. coli, γ-ECL and GS are encoded by the genes gshA and gshB, respectively. The gshA-gshB-E. coli K12 double mutant was constructed according to the “lambda Red” method (described in Ref. 33.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR fragments of the kanamycin-resistance gene from the pACYC177 plasmid (Fermentas GMBH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) were amplified with primers that contained a 50-bp 5′-end extension, identical or complementary, respectively, to nucleotides -50 to -1 or 1558 to 1608 of the E. coli K12 1557-bp gshA gene (forward primer, 5′-ACCATTACAGTTATGCTAATTAAAACGATTTTGACAGGCGGGAGGTCAATATGAGCCATATTCAACGGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ATTCCAGAGATGAAATTTTGGCCACTCACGAGTGGCCTTTTTCTTTTCTGTTAGAAAAACTCATCGAGCA-3′). K12 E. coli strain, harboring plasmid pKD46, which encodes arabinose-inducible λ-phage Red recombinase, and grown in medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 0.04% l-arabinose, was transformed by electroporation with the purified PCR product. Kanamycin-resistant clones, which had integrated the PCR product by homologous recombination in frame to the gshA gene promoter, were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic, grown at 37 °C, and purified at 42 °C to cure the pKD46 plasmid of the strain. The in-frame replacement of the gshA gene by the PCR product was confirmed by PCR using primers that flank the replaced gshA gene (forward primer, 5′-TGTCTGTTAGCGGGATGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CATCCGGGTATGATCGAC-3′) (data not shown). The final gshA-gshB-E. coli K12 double mutant was then constructed applying an identical methodology, now using the gshA-E. coli K12 mutant as a host for the electroporation of gshB-interrupting PCR fragments. These PCR fragments contained the chloramphenicol-resistance cassette of the pACYC184 plasmid (Fermentas GMBH) and were amplified with primers that contained a 50-bp 5′-end extension, identical or complementary, respectively, to nucleotides 1–50 or 901–951 of the E. coli 951-bp K12 gshB gene (forward primer, 5′-ATGATCAAGCTCGGCATCGTGATGGACCCCATCGCAAACATCAACATCAACAGCACCTCAAAAACACCAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTACTGCTGCTGTAAACGTGCTTCGATGGCATCCATTAACATTCCGGTGACTACCAGGCGTTTAAGGGCA-3′). The insertion of the PCR product into the gshB gene was confirmed by PCR using primers that flank the interrupted gshB gene (forward primer, 5′-GAGACAACTGCGCTCACC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCGCTGTCACTCAGAGTC-3′) (data not shown). Recombinant Expression and Purification of P. multocida and S. agalactiae GshF—An overnight culture of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) bearing pET-GshFPm was used to inoculate 5 liters of carbenicillin-supplemented LB medium at a ratio of 10 ml/liter. The expression culture was incubated at 37 °C under vigorous shaking to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.7–0.9, after which isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After being cultured for another 15 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min, at 4 °C. The cell pellets were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (5 ml/liter original culture) and sonicated. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to produce cell-free extract. An identical procedure was applied to obtain recombinant S. agalactiae GshF. To purify either P. multocida or S. agalactiae recombinant GshF, crude protein solution was subjected to medium pressure chromatography using an Δkta-design fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC, Amersham Biosciences). Other chromatographic equipment was also purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The cell-free extract was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, diluted 3-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm NaCl (Buffer A), and applied onto a Q-Sepharose FF packed HR 16/10 column pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was then washed with 100 ml of Buffer A followed by elution using an increasing step gradient of 5 mm NaCl increments in Buffer A, each increment generating a 50-ml elution fraction. To the fraction containing the highest amount of GshF, NH4(SO4)2 was added to a final concentration of 1 m, after which precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was applied onto a butyl-Sepharose FF packed HR 16/10 column that had been equilibrated with Buffer C (Buffer A, with 1 m NH4(SO4)2). The column was washed with Buffer C, and eluate was obtained using a linear gradient of Buffer A at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. GshF started to elute at 75% Buffer A. The fractions containing purest GshF were then applied onto a desalting column (HiPrep™ 26/10 desalting column; 10 ml/min) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Eluate was subsequently applied onto 0.5 ml of Source Q anion-exchange resin that had been equilibrated with Buffer A, and GshF was concentrated by a one-step elution from 0 to 300 mm of NaCl. Concentrated GshF (2 ml) was then loaded onto a Superdex G-200 (16/60) gel filtration column (120 ml total volume), pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl. This buffer was used for down-flow elution at a rate of 1 ml/min. GshF eluted as a single peak and was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as determined by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. GshF proteins were stored without supplements at -80 °C until use. The native molecular masses of either P. multocida or S. agalactiae recombinant GshF were determined by gel filtration on a Superdex G-200 (16/60) column with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl (1 ml/min). The molecular size standards for gel filtration were β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Blue dextran was included to identify the void volume. The concentration of purified protein was determined by the method of Bradford (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Agar Disk Diffusion Susceptibility Assays—E. coli (supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics) or P. multocida precultures, grown overnight, were diluted 1:50 to 1:100 in LB or MIc medium, respectively, to an A600 of ∼0.005 and then grown to an A600 of 0.75 (mid-exponential phase). Using sterile cotton swabs, cells were confluently inoculated onto LB agar plates (E. coli) or MIc agar plates, either supplemented or not with 100 μm GSSG (P. multocida). Round sterile filters (5.2-mm diameter) were placed in the center of the plates and spotted with 5 μlof 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 0.5 m t-butyl hydroperoxide, 2.78 m methylglyoxal, or 2.0 m diamide. Zones of growth inhibition were measured (in millimeters) after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C (E. coli) in a candle extinction jar (P. multocida). The experiments were performed in triplicate; mean values are reported, with error bars representing the standard error of the mean (S.E.), and were analyzed using the unpaired t test (Graphpad Instat Software, San Diego, CA) with p < 0.05 considered significant. Determination of Intracellular Glutathione—Overnight grown E. coli (supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics) or P. multocida precultures were diluted 1:50 to 1:100 in LB or MIc medium (either supplemented or not with 100 μm GSSG), respectively, to an A600 of ∼0.005 and then grown to an A600 of 0.25 (early exponential phase). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) before being suspended in the same buffer. Cells were subsequently disrupted via sonication, and cell-free extracts were prepared by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 25 °C). After determination of total protein, cell-free extracts were incubated at 95 °C for 15 min, and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 25 °C). The sample glutathione concentrations were determined according to the GSSG reductase-based quantification assay described by Tietze (35.Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar) using a glutathione standard curve. The results are expressed as nmol of intracellular glutathione/mg of total protein. The experiments were performed in triplicate; mean values are reported with errors representing S.E. Enzyme Assays—The γ-ECL and GS activities of recombinant P. multicida GshF were determined by a recognized ATPase assay, which couples ADP to ATP recycling to the oxidation of NADH (using the coupled activities of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), which can be monitored continuously at 340 nm (PK-LDH method (36.Belda F.F. Carmona F.G. Canovas F.G. Gomez J.C. Lozano J.A. Rev. Esp. Fisiol. 1982; 38: 327-332PubMed Google Scholar)).

A prime structural feature distinguishing fungal glucosylceramides from those of plants and animals is a methyl group at the C9-position of the sphingoid base, the biosynthesis of which has never been investigated. Using information on the presence or absence of C9-methylated glucosylceramides in different fungal species, we developed a bioinformatics strategy to identify the gene responsible for the biosynthesis of this C9-methyl group. This phylogenetic profiling allowed the selection of a single candidate out of 24–71 methyltransferase sequences present in each of the fungal species with C9-methylated glucosylceramides. A Pichia pastoris knock-out strain lacking the candidate sphingolipid C9-methyltransferase was generated, and indeed, this strain contained only non-methylated glucosylceramides. In a complementary approach, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was engineered to produce glucosylceramides suitable as a substrate for C9-methylation. C9-methylated sphingolipids were detected in this strain expressing the candidate from P. pastoris, demonstrating its function as a sphingolipid C9-methyltransferase. The enzyme belongs to the superfamily of S-adenosylmethionine-(SAM)-dependent methyltransferases and shows highest sequence similarity to plant and bacterial cyclopropane fatty acid synthases. An in vitro assay showed that sphingolipid C9-methylation is membrane-bound and requires SAM and Δ4,8-desaturated ceramide as substrates.

An in vitro assay showed that sphingolipid C9-methylation is membrane-bound and requires SAM and Δ4,8-desaturated ceramide as substrates. Sphingolipids of fungi and plants can be grouped into different classes based on the nature of their polar headgroups. In the case of GIPC, 2The abbreviations used are: GIPC, glycosylinositolphosphorylceramide; IPC, inositolphosphorylceramide; CDS, coding sequence; contig, group of overlapping clones; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; ESI, electrospray ionization; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MCS, multiple cloning site; MS, mass spectrometry; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 2The abbreviations used are: GIPC, glycosylinositolphosphorylceramide; IPC, inositolphosphorylceramide; CDS, coding sequence; contig, group of overlapping clones; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; ESI, electrospray ionization; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MCS, multiple cloning site; MS, mass spectrometry; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. an inositol residue is phosphodiester-linked to the hydrophobic part of the molecule, the ceramide backbone. In the case of cerebrosides, the ceramide is directly linked to a glucosyl or galactosyl residue that can form the base for further glycosylations. The ceramide backbone usually carries several functional groups such as hydroxy groups, (E)- or (Z)-double bonds, methyl branches at aliphatic or olefinic carbon atoms, or even cyclopropane rings. Different patterns of functional groups are characteristic for GIPC versus cerebrosides as well as for different organisms (see Fig. 1) (1Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

The functional significance of these differences has yet to be investigated.The genes responsible for most functional groups have been cloned (reviewed in Refs. 4Warnecke D. Heinz E. Cell. Mol.

Bot. 2004; 93: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and now their biological functions will be characterized by reverse genetic, molecular, and cell biological approaches. A structural feature hardly studied so far is the C9-methyl branch at the (E)-Δ8-double bond of fungal cerebrosides. Many fungi share a canonical glucosylceramide structure with (E,E)-9-methylsphinga-4,8-dienine as sphingoid base, carrying (E)-double bonds at the Δ4- and Δ8-positions and a methyl branch at the C9-position (4Warnecke D. Heinz E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 919-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Besides in fungi, a glucosylceramide with the same structure has been found in the sea anemone Metridium senile (9Karlsson K.-A. Leffler H. Samuelsson B.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 574: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the first organism described to contain C9-methylated sphingolipids, as well as in the protist Thraustochytrium globosum (10Jenkins K.M. Jensen P.R. Fenical W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 7637-7640Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Structurally related glucosylceramides containing an additional Δ10-double bond have been found in T. globosum, in several species of starfish, in the marine sponge Agelas mauritianus, and in the sea squirt Phallusia fumigata (10Jenkins K.M.

Fungal glucosylceramides carrying a C9-methyl group as well as certain plant glucosylceramides induce fruiting body formation in the fungus Schizophyllum commune (16Kawai G. Ohnishi M. Fujino Y. Ikeda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 779-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human patients with a Cryptococcus neoformans infection as well as rabbits infected with Pseudallescheria boydii develop antibodies binding to C9-methylated fungal glucosylceramides. The purified antibodies inhibit fungal growth in culture (17Rodrigues M.L. Travassos L.R. Miranda K.R. Franzen A.J. Rozental S. de Souza W. Alviano C.S. Barreto-Bergter E. Infect.

Fungal glucosylceramides can elicit defense responses in rice plants and cell suspension cultures of rice, and treatment with these fungal glucosylceramides protects rice plants against fungal infection (19Koga J.

Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans strains deficient in the gene responsible for glucosylceramide synthesis are resistant to RsAFP2 (22Thevissen K. Warnecke D.C. François I.E.J.A. Leipelt M.

Because the C9-methyl group is the prime structural feature distinguishing fungal glucosylceramides from those of plants and mammals (Fig. 1), it is likely that C9-methylation of fungal glucosylceramides plays an important role in the interactions between fungi and other organisms.To enable the investigation of these proposed functions with molecular techniques, we were interested in identifying the gene encoding the methyltransferase that introduces the C9-methyl branch into fungal sphingolipids, as well as in directly demonstrating its biochemical function. We developed a bioinformatics strategy based on phylogenetic profiling that exploits the pattern of presence or absence of C9-methylated glucosylceramides in several fungi with completely sequenced genomes. After identifying candidate genes, we tested their involvement in sphingolipid C9-methylation by generating a knock-out mutant of the yeast P. pastoris. In a complementary experiment, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was engineered to directly demonstrate the formation of C9-methylated sphingolipids. Finally, membrane association and substrate specificity of sphingolipid C9-methylation in P. pastoris were investigated by an in vitro assay.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPhylogenetic ProfilingData Base Construction and Sequence Retrieval—The complete sets of protein sequences from several fungi, plants, and animals were downloaded from the web pages of the sequencing projects listed in Supplemental Table S1 and compiled into a single data base. Swiss-Prot species identification codes (www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/speclist) were included in the sequence titles as species identifiers.Protein sequences belonging to the superfamily of SAM-dependent methyltransferases were retrieved using PSI-Blast (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar) with the S. cerevisiae sterol methyltransferase Erg6p (YML008C) as query sequence (10 iterations, inclusion threshold e ≤ 10–4).Clustering of SAM-dependent Methyltransferase Sequences—SAM-dependent methyltransferase sequences were compared pairwise using blastp (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar) (e-value e ≤ 10–4). The resulting score matrix was used as input for the TRIBE-MCL protocol (Ref. 24Enright A.J. Van Dongen S. Ouzounis C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar, available at micans.org/mcl) with parameter I = 1.1. For each cluster containing more than four sequences, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with ClustalX (25Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35206) Google Scholar).Groups of Orthologous Sequences—Within the phylogenetic tree for each cluster, groups of orthologous sequences were identified by comparing the branching pattern of the tree with the phylogeny of the species from which the sequences originate. A group of orthologous sequences is defined as a subtree of the phylogenetic tree in which the branches originate only from speciation events but not from gene duplications within the same species. Genes duplicated within a single species were counted as one gene if the duplicated sequences were more similar to each other than to any other sequence.Groups of orthologous sequences as defined above may be nested, i.e. when sequences A, B, and C form a group of orthologous sequences with branching pattern ((A,B), C), then the sequences A and B form themselves a smaller group that also fits the definition. In such cases, only the enclosing group was considered for phylogenetic profiling.Phylogenetic Profiles—The phylogenetic profile of a group of sequences is defined as the set of species from which the sequences originate (26Pellegrini M. Marcotte E.M. Thompson M.J. Eisenberg D. Yeates T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4285-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). The difference between two phylogenetic profiles was quantified by counting how many sequences were present in only one of the two profiles. The number of differences was counted as the number of sequences present only in the first profile plus the number of sequences present only in the second profile.Data Handling—Scripts for the handling of sequence data and phylogenetic trees were written in the programming language Python (www.python.org) with the Biopython libraries (www.biopython.org).Knock-out of the Sphingolipid C9-Methyltransferase in P. pastorisA knock-out cassette for an exact deletion of the candidate C9-methyltransferase CDS was constructed by triple fusion PCR as described in Ref. 27Shevchuk N.A.

All reactions were performed with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The primers used are listed in Supplemental Table S2. The underlined parts of the chimeric primers Up-R-Zeo-F and Down-F-Zeo-R are the reverse complement to the primers Zeo-F and Zeo-R, respectively. The Zeocin resistance cassette from the pGAPZ-B vector (Invitrogen) was amplified with primers Zeo-F and Zeo-R. 3099 bp of the genomic locus containing the candidate C9-methyltransferase CDS was amplified from genomic DNA of the P. pastoris strain GS115 (28Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) with primers Up-F and Down-R. From this PCR product, upstream and downstream sequences directly flanking the CDS were amplified with the nested primers Up-nested-F/Up-R-Zeo-F (530 bp) and Down-nested-R/Down-F-Zeo-R (516 bp), respectively. The upstream and downstream sequences and the Zeocin resistance cassette were fused in a single PCR for 12 rounds without primers. From this, the full-length fusion product was amplified in a separate reaction with primers Up-nested-F and Down-nested-R. The knock-out cassette was ligated into the SmaI site of the pBluescript II KS(–)-vector (Stratagene) and checked by sequencing.The knock-out cassette was excised from the plasmid with PstI/XbaI and used to transform electrocompetent cells of the strain GS115 (his4). Transformants were selected on YPD plates (34Treco D.A. Lundblad V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: Asubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Correct integration of the knock-out cassette was confirmed by PCR with the primer pairs Up-F/Zeo-int-R and Down-R/Zeo-int-F as positive and Up-F/Int-R and Down-R/Int-F as negative controls.Knock-out of SUR2 in S. cerevisiaeA knock-out cassette for an exact deletion of the SUR2 CDS (YDR297W) was constructed by PCR with long primers as described in Ref. 29Lundblad V.

Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar) was amplified with primers SUR2-kan-F and SUR2-kan-R. These primers contain ≈80 bp complementary to the sequences directly flanking the SUR2 CDS (underlined). The PCR reaction was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The knock-out cassette was ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega).The knock-out cassette was excised from the plasmid with NotI/SacII and used to transform chemically competent cells of the strain UTL-7A (MATa ura3–52 trp1 leu2–3/112). Transformants were selected on YPD plates containing 200 mg/liter G-418. Correct integration of the knock-out cassette was confirmed by PCR with primer pairs SUR2-up-F/SUR2-up-R and SUR2-down-F/SUR2-Down-R as positive controls and primer pair SUR2-up-F/SUR2-Down-R as combined positive and negative control.An S. cerevisiae Expression SystemIdentification of the Δ4- and Δ8-Desaturases from P. pastoris—For PCR-based cloning of the P. pastoris Δ4- and Δ8-desaturases, a genomic DNA library of the P. pastoris strain GS115 (28Cregg J.M.

PCR-amplification was carried out with the degenerate primers Delta4-deg-F and Delta4-deg-R at an annealing temperature of 48 °C.To amplify the Δ8-desaturase, degenerate primers were deduced from a multiple alignment of amino acid sequences from Δ5- and Δ6-fatty acid desaturases and Δ8-sphingolipid desaturases described in Ref. 32Sperling P.

PCR amplification was carried out using the degenerate primers Delta8-deg-F and Delta8-deg-R at an annealing temperature of 40 °C and resulted in PCR products of 177 bp for the Δ4-desaturase and 564 bp for the Δ8-desaturase.For the identification of full-length Δ4- and Δ8-desaturase sequences, the P. pastoris genomic DNA library was screened with these PCR products using the DIG System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The inserts of positive clones for each desaturase were sequenced, with CDS of 1083 bp (Δ4-desaturase) and 1629 bp (Δ8-desaturase) encoding polypeptides of 360 and 542 amino acids, respectively. 3The nucleotide sequences of the Δ4- and Δ8-desaturases from P. pastoris have been deposited in the GenBank™ database with accession numbers AY700778 and AY700777. The GenPept accession numbers of the deduced amino acid sequences are AAU10085 and AAU10084, respectively. Cloning of the P. pastoris Δ4- and Δ8-Desaturases—The complete CDSs of the P. pastoris Δ4- and Δ8-desaturases were amplified from genomic clones by PCR with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Δ4-desaturase) or Herculase DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, Δ8-desaturase) with the primers Delta4-F and Delta4-R (Δ4-desaturase), and Delta8-F and Delta8-R (Δ8-desaturase) (Supplemental Table S4). The primers included adapter sequences containing the indicated restriction sites (underlined). The PCR products were ligated into the pESC-URA vector (Stratagene), with the CDS of the Δ4-desaturase in the NotI and BglII sites of MCS1 and the CDS of the Δ8-desaturase in the BamHI and XhoI sites of MCS2. In this way, three different plasmids were generated: One plasmid carrying the Δ4-desaturase, one carrying the Δ8-desaturase, and one carrying both desaturases. The cloned CDSs were checked by sequencing.Cloning of a Candidate Sphingolipid C9-Methyltransferase—The complete CDS of a candidate sphingolipid C9-methyltransferase from P. pastoris was amplified from genomic DNA of the P. pastoris strain GS115 with the primers C9-F and C9-R (Supplemental Table S4). The primers included adapter sequences containing the indicated restriction sites (underlined). The PCR products were ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pYES3-CT vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was checked by sequencing.Transformation of S. cerevisiae—For the experiment shown in Fig. 3, chemically competent cells of the S. cerevisiae SUR2 knock-out strain were transformed with the empty vector pESC-URA (Fig. 3A) or with either the Δ4-desaturase (Fig. 3B), the Δ8-desaturase (Fig. 3C), or both desaturases (Fig. 3D) ligated into pESC-URA.FIGURE 3Expression of the P. pastoris Δ4- and Δ8-desaturases in an S. cerevisiae strain lacking the sphingolipid C4-hydroxylase SUR2.

A, S. cerevisiae cells lacking the sphingolipid C4-hydroxylase SUR2 while expressing the P. pastoris Δ4- and Δ8-desaturases, the human glucosylceramide synthase, and the candidate sphingolipid C9-methyltransferase from P. pastoris contained the C9-methylated sphingoid base C18-(E,E)-9-methylsphinga-4,8-dienine (d18:2–9m) as well as the non-methylated sphingoid bases shown in Fig. 3D. B, enlarged section of the chromatogram shown in A. The methylated sphingoid base C18-(E,E)-9-methylsphinga-4,8-dienine (d18:2–9m) is only present in the S. cerevisiae cells expressing the candidate C9-methyltransferase (top), but not in the control (bottom). C, comparing the ion trace of the ion with m/z = 476 (bottom) to the chromatogram (top) confirms that the peak at 20 min is indeed C18-(E,E)-9-methylsphinga-4,8-dienine (d18:2–9m). D, the ESI-MS spectrum of the peak at 20 min shows that this peak contains only the ion with m/z = 476 corresponding to C18-(E,E)-9-methylsphinga-4,8-dienine and its heavier isotope with m/z = 477.

To induce expression under the control of the GAL1 and GAL10 promotors, the cells were washed, and 100 ml of complete minimal medium containing 2% (w/v) raffinose and 2% (w/v) galactose was inoculated to give a starting optical density of A600 = 0.02. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation.Isolation of Glucosylceramides from P. pastoris—Approximately 10 g (fresh weight) of P. pastoris cells was resuspended in 20 ml of 0.45% (w/v) NaCl and boiled in a water bath for 15 min. The cells were sedimented by centrifugation, and the lipids were extracted by shaking in 30 ml of CHCl3/MeOH, 1:2 for 24 h at 8 °C followed by 30 ml of CHCl3/MeOH, 2:1. The lipid extract was washed by phase partitioning with CHCl3/MeOH/0.45% (w/v) NaCl (8:4:3) and subsequently evaporated. The lipids were redissolved in CHCl3 and applied to a 500 mg/6 ml Strata SI-2 column (Phenomenex). The column was flushed with 30 ml of CHCl3 before the glycolipids were eluted with 30 ml of acetone/2-propanol, 9:1. The glucosylceramides were purified from the acetone/2-propanol fraction by preparative TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) in CHCl3/MeOH, 85:15.Analysis of the Sphingoid Base Composition—The sphingoid base composition of P. pastoris glucosylceramides and of total S. cerevisiae cells was analyzed as described in Ref. 31Ternes P.

The DNP-derivatized sphingoid bases were extracted and purified by TLC in CHCl3/MeOH, 90:10.Analysis by reverse-phase HPLC was performed on a Multospher RP18-5 250 × 4 mm column (CS-Chromatographie) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min and a concave gradient from 84 to 100% methanol/acetonitrile/2-propanol, 10:3:1, against H2O in 55 min. The elution was monitored with a UV detector (ThermoQuest) at 350 nm.Reversed-phase HPLC/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) of DNP-derivatized sphingoid bases was performed on a MAT 95XL-Trap instrument (ThermoQuest) in negative ion mode.

The TATA-less PKR promoter possesses a novel 15-bp DNA element (kinase conserved sequence (KCS)) unique to the human and mouse PKR genes that is conserved in sequence and position. We found that Sp1 and Sp3 of the Sp family of transcription factors bind at the KCS element. Their involvement was analyzed in the activation of basal and IFN-inducible PKR promoter activity. Both the small and large isoforms of Sp3 co-purified with KCS protein binding activity (KBP) by using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells not treated with IFN. Two forms of the KCS-binding protein complex were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis; one contained Sp1 and the other Sp3. In mouse cells null for all Sp3 isoforms, PKR expression was reduced to ∼50% that of wild-type cells in the absence of IFN. The IFN-inducible expression of PKR, however, was Sp3-independent but STAT1- and JAK1-dependent. Overexpression of Sp1 in human U cells resulted in increased PKR promoter activity. In Drosophila SL2 cells lacking Sp proteins, both Sp1 and Sp3 large but not small isoforms activated PKR promoter expression, with the Sp1-mediated activation dominant. Mutational analysis of the PKR promoter region indicated a cooperative interaction between two different Sp sites, one of which is within the KCS element. These results establish that, in the absence of IFN treatment, activation of PKR basal expression is mediated by Sp1 and Sp3 proteins in a cooperative manner.

A range of biological processes is affected by the PKR protein, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, in addition to virus multiplication. Because of these broad and basic functions affected by PKR, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the amount and activity of the PKR protein, including the transcriptional activation of the PKR gene, is of fundamental importance.

J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the uteroglobin gene promoter is up-regulated by Sp1 but repressed by Sp3 (27Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Sp1 and Sp3 are also reported to act synergistically to enhance transcription in the case of the c-met gene (28Zhang X. Li Y. Dai C. Yang J. Mundel P. Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F82-F94Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of Sp factors in the constitutive expression of genes such as PKR that are also inducible by IFN. Here we establish that activation of the protein kinase PKR promoter in the absence of interferon is mediated by Sp factor proteins that are constituent components of the heteromeric transcriptional activator (KBP) complex that binds at the KCS DNA element. Protein purification and immunochemical and mutational analyses established that both the large (li) and small isoforms (si) of Sp3 are KBP complex components. Sp3li and the previously identified Sp1 protein both activate the PKR promoter in mammalian and insect cells. In Drosophila cells devoid of Sp factors, the PKR promoter is silent but is activated by both Sp1 and Sp3li, whereas Sp3si neither activates nor antagonizes Sp1-mediated transactivation of the PKR promoter. These results provide new mechanistic insight into the activation of the PKR gene and unequivocally demonstrate that members of the Sp protein family of transcription factors are fundamentally important determinants of basal promoter activity of the PKR gene in the absence of IFN treatment. Cell Maintenance and Interferon Treatment—Human amnion U cells and mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 or 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), respectively, and 1% sodium pyruvate (Cambrex Bio Science), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Ward S.V.

Drosophila Schneider line SL-2 cells (Drosophila melanogaster embryo, SL-2) were kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Poole of this institution and were grown in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) at ambient room temperature (22–25 °C). Plasmid Constructions—The pCAT-Basic promoter-less plasmid (Promega) containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was used for construction of reporter plasmids containing WT and mutated KCS and ISRE as well as constructs with 5′-deletion in the minimal promoter region. The construction of human PKR promoter plasmids p503(WT), p63(WT), p130(WT), p503(KCSmt6A), p503(KCSmt9T), and p503(ISREmt8T) were as described previously (18Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1999; 254: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The p503(KCSdelISRE mt8T) double mutant construction was generated by insertion of a 130-bp BamHI/XbaI fragment derived from p503 (ISREmt8T) into pBluescript (Stratagene) with the PstI site in the MCS deleted (pBluescriptΔPstI). The KCS element was deleted by using PstI and StyI, followed by filling in with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and plasmid closure with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting BamHI/XbaI fragment containing KCSdelISREmt8T was exchanged for the corresponding BamHI/XbaI of p503 (ISREmt8T). pGL2-basic promoter-less plasmid (Promega) containing the firefly luciferase gene as the reporter was used for construction of the p503(WT)LUC promoter plasmid that was generously provided by Dr. Ping Zhang of this laboratory. pRSV-βgal was generously provided by Dr. Joe Nevins (Duke University, Durham).

The pCMV vector without insert was generated by deleting the Sp1 insert from the pCMVSp1 construct. The Drosophila actin promoter-driven expression plasmids pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 for WT Sp1 and Sp3, respectively, were gifts from Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley) and Dr. Grace Gill (Harvard Medical School, Boston). The pPac vector without insert was generated by deleting the Sp3 insert from the pPacSp3 construct. pPacSp3(Δ1.+2.AUG) was as described recently (35Sapetschnig A. Koch F. Rischitor G. Mennenga T.

All DNA plasmids used in transfections were purified either by cesium chloride equilibrium centrifugation or by using a QIAfilter plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen); plasmid integrity was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Varying amounts of pCMVSp1 and pCMVSp3 expression plasmids together with added empty pCMV-4 vector to give a total of 5 μg of pCMV DNA were used for co-transfections. IFN treatment was initiated 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and extracts were prepared and luciferase, CAT, and β-galactosidase activities determined as described previously (10Kuhen K.L. Samuel C.E.

Protein concentrations of extracts were determined by the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The data presented are the average values derived from three to five independent experiments. Drosophila SL-2 cells were transfected using Cellfectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Sf-900 II SMF medium (Invitrogen) was used to dilute the DNA as well as Cellfection reagent. Briefly, SL-2 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at ∼4 × 106 cells/dish 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were then transfected with 3 μg of CAT reporter plasmid and the indicated amounts of pPacSp1 or pPacSp3 expression constructs and pPac empty vector as necessary to maintain constant DNA amounts. Fresh media was added to the cells 24 h post-transfection, and cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and extracts were prepared by repeated freeze-thaw cycles followed by determination of CAT activity as described previously (10Kuhen K.L.

Cell suspensions were gently pipetted up and down, and the lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain nuclear pellets. Nuclear pellets were washed two times with cell lysis buffer (lacking Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture) followed by resuspension in 2 volumes of nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 10 mm KCl; 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mm DTT; 1 mm Na3VO4; 420 mm NaCl; 20% glycerol (v/v); and 10% protease inhibitor mixture (v/v) (Sigma)). Nuclei were extracted by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min; the resultant supernatant fraction was used as nuclear extracts. Whole Cell Extract Preparation—Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (19Ward S.V. Samuel C.E. Virology. 2003; 313: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were washed, scraped, and pelleted as described above.

For supershift analyses, rabbit polyclonal antisera against Sp1 (07-645) and Sp3 (07-107) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Incubation with antibodies was carried out on ice for 45 min prior to addition of 32P-labeled probe. Western Immunoblot Assays—Proteins were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then probed with an appropriate dilution of primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% skim milk. Western blot detection was done with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody using an ECL detection reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), according to manufacturer's protocol. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a VersaDoc (Bio-Rad) imaging system, and quantitation was done using the Quantity One software program. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used to detect Sp1 protein (07-645; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse Sp3 protein (sc-644; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and human Sp3 protein (07-107; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Monoclonal antibody anti-hemagglutinin from Roche Applied Science (clone 12CA5) was used to detect hemagglutinintagged Sp1 and Sp3 proteins in extracts of transfected U-cells, and rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant mouse PKR expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion was prepared by our laboratory.

https://openalex.org/W1974765982,"Bacterial 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthases (DAHPSs) have been divided into either of two classes (Class I/Class II) or subfamilies (AroAIα/AroAIβ). Our investigation into the biochemical properties of the unique bifunctional DAHPS from Bacillus subtilis provides new insight into the evolutionary link among DAHPS subfamilies. In the present study, the DAHPS (aroA) and chorismate mutase (aroQ) activities of B. subtilis DAHPS are separated by domain truncation. Detailed enzymatic studies with the full-length wild-type protein and the truncated domains led to our hypothesis that the aroQ domain was fused to the N terminus of aroA in B. subtilis during evolution for the purpose of feedback regulation and not for the creation of a bona fide bifunctional enzyme. In addition, examination of aroA and aroQ fusion proteins from Porphyromonas gingivalis, in which the aroQ domain is fused to the C terminus of aroA, further supports the hypothesis. These results, along with sequence structure analysis of the DAHPS families suggest that “feedback regulation” may indeed be the evolutionary link between the two classes/subfamilies. It is likely that DAHPSs evolved from a primitive unregulated member of the AroAIβ subfamily. During evolution, some members of the AroAIβ subfamily remained unregulated, whereas other members acquired an extra domain for feedback regulation. The AroAIα subfamilies, however, evolved in a more complex manner to acquire insertions/extensions in the (β/α)8 barrel to function as regulatory elements.

Chorismate is rearranged to prephenate by chorismate mutase (CM; EC 5.4.99.5) or to be converted into anthranilate by anthranilate synthase in the subsequent Phe/Tyr or Trp branch biosyntheses, respectively. DAHPSs exist in both microorganisms and plants (2.Knaggs A.R. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 334-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3.Knaggs A.R. Nat. Prod.

Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) divided 25 randomly chosen microbial DAHPS protein sequences into two classes (defined as Class I and Class II). In addition, 29 randomly chosen 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthases (KDOPS; EC 4.1.2.16) amino acid sequences were divided into two separate families of their own. KDOPS, a homologous enzyme involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, catalyzes a similar condensation reaction to that catalyzed by DAHPS, except between PEP and arabinose 5-phosphate (10.Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). In a more inclusive-type analysis of over 100 DAHPS homologous amino acid sequences (including the KDOPSs) from both microbial and plant sources, performed by Jensen and colleagues (7.Subramaniam P.S.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4061-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), members of both enzymes were divided into two distinct main families (defined as AroAI and AroAII). The AroAII family, defined as “plant-like” DAHPS, are mainly plant proteins. The AroAI family, mainly microbial proteins, is further divided into subfamilies AroAIα and AroAIβ in the same analysis. A comparison of the two phylogenetic analyses find that Birck's DAHPS Class II and Class I correspond to Jensen's AroAIα and AroAIβ, respectively. Therefore, to simplify further discussion, the notation by Jensen (AroAIα and AroAIβ) will be utilized in the remainder of this manuscript. Attempts at rationalizing this computer-generated bifurcation by examining the biochemical property or properties of various members of these DAHPS subfamilies have been a challenge for years. Three different properties, metal requirement, allosteric effectors, and substrate specificity have been separately proposed as the possible criteria characterizing the individual subfamilies (7.Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The metal requirement hypothesis (8.Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggests that the AroAIβ enzymes are non-metalloenzymes, whereas the AroAIα enzymes are metalloenzymes; however, recent studies demonstrate that some AroAIβ DAHPSs are metalloenzymes. The present of an absolute conserved metal binding sequence motif in all DAHPS, thus far identified, suggests that all DAHPSs are indeed metalloenzymes (6.Wu J. Howe D.L. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27525-27531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on the results of DAHPS from the Bacillus subtilis derivative strain 168 (12.Jensen R.A.

Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) proposes that the AroAIβ enzymes are inhibited by the branch intermediates chorismate/prephenate; whereas, the AroAIα enzymes are inhibited by the terminal amino acid products Phe/Tyr/Trp. However, some AroAIα enzymes have been shown to only be inhibited by their terminal amino acid products (6.Wu J. Howe D.L. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27525-27531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, the substrate specificity hypothesis (7.Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the more “ancient” AroAIβ subfamily has a broad substrate specificity, whereas the more “recent” AroAIα subfamily has a more narrow substrate specificity. Recently, this hypothesis has been found to be incorrect (6.Wu J. Howe D.L. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27525-27531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem.

Hence, the evolutionary link (or biochemical differences) between DAHPS subfamilies still remains unclear. New studies on the DAHPS from the parent B. subtilis Marburg strain suggested that it is a naturally evolved bifunctional enzyme possessing both DAHPS (aroA) and chorismate mutase (CM, aroQ) activity (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, the enzyme is uniquely feedback-regulated by the branch point intermediates prephenate and chorismate (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, a more thorough investigation into the origin and biochemical properties of this fused aroQ-aroA of B. subtilis may provide further understanding on the evolution/biochemically derived bifurcation of the DAHPS family. In the present study, the aroQ and aroA activities of B. subtilis DAHPS (abbreviated as aroA(Q)Bs) were separated by domain truncation. Results from our studies utilizing the full-length protein and the truncated domains suggest that aroQ was fused with aroA in B. subtilis for the sole purpose of feedback regulation and not for the creation of a bona fide bifunctional enzyme. Moreover, examination of another aroA-aroQ fusion protein, Porphyromonas gingivalis DAHPS (abbreviated as aroA(Q)Pg), in which the fusion linkage is at the C terminus of aroA instead of the N terminus, further supports these predictions. These results, along with further sequence structure analyses, suggest that feedback regulation pattern may be the evolutionary link (biochemical rationale for the computer-generated bifurcation) between the two subfamilies of the DAHPSs. Strains and Plasmids—Genomic P. gingivalis DNA was a generous gift from Dr. M. Duncan (Forsyth Dental Center, Boston, MA). Cloning was carried out in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). All genes were constructed into the laboratory stock plasmid pT7–7, an E. coli overexpression vector under the control of the T7 promoter. All plasmid constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) for protein overexpression. DNA Manipulations—Nucleic acid manipulations were performed according to standard procedures (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen and are listed in Table 1. Plasmids were prepared using the Promega Wizard DNA purification kit. The sequences of all genes and relevant plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the University of Michigan DNA Core Facility.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used in the present studyNameSequenceP1GTATCCCACGGCGCCAATAACATATGTCCGAAAAGCAAGACGP2CGTCTTGCTTTTCGGACATATGTTATTGGCGCCGTGGGATACP3ctagattctagaattcatATGAAGTACTGTGATTTTACP4gattatgaattcggatccTTATGATATACAGTCGTCP5GCTTCAGGAAGAAGATCACTAACATATGAGCAAAGCGCTGCTTGTCP6GACAAGCAGCGCTTTGCTCATATGTTAGTGATCTTCTTCCTGAAGC Open table in a new tab Construction of Plasmids—The plasmids pT7/aroA(Q)BsCM and pT7/aroA(Q)BsDAHPS, which express the truncated CM domain and DAHPS domain of aroA(Q)Bs, respectively, were constructed using a pair of complementary primers P1 and P2 (Table 1). The primers were designed to incorporate a stop codon followed by an NdeI site between the codons for His-90 and Ser-91. The plasmid pT7/aroA(Q)BsCM was obtained directly by the standard QuikChange mutagenesis methodology utilizing pT7/aroA(Q)Bs, previously constructed (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), as template. The plasmid pT7/aroA(Q)BsDAHPS was obtained from the pT7/aroA(Q)BsCM plasmid first by NdeI digestion to remove the 1–90 amino acid coding region followed by self-ligation of the remaining ∼3300-bp fragment. In vivo expression led to the incorporation of a new methionine residue preceding Ser-91 in the aroA(Q)BsDAHPS. Standard polymerase chain reaction methodologies were used to amplify the aroA-like gene (NC_002950) from P. gingivalis genomic DNA using forward primer P3 and reverse primer P4 (Table 1). The amplification product was isolated, restricted with NdeI and BamHI (Table 1, underlined), and ligated into the similarly restricted expression vector pT7–7. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue cells. The presence of plasmids containing the desired gene from several transformants was verified by restriction analysis, and the gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids pT7/aroA(Q)PgDAHPS and pT7/aroA(Q)PgCM, which express the truncated DAHPS domain and CM domain of aroA(Q)Pg, respectively, were constructed using the same methodology described above for truncating CM/DAHPS domains from aroA(Q)Bs. The truncation was performed between Gln-263 and Ser-264 using the complementary primer pair P5 and P6 with the plasmid pT7/aroA(Q)Bs as template. Again, in vivo expression adds a new methionine preceding Ser-264 to the aroA(Q)PgDAHPS protein. Protein Overexpression and Purification—aroA(Q)BsCM, aroA(Q)BsDAHPS, and aroA(Q)PgCM were expressed and purified utilizing the protocol previously described for aroA(Q)Bs (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). AroA(Q)Pg and aroA(Q)PgDAHPS were expressed and purified using a similar protocol with the following modification. The cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μm ZnCl2. During the purification, BTP buffer (1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane) was replaced by 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 50 μm ZnCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme Assay—The DAHPS activity of aroA(Q)BsDAHPS was determined by either discontinuous colorimetric assay or continuous spectrophotometric assay as described previously (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The DAHPS activity of aroA(Q)PgDAHPS and aroA(Q)Pg was determined as above, except that 50 μm ZnCl2 was added to the assay buffer. The CM activity was determined by the fixed point assay previously described (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Effect of Metal Chelators on DAHPS Activity—To determine the effect of metal chelators on DAHPS activity for aroA(Q)BsDAHPS, an enzyme sample (0.6 μm) was incubated with various concentrations of metal chelators (EDTA or DPA separately) in 100 mm BTP (pH 7.5) at 25 °C for 10 min. PEP (3 mm) was added to the enzyme/chelator solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 min before initiating the reaction with d-erythrose 4-phosphate (6 mm). The reaction time was 2 min. The DAHPS activity was measured in triplicate using the discontinuous colorimetric assay. Kinetic Studies—Reactions were performed at 37 °C using the continuous assay for the DAHPS activity of aroA(Q)BsDAHPS, the discontinuous assay for the DAHPS activity of aroA(Q)Pg and aroA(Q)PgDAHPS, and the fixed point assay for all of the CM activities. Initial velocities were determined separately for at least five concentrations of one substrate (varied between 0.1 and 5 to ∼10 × Km), whereas the concentration of the other substrate was held constant (>5 × Km). Best fits of Km and Vmax were determined by fitting the initial velocity versus substrate concentration using a non-linear least squares fit to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation. pH Dependence of aroA(Q)PgDAHPS—The pH dependence of the enzyme was measured as described previously (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Feedback Inhibition—The feedback regulation of DAHPS activity was determined by incubating enzyme (0.5 μm for aroA(Q)Bs and aroA(Q)BsDAHPS, 3 μm for aroA(Q)Pg and aroA(Q)PgDAHPS) and 3 mm PEP with a fixed concentration of potential inhibitor (1 mm) (see Figs. 3A and 4A) or with a series of concentrations of either prephenate or chorismate (see Figs. 3B and 4B) in assay buffer on ice for 15 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of d-erythrose 4-phosphate (6 mm). After 2 min, the progress of the reaction was monitored using the discontinuous assay at 37 °C. Addition of the inhibitor after the enzymatic reaction but before the assay served as a control for potential interference of the tested inhibitors with the Aminoff colorimetric assay (6.Wu J. Howe D.L. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27525-27531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Feedback inhibition of aroA(Q)Pg/aroA(Q)PgDAHPS.

SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions on a 12% polyacrylamide gel with a Mini-PRO-TEAN II electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad) and visualized with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stain. Optical spectroscopy was performed using a HP 8453 UV radiation-visible spectrophotometer. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW (17.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar). Truncation of aroA(Q)Bs—Previous studies have demonstrated that aroA(Q)Bs exhibits both DAHPS and CM activity (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An NCBI conserved domain search revealed a number of DAHPS-type domains to which a CM domain had been fused. The CM domains are either fused to the N- or C-terminal region via a short linker region (for aroA(Q)Bs amino acids, 88–103 is predicted to be the linker region). To gain insight into the true biochemical purpose of this fusion and to potentially understand the mechanism of the feedback regulation of DAHPS by the CM domain, the two domains were truncated by genetic engineering. To keep the individual domains as intact as possible, the truncation (or cleavage) site was chosen between His-90 and Ser-91 of the linker region. Both truncated proteins were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity. Purification and Truncation of aroA(Q)Pg—In addition to the aroQ-aroA fusion pattern observed in B. subtilis, the alternate fusion-type protein, in which aroQ is fused to the C terminus of aroA as opposed to the N terminus, was also found. The aroA-aroQ protein from P. gingivalis (aroA(Q)Pg) was chosen for comparative studies. The aroA(Q)Pg was expressed and purified using the same procedure described for aroA(Q)Bs (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); however, the “as-isolated” protein preparation exhibited rather low activity (< 0.3 units/mg) and contained Zn2+, Mg2+, and Cu2+ as determined by metal analysis (data not shown). The enzymatic activity was abolished by the addition of EDTA, as predicted, based on an examination of the amino acid sequence of the aroA(Q)Pg, which reveals the presence of the conserved metal binding residue Cys-24, His-203, Glu-229, and Asp-240 (6.Wu J. Howe D.L. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27525-27531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18.Shumilin I.A. Kretsinger R.H. Bauerle R.

Biol. 2000; 301: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); thus, aroA(Q)Pg is predicted to be a metalloenzyme. Therefore, it is possible that the low catalytic specific activity observed for the as-isolated enzyme preparation could be due to the presence of a contaminating, less than optimal, metal cation(s) at the metal binding site. A similar phenomenon was observed for E. coli DAHPS (Tyr-sensitive) (20.Baasov T. Knowles J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6155-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The authors found that the addition of a specific metal salt (copper) to the isolation buffers resulted in an increase in the as isolated E. coli DAHPS activity (Tyr-sensitive) (20.Baasov T. Knowles J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6155-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus zinc, which has been found in the as isolated DAHPS preparations from other microbial sources (6.Wu J. Howe D.L. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27525-27531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21.Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20810-20817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in the above low activity preparation of aroA(Q)Pg, was added in the growth medium and purification buffers. A significantly more active aroA(Q)Pg (3.4 units/mg) was obtained. The results of the NCBI conserved domain search of aroA(Q)Pg suggested that the DAHPS and CM domains are connected via an apparent linker (amino acids 255–267 are predicted to be the linker region). The two domains were truncated by genetic engineering between Gln-263 and Ser-264 of the linker to keep the individual domains as intact as possible. Both truncated proteins were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity. Effect of Metal Chelators on DAHPS Activity—Two metal chelators, EDTA and DPA, were examined for their effect on the enzymatic activity. For aroA(Q)Pg and aroA(Q)PgDAHPS, it was found that DAHPS activity was effectively eliminated by treatment with DPA or EDTA. However, for aroA(Q)BsDAHPS, DAHPS activity was only effectively eliminated by treatment with DPA (in a concentration-dependent manner) but not by EDTA at concentrations as high as 10 mm (Fig. 1). Kinetic Studies—The kinetic constants for aroA(Q)BsDAHPS DAHPS activity were determined using a continuous assay. A discontinuous assay was utilized for aroA(Q)Pg and aroA(Q)PgDAHPS DAHPS activity. A discontinuous assay was utilized to determine the kinetic constants for the CM activity for all of the enzymes (Table 2). All of the enzymes exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The aroA(Q)BsDAHPS domain showed only DAHPS activity, whereas the aroA(Q)BsCM domain showed only CM activity. The aroA(Q)Pg displayed both DAHPS and CM activity, whereas the aroA(Q)PgDAHPS domain showed only DAHPS activity, and the aroA(Q)PgCM domain showed no DAHPS or CM activity.TABLE 2Kinetic constantsProteinsDAHPSCMKmPEPKmE4PkcatKmchorismatekcatμmμms-1μms-1aroA(Q)Bs aPreviously reported result (13).139.0 ± 11.41760 ± 1104.6 ± 0.1850.5 ± 970.41 ± 0.01aroA(Q)BsDAHPS141.5 ± 9.11400 ± 604.2 ± 0.2NAbNo detectable activity.NAaroA(Q)BsCMNANANA1133.6 ± 66.60.73 ± 0.02aroA(Q)Pg421 ± 431238 ± 1411.6 ± 0.1337 ± 150.45 ± 0.04aroA(Q)PgDAHPS2724 ± 2563638 ± 3750.8 ± 0.1NANAaroA(Q)PgCMNANANANANAa Previously reported result (13.Wu J.

Open table in a new tab pH Dependence of aroA(Q)BsDAHPS—The aroA(Q)BsDAHPS exhibited a pH profile nearly identical to that previously reported for aroA(Q)Bs (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) DAHPS activity, with a pH optima at 9 (Fig. 2). Feedback Inhibition—The effect of possible feedback regulators on the DAHPS activity of aroA(Q)Bs/aroA(Q)BsDAHPS and aroA(Q)Pg/aroA(Q)PgDAHPS are presented in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Both prephenate and chorismate inhibited the DAHPS activity of wild-type enzymes, whereas no compounds tested inhibited the DAHPS activity of the truncated enzymes (Figs. 3A and 4A) at concentrations up to 1 mm. Additional experiments showed that aroA(Q)Bs is more sensitive to prephenate than chorismate, with 50% activity remaining at 100 μm prephenate or at 1 mm chorismate (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that a sigmoid inhibition curve was observed for chorismate inhibition (Fig. 3B). Neither prephenate nor chorismate had an effect on the DAHPS activity of the aroA(Q)BsDAHPS at concentrations as high as 3 mm. The DAHPS activity of aroA(Q)Pg is very sensitive to both prephenate and chorismate with 50% enzymatic activity remaining at 1.5 μm prephenate and at 2.5 μm chorismate, respectively (Fig. 4B). Based on phylogenetic analysis, the DAHPS family has been divided into two main families, one of which was further divided into subfamilies (7.Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9.Jensen R.A. Xie G. Calhoun D.H. Bonner C.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, several biochemical properties (7.Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have been separately proposed as the possible criteria characterizing the individual subfamilies. Nevertheless, as discussed earlier, none of these suggestions have been demonstrated to be convincing. To gain further insights into the potential biochemical property distinguishing the subfamilies, we reinvestigated the unique DAHPS from B. subtilis that exhibits both DAHPS (aroA) and CM (aroQ) activity (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and that exhibits a unique feedback regulation pattern. Another apparent aroA-aroQ fusion protein, the DAHPS from P. gingivalis, was also probed to complement the studies with B. subtilis DAHPS. The aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway may be controlled by feedback inhibition at the first enzyme in the pathway, DAHPS, as well as the first branch point enzyme, CM (22.Haslam E. Shikimic Acid: Metabolism and Metabolites. John Wiley and Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1993Google Scholar). Unlike many other microorganisms, B. subtilis has an unregulated monofunctional CM (aroH in B. subtilis Marburg strain) (23.Gray J.V. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) capable of producing high cellular levels of prephenate. Prephenate, therefore, was likely chosen as the regulator of DAHPS activity to prevent the pathway from producing an unnecessary prephenate flow through the pathway. A simple solution to this problem would have been to fuse a prephenate binding domain onto DAHPS and then modify the binding module to function as a regulatory domain. The aroQ protein, another protein displaying CM activity (the end product of the CM reaction is prephenate), was chosen for this task. The active site of CM would need only modest alteration to be converted into an efficient prephenate binding site. We propose that this unusual aroQ-aroA fusion protein (aroA(Q)Bs) was evolved to acquire the CM domain to function as a feedback regulatory domain instead of creating a true bifunctional enzyme, such as E. coli aroQ-pheA (P-protein) (24.Zhang S. Wilson D.B. Ganem B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 3109-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) or aroQ-tyrA (T-protein) (25.Zhang S. Kongsaeree P. Clardy J. Wilson D.B. Ganem B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which have fused sequential enzymatic steps in the Shikimate pathway for true biosynthetic purposes. This hypothesis is supported by three major observations: (i) an extremely low CM activity, (ii) the kinetics of the feedback inhibition of each inhibitor, and finally (iii) the ability of the truncated catalytic domain to catalyze the condensation reaction in the presence of the inhibitor. The aroQ enzyme domain has been extensively modified to preferentially bind prephenate instead of catalyzing the conversion of chorismate to prephenate; thus, the residual CM activity of the aroA(Q)Bs (0.4 s–1, which is at least 50-fold less active than the CM activity of the E. coli P- and T-protein true bifunctional enzymes) reflects only a remnant of its evolutionary past. In the present experiment, both chorismate and prephenate inhibit aroA(Q)Bs. However, compared with prephenate, chorismate is a much weaker inhibitor, and its inhibition pattern appears to be a sigmoid curve (Fig. 3B). It is highly likely that chorismate exhibits its weak inhibition effect in vitro first via its catalytic conversion to prephenate by the low CM activity of the aroQ domain in the aroA(Q)Bs. The aroA(Q)Bs would most likely be inhibited by only prephenate in vivo, because the intracellular chorismate would be rapidly converted to prephenate by the high CM activity of aroH (in parent Marburg strain) (13.Wu J. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or to other compounds in branch pathways, such as the tryptophan, folic acid, and ubiquinone biosynthesis pathways. The most convincing evidence is the results obtained from our domain truncation studies. The truncated DAHPS domain (aroA(Q)BsDAHPS) displayed properties almost identical to wild-type aroA(QBs), including kinetic parameters (Table 2), pH profile (Fig. 2), and the sensitivity to metal chelators (Fig. 1); however, the aroA(Q)BsDAHPS domain showed no feedback inhibition (Fig. 3), suggesting that the DAHPS domain in the wild-type aroA(Q)Bs functions as a catalytic domain, whereas the N-terminal CM domain functions as a “modular” regulatory domain that bestows its feedback inhibition property on the wild-type enzyme. Our hypothesis is further supported by the DAHPS from P. gingivalis, which, based on sequence analysis, appears to be a fusion protein with a CM (aroQ) domain fused to the C terminus of an aroA domain (Fig. 5) as opposed to the N terminus in aroA(Q)Bs. The two aroA domains from aroA(Q)Pg and aroA(Q)Bs share 32% identity, with the active site residues absolutely conserved, whereas the two aroQ domains share 19% identity, with the active site residues mostly conserved. Our experimental results confirm that aroA(Q)Pg is also a bifunctional enzyme exhibiting both DAHPS and CM activity. Similar to aroA(Q)Bs, aroA(Q)Pg has low CM activity and is inhibited by both prephenate and chorismate. In addition, its truncated catalytic domain, aroA(Q)PgDAHPS, is able to catalyze the condensation reaction, and the activity is not affected by inhibitors. Therefore, similar to the CM domain in aroA(Q)Bs, the CM domain in aroA(Q)Pg also functions as a modular regulatory domain. Results further indicate that there may be significant differences in the domain interaction pattern between these two bifunctional enzymes. Unlike the apparently discrete domain relationship observed in aroA(Q)Bs, a spatially dependent domain relationship in aroA(Q)Pg is suggested from the results that the aroA(Q)PgDAHPS domain exhibits less activity compared with the intact protein and that the aroA(Q)PgCM domain loses all of its CM activity. It is possible that, driven by enhanced inhibition efficiency, the two domains in aroA(Q)Pg have evolved to make more contacts and have buried a larger surface area than the surface area buried in the aroA(Q)Bs protein. Thus, the truncated domains are less stable because of the exposure of those buried interdomain surface areas to the solvent. This possibility of more interaction between the two domains (more domain contacts) is further supported by the observation that, compared with aroA(Q)Bs, aroA(Q)Pg is very sensitive to inhibition by both prephenate and chorismate (Figs. 3 and 4). Crystallographic studies of the two bifunctional enzymes currently underway will provide further information on this issue. This unique feedback regulatory mechanism observed with the aroA and aroQ fusion proteins prompted us to re-examine the results from previous phylogenetic studies (8.Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9.Jensen R.A. Xie G. Calhoun D.H. Bonner C.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that divided the microbial DAHPS family into two subfamilies. ClustalW (17.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) analysis of the amino acid sequence found that AroAIβ DAHPSs, to which aroA(Q)Bs and aroA(Q)Pg were assigned, appear to consist of two types of enzymes (Table 3), one with a shorter sequence defining a single DAHPS domain (type I, ∼270 residues) and one with a longer sequence that contains a single DAHPS domain plus an extra segment with divergent sequences at either the N or C terminus (type II, ∼350 residues). Recently, two type I DAHPSs, one from Aeropyrum pernix 3M. Zhou, personal communication. and one from Pyrococcus furiosus (26.Schofield L.R. Patchett M.L. Parker E.J.

Based on these analyses and the experimental findings from aroA(Q)Bs and aroA(Q)Pg, it is very likely that, in AroAIβ DAHPSs, the type I enzymes are unregulated, whereas the type II enzymes are controlled by a regulatory domain that was fused with the DAHPS catalytic domain during the evolution process (Table 3). This regulatory domain can be a CM domain, as in the case of B. subtilis and P. gingivalis, or some other domain(s) in other type II DAHPSs.TABLE 3Feedback regulation patterns among various DAHPS subfamilies Filled gray box represents the sequences forming the catalytic DAHPS domain; white box in AroAIβ represents the sequences forming the regulatory domain. White box in AroAIα represents the discontinuous insertion sequences forming the regulatory region. The above hypothesis is further supported by the recently solved crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima DAHPS (type II) (27.Shumilin I.A. Bauerle R. Wu J. Woodard R.W. Kretsinger R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The monomer structure consists of two compact domains, an N-terminal ferredoxin-like (FL) domain (residues 1–64) and a catalytical (β/α)8 barrel domain (residues 80–338) connected by a linker region (residues 65–79). Interestingly, the FL domain shares the βαββαβ motif with several amino acid metabolism regulatory domains (28.Vrana K.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 401-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the mechanism of feedback regulation in T. maritima DAHPS is likely mediated by the FL domain. Domain truncation studies with T. maritima DAHPS, in which the truncated DAHPS domain retains similar activity and thermostability as its intact enzyme and is not inhibited by any aromatic amino acid, support the hypothesis that the FL domain is a regulatory domain. 3M. Zhou, personal communication. Exceptions to this proposed domain recruitment for feedback regulation in the DAHPS hypothesis, however, already exist. Recent studies of the crystal structures of the AroAIα DAHPSs derived from E. coli (Phe-sensitive) (29.Shumilin I.A. Zhao C. Bauerle R. Kretsinger R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (30.Hartmann M. Schneider T.R. Pfeil A. Heinrich G. Lipscomb W.N. Braus G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reveal both structures consist of a (β/α)8 barrel, seen for all DAHPS structures solved to date. However, several extensions/insertions are also present and have been reported to function as regulatory elements. Of particular interest is a two-stranded β-sheet (β6a/β6b) insertion that participates in inhibitor binding. Multiple sequence alignment showed that this β6a/β6b insertion, which seems to exist in all of the AroAIα DAHPSs, is “missing” in AroAIβ, including both type I and type II enzymes. It is interesting to note that this insertion, as well as either an N- or C-terminal fusion protein, is also missing in the structurally and functionally related catalytically unregulated KDOPS. Members of the KDOPS family, which are normally shorter in sequence (∼280 residues) than the regulated DAHPSs, have been assigned to the AroAIβ branch of the phylogenetic tree (9.Jensen R.A. Xie G. Calhoun D.H. Bonner C.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our findings and re-analysis of previous phylogenetic studies provide definitive new clues into what property or properties may distinguish the two subfamilies of these enzymes. It is very likely that the AroAIα and AroAIβ families differ mainly, not only in regulation versus nonregulation, but also in how they are regulated and not the previously proposed properties, such as metal requirement, the nature of the feedback inhibitors, and/or substrate specificity (7.Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DAHPSs and KDOPSs probably evolved from a common progenitor, an unregulated primitive DAHPS. It is hypothesized that, during evolution, some AroAIβ enzymes (type I) remained unregulated, whereas the others (type II) acquired an extra domain for feedback regulation. KDOPSs have remained unregulated. The AroAIα enzymes, however, evolved in a more complex manner to acquire insertions/extensions in the (β/α)8 barrel to function as regulatory elements (Table 3) to provide more efficient regulation, which is reflected by the general trend that the inhibition constants of AroAIα enzymes are lower than those of the regulated type II AroAIβ enzymes (data not shown). In summary, the DAHPSs from B. subtilis and P. gingivalis acquired the CM domain to function as a feedback regulatory domain for the regulation of the Shikimate pathway. Sequence structure analyses suggest that the feedback regulation pattern is the evolutionary link between the two subfamilies of DAHPSs. The regulation pattern and evolutionary model of DAHPSs presented here may serve as a model for the evolution of other feedback-regulated enzymes involved in other types of amino acid metabolism.

MAP and Mycobacterium avium subspecies avium, a closely related opportunistic environmental bacterium, share 95% of their genes and exhibit homologies of more than 99% between these genes. The identification of molecules specific for MAP is essential for understanding its pathogenicity and for development of useful diagnostic tools. The application of gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance led to the structural identification of a major cell wall lipopeptide of MAP, termed Para-LP-01, defined as C20 fatty acyl-d-Phe-N-Me-l-Val-l-Ile-l-Phe-l-Ala methyl ester. Variations of this lipopeptide with different fatty acyl moieties (C16 fatty acyl through C17, C18, C19, C21 to C22) were also identified. Besides the specificity of this lipopeptide for MAP, the presence of an N-Me-l-valine represents the first reported N-methylated amino acid within an immunogenic lipopeptide of mycobacteria.

They share 95% of their genes and exhibit homologies of more than 99% between these genes (1Li L. Bannantine J.P. Zhang Q. Amonsin A. May B.J. Alt D. Banerji N. Kanjilal S. Kapur V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12344-12349Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). MAP can be distinguished from MAA by the presence of IS900; however, there is a very similar repetitive element (IS901) in MAA. MAP also differs from MAA by its growth characteristics: 1) MAP grows more slowly, with a generation time of 22-26 h compared with 10-12 h for MAA, and 2) MAP requires the siderophore Mycobactin J for growth (MAA can synthesize this siderophore) (2Chacon O.

Dufour A. Cotruvo J. Pathogenic Mycobacteria in Water: A Guide to Public Health Consequences, Monitoring, and Management. IWA Publishing, London2004: 39-54Google Scholar). MAP also lacks the antigenic glycopeptidolipids that serve as the basis for serotyping the M. avium complex, although rough colony variants of MAA are also devoid of these molecules. However, none of these differences helps to explain why MAP occupies a specific biological niche distinct from MAA. MAP is the causative agent of Johne disease in cattle and other ruminants and is proposed to be at least one of the causes of Crohn disease in humans (2Chacon O. Bermudez L.E. Barletta R.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 329-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both diseases are presented as a chronic inflammation of the bowel. MAA is an environmental bacterium found in soil and water that causes opportunistic infections in humans, including lymphadenitis in children, “hot tub lung” in the general population, and systemic infection in immunocompromised individuals (4Primm T.P. Lucero C.A. Falkinham III, J.O. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 17: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). MAP-specific traits have recently been defined by sequencing the genomes of strains of each subspecies (1Li L. Bannantine J.P. Zhang Q. Amonsin A. May B.J. Alt D. Banerji N. Kanjilal S. Kapur V.

Methods. 2005; (Epub. 8/2/2005)PubMed Google Scholar), but more investigations are necessary especially in the fields of proteomics, lipidomics, glycomics, and gene regulation. Lipidomics is a promising area of study because members of the family Mycobacteriaceae contain large numbers of complex lipids in their cell wall, and we recently identified several cell envelope and culture filtrate lipids present in MAP strain K-10 but absent from MAA strain 2151. 3T.

Here we report the chemical structure and seroreactivity of Para-LP-01, a major cell wall-associated MAP-specific lipopeptide. Chemical Reagents—All chemical reagents were of the highest grade from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Bacterial Growth—MAP strain K-10 is a bovine isolate from Nebraska that was provided by V. Kapur (University of Minnesota). MAA strain 2151 is a human sputum isolate (7Belisle J.T. McNeil M.R. Chatterjee D. Inamine J.M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10510-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were grown on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates supplemented with 10% OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase); for MAP, Mycobactin J (2 μg/ml) (Allied Monitor, Fayette, MO) was also added. After 4 weeks (MAA) or 12 weeks (MAP) of growth at 37 °C, cells were harvested by scraping colonies off the plates into phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and centrifuging at 3,500 rpm for 30 min. Cell pellets were then lyophilized. Extraction of Total Lipids and Isolation of Lipopeptide Para-LP-01—Total lipids were extracted from lyophilized cells with chloroform/methanol (2:1) (30 ml/g dried cells) at 55 °C for 3 h. The extracts were dried under nitrogen and Folch-washed with 6 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 1 ml of water. The organic layer was transferred to a new tube and dried. For visualization, total lipids were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and then separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) on aluminum-backed silica 60 F254 gel plates (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) using chloroform/methanol (96:4) in the first dimension and toluene/acetone (80: 20) in the second dimension. Plates were sprayed with 10% copper sulfate in 8% phosphoric acid and the lipids visualized by heating. Total lipids and lipid Para-LP-01 were further analyzed by differential spraying of the plates to detect carbohydrates (using α-naphthol), free amino groups (using ninhydrin), and phosphates (using ceric ammonium molybdate) after heating. The lipopeptide Para-LP-01 was purified by preparative TLC. It was first scraped from plates run in chloroform/methanol 96:4, and then the lipopeptide was subjected to a second preparative TLC purification using the solvent system of toluene/acetone 80:20. For extraction from the silica, chloroform/methanol (2:1) was used in an incubation at 4 °C overnight. Extracts were dried under nitrogen and purified by Folch wash, and the organic layer was transferred to a new tube. The dried organic layer was suspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Detection of Amino Acids—The EZ:faast amino acid analysis kit (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA) was used to identify amino acids following the hydrolysis of 100 μg of lipid Para-LP-01 with 6 N HCl overnight at 110 °C. Derivatized amino acids were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Specifically, the analyte was applied to a DB-5 column (10 m × 0.18-mm internal diameter, 0.18-μm film thickness) (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) on a ThermoQuest Trace gas chromatograph 2000 (ThermoQuest, Austin, TX) connected to a GCQ/Polaris MS mass detector (ThermoQuest) at an initial temperature of 60 °C for 1 min, increasing to 130 °C at 30 °C/min, and finally to 280 °C at 5 °C/min. Analysis of Fatty Acids—Lipid Para-LP-01 was first hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl overnight at 110 °C followed by 3 N HCl in methanol at 85 °C for 16 h. The sample was treated with TRI-SIL reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) for 20 min at 70 °C. Analysis of the trimethylsilylated compounds was performed by GC/MS using the same column and temperature program described for amino acids. d and l Determination of Amino Acids—To determine the enantiomeric form of amino acids an (R)-(-)-2-butanol and an (S)-(+)-2-butanol derivatization was performed as described by Huasek and Macek (8Huasek P. Macek K. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 113: 139-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The O-butyl, N-heptafluorobutyryl amino acid butyl derivatives were analyzed by GC/MS as described above. Partial Hydrolysis of Lipopeptide Para-LP-01—Hydrolysis of the lipid was performed with 6 N HCl at 110 °C for 15, 40, 90, and 180 min. Permethylation of Lipid Para-LP-01—The deuteromethylated derivative of lipopeptide Para-LP-01 was generated by permethylation as described by Ciucanu and Kerek (9Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). Derivatives were analyzed by liquid chromatography/MS-ES/MS. FAB-MS—Cesium-ion fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was performed on a Fisson Instruments VG Auto Spec in the Central Instrument Facility, Dept. of Chemistry, Colorado State University. MALDI-TOF—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) was performed in the Macromolecular Resources facility, Colorado State University, with an Ultraflex MALDI/TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) with 2,5 dihydrobenzoic acid and NaI as a matrix. ES/MS—Electrospray/mass spectrometry (LC/MS-ES/MS) was performed with an LCQ electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Lipid Para-LP-01 and its deuteropermethylated derivative were suspended in methanol, 0.1% trifluoric acid at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Ionization was achieved with spray voltages of 3 and 4.5 kV for the deuteromethylated and native lipid, respectively. Fragmentation of the major positive ions was performed using 30-60% normalized collision energy. NMR Spectroscopy—One-dimensional 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 1H-1H shift-correlated spectroscopy (COSY) NMR were performed on a Varian Inova 400 MHz, and two-dimensional 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHZ NMR spectrometer using the supplied Varian pulse sequences. NMR spectroscopies were performed in the Central Instrument Facility, Dept. of Chemistry, Colorado State University. ELISA—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed at room temperature in a 96-well microtiter plate with bovine sera (generous gift from Mycos, Fort Collins, CO) tested by IDEXX HerdChek® (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis test kit for Johne disease) (IDEXX, Westbrook, ME) at the Diagnostic Laboratory, James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Colorado State University. Strong IDEXX-positive (IDEXX values 1.33-2.60) and IDEXX-negative (IDEXX values 0-0.1) sera were used to make serial 2-fold dilutions from 1:1 to 1:512. All sera and antibody dilutions were made with 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Lipid Para-LP-01 was suspended in hexane, sonicated for 3 min, and 100 μg was loaded into each well and air dried. Blocking was performed with 200 μl of blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 1 h. After removing the blocking solution, serial dilutions of the bovine sera (200 μl) were added to duplicate wells and incubated for 2 h. Wells were washed five times with 200 μl of blocking buffer, and then 100 μl of the secondary antibody (sheep anti-bovine IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX)) diluted 1:2000 was added and incubated for 2 h. Finally, the wells were washed five times with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) before 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine was added. After 5 min the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 2 N sulfuric acid and the A450 was determined with a plate reader model 680 (Bio-Rad). A lipid designated Para-LP-01 was recently identified in a lipidomic analysis of MAP strain K-10 in comparison to MAA strain 2151. 3T. M. Eckstein, S. L. Duskin, S. N. Manzer, B. D. Acres, S. Chandrasekaran, A. M. Snyder, D. Chatterjee, J. T. Belisle, and J. M. Inamine, manuscript in preparation. It was selected for further characterization because it is a major cell wall-associated lipid, was well isolated when the total lipids were separated by two-dimensional TLC using an apolar solvent system, and was present only in MAP (Fig. 1). Initial analysis by two-dimensional TLC followed by differential spraying suggested that Para-LP-01 lacked carbohydrates, free amino groups, and phosphate groups. Chemical Characterization of Lipid Para-LP-01 by Its Amino Acid and Fatty Acid Composition—GC analysis of the trimethylsilylated derivatives of the fatty acids of purified Para-LP-01 showed three components with retention times of 14.57, 17.83, and 20.92 min, with the major component at 17.83 min. These retention times corresponded with standards of trimethylsilylation derivatives of C18-, C20-, and C22-saturated fatty acids, respectively. In addition, GC/MS analysis of the three components resulted in m/z of 298.3, 326.2, and 354.3, respectively, matching the known masses of the standards. GC/MS analysis of the derivatized amino acids using the EZ:faast protocol yielded three major components with retention times of 4.75, 5.47, and 7.97 min, corresponding to standards for alanine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine, respectively. A minor component with a retention time of 4.78 min that correlated with a valine standard was also identified. The enantiomeric forms of the amino acids were determined by analyzing the O-butyl, N-heptafluorobutyryl amino acid butyl derivatives. GC analysis demonstrated that the amino acids alanine, valine, and isoleucine were present only in the l configuration, whereas phenylalanine was detected in both the l and d configurations. Thus, these analyses indicated that lipid Para-LP-01 is comprised of a saturated C20 fatty acid (as the major fatty acid moiety) linked to a peptide, possibly a pentapeptide, containing d- and l-phenylalanine, l-alanine, l-valine, and l-isoleucine. These findings were consistent with the initial two-dimensional TLC analysis that identified Para-LP-01 as a nonpolar lipid. Structural Analysis of Lipopeptide Para-LP-01 by FAB-MS and MALDI-TOF Analyses—Positive ion FAB-MS analysis of lipopeptide Para-LP-01 resulted in several ions ranging from m/z 500 to 1100 (Fig. 2). The major ion of the molecule was m/z 918.6, and ions found at m/z 815.6, 668.5, and 555.4 were identified as putative fragmentation ions. Associated with each of these ions were minor ions differing by ± 28 atomic mass units representing the different fatty acid chain lengths. The differences between the major and fragmentation ions were 103 (918.6-815.6), 147.1 (815.6-668.5), and 113.1 atomic mass units (668.5-555.4). These differences corresponded to the masses of alanine (methyl ester), phenylalanine, and isoleucine, respectively. In addition, minor ions were obtained ± 14 atomic mass units and -42 and -60 atomic mass units apart from the major ion of m/z 918.6, suggesting that seven different fatty acyl chains were linked to a pentapeptide core (Fig. 2B). The finding of seven different fatty acyl chains was supported by MALDI-TOF analysis (Fig. 3). This analysis showed seven peaks that differed by 14 atomic mass units in their masses for native Para-LP-01, and all seven peaks shifted by + 71 atomic mass units in the deuteromethylated lipid. This indicated that the peptide core for the seven molecules was the same but that these molecules differed in their fatty acyl chains. Thus, the presence of seven different saturated fatty acyl chains linked to the peptide core could be demonstrated: hexadecanoic acid (C16:0), heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), octadecanoic acid (C18:0), nonadecanoic acid (C19:0), eicosanoic acid (C20:0), heneicosanoic acid (C21: 0), and docosanoic acid (C22:0). The above analyses indicated that Para-LP-01 is actually a lipopeptide complex or family in which a pentapeptide core is attached to a series of saturated fatty acids dominated by C20. From component analysis, the calculated mass (890.6) differed from the major ion identified by FAB-MS (918.6) by 28 atomic mass units. The nature of this difference was examined by NMR. Structural Features of the Lipopeptide by NMR Analyses—1H NMR analysis (Fig. 4) revealed 10 protons derived from aromatic rings. It also showed that there were, as predicted, five α-C protons within this structure corresponding to the five amino acids. The exact assignment and coupling of the other protons to these α-C protons was defined through their connectivity within the two-dimensional COSY 1H-NMR (Table 1). The following assignments were made: α-C protons for two phenylalanines at δ 5.13 and δ 4.63 ppm, one alanine at δ 4.35 ppm, one valine at δ 4.13 ppm, and one isoleucine at δ 4.41 ppm. A large peak at δ 1.25 ppm represented protons within the fatty acyl chain.TABLE 1Coupling of lipid Para-LP-01 protons by two-dimensional COSY 1H NMR and the chemical shifts for the 13C within the amino acids and the fatty acyl chainCompound and groupppm δ 1HCoupled toppm δ 13CPhenylalanine 17.18aThe multiplet centered at δ 7.18 ppm can be assigned by its chemical shift to the aromatic ring protons of Phe.αCH5.13βCH-H’, βCH-H’52βCH-H’3.03αCH, βCH-H’39βCH-H’2.9αCH, βCH-H’38.5Phenylalanine 27.18aThe multiplet centered at δ 7.18 ppm can be assigned by its chemical shift to the aromatic ring protons of Phe.αCH4.63βCH-H’, βCH-H’55βCH-H’3.13αCH, βCH-H’38.5βCH-H’2.9αCH, βCH-H’38.5N-Me-valineαCH4.13βCH58βCH1.71αCH, CH3, CH338CH30.75βCH11.5CH30.78βCH16N-CH33.0231.5AlanineαCH4.35CH349CH31.37αCH17.5O-CH33.6853IsoleucineαCH4.41βCH64βCH2.12αCH, βCH3, γCH236.5βCH30.75βCH20γCH21.3βCH, γCH323.5γCH30.45γCH219Fatty acylβCH22.08γCH2, CH2 (remaining)27.5γCH21.49βCH2, CH2 (remaining)27CH2 (remaining)1.2-1.3CH330-34CH30.9CH2 (remaining)14.5a The multiplet centered at δ 7.18 ppm can be assigned by its chemical shift to the aromatic ring protons of Phe. Open table in a new tab Furthermore, eight methyl groups were identified in the 1H-13C NMR (Fig. 5). Six of them exhibit signals with chemical shifts up to 1.5 ppm. Of these, two were associated with isoleucine, two with valine, one with alanine, and one with the fatty acyl chain. However, two signals with chemical shifts of 3.05 and 3.71 ppm suggested methyl groups linked to nitrogen and oxygen, respectively. Thus, 1H NMR and 1H-13C NMR demonstrated the presence of two phenylalanines, one alanine, one isoleucine, and one valine and also provided strong evidence for a saturated fatty acid. In addition, the calculated difference in the mass of the lipopeptide of 28 atomic mass units could be accounted for by N- and O-linked methyl groups. The location of these methyl groups was examined by MALDI-TOF. Further Structural Analysis by MALDI-TOF—MALDI-TOF analysis of the native lipopeptide and its deuteromethylated derivative showed that the main ion of m/z 940.6 [M + Na]+ shifted to an m/z 1011.8 [M + Na]+ for the deuteromethylated lipid (+ 71 atomic mass units) (Fig. 3), indicating that four deuteromethyl groups were incorporated into the lipopeptide (+ 68 atomic mass units). Furthermore, it showed the replacement of one methyl group by a deuteromethyl group (+ 3 atomic mass units), which had to come from an ester, consistent with a methyl ester at the carboxyl group. Because five amide bonds were expected according to the data reported above, the MALDI-TOF data showed that one amide bond was naturally N-methylated. Final Structural Determination of Lipopeptide Para-LP-01 By ES/MS—To identify the structure of Para-LP-01 and the location of the N-methylation, ES/MS was performed. Characteristic ions of m/z 940.6 and 1011.8 were obtained for the native and the deuteromethylated lipids, respectively (data not shown). Further MS/MS analyses of these ions demonstrated the incorporation of deuteromethyl groups into the lipopeptide (Fig. 6, A and B). Note that typically in peptides, “a” ions are less abundant than “b” ions when analyzed by collision-induced MS. However, here and in our previous analyses of lipopeptides (7Belisle J.T. McNeil M.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10510-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the reverse has been observed, i.e. that “a” ions are more abundant than “b” ions. Thus the data in panels A and B showed that the positions of the two phenylalanines and the single alanine within Para-LP-01 could be determined. However, a mass difference of m/z 113 was detected twice. This suggested that one m/z 113 was isoleucine and the other was an N-methylated valine. Panels C and D of Fig. 6 show the MS/MS/MS analyses of the major ions representing the tetrapeptide of the C terminus. The newly generated ions demonstrated clearly that the peptide sequence is comprised of N-Me-valine-isoleucine-phenylalanine-alanine methyl ester. The presence of N-methylated valine also explained why GC/MS analysis of the derivatized amino acids indicated that valine was a minor component: the free valine had to be generated by further hydrolysis of N-Me-Val. Thus the final structure of the lipopeptide consists of pentapeptide Phe-N-Me-l-Val-l-Ile-Phe-l-Ala methyl ester N-linked to a C20 fatty acid that was identified as the major fatty acid. In Silico Analysis to Determine the Location of the Enantiomeric Forms of Phenylalanine—As noted above, amino acid analysis revealed the presence of both the d and l isomers of phenylalanine. Several attempts at partial hydrolysis failed to generate truncated lipopeptides that could be used to define the location of the d- and l-phenylalanine in the pentapeptide. However, in silico analyses of the MAP genome revealed two single genes and three gene clusters encoding putative peptide synthetases. The one most likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of the lipopeptide Para-LP-01, MAP1420, consists of five modules, one for each of the five amino acids (Fig. 7). The first module contains the motif for the incorporation of an epimerized amino acid as the first amino acid. The second module contains the motif for N-methylation of a non-epimerized amino acid, and the final three modules would also direct the incorporation of l amino acids. In addition, the first module exhibits a high degree of homology (63% identity; 75% similarity) to the first module of the pstA gene product in MAA that is responsible for the incorporation of a d-phenylalanine into the lipopeptide core of the highly immunogenic glycopeptidolipids (10Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2018-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the final structure of Para-LP-01 was determined to be C20:0 fatty acyl d-Phe-N-Me-l-Val-l-Ile-l-Phe-l-Ala methyl ester. Seroreactivity of Lipopeptide Para-LP-01 Using Bovine Sera—ELISAs with the lipopeptide Para-LP-01 were performed with bovine sera previously screened using the IDEXX HerdChek® Mycobacterium paratuberculosis test kit for Johne disease. IDEXX-negative sera at a titer of 1:4 showed no detectable O.D. for the lipopeptide. ELISAs performed with IDEXX-positive sera resulted in high O.D. readings for the lipopeptide Para-LP-01. There was a significant difference between the O.D. numbers for the lipopeptide with IDEXX-positive sera versus those obtained with IDEXX-negative sera. Two exceptions were found: 1) no positive O.D. reading was obtained repeatedly for the IDEXX-positive serum 9687, and 2) low O.D. was measured for the IDEXX-negative serum 2727, which was still significantly lower than those obtained for IDEXX-positive sera (Fig. 8). A major nonpolar lipid, termed Para-LP-01, was identified by comparative lipidomics to be present only in MAP, but not in MAA, 3T. M. Eckstein, S. L. Duskin, S. N. Manzer, B. D. Acres, S. Chandrasekaran, A. M. Snyder, D. Chatterjee, J. T. Belisle, and J. M. Inamine, manuscript in preparation. and it was purified and subjected to structural analyses. The fatty acids associated with this lipid were saturated and ranged from C16 to C22. This was a surprise because the lipopeptides and glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) that together represent 3-4% of the total cell weight of MAA are comprised of a tetrapeptide that is N-linked to mono- or even diunsaturated 3-OH fatty acids ranging from C32 to C36 (7Belisle J.T. McNeil M.R. Chatterjee D. Inamine J.M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10510-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we expected the MAP lipids to be similar. Para-LP-01 is a major lipid in the cell wall and is likely a major component of the outer part of the cell envelope, just as the GPLs of MAA are surface exposed (10Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2018-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Structurally, the GPLs consist of a lipopeptide core comprised of a tetrapeptide (three amino acids, one amino alcohol) that is N-linked to mono- or diunsaturated long chain fatty acids. O-linked to this core molecule are mono- and oligosaccharides, which can be further modified (e.g. by methylation or acylation). These sugar moieties form the basis for the 28 different serovars of the M. avium complex (10Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2018-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although MAP is technically a member of the M. avium complex, it lacks GPLs and is missing some of the genes responsible for their biosynthesis. In comparison, Para-LP-01 consists of a peptide core with five amino acids that are distinct from those found in the GPL core. Furthermore, an additional modification of an amino acid (N-methylation) was identified within the Para-LP-01 that is not found in the GPLs. Finding an N-methylated valine in the lipopeptide structure of Para-LP-01 was unexpected. To our knowledge, there are only two reports of N-methylated amino acids within a lipopeptide in mycobacteria: 1) a “unique phenylalanine-containing lipopeptide” of a rough colony variant of MAA (N-Me-Ile) (11Riviere M. Puzo G. Wright E.L. Barrow W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and 2) fortuitine, an acyl nonapeptide methyl ester of M. fortuitum (N-Me-Leu) is present twice (12Barber M. Jolles P. Vilkas E. Lederer E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 18: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This type of modification is not unknown in other prokaryotic nonribosomal peptide syntheses. The best example is cyclosporine with seven N-methylated amino acids within the undecapeptide. This high degree of N-methylation protects the molecule from proteolytic digestion (13Thern B. Rudolph J. Jung G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 2307-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Vitoux B. Aubry A. Cong M.T. Marrand M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 27: 617-632Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Other nonribosomal peptides with N-methylated amino acids are enniatin (15Billich A. Zocher R. Kleinkauf H. Braun D.G. Lavanchy D.

Naudin L. Crouzet J. Blanc V. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (N-Me-Phe, further modified to 4-dimethylparaamino-N-Me-Phe). Better protection from proteolytic cleavage has also been proposed for peptides containing d amino acids (19Sieber S.A. Mahariel M. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 715-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Almost every nonribosomally synthesized peptide is comprised in part of d-configured amino acids (19Sieber S.A. Mahariel M. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 715-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 20Mahariel M. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 21von Döhren H. Keller U. Vater J. Zocher R. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2675-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The specific location of these amino acids within the peptide is also essential for further modifications such as cyclization and release from the synthesizing enzymes (19Sieber S.A. Mahariel M. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 715-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In addition, in silico analysis revealed an open reading frame (MAP1420) representing a putative peptide synthetase comprised of five modules for the incorporation of amino acids into a peptide and is the most likely gene behind the biosynthesis of the lipopeptide Para-LP-01. Several other putative peptide synthetases were found in the genome of MAP but contained fewer modules (MAP1242 (3 modules), MAP1871c/1870c (2 modules), MAP3740/3741/3742 (2 modules), MAP2178 to MAP2171c (2 complete and 2 incomplete modules)), had additional modification motifs (e.g. reduction, oxidation, cyclization), or did not exhibit epimerization motifs reflecting the presence of d amino acids. Many lipid components of the cell envelope of mycobacteria demonstrate seroreactivity. The best examples are the highly immunogenic GPLs of the M. avium complex (11Riviere M. Puzo G. Wright E.L. Barrow W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 22Barrow W.W. Brennan P.J. Infect Immun. 1982; 36: 678-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee B.Y.

Biochem. 1996; 241: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Indeed, most of the antigenic lipids of Mycobacterium subspecies contain sugar moieties. Molecules such as 2,3 diacyl trehalose, phenolic glycolipids, lipooligosaccharides, sulfolipids, and trehalose dimycolate were successfully used to demonstrate high seroreactivity for patients with active tuberculosis (24Dalaine G. Lagrange P.H. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1995; 76: 234-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Maekura R. Okuda Y. Nakagawa M. Hiraga T. Yokota S. Ito M. Yano I. Kohno H. Wada M.

Acta Leprol. 2003; 12: 112-116PubMed Google Scholar). Although many studies have demonstrated the seroreactivities of different lipid molecules, none has identified a lipopeptide as the target molecule. Thus, the findings in our studies would make this MAP-specific molecule the first described mycobacterial lipopeptide exhibiting biological activity through its seroreactivity with sera from cattle with Johne disease. Recently, Moody et al. (28Moody D.B. Young D.C. Cheng T.-Y. Rosat J.-P. Roura-mir C. O'Connor P.B. Zajonc D.M. Walz A. Miller M.J. Levery S.B. Wilson I.A. Costello C.E. Brenner M.B. Science. 2004; 303: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) described T-cell activation through CD1a presentation of a lipopeptide that most likely functions as an intermediate in mycobactin biosynthesis. The most potent T-cell response was achieved with the monounsaturated C20:1 fatty acid, whereas molecules with shorter or saturated fatty acids were substantially less stimulatory. Based on similarity within the structures of lipopeptides in general and of Para-LP-01 in particular, it would be interesting to analyze the importance of the structural findings of this lipopeptide for T-cell activation through CD1 in humans with Crohn disease and in cattle with Johne disease."

Integrins and E-cadherin are the key components involved in these processes in epithelial cells. We recently showed that integrin-dependent adhesion to the extracellular matrix reinforces the formation of E-cadherin-actin complexes inducing the polarization of Caco-2 enterocytes and increases the expression of a marker of enterocyte differentiation, the apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) gene. By impairing or enhancing E-cadherin-dependent cell adhesion, we demonstrate in the present study its involvement in the transcriptional activation of the apoA-IV gene in Caco-2 cells. This control requires the regulatory sequence that we have previously identified as necessary and sufficient to drive and restrict apoA-IV gene expression in enterocytes in vivo. Furthermore, using chimeric E-cadherin-Fc homophilic ligand-coated surfaces, we show that a direct activation of E-cadherin triggers the transcriptional activation of the apoA-IV promoter. Finally, E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion controls the nuclear abundance of the transcription factor hepatic nuclear factor 4α, which is involved in the enterocyte-specific expression of apoA-IV gene. Altogether, our results suggest that E-cadherin controls enterocyte-specific expression of genes, such as the apoA-IV gene, through the control of hepatic nuclear factor 4α nuclear abundance.

The functional maintenance of the intestinal epithelium displays specific features: a rapid and permanent renewal from stem cells located at a fixed position within the crypt, the migration of cells “en cohorte” along the crypt to villus axis, and a cell shedding at the apex of the villi (6Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These features make specially important the contribution of cell adhesion systems to the control of intestinal epithelium differentiation, considering that cell adhesion to ECM varies during cell migration along with the gradual loss of stem cell properties and the acquisition of differentiated features (7Booth C. Potten C.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ECM components are known to control cell proliferation and differentiation in many tissues through interactions with integrins (8Boudreau N. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin.

They are cooperatively produced by mesenchymal and epithelial cells and are differentially distributed along the crypt-to-villus axis in both the developing and the adult intestine (10Lussier C.

The pattern of expression of E-cadherin, one of the major cell-cell adhesion molecules in the intestinal epithelium, also varies along the crypt-to-villus axis, with a lesser abundance in undifferentiated cells in the crypt (15Escaffit F.

Cadherins mediate cell-cell adhesion through Ca2+-dependent homophilic interaction of their extracellular domain and anchoring of their cytoplasmic domain to the actin cytoskeleton by catenins (16Yap A.S.

These results suggested that the activation of E-cadherin might contribute to the control of apoA-IV gene expression. The purpose of our present study was to investigate, by means of impairment and activation experiments, the involvement of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in the control of apoA-IV gene transcription in intestinal cells and the potential role of HNF-4α in this regulation. Constructs and Cell Transfection—The eC3A4-GFP cells were obtained as follows. A plasmid (eC3-A4-GFP) expressing the green fluorescent protein (E-GFP) under the control of the eC3-A4 regulatory sequences, which restrict the expression of the apoA-IV gene to villus enterocytes (24Le Beyec J.

Caco-2 cells (28Pinto M. Robine-Leon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assmann P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol.

Individual clones were isolated after 3 weeks in G418 (Invitrogen) (400 μg/ml) and further subcloned by the limit dilution method. Flow cytometry experiments showed that the GFP fluorescence signals obtained in mock-transfected and nontransfected Caco-2 cells were perfectly superimposed. After confluence, GFP was induced to similar levels in all clones obtained. The eC3A4-GFP3-1 clone was used for further studies and was subsequently designated as eC3A4-GFP cells. The eC3A4-Luc cells have been previously described (26Carriere V. Vidal R. Lazou K. Lacasa M. Delers F. Ribeiro A. Rousset M. Chambaz J. Lacorte J.M. J. Biol.

Preparation and Coating of the Extracellular Matrix—The native ECM was prepared as described previously (29Le Beyec J. Delers F. Jourdant F. Schreider C. Chambaz J. Cardot P. Pincon-Raymond M. Exp.

Cell Culture and Perturbation Experiments—Caco-2, eC3A4-GFP, and eC3A4-Luc cells were cultured at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing or not containing calcium supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (AbCys). Cells were plated out at high density (100,000 cells/cm2) or low density (12,000 cells/cm2). The medium was changed every day. For integrin perturbation experiments, the eC3A4-GFP cell suspension was incubated with a monoclonal anti-β1 integrin blocking antibody (6S6; Chemicon) (5 μg/ml) or a monoclonal anti-β1 integrin activating antibody (B3B11; Chemicon) (10 μg/ml) during 20 min at room temperature before being seeded in the presence of the antibodies at high density in culture plates that had or had not been coated with ECM. Purified mouse IgG (Chemicon) was used as a control. Cells were analyzed after 48 h for GFP fluorescence by confocal microscopy. For E-cadherin perturbation experiments, Caco-2 cells or eC3A4-Luc cells were seeded at high density. For the calcium switch experiments, at the time indicated under “Results,” cells were treated for 10 min with a solution of PBS containing 2 mm EGTA and 2.5 mm glucose and then placed for 48 h in a serum-free medium containing (+/+) or not containing (+/-) calcium. In some experiments, a blocking anti-E-cadherin antibody (SHE78-7; Takara), or nonspecific IgG (Chemicon), was added at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The cells were changed after 24 h of treatment with fresh serum-free medium containing or not containing calcium and containing or not containing SHE78-7 or nonspecific IgG. For fully differentiated cells, low density Caco-2 cells were cultured for 16 days with normal calcium concentration. At day 16, cells were treated for 10 min with 2 mm EGTA, as described above, and then cultured for 48 h with fresh serum-free medium containing (+/+) or not containing (+/-) calcium, to disrupt or not disrupt calcium-dependent cell-cell junctions. To grow cells in suspension, 850,000 eC3A4-Luc cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of medium described above, in 15-ml polypropylene tubes (Techno Plastic Products AG). For E-cadherin activation experiments, culture plates were precoated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-Fc antibody (0.5 μg/cm2 in PBS/Ca2+) (Jackson Immunoresearch) and then coated with a recombinant human E-cadherin-Fc chimera (R&D Systems) (10 μg/cm2 in PBS/Ca2+) for 2 h at room temperature followed by PBS/Ca2+ wash and blocked with PBS/Ca 2+ containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin. Plates coated with anti-Fc antibodies only were used for controls. Then eC3A4-Luc cells were seeded at low density in these coated plates and cultured for 48 h. For the actin cytoskeleton perturbation experiments, Caco-2 cells were seeded at low density, and at the time indicated in the results, the cells were treated with 0.5 or 2 μm of Latrunculin B for 48 h in serum-free medium. Reporter Gene Expression Analysis—GFP expression was analyzed by flow cytometry or by confocal microscopy. For flow cytometry analysis, eC3A4-GFP cells were carefully trypsinized to obtain a single cell suspension. This suspension was rinsed in PBS and fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cells were then centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g, and the pellets were resuspended in PBS and kept at 4 °C until analysis. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a Coulter Altra cell sorter (Beckman-Coulter) equipped with an argon laser. The excitation wavelength was set at 488 nm, and the GFP emission was recovered at 510 nm. For each sample, 10,000 cells were analyzed. The results are expressed as the mean fluorescence values ± S.D. for triplicate cultures. For confocal analysis, eC3A4-GFP cells were grown on LabTek chambered borosilicate cover glass (Nunc). GFP fluorescence was quantified using software from a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. For luciferase analysis, eC3A4-Luc cells were washed twice with PBS and kept at -80 °C until extraction. The cells were thawed in the presence of the luciferase extraction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), scraped, and transferred into Eppendorf tubes and frozen and thawed twice. The cellular debris were eliminated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for luciferase activity measurement (34Rodolosse A. Carriere V. Rousset M. Lacasa M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein contents determination was made with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Immunofluorescence Studies—Cells, grown on LabTek chambered borosilicate cover glass (Nunc), were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific antigens were blocked by incubating in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. E-cadherin/actin was double-labeled by incubation with an anti-E-cadherin antibody (HECD-1 (1:200) or ECCD-2 (1:250); Zymed Laboratories) for 90 min, revealed by Cy2-labeled secondary antibody (Sigma) and by incubation with Alexa 545-labeled phalloidin (1:500) (Molecular Probes). HNF-4α was labeled by incubation with a polyclonal anti HNF-4α antibody (1:1000) (a gift from Dr. M. Pontoglio, CNRS Paris), revealed by Cy2-labeled secondary antibody (Sigma). The results were recorded with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert 100M oil immersion objective (plan Achromat 63 × 1.40 numerical aperture). The contrast and brightness settings were kept constant during the course of image acquisition. Cells grown in suspension were washed in ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and then centrifuged through Tek OCT (Shandon), and 8-μm cryosections were cut. Immunofluorescence proceedings were made as described above for attached cells. The results were recorded with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with oil immersion objectives (×100 Pan-Neofluar lenses) and analyzed with Axiovision software (release 4.3; Carl Zeiss). Immunobloting Analysis—Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously reported (35Feuillard J. Gouy H. Bismuth G. Lee L.M. Debre P. Korner M. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 257-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the presence in all buffers of protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples (10 μg of nuclear proteins) were boiled for 5 min in SDS-reducing sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in reducing conditions in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and probed successively with polyclonal anti HNF-4α (1:5,000) and with anti-SP1 (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). A peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody (1:10,000; Biodesign) and then analyzed with ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Red Ponceau staining was used to ensure that equal amounts of proteins were loaded. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (25Sauvaget D. Chauffeton V. Citadelle D. Chatelet F.P. Cywiner-Golenzer C.

The AIV-E double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-GGGAGATGTGGACTTTGCCCCCCATGAGCCC-3′ was used as probe, as previously described (25Sauvaget D. Chauffeton V. Citadelle D. Chatelet F.P. Cywiner-Golenzer C.

Supershift experiments were performed with antibody directed against HNF-4α (C-19X), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reverse Transcription and Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNAplus reagent (qBiogene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reverse transcription (RT) experiments were performed as previously described (26Carriere V. Vidal R. Lazou K. Lacasa M. Delers F. Ribeiro A. Rousset M. Chambaz J. Lacorte J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5406-5413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with 2 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 40 μl. Messenger RNA was quantified using the Light-Cycler system according to the manufacturer's procedures (Roche Applied Science). PCRs were performed with a 1:50 final dilution of the RT samples. ApoA-IV mRNA level was quantified using hybridization probes designed by Genset (Proligo, Paris, France). PCR conditions were one step of denaturation (8 min at 95 °C) followed by 40 cycles (each cycle consisted of 15 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 58 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C). The mRNA levels of the other genes were quantified using SYBR Green, and the PCR conditions were one step of denaturation (8 min at 95 °C) followed by 40 cycles (each cycle consisted of 10 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 58-62 °C, depending of the cDNA amplified, and 10 s at 72 °C). The sequences of the primers used in this study were as follows: 5′-AGCCAGGACAAGACTCTCTC-3′ (forward primer); 5′-TCTCACCTCCCACTGGAC-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CCCCTTTGGAGAGCTGAGCTG- fluorescein isothiocyanate-3′ (anchor probe); and 5′-LCred640-CCCTGGTGCACTGGCCCC-3′-phosphate (detection probe) for ApoA-IV; 5′-TTCAGCACCTCAGGACTGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTCTGAGGTCTGAGCAGAG-3′ (reverse primer) for microsomal transfer protein (MTP); 5′-GATCGGGAAGTGGCGTGTTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TGGAGATCTGAGCTGACTGC-3′ (reverse primer) for DPP-IV; 5′-GTGGACGGAGAGAATGAATTG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCTTTCCACACGTAGATCTT-3′ (reverse primer) for villin; 5′-AAGATCGATCGCCACATGTATCA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TGCGTGCTTCCTTGGTCTTAGA-3′ (reverse primer) for L19. The quantification of 18 S RNA (using Taqman probes from Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) was used as control for the RNA extraction and reverse transcription experiments. Results were expressed as the ratio between the levels of mRNA of interest and 18 S RNA. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed are means ± S.E. or ± S.D. The statistical significance of differences was determined by an unpaired Student's t test using Excel software. Perturbation of Cell-Cell Adhesion Impairs ApoA-IV Gene Expression in Caco-2 Cells—The involvement of cell-cell adhesion in apoA-IV gene expression was first investigated either by a perturbation of E-cadherin adhesive properties or by disruption of the integrity of adherens junctions. For that means, high density-plated Caco-2 cells were first grown in normal calcium concentration until day 4 and then grown in the presence or in the absence of calcium for 48 h. As expected, calcium deprivation provoked cell rounding (Fig. 2A, a and b) and a loss of cell-cell adhesion. The disruption of adherens junctions was further characterized by confocal analysis. Calcium depletion led to a diffuse distribution of E-cadherin within some perinuclear aggregates (Fig. 2A, d); colocalization with the actin cytoskeleton was no longer observed (Fig. 2A, f). In contrast in control culture conditions E-cadherin staining was mostly concentrated at lateral membranes (Fig. 2A, c) and associated with the actin cytoskeleton staining (Fig. 2A, e). At the same time, calcium deprivation abolished the induction of apoA-IV mRNA expression that is observed between day 4 and day 6 in high density-plated cells grown in the presence of calcium (Fig. 2B). We next addressed whether E-cadherin perturbation affects other differentiation genes. Human intestinal dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) expression specifically increased during the enterocytic differentiation (36Darmoul D. Lacasa M. Baricault L. Marguet D. Sapin C. Trotot P. Barbat A. Trugnan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4824-4833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of DPP-IV mRNA increased between days 4 and 6, whereas calcium deprivation did not affect this increase (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the mRNA of villin, another differentiation gene (37Hodin R.A. Shei A. Meng S. J. Gastrointest. Surg. 1997; 1: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not significantly vary upon calcium depletion (data not shown). The crucial role of actin cytoskeleton integrity in the formation and maintenance of cell-cell adhesion is illustrated by the rapid and efficient disruption of cell-cell junctions caused by pharmacological agents that disrupt the actin cytoskeleton (e.g. cytochalasin D and Latrunculin B) (38Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1105-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 39Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin.

Therefore, Caco-2 cells, plated at low density, were grown until confluence (day 7) in normal calcium and then treated or not for 48 h with 0.5 μm Latrunculin B (Fig. 3). As show"
https://openalex.org/W1972856570,"Recent studies have revealed that myosin IX is a single-headed processive myosin, yet it is unclear how myosin IX can achieve the processive movement. Here we studied the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis cycle of actomyosin IXb. We found that myosin IXb has a rate-limiting ATP hydrolysis step unlike other known myosins, thus populating the prehydrolysis intermediate (M·ATP). M·ATP has a high affinity for actin, and, unlike other myosins, the dissociation of M·ATP from actin was extremely slow, thus preventing myosin from dissociating away from actin. The ADP dissociation step was 10-fold faster than the overall ATP hydrolysis cycle rate and thus not rate-limiting. We propose the following model for single-headed processive myosin. Upon the formation of the M·ATP intermediate, the tight binding of actomyosin IX at the interface is weakened. However, the head is kept in close proximity to actin due to the tethering role of loop 2/large unique insertion of myosin IX. There is enough freedom for the myosin head to find the next location of the binding site along with the actin filament before complete dissociation from the filament. After ATP hydrolysis, Pi is quickly released to form a strong actin binding form, and a power stroke takes place.

After ATP hydrolysis, Pi is quickly released to form a strong actin binding form, and a power stroke takes place. Among the myosin superfamily members, class IX myosin is quite unique in several aspects. One of the unique features is that the tail region contains a GTPase-activating protein domain for the small GTP-binding protein, Rho (1Reinhard J. Scheel A.A. Diekmann D. Hall A. Ruppert C. Bahler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, myosin IX may be a motor protein carrying its Rho-GTPase-activating protein tail to required sites to down-regulate Rho-dependent signaling. Quite recently, it was reported that myosin IXb binds to BIG1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf1) and the binding of BIG1 to myosin IXb competes with RhoA binding, thus regulating the Rho-GTPase-activating protein activity of myosin IXb (3Saeki N. Tokuo H. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10128-10134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings raise an idea that myosin IX delivers the G-protein signaling molecules to the cellular compartment, where G-protein regulation takes place. Supporting this view, it is shown that myosin IXb moves processively on actin filaments (4Post P.L. Tyska M.J. O'Connell C.B. Johung K. Hayward A. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11679-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Inoue A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is found that myosin IXb moves toward the minus end of the actin filament (5Inoue A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that the full-length myosin IXb moves toward the plus end of actin filament (6O'Connell C.B. Mooseker M.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and because the construct of myosin IXb used by Inoue et al. (5Inoue A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) does not have the tail domain, it was proposed that the tail domain may be important for the determination of the directionality of myosin IXb. A critical issue is that myosin IXb is a single-headed myosin yet moves processively on actin filaments. It has been proposed that the two-headed processive myosin, such as myosin V, moves on actin filaments with a hand-over-hand mechanism to travel a long distance (7Forkey J.N. Quinlan M.E. Shaw M.A. Corrie J.E. Goldman Y.E. Nature. 2003; 422: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Two critical features are required for this mechanism. One is the high duty ratio, in which each myosin head spends a majority of the ATP hydrolysis cycle time (more than 50%) with the strong actin-binding form. During the ATPase cycle, myosin populates either the weak-binding state or strong binding state. The rate-limiting step of a nonprocessive motor, such as myosin II, is Pi release (k+4'); thus, nonprocessive myosins spend a large fraction in the weak binding during the ATPase cycle. Therefore, those myosins can work together in an asynchronous ensemble with high speed. On the other hand, the rate-limiting step for myosin V is ADP release (k+5'); thus, the processive myosins spend the strong binding state in a large fraction during the ATPase cycle. The other is the coordinated binding of the two heads to actin. If the fraction of strong binding state for a single head of myosin V is greater than 0.5, double-headed processive myosin can move on actin filament continuously through a coordinated interaction of two motor domains with the actin filament. However, this model cannot account for the processive movement of a single-headed myosin IX. Of interest is how single-headed myosin IX moves processively on actin filament. Here we studied the ATP hydrolysis mechanism of actomyosin IX to clarify such unique features of myosin IX, a single-headed processive myosin, by analyzing the ATP hydrolysis mechanism that is closely coupled with the cross-bridge cycling of myosin. Reagents and Proteins—2′-Deoxy-mant-ATP (dmantATP) 2The abbreviations used are: dmantATP, 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP; mant, methylanthraniloyl; CaM, calmodulin; M9bIQ4, myosin IXb truncated at the end of IQ motif; Vi, vanadate. was kindly provided by Dr. Howard D. White (Eastern Virginia Medical School). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified according to Spudich and Watt (9Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human calmodulin was cloned from human testis total RNA (Clontech). The cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with random oligonucleotides and subcloned into pFastbac vector for expression in insect Sf9 cells. The CaM cDNA was also introduced to PET30 vector for expression in E. coli and purified as described (10Ikebe M. Kambara T. Stafford W.F. Sata M. Katayama E. Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17702-17707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Preparation of Recombinant Myosin IXb—The myosin IXb construct used (M9bIQ4) was prepared previously (5Inoue A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The construct contains nucleotides 1–3889, encoding residues 1–1296 of human myosin IXb (Fig. 1A). The recombinant myosin IXb was expressed as described (5Inoue A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Typically, 0.3 mg of protein is obtained from 300 ml of culture. Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 5–20% polyacrylamide gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Steady-state ATPase Assay—The ATPase assays were performed at 25 °C in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μm CaM (buffer A). Liberated 32P was measured as described previously (12Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin Binding Assay—Various concentrations of actin (1–20 μm) were mixed with 0.3–0.5 μm M9bIQ4 in buffer A and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. 2 mm ATP was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. For the binding assay of the M·ADP·P state, 0.1 mm ADP and 1 mm Vi were incubated with M9bIQ4 for 1 h on ice, and then various concentrations of actin were incubated with the ternary complex of M9bIQ4·ADP·Vi for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged in the Beckman Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge at 300,000 × g for 5 min. Equal proportions of supernatant and dissolved pellet were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The band intensities were quantified using the ImageJ software to determine the percentage of M9bIQ4 bound to pelleted actin. To determine the bound M9bIQ4 containing ADP·Vi, the amount of [3H]ADP trapped in acto-M9bIQ4 was measured. M9bIQ4 was incubated with [3H]ADP in the presence and absence of 1 mm Vifor 1 h on ice, and then 20 μm actin and 2 mm cold ADP were added to the mixture. If [3H]ADP·Vi is not stably trapped in the active site of M9bIQ4, [3H]ADP is replaced by nonradioactive ADP. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the samples were ultracentrifuged. The pellet was washed with the buffer containing 1 mm ADP, and the amount of [3H]ADP in dissolved pellet was counted by a scintillation counter. The concentration of bound M9bIQ4 in dissolved pellet was also determined by densitometry of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the percentage of trapped [3H]ADP in the M9bIQ4 was calculated. Photoaffinity Labeling of Myosin IXb with ATP—Photoaffinity labeling was performed as described by Maruta and Korn (13Maruta H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 499-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modification. Myosin IXb was mixed with 0.1 mm [α-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]ATP in buffer A and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After irradiation for 2 min with UV light at 254 nm, the proteins were precipitated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 32P into myosin heavy chain was analyzed by a phosphor imager (Fuji Film FLA-5000). Kinetic Experiments—All transient kinetic experiments were done in buffer A at 25 °C using Kin-Tek SF-2001 stopped flow apparatus. The concentration of M9bIQ4 after mixing was 0.2–0.6 μm, and actin was added at 1.2 times the M9bIQ4 concentration. Fluorescence change of dmantATP was measured by fluorescence energy transfer by exciting at 280 nm, and emission was detected at 400 nm with a long pass filter (Oriel). For 90° light scattering, the excitation beam was passed through a 360-nm interference filter. Quenched flow measurements were performed with a Kin-Tek RQF-3 apparatus (KinTek Corp.). Samples of M9bIQ4 or acto-M9bIQ4 were mixed with an equal volume of [32P]ATP in buffer. After aging in the delay line, reactions were stopped by mixing with a solution containing 0.3 n perchloric acid, and the liberated 32P was measured. All of the transients shown are the average of 3–6 independent mixings. Single exponential data were fit to the equation I(t) = c + I (exp-kobst), and two exponential data were fit to I(t) = c + I1(exp-kobs1t) + I2(exp-kobs2t), where I(t) is the fluorescent signal at time t, c is constant, and I, I1, and I2 are the amplitude coefficients of reactions with rate constant kobs, kobs1, and kobs2, respectively. Kinetic modeling and simulation were performed using STELLA software version 8.1.1 (Isee Systems). We expressed and purified the M9bIQ4 construct (Fig. 1A) that contained the entire head domain and the light chain binding neck domain, because this shows the processive movement on actin filament, and one can avoid the potential complexity arising from the presence of the tail domain containing the Rho-binding GTPase-activating protein domain. The purified construct was composed of a heavy chain band and calmodulin and free from 200-kDa Sf9 conventional myosin and 43-kDa actin (Fig. 1B). The number of calmodulin associated with M9bIQ4 was determined by densitometry of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and estimated to be as follows: M9bIQ4 heavy chain/calmodulin = 1:3.93 ± 0.06. Steady-state ATPase Activity of M9bIQ4—Interestingly, the ATPase activity is not significantly activated by actin (Table 1, Fig. 2). The steady-state ATPase activity at saturating ATP concentration is 0.22 s-1 with a KATP of 7.95 μm in the absence of actin and 0.29 s-1 with a KATP of 6.30 μm in the presence of actin.TABLE 1Steady-state ATPase activity of M9bIQ4 S.D. values are shown in parentheses.VmaxKATPKactins-1μmμm- Actin0.22 (0.012)7.95 (0.77)+ Actin0.29 (0.015)6.30 (0.62)2.3 (2.1) Open table in a new tab As demonstrated for other characterized processive myosins, myosin V and myosin VI, ATPase activity of processive myosins is inhibited by ADP because of slow dissociation of ADP from the strong actin binding form of myosin (14De La Cruz E.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to myosin V and myosin VI, the ATPase activity of M9bIQ4 was not changed in the absence and presence of the ATP regeneration system (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the ATPase of M9bIQ4 is not inhibited by ADP. To further confirm this notion, the ATPase activity of M9bIQ4 was measured as a function of ADP (Fig. 3B). The experiment was done with low ATP concentration (25 μm), because ADP only moderately inhibited the ATPase activity. A KADP value of 16 μm was obtained. In the presence of 0.5 mm ATP, the inhibition of the ATPase activity of M9bIQ4 is not observed in the presence of 1 mm ADP, which is consistent with the above experiment. The result is due to the lower affinity of ADP compared with that of ATP. ATP Binding—The data of steady-state ATPase activity show that single-headed myosin IX has lower affinity for ADP, unlike other characterized processive myosins, suggesting that the mechanism of processive movement for myosin IXb would be different from previously reported two-headed processive myosins, whose ADP release step is slow, and is the rate-determining step for the entire hydrolysis cycle (16De La Cruz E.M.

To clarify the mechanism of the processive movement of single-headed myosin IX, we determined each kinetic step of the ATP hydrolysis cycle that is correlated to the cross-bridge cycle (Scheme 1). The fluorescent nucleotide dmantATP was used as a probe to measure the rate of nucleotide binding. A fluorescence enhancement of dmantATP upon binding to M9bIQ4 was best fit to a single exponential (Fig. 4, inset), and the rates are linearly related to the dmantATP concentration to yield the second order rate constants for dmantATP binding of K1k+2 = 1.08 μm-1 s-1 and K1’k+2’ = 1.07 μm-1 s-1, to M9bIQ4 and acto-M9bIQ4, respectively (Fig. 4). The y intercept indicates a dissociation rate of dmantATP (k-2, k-2’) for M9bIQ4 and acto-M9bIQ4 to be 2.22 and 3.43 s-1, respectively (Table 2). Based upon these parameters, the rate of ATP binding at physiological ATP concentration (>2mm) (18Roth K. Weiner M.W. Magn. Reson. Med. 1991; 22: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) is >2000 s-1, which is at least 6000-fold faster than the cycle rate if the rate constant is linearly increased with ATP. We found no sign of curvature within the ATP concentration tested, and the observed rate constant at 5 μm ATP far exceeded the ATPase cycle rate.FIGURE 4Kinetics of dmantATP binding to M9bIQ4 and acto-M9bIQ4. Rates of dmantATP binding to M9bIQ4 (open circles) and acto-M9bIQ4 (closed circles) as a function of nucleotide concentration are shown. The observed rates (kobs) were obtained by fitting the fluorescence data at each nucleotide concentration to a single exponential. The apparent second order rate constants for dmantATP binding to M9bIQ4 and acto-M9bIQ4 are 1.08 and 1.07 μm-1 s-1, respectively. Dissociation rates of ATP determined by y intercept are 2.22 s-1 in the absence of actin and 3.43 s-1 in the presence of actin. The error bars indicate S.D. for n = 4 from three independent preparations. The inset shows a dmantATP fluorescence transient obtained by mixing 0.25 μm M9bIQ4 or acto-M9bIQ4 with 3 μm dmantATP.

It has been thought that the formation of the myosin·ADP·P complex is necessary for normal motor function for myosin (19White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R.

We employed a single turnover experiment, in which all given ATP binds to the myosin active site and is hydrolyzed. The kinetics for single turnover of all myosin so far known showed two exponentials of which the first rapid phase is due to rapid binding and hydrolysis of ATP, followed by the second slow phase of product dissociation. Surprisingly, unlike other myosins, the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis was very slow and best fit to a single exponential in both the presence and absence of actin (Fig. 5A). The result suggests that M9bIQ4 does not form M·ADP·P rapidly, and the rate of product off is faster than that of hydrolysis. The apparent hydrolysis rates of single turnover of ATP hydrolysis are 0.06 and 0.08 s-1 in the absence and presence of actin, respectively. The values were slower than the steady state cycle rate because of the presence of significant reverse reaction of the ATP binding step unlike well known myosin I, II, and V. Fig. 5B shows the simulation to obtain k+3 and k+3' values from kobs with obtained rate constants of the ATP binding step. At given M9bIQ4 and ATP concentration, k+3 and k+3' values were estimated to be 0.24 and 0.45 s-1 in the absence and presence of actin, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the hydrolysis rate obtained from kobs in different M9bIQ4 and ATP concentration. These rates agree well with those of steady-state ATP hydrolysis cycle rates, suggesting that the ATP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting for the M9bIQ4 ATPase reaction.TABLE 3Simulation for hydrolysis rate Different concentrations of M9bIQ4 and ATP were used to obtain apparent hydrolysis rate (kobs). Rates of hydrolysis (k+3) to fulfill experimentally determined kinetic constants (kobs) in each condition are determined by simulation using STELLA software.

Whereas myosin IX contains this conserved Trp, ATP-induced change in Trp fluorescence was not observed (not shown). Predominant Intermediate during ATPase Cycle—If the ATP hydrolysis step is the rate-limiting step for the entire cycle, the predominant reaction intermediate should be M·ATP rather than M·ADP·P. To support this notion, we determined the dominant intermediate by performing photoaffinity labeling of M9b with 32P-labeled ATP. Myosins were UV-irradiated with [α-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]ATP, and the incorporation of 32P into myosin heavy chain was analyzed by a phosphor imager. For conventional myosin (smooth muscle heavy meromyosin), the radioactivity was detected only when myosin was irradiated with [α-32P]ATP, but not with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 6). Since smooth muscle heavy meromyosin rapidly hydrolyzed ATP to produce M·ADP·P, the noncovalently associated Pi dissociated from myosin heavy chain upon acid quenching. On the other hand, radioactivity is detected when M9b is irradiated with [γ-32P]ATP similar to that with [α-32P]ATP (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the notion that M9bIQ4 has the rate-limiting ATP hydrolysis step, indicating that the predominant steady-state intermediate for myosin IX is M·ATP. Actin Binding and ADP Off—It is known for reported myosins that the myosin head is rapidly dissociated from actin upon the addition of ATP; however, we found that the majority of myosin IX co-sedimented with actin even in the presence of ATP. This suggested that the actin binding properties of myosin IX are different from other myosin so far reported. It should be noted that M9bIQ4 was not precipitated in the absence of actin. We further examined the unique actin binding properties of myosin IX. Light scattering was used to determine the rate of actin binding of M9bIQ4. The rate constants of the binding of M9bIQ4 and M9bIQ4·ADP to actin were linearly related to actin concentration (Fig. 7). The y intercept of Fig. 7 is very close to the original point in both presence and absence of ADP, suggesting that the off rate is very small. The apparent second order rate constant for M9bIQ4 binding to actin was 5.2 μm-1 s-1 in the absence of ADP (k-6) and 5.4 μm-1 s-1 in the presence of ADP (k-10). The rate of dissociation of M9bIQ4 and M9bIQ4·ADP from actin was also measured by light scattering. The kinetics of ATP-induced dissociation of acto-M9bIQ4 was slow and showed hyperbolic dependence on ATP concentration (Fig. 8). The maximum rate of dissociation was k+8 + k-8[actin] = 13.0 s-1. This is extremely slow compared with other characterized myosins that the rate of dissociation is typically >500 s-1. The dissociation rate was significantly decreased in the presence of ADP, and this is because the dissociation of M9bIQ4 from actin should be limited by the rate of ADP release (k+5') in the presence of excess ATP. Thus, the dissociation rate of ADP from acto-M9bIQ4 of k+5 = 3.34 s-1 was obtained, which is 10-fold faster than the entire ATP hydrolysis cycle rate. The rate of ADP off was also measured by monitoring the change in the fluorescence of bound dmantADP after the addition of excess ATP, and the result confirmed the light-scattering experiment (not shown). The result suggests that ADP release is not the rate-determining step for M9bIQ4. Since the affinity of ADP to acto-M9bIQ4 (KADP)is16 μm (Fig. 3B), the association rate constant for ADP to acto-M9bIQ4 was calculated to be 0.21 μm-1 s-1. For other processive myosins, ADP release is rate-limiting, resulting in the formation of predominant intermediate at M·ADP state, which is strongly bound to actin (16De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The result suggests that the mechanism of processive movement of myosin IX is quite different from those of two-headed processive myosin. We determined the binding affinity of M9bIQ4 to actin by co-sedimentation analysis in the presence of ATP (Fig. 9A). The data points were fit to hyperbola, and the affinity of M9bIQ4 for actin in the presence of ATP was Kd = 2.33 μm. Since the predominant intermediate is M·ATP, the Kd value is considered as K8 (equal to k-8/k+8). Since k+8 + k-8[actin] is equal to 13.08 s-1, where [actin] = 0.6 μm, the values of k-8 and k+8 were calculated to be 5.45 μm-1 s-1 and 12.7 s-1, respectively. The results indicate that M·ATP state for myosin IX has much higher binding affinity than other myosins, in which the M·ATP state is a weak actin binding state (32Berger C.L. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11036-11045Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Konrad M. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Resetar A.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 28844-28854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, we found that the amplitude of the ATP induced change in the light scattering of acto-M9bIQ4 decreases with actin concentration. The extent of the change at 2 μm actin was approximately half of the maximum change in the light scattering estimated from the binding of M9bIQ4 to actin (not shown). It is known for other myosins that M·ADP·P state is also a weak actin binding state. Because M·ADP·P is not the predominant intermediate for myosin IX, we used Vi to trap ADP into the active site. M9bIQ4 with excess [3H]ADP was incubated with or without vanadate in the presence of actin, and the amount of [3H]ADP on M9bIQ4 co-sedimented with actin was determined. As shown in Fig. 9B, nearly 100% of actin-bound M9bIQ4 trapped [3H]ADP in the presence of Vi, whereas little [3H]ADP was trapped in the absence of Vi. These results suggest that M·ADP·P st"

This sequence, YDSI, has been shown to interact with the μ2 subunit of the AP-2 adaptor complex (14Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3655-3660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 443: S70-S74PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weixel K.M.

Alanine substitutions of the tyrosine and isoleucine residues result in an accumulation of the double alanine mutant CFTR at the cell surface, with a matching increase in chloride channel function (12Peter K. Varga K. Bebok Z. McNicholas-Bevensee C.M. Schwiebert L. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49952-49957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, loss of the signal has no effect on the protein half-life, suggesting that internalization is not the rate-limiting step for CFTR degradation. Over 1400 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene, and these are classified into six classes (reviewed in Ref. 17Rowntree R.K. Harris A. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2003; 67: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Class II mutations that affect protein maturation are the most prevalent, and the prototype of this class, ΔF508, is the most common disease-causing mutation. This mutation confers a temperature-sensitive folding defect (18Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar); when cell lines expressing this protein are cultured at 27 °C for 2 days, ΔF508 CFTR is released to the cell surface (18Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), where it reduces single channel activity (20Wang W. Li G. Clancy J.P. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23622-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even after delivery to the cell surface, ΔF508 is rapidly down-regulated (21Sharma M. Pampinella F. Nemes C. Benharouga M. So J. Du K. Bache K.G. Papsin B. Zerangue N. Stenmark H. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), suggesting multiple defects that need to be corrected to restore normal chloride channel function. Therefore, identification of the structural features in CFTR responsible for proper cell surface trafficking are of great interest. In the present studies, we examined two naturally occurring mutations, R31C and R31L, which cause mild CF. 3CF Genetic Analysis Consortium, www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr. 3CF Genetic Analysis Consortium, www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr. To determine the defects caused by these missense mutations, we expressed them in COS-7 cells and analyzed their biogenesis and trafficking. Our results indicate that both R31C and R31L have compromised biogenesis and enhanced endocytosis compared with wild-type CFTR. These two additive defects contribute to the low surface expression of the mutants. Patch clamp studies confirmed the biochemical data and showed a dramatic decrease in the functional surface pool of both Arg-31 CFTR mutants. Construction of CFTR Mutants—The R31C and R31L mutants were prepared by PCR mutagenesis. Cloning vectors, oligos, enzymes, and reagents were from Invitrogen. PCR reactions were performed using Platinum Pfx polymerase according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Using the CFTR gene contained in plasmid pCDNA3.1+ as template, the R31L and R31C mutants were constructed by PCR-mutagenesis using a pair of internal primers for each mutant, annealing at the Arg-31 coding site, and a pair of external primers, one annealing at the Nhe-I site of the multilinker of the vector, and one annealing at the BspE-I site in the CFTR gene. The oligos used were (5′–3′): CFTR_R31L(+), GAGGAAAGGATACAGACAGCTCCTGGAATTGTCAGACATATAC; CFTR_R31L(–), GTATATGTCTGACAATTCCAGGAGCTGTCTGTATCCTTTCCTC; CFTR_R31C(+), GAGGAAAGGATACAGACAGTGCCTGGAATTGTCAGACATATAC; CFTR_R31C(–), GTATATGTCTGACAATTCCAGGCACTGTCTGTATCCTTTCCTC; PCDNA-Nhe-N, GGCTAGCGTTTAAACTTAAGC; and CFTR-BspEI-C, GAATATTTTCCGGAGGATGATTC. For each mutation, a pair of PCR reactions was performed, one using the external N primer and the internal (–) primer, another using the external C primer and the internal (+) primer. An aliquot from each reaction was then combined in a second reaction with both external primers. Annealing at, and extension from, the homologous termini of the first reaction products provided the template for the second reaction. The products of the second reactions were cloned using the PCR cloning vector pCR-Blunt. Mutant clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Center for AIDS Research/Comprehensive Cancer Center Sequencing Core) and subcloned back into the CFTR gene in pCDNA3.1+ at the Nhe-I and BspE-I sites. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection of COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured as described previously (10Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and transiently transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Transfection efficiencies were monitored by co-transfection with green fluorescent protein and generally approximated 60%. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for 48 h before analysis. Immunoprecipitation of CFTR—One T75 flask of confluent-transfected COS-7 cells was used 48 h post-transfection. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). CFTR was immunoprecipitated using a mouse monoclonal anti-carboxyl-terminal tail 24–1 antibody (ATCC number HB-11947) coupled to protein A-agarose (Roche Diagnostics) (22Varga K. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Hong J.S. Guimbellot J.S. Venglarik C.J. Niraj A. Mazur M. Sorscher E.J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. J. Biol.

Calculation of protein half-lives was performed as described by Straley et al. (23Straley K.S. Daugherty B.L. Aeder S.E. Hockenson A.L. Kim K. Green S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1683-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Maturation efficiency was measured by comparing the density of the labeled immature, core-glycosylated form (B band) to the density of the fully glycosylated protein (C band) using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.) (24Bebok Z. Varga K. Hicks J.K. Venglarik C.J. Kovacs T. Chen L. Hardiman K.M. Collawn J.F. Sorscher E.J. Matalon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43041-43049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface glycoproteins were biotinylated using previously established methods (12Peter K. Varga K. Bebok Z. McNicholas-Bevensee C.M. Schwiebert L. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49952-49957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, after surface biotinylation with biotin LC hydrazide, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with a protease inhibitor mixture (30 min on ice), and CFTR was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to CFTR (24–1) coupled to protein A-agarose. CFTR was eluted from the beads with 2× Laemmli sample buffer, run on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Biotinylated CFTR was detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled avidin. Chemiluminescence was induced with Pico Super Signal peroxide solution (Pierce). The membranes were exposed for different time periods up to 1 min, and a linear range for a standard set of diluted samples was calibrated. Endocytosis Assays—Internalization assays were performed as described previously with minor modifications (10Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B.

Biotinylated CFTR was detected using Western blot analysis after calibration of a standard curve of diluted samples. CFTR internalization was detected as percentage of loss of biotinylated CFTR in the 2.5-min warm-up period compared with the control samples (no warm-up period). Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (24Bebok Z. Varga K. Hicks J.K. Venglarik C.J. Kovacs T. Chen L. Hardiman K.M. Collawn J.F. Sorscher E.J. Matalon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43041-43049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Patch Clamp Analysis—Macroscopic currents were recorded in the excised, inside-out configuration. Patch pipettes were pulled from Corning 8161 glass to tip resistances of 3 megohms. CFTR channels were activated following patch excision by exposure of the cytoplasmic face of the patch to the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (110 units/ml; Promega) and MgATP (1 mm). Currents were recorded in symmetrical solutions containing (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 3 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, and 10 TES, pH 7.3. Macroscopic currents were evoked using a ramp protocol from +80 to –80 mV with a 4-s time period. Signals from macroscopic recording were filtered at 20 Hz. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pCLAMP 9.1 software (Axon Instruments). All patch clamp experiments were performed at 21–23 °C. SPQ Fluorescence Assays—CFTR function in individual cells was assayed using the halide-quenched dye SPQ (25Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded for 10 min with SPQ (10 mm) by hypotonic shock and then mounted in a specially designed perfusion chamber for fluorescence measurements. Fluorescence (F) of single cells was measured with a Zeiss inverted microscope, a PTI imaging system, and a Hamamatsu camera. Excitation was at 340 nm, and emission was >410 nm. All functional studies were conducted at 23 °C. Base-line fluorescence was measured in isotonic NaI buffer (NaI buffer; 130 mm NaI, 5 mm KNO3, 2.5 mm Ca(NO3)2, 2.5 mm Mg(NO3)2, 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES) followed by perfusion with isotonic dequenching buffer (NaNO3 replaced NaI) to measure unregulated efflux and then NaNO3 buffer with 20 μm forskolin as indicated. At the end of each experiment, the cells were returned to the NaI buffer for requenching (1100 s). The increase in fluorescence above the basal (NaI-quenched) level is shown (% increase F > basal) (Fig. 6E). The data are cumulative from three coverslips in each condition studied in a paired fashion on three separate days (n = 120 cells/curve). The bottom 10% of cells in all conditions (attributable to inadequate SPQ loading, cell detachment, etc.) were discarded, and the data obtained from the top 90% of cells in each condition were analyzed as previously described (26Clancy J.P. Ruiz F.E. Sorscher E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C361-C369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Clancy J.P. Hong J.S. Bebok Z. King S.A. Demolombe S. Bedwell D.M. Sorscher E.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15222-15230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Wild-type CFTR-expressing cells had an increased dequenching in NO3 buffer and NO3 buffer plus forskolin, as previously described, presumably because of varying levels of wild-type CFTR activation. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance among means was determined using the Student's t test (two samples) unless otherwise indicated. The Arg-31 Mutations Inhibit Processing—Because missense mutations in the amino terminus of CFTR often result in processing defects (28Cormet-Boyaka E. Jablonsky M. Naren A.P. Jackson P.L. Muccio D.D. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8221-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the Arg-31 mutations were nonconservative substitutions, we first examined the effects of these two changes on the biogenesis of CFTR. Fig. 1 shows the location of the mutations in the context of the CFTR molecule. To examine the maturation efficiency of the Arg-31 mutants, they were expressed in COS-7 cells, and biogenesis tested in metabolic pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 2). For wild-type CFTR, 21.0 ± 1.0% (mean ± S.D.) of the protein was converted from the immature, core-glycosylated form (band B) to the maturely glycosylated protein (band C). This result was consistent with previous reports on the processing of wild-type CFTR in COS-7 cells (22Varga K. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Hong J.S. Guimbellot J.S. Venglarik C.J. Niraj A. Mazur M. Sorscher E.J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22578-22584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). A significant proportion of band B was converted to band C (17.7 ± 1.5%) by 2 h and was maximal at 4 h after the labeling. With the R31C and R31L mutants, however, very little processing occurred during the first 2 h of chase (0 and 4.7 ± 1.5%, respectively). By 4 h, 10.3 ± 3.0% (R31C) and 11.3 ± 2.1% (R31L) of CFTR was converted to the mature form, indicating that, although there is a processing defect, it does not cause complete inhibition.FIGURE 2Protein maturation of R31C and R31L CFTR is inefficient compared with wild-type CFTR. COS-7 cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min at 37 °C with 300 μCi/μl [35S]methionine. After the pulse, radioactive medium was replaced by complete medium, and cells were lysed at the time points indicated. CFTR was immunoprecipitated with 24–1 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels and PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). CFTR maturation efficiency was measured by comparing the maximum density of labeled band B after a 30-min pulse (100%) to the density of band C after 4 h of chase using IPLab software. A, representative metabolic labeling experiments are shown for wild type (WT), R31C, and R31L (left panels). Band B represents the core-glycosylated form of CFTR, and band C represents fully glycosylated protein. The average disappearance of band B (maturation and/or degradation) and formation of band C at each time point are shown (right panels). The disappearance of band B (closed circles) and formation of band C (open circles) were calculated based on densitometry at each time point. Results are plotted as percent of band B at the 0 time point. B, summaries of the protein maturation efficiencies for each of the constructs. Maturation efficiencies of wild type, R31C, and R31L were calculated after 4 h of chase (average ± S.D., n = 3; *, p < 0.005; **, p < 0.001). C, R31C (C) and R31L (L) are not temperature-sensitive. WT, R31C and R31L CFTR were immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells 48 h after transfection. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were cultured at either 37 or 27 °C for 24 h before analysis. CFTR was in vitro phosphorylated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. A 27 °C incubation increased the amount of B band but did not influence C band production for R31C or R31L CFTR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transfected cells were next cultured at 37 or 27 °C to determine whether maturation of the Arg-31 mutants improved at a lower temperature. The results (Fig. 2C) indicate that there is no improvement in processing at 27 °C. Overall, the maturation experiments suggest that in contrast to ΔF508 CFTR, compromised processing of the Arg-31 mutations is not the result of a temperature-sensitive folding defect. The Arg-31 Mutations Have No Effect on Protein Half-life—To determine whether these substitutions affected protein stability, half-lives of the fully processed mutant proteins were measured in metabolic pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 3). The results indicate that the protein half-life of the wild-type protein is 13.3 ± 1.2 h, and the R31C and R31L half-lives are 12.7 ± 0.6 and 14.3 ± 3.1 h, respectively, indicating that, although the processing of the mutants was decreased by 50%, the stability of the processed proteins was comparable with wild-type CFTR. Reduced Surface Expression of R31C and R31L—Because some mutant protein was processed correctly and the protein half-life appeared normal, the surface pool of the Arg-31 mutants was examined next. Wild-type and Arg-31 mutant CFTR intracellular distributions were monitored using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 4A). For wild-type CFTR, perimeter staining was clearly seen as indicated by the arrows. For the R31C and R31L mutants, however, staining was much more restricted to an intracellular, reticular pattern. Perimeter staining was difficult to see in the Arg-31 mutants. To confirm this observation, cells expressing wild-type, R31C, and R31L CFTR were surface-biotinylated (Fig. 4B), CFTR was immunoprecipitated, and the biotinylated fraction was detected by Western blot analysis. The results indicate that the surface pool of the R31C and R31L mutants is 20.3 ± 7.5 and 33.6 ± 11.7% of the wild-type protein, respectively (n = 4, p < 0.005, and p < 0.05, respectively. This suggests that the surface pool is smaller than would be predicted based on the biogenesis and half-life experiments. R31C and R31L Are Internalized More Rapidly than the Wild-type CFTR—Because the surface pool was smaller than predicted, we next tested whether the mutations affected CFTR clearance from the cell surface. To test this, a two-step biotinylation assay was used to monitor CFTR endocytosis during a 2.5-min warm-up period. This period of time is within the linear phase of CFTR endocytosis in these cells (10Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The results indicated that 24.8 ± 5.9% of the wild-type protein was internalized in 2.5 min (Fig. 5). This rate of endocytosis was consistent with previous results (12Peter K. Varga K. Bebok Z. McNicholas-Bevensee C.M. Schwiebert L. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49952-49957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The R31C and R31L mutants, however, have dramatically altered internalization kinetics with 54 ± 4 and 55 ± 13.9% of the R31C and R31L mutants, respectively (internalized during the same warm-up period). This result suggests these substitutions affect the surface stability of CFTR and are consistent with the lowered surface expression seen with immunofluorescence and surface biotinylation. The Functional Activity of the R31C and R31L Mutants Is Severely Compromised—As a final measure of the total CFTR chloride channels at the cell surface, we tested the functional activity of the R31C and R31L mutants in two complementary functional assays, macroscopic patch clamp experiments and SPQ assays. In the first studies, inside-out membrane patches were excised from transfected COS-7 cells using large tip pipettes (3 megohms). CFTR channels were activated with normally saturating concentrations of protein kinase A and MgATP. For cells transfected with wild-type CFTR, the majority of patches (4 of 6) contained many CFTR channels (>30–50) as deduced from the magnitude of the peak currents recorded at ±80 mV (assuming single channel currents of ∼0.5 pA; Fig. 6A). The recorded currents were determined to be CFTR-mediated on the basis of three criteria: (i) dependence on MgATP, (ii) inhibition by the voltage-dependent pore blocker glibenclamide (30Schultz B.D. DeRoos A.D. Venglarik C.J. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L192-L200PubMed Google Scholar), and (iii) absence from untransfected cells (data not shown). Cells transfected with the R31L and R31C mutants exhibited two differences as compared with wild-type-transfected cells. First, for each mutant the CFTR-mediated currents were much smaller across those patches that exhibited detectable channel activity (Fig. 6, B and C). Second, cells that were transfected with the mutants exhibited far more silent patches (i.e. patches that exhibited no detectable channel activity; see Fig. 6 legend). The silent patches might represent untransfected cells, although the fact that wild-type-transfected cells exhibited very few silent patches makes this less likely. These macroscopic patch clamp results are consistent with the notion that the Arg-31 mutations reduce the steady-state surface expression of CFTR. As with any macroscopic functional assay, however, these findings do not exclude the possibility that the Arg-31 mutations also affect the single channel properties of CFTR. In the second functional analyses, the Arg-31 mutants were tested using an SPQ halide efflux protocol to measure anion transport through the cell surface membrane. Fig. 6E shows that, in wild-type CFTR-expressing cells, halide transport was activated after stimulation with cyclic AMP agonists (20 μm forskolin and 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methlyxanthine). Analysis of the Arg-31 mutants, however, revealed that the halide transport activities were reduced compared with the wild-type protein. This result, in combination with the patch clamp analysis, supports the biochemical data and indicates that there is a decrease in the functional chloride channels at the surface in cells expressing the Arg-31 mutants compared with the wild-type controls. The R31C and R31L are naturally occurring missense CF mutations that appear to have a mild phenotype (31Zielenski J. Markiewicz D. Chen H.S. Schappert K. Seller A. Durie P. Corey M. Tsui L.C. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).3 Both of these mutations are rare (identified once in 284 CF chromosomes, for the R31L mutation). The R31C mutation was found in a 45-year-old male CF patient diagnosed in childhood who was pancreatic-sufficient with moderate pulmonary symptoms and a positive sweat test. His other allele is the I556V mutation. The R31L was found in a 24-year-old female CF patient who was pancreatic-sufficient with normal lung function but a positive sweat test. The other allele was not identified. Based on these descriptions, both mutations appear to be associated with mild disease, and our biochemical and functional data support this idea, because there is some surface-expressed and functional chloride channel activity associated with these mutants. The analysis of the Arg-31 CFTR suggests that replacement of the arginine with either cysteine or leucine at position 31 affects protein biogenesis. The biogenesis defect is not complete, however, because some CFTR is processed properly and reaches the cell surface. Interestingly, not only was biogenesis compromised by ∼50%, the kinetics of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus as assessed by glycosylation changes appeared slower for the two mutants, particularly at the 2-h time point. By 6 h, however, there was a decrease in the amount of labeled band C for both of the mutants compared with earlier time points. Surprisingly, once the protein was fully processed, the stability of the Arg-31 mutants was comparable with the wild-type protein. The fact that these substitutions affect biogenesis is not surprising, given that, in the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Data Base, there are 27 missense mutations that have been identified within the 80-residue amino-terminal tail.3 Furthermore, our own studies using deletion analysis have shown that the amino terminus is essential for CFTR protein processing (10Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One possible reason for the critical nature of the amino terminus is that this region has been shown to control protein kinase A-dependent channel gating through a physical interaction with the distal region of nucleotide binding domain 1 and the R domain (residues 595–823) (33Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alanine scanning of this region shows that a number of sites are critical for processing (32Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that point mutations in this region of the molecule are poorly tolerated, even when the substitutions are alanine residues. In the case of the Arg-31 mutations, the substitutions are nonconservative, and based on the data, these nonconservative changes affect CFTR processing. The reason these two mutations affect endocytosis is unclear. One intriguing possibility, however, is that they introduce potential internalization signals in the amino terminus of CFTR, Y28XXC31 and Y28XXL31. With the introduction of the hydrophobic residue at position 4, they conform to a consensus internalization signal that consists of YXXΦ, where Φ is a large hydrophobic residue and X is any residue (13Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Whether these mutations are recognized by the endocytic machinery of the cell, however, cannot be determined from the present studies. In fact, it is possible that these mutations somehow affect the recognition of the tyrosine-based signal in the carboxyl terminus and promote enhanced endocytosis. A third possibility is that the mutations alter the tertiary structure of CFTR and this influences the rate of clearance of CFTR from the cell surface. However, if the structure were dramatically altered, then the protein half-life might be affected, and this is certainly not the case with these particular mutations. Another CFTR mutation was recently identified in the second intracellular loop, N287Y, which affects endocytosis over wild-type levels (34Silvis M.R. Picciano J.A. Bertrand C. Weixel K. Bridges R.J. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11554-11560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N287Y mutation does not introduce a consensus tyrosine-based signal and did not affect biogenesis of CFTR. This suggests that overactive internalization alone is sufficient to promote a disease phenotype (34Silvis M.R. Picciano J.A. Bertrand C. Weixel K. Bridges R.J. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11554-11560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the case of the Arg-31 mutants, a combination of a biogenesis defect coupled with enhanced endocytosis results in a decrease in the functional amount of CFTR at the cell surface. The mild phenotype of patients harboring these mutations is consistent with the residual amount of activity of the mutants found in this study. The altered surface stability defect in the Arg-31 mutants without a corresponding defect in protein stability is in contrast to the ΔF508 mutation. ΔF508 is a class II mutation that misfolds during biogenesis and is rapidly degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (35Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). ΔF508, however, is a temperature-sensitive mutation (18Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), and some CFTR escapes endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation when cells are cultured at 27 °C. Recent studies on rescued ΔF508 CFTR in airway epithelia indicate that, similar to the Arg-31 mutants, ΔF508 CFTR is also more rapidly internalized than the wild-type protein (19Swiatecka-Urban A. Brown A. Moreau-Marquis S. Renuka J. Coutermarsh B. Barnaby R. Karlson K.H. Flotte T.R. Fukuda M. Langford G.M. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36762-36772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The Arg-31 mutants do have a partial biogenesis defect, indicating their status as class II mutations. However, culturing at 27 °C has no effect on Arg-31 mutant biogenesis, indicating that they are not temperature-sensitive. Analysis of the ΔF508, N287Y, and R31L and R31C indicate that alterations in the transport of CFTR at the cell surface, whether it is enhanced internalization or compromised recycling, can result in a disease phenotype. In summary, two naturally occurring mutations in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR at position 31 dramatically enhance endocytosis. This, in combination with a partial biogenesis defect, leads to diminished chloride channel activity at the cell surface and explains two of the cellular defects observed in these mutations.

Accumulated evidence shows that PtdIns 3-kinase can provide a critical signal for cell proliferation, cell survival, membrane trafficking, glucose transport, and membrane ruffling. Mammalian PtdIns 3-kinases are divided into three classes based on structure and substrate specificity. A unique characteristic of class II PtdIns 3-kinases is the presence of both a phox homolog domain and a C2 domain at the C terminus. The biological function of the C2 domain of the class II PtdIns 3-kinases remains to be determined. We have determined the crystal structure of the mCPK-C2 domain, which is the first three-dimensional structural model of a C2 domain of class II PtdIns 3-kinases. Structural studies reveal that the mCPK-C2 domain has a typical anti-parallel β-sandwich fold. Scrutiny of the surface of this C2 domain has identified three small, shallow sulfate-binding sites. On the basis of the structural features of these sulfate-binding sites, we have studied the lipid binding properties of the mCPK-C2 domain by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results show that this C2 domain binds specifically to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 and that three lysine residues at SBS I site, Lys-1420, Lys-1432, and Lys-1434, are responsible for the phospholipid binding affinity.

On the basis of their structures and in vitro activity, PtdIns 3-kinases are divided into three distinct families, termed classes I, II, and III (4.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 5.Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6.Anderson K.E. Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Among them, the class I family is further divided into class Ia and class Ib subfamilies. Class Ia PtdIns 3-kinases include p110α, p110β, and p110δ and are regulated by a p85-like adaptor. In contrast, class Ib PtdIns 3-kinases include a G-protein-activated enzyme, p110γ, and are regulated by a molecule termed p101. Class I PtdIns 3-kinase phosphorylates at the 3′-position of PtdIns, PtdIns (4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro. The role in intracellular signal transduction has been extensively examined for class I PtdIns 3-kinases, and they are recognized as mediators for receptor signaling (4.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). On the other hand, class III PtdIns 3-kinase includes a vps34p analog, which phosphorylates at the 3′-position of PtdIns and regulates vesicle trafficking in a ligand-independent manner (4.Fruman D.A.

Distinct from class I and class III PtdIns 3-kinases, class II PtdIns 3-kinases contain two tandem domains at the C terminus, a phox homolog (PX) domain that binds specifically to PtdIns(4,5)P2 (15.Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and a C2 domain containing a nuclear localization signal (16.Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The structure, biochemical properties, and physiological function of this C2 domain, however, remain unknown.The C2 domain is a module of ∼120 amino acid residues in length and was originally identified in the Ca2+-dependent isoforms of protein kinase C (17.Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Single and multiple copies of C2 domains have been identified in hundreds of eukaryotic signaling proteins that are involved in signal transduction, membrane trafficking, inflammation, and many other cell processes (18.Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As a group, C2 domains display the remarkable property of binding a variety of different ligands and substrates, including Ca2+, phospholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and intracellular proteins. Some C2 domains, such as those derived from synaptotagmin I (SytI) and PKCβ, have been shown to bind synergistically to Ca2+ and acidic phospholipids, or phosphatidylcholine (18.Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19.Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Honig B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 145-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an increasing number of C2 domains, including the C2 domains of class II PtdIns 3-kinases, were identified as Ca2+ insensitive due to the lack of the conserved aspartate residues necessary for Ca2+ binding. The C2 domains in other proteins were also shown to bind specifically to acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylserine (PS) (10.Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S.

However, the contribution of the lipid binding ability of the C2 domains to the physiological function of those C2 domain-containing proteins is still not clear.Here we report the first three-dimensional structure and lipid binding properties of the C2 domain of class II PtdIns 3-kinase from Mus musculus (mCPK-C2 domain). Structural studies reveal a typical anti-parallel β-sandwich fold as well as three sulfate-binding sites (SBSs) on the surface of the domain. One of the SBSs was identified as the binding site for PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, as demonstrated from the lipid binding features in combination with site-directed mutagenesis studies. These results provide the structural basis for the lipid binding property of the C2 domain of PtdIns 3-kinases, which helps us to understand the regulatory mechanism of class II PtdIns 3-kinases.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Plasmids and Mutagenesis—DNA fragments encoding the C2 domain of class II PtdIns 3-kinase, mCPK (residues 1384-1509), was PCR cloned into a modified vector with a His6 tag at its N terminus with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII as reported previously (15.Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The K1420A, K1432A/K1434A, and R1439A/K1440A mutants of the His-tagged mCPK-C2 domain (called C2-K-A, C2-KRK-ARA, and C2-RK-AA) were generated with the overlapping polymerase chain reaction. All cloned plasmid DNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification—The plasmid DNA encoding the mCPK-C2 domain and its mutants were transformed into Escherichiacoli BL21(DE3) cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Luria Bertani medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when A595 nm reached 0.5-0.6. After further growth at 22 °C for 8 h, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For protein purification, the frozen cells were thawed on ice, resuspended in 40 ml of extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100), and disrupted with sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) at 4 °C overnight with constant shaking. The beads were washed several times with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fusion protein was finally eluted from the beads with elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5% glycerol). The pure protein was combined and dialyzed against and concentrated in the harvesting buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 and 5% glycerol).Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystal growth was performed by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. Crystallization drops were obtained by mixing 2 μl of mCPK-C2 domain (15 mg/ml) and 2 μl of reservoir solution (23% polyethylene glycol 6000, 200 mm Li2SO4, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and were equilibrated against 0.5 ml of reservoir solution at 4 °C. Crystals were obtained in 2 months. Diffraction data were collected at the BL41XU beam line in SPring-8 (Proposal 2003A0438-NL1-np; Harima, Japan) and at the Gulf Coast Consortium for Protein Crystallography beam line at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (Baton Rouge, LA). Data were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (31.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) and CCP4 programs (32.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P41212 with cell constants a = b = 53.365 Å and c = 200.110 Å. There are two molecules per asymmetric unit. The best data set was taken in the resolution range 50-2.3 Å (2.38-2.30 Å), with completeness, I/σ(I), and Rmerge of 99.7% (100%), 43.9 (10.4), and 5.6% (16.5%), respectively.Structural Determination—The structure was determined by molecular replacement with the program AMORE (32.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the polyalanine model of the Rattus norvegicus SytI C2 domain (20.Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), adding identical side chains but omitting gap regions as well as five residues at both N- and C-terminal ends, serves as an effective search model. Cross-rotational and translational searches identified the first molecule at 3.0 Å. The second molecule was located by an additional round of translational searching holding the first molecule fixed. After an initial rigid body refinement, subsequent refinements were performed with the program CNS (33.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). 5% of randomly selected data were used to calculate the Rfree factor to monitor refinements. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used in the refinements and were gradually released. Modeling was performed with the program O (34.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Omitted residues and excluded side chains were gradually added based on 2 Fo- - Fc and omit maps. Positional refinements (simulated annealing and energy minimization) were performed first in the resolution range of 47-3.0 Å and finally to 2.3 Å. Water molecules and sulfate ions were then assigned and refined. Subsequently, individual B-factor refinement was performed. The final model was obtained with R and Rfree factors of 19.7 and 23.3%, respectively. The final model was checked with PROCHECK (32.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar), and the root mean square deviations from ideal geometry are 0.009 Å for bond lengths, 1.6° for bond angles, and 26.6° for dihedral angles. The coordinates of the mCPK-C2 structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (2B3R).Liposome Binding Assays—Liposome binding assays were performed as described before (35.Zhan Y. Virbasius J.V. Song X. Pomerleau D.P. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4512-4518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. PtdIns (4)P, PtdIns(5)P, and PtdIns(3,5)P2 were purchased from Echelon, Inc. PtdIns (3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were purchased from Matreya, Inc. The published liposome binding assay protocol was used for the binding experiments in this report (24.Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R. Watton S.J. Layton M.J. Gout I. Ahmadi K. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol.

The dried mixture was then resuspended in 100 μl of liposome buffer (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), sonicated in a bath sonicator for 15 min, and spun for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C. The liposomes were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2) at the concentration of 1 mg/ml. The liposomes were then incubated with 8 μg of purified protein for 15 min at room temperature and centrifuged. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer. 25 μl of both fractions was used for analysis by SDS-PAGE gel and Coomassie Blue staining. The intensity of the stained bands was quantitatively determined with an LKB Ultrascan laser densitometer.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structure of the mCPK-C2 Domain—We cloned, expressed, and purified the C2 domain (residues 1384-1509) of the class II PtdIns 3-kinase from M. musculus, mCPK, with a His6 tag linked by a short peptide (-Gly-Ser-) at the N terminus by the reported method (15.Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the mCPK-C2 domain was determined at 2.3 Å resolution with an R-factor of 19.7% (Fig. 1A). Residues 1384-1505 were located with the electron density map, and other residues at both termini, including the His6 tag, were disordered. The mCPK-C2 domain folds as a typical type-I anti-parallel eight-stranded β-sandwich, with an extra short β-strand (β4′) located at the C terminus of strand β4 and an extra α helix (α1) connected to strands β5 and β6 (Fig. 1B).

Almost none of the five aspartate residues involved in Ca2+ binding in the C2 domains of SytI and synatotagmin III (SytIII) and of PKCα and PKCβ is conserved in the C2 domains of class II PtdIns 3-kinases (Fig. 1C).Although the β-sandwich cores of various C2 domains are structurally well conserved, their loop regions at both ends of the cores are highly flexible, especially among the C2 domains from different protein families. The mCPK-C2 domain is folded mostly similarly to the SytI-C2 domain (20.Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), with two β-sheets, β8-β1-β2-β5 and β7-β6-β3-β4, forming the convex and concave sides of the sandwich, respectively. The root mean square deviation between the α-carbons of the mCPK-C2 domain and the SytI-C2 domain is 0.87 and 1.05 Å for molecules A and B, respectively. In addition, a five-residue α-helix is inserted between strands β5 and β6, and an additional β4′-strand is located at the C-terminal side of β4 in the mCPK-C2 domain. Sequence alignments show high homology among the C2 domains of class II PtdIns 3-kinases, as compared with those of PKCs and synaptotagmins (∼30%). For example, the C2 domains of PtdIns 3-kinase C2α share 58 and 40% sequence identity with those of PtdIns 3-kinase C2β and PtdIns 3-kinase C2γ, respectively, suggesting a similar structure and function of these C2 domains (Fig. 1C). In addition, the mCPK-C2 domain is almost identical to that of the human PtdIns 3-kinase C2α, with only 3 of 136 pairs of residues being non-identical.The Sulfate-binding Sites of the mCPK-C2 Domain—Three sulfate-binding sites are located at the two ends and at the concave region of the β-sandwich of the mCPK-C2 domain (Fig. 2). Each sulfate-binding site is associated with two or three lysine/arginine residues, with a positive electrostatic potential surface on the binding sites (Figs. 1C and 2). Among them, either one or both of the two binding sites on the β3/β4-strands (SBS I) and on the β4′-strand (SBS II) were observed in the reported structures of other C2 domains (20.Sutton R.B.

The three oxygen atoms in the sulfate ion interact with the side chains of these lysine residues. In addition, one of the oxygen atoms also forms a hydrogen bond with the OH group of Tyr-1418. Similar tripod cluster structures formed by three-lysine residues, interacting with a PO43- ion and a PS molecule, were also observed in the structures of the C2 domains of PKCα and PKCβ, respectively (21.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 30.Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).The second sulfate-binding site, SBS II, is located at the CBR end of the β-sandwich (Fig. 2B). This site is located at the dimer interface and is determined by a two-residue cluster (Arg-1439/Lys-1440) on the β4′-strand of both the mCPK-C2 domain and its symmetry-related dimer molecule. Lys-1440 is conserved among the C2 domains of class II PtdIns 3-kinases. A phosphatidylserine molecule was bound to a similar region in the PKCα-C2 domain structure (31.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The third sulfate-binding site, SBS III, is located at the end of the molecule opposite the CBR (Figs. 2C and 4A) and is formed with a lysine (Lys-1457) and an arginine (Arg-1461) at the two ends of an α1 helix. However, both the α1 helix and the two residues defining SBS III are not conserved among other C2 domains of class II PtdIns 3-kinases. Although the three SBSs have positive electrostatic potential surfaces (Fig. 2, D and E), no evidence supports the existence of an extensive and deep binding pocket similar to that observed in the p47phox PX domains (40.Bravo J.

Their bound ligands and/or ions are shown in the same color as the Cα chains. For the structure of the mCPK-C2 domain, every tenth residue and each β-strand are labeled. In addition, the backbone of mCPK-C2 domain is rendered as thick sticks, and the three bound sulfate ions are rendered as ball-and-stick models with the same color coding as in Fig. 1A.

The backbones are shown in the same color as in panel A. The side chains of the residues involved in ligand binding and the bound ligand in the complex structure (sulfate, PS, and phosphate molecule in panels B, C, and D, respectively) are shown with a ball-and-stick model, in which red, blue, gray, and yellow represent the oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur/phosphorus atoms, respectively.

Examination of contacts between two independent molecules reveals two possible dimer interfaces of the mCPK-C2 domains (Fig. 3). One dimerization interface is located at the convex side of the β-sandwich (Fig. 3A) and is stabilized by ionic interactions (Arg-1393/Glu-1496′ and Glu-1496/Arg-1393′), van der Waals interactions (Met-1449/Met-1449′), and hydrogen bonding (Gln-1447/Ser-1453′ and Ser-1453/Gln-1447′). The other dimerization interface is located at the concave side of the β-sandwich (Fig. 3B). Here, the β6-β7 loop of each monomer contacts the concave side of the other molecule.

Processing of COX1 primary transcript requires accessory proteins factors, some of which are encoded by nuclear genes and others by reading frames residing in some of the introns of the COX1 and COB genes. Here we show that the low molecular weight protein product of open reading frame YLR204W, for which we propose the name COX24, is also involved in processing of COX1 RNA intermediates. The growth defect of cox24 mutants is partially rescued in strains harboring mitochondrial DNA lacking introns. Northern blot analyses of mitochondrial transcripts indicate cox24 null mutants to be blocked in processing of introns aI2 and aI3. The dependence of intron aI3 excision on Cox24p is also supported by the growth properties of the cox24 mutant harboring mitochondrial DNA with different intron compositions. The intermediate phenotype of the cox24 mutant in the background of intronless mitochondrial DNA, however, suggests that in addition to its role in splicing of the COX1 pre-mRNA, Cox24p still has another function. Based on the analysis of a cox14-cox24 double mutant, we propose that the other function of Cox24p is related to translation of the COX1 mRNA.

This subunit is encoded by the mitochondrial COX1 gene, which is transcribed as a polycistronic precursor RNA containing COX1, ATP8, ATP6, and ENS2 (10Manon S. Guerin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Most commonly used laboratory strains have a COX1 gene with variable but multiple introns (11Bonitz S.G. Coruzzi G. Thalenfeld B.E. Tzagoloff A. Macino G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11927-11941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aI3, aI4, aI5α, and aI5β introns of COX1 are group I introns, whereas aI1, aI2, and aI5γ belong to group II introns. Both types of introns have the ability to act as mobile elements with the difference that homing of group II introns depends on an RNA intermediate and homing of group I intron is a DNA-based process (12Dujon B. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 82: 91-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 13Lazowska J. Meunier B. Macadre C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4963-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mobility of group I introns is enhanced by endonucleases encoded in the introns themselves. aI3 encodes the I-SceIII endonuclease that cleaves the junction of the two flanking exons, needed for its homing but in addition appears to exert a positive effect in removal of the intron (14Guo W., W.

Excision of some intervening sequences also depends on nuclear genes such as CBP2, and SUV3 and MSS116, the latter two coding for RNA helicases (3Seraphin B. Simon M. Faye G.

Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Suv3p has been implicated in stabilizing the COX1 transcript by regulating turnover of group I intronic RNAs (24Golik P.

Some of the accessory factors appear to have several functions in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. PET309, first isolated as a COX1 translation facilitator, also affects the stability of intron-containing COX1 RNA (4Manthey G.M. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4031-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and was recently found to be associated with CBP1, a cytochrome b RNA stabilization and translation factor (27Krause K. Lopes de Souza R. Roberts D.G. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NAM2/MSL1, the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, is required for excision of the aI4 and bI4 introns of COB (28Herbert C.J. Labouesse M. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Labouesse M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Excision of the aI5β intron of COX1 depends on several nuclear gene products. Already mentioned are the helicases Suv3p and Mss116p. Other factors include Pet54p, Mss18p, and Mrs1p. Pet54p was first characterized as a translational factor for COX3 mRNA (6Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2677-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but was subsequently shown to also play a role in aI5β excision (30Valencik M.L. Kloeckener-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3899-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mrs1p is required for processing of introns bI3 of COB, and aI5β and aI5γ of COX1 (31Bousquet I. Dujardin G. Poyton R.O. Slonimski P.P. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At present the only proteins known to function in processing of a single intron are Mss18p (3Seraphin B. Simon M. Faye G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Cpb2p (23Gampel A. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which target aI5β and bI5, respectively. In the course of analyzing the biochemical defects of the respiratory deficient pet mutant of S. cerevisiae, we identified a new gene, which when mutated causes the accumulation of COX1 intermediates transcripts. This gene has been designated COX24 in keeping with our previous convention for naming genes involved in expression of cytochrome oxidase. COX24 corresponds to reading frame YLR204W and was previously named QRI5 (32Simon M. Della Seta F. Sor F. Faye G. Yeast. 1992; 8: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The phenotype of cox24 mutants and characterization of their mitochondrial RNAs lead us to propose that Cox24p plays an important role in processing of the COX1 primary transcript, but like the other aforementioned processing factors, may have another function as well. Strains and Media—The strains of yeast used in this study are listed in Table 1. The respiratory deficient mutants of complementation group G82 were derived from S. cerevisiae D273-10B/A1 by mutagenesis with nitrosoguanidine or ethyl methanesulfonate (1Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L.

Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 108 cells were transformed with 50 μg of the plasmid library by the method of Beggs (38Beggs J.D. Nature. 1978; 275: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Disruption of COX24—A BamHI-BglII fragment of pG82/T1 containing COX24 was transferred to pUC19. The resultant plasmid (pG82/ST10) was used to replace the COX24 coding sequence with the yeast HIS3 gene. Amplification of pG82/ST10 with bi-directional primers 5-GGCAGATCTGGGCTGTAAAAACCTCTCAC and 5′-GGCAGATCTGTTTATCTCGTTCTGGTGTC resulted in a clean deletion of COX24. The linear product containing COX24 5′- and 3′-flanking regions in pUC19 was digested with BglII and ligated to HIS3 on a 1-kb BamHI fragment. The cox24::HIS3 null allele was recovered from this plasmid as a BamHI-XbaI fragment and was substituted by homologous recombination (39Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) for the wild-type gene in respiratory competent strains W303-1B and W303-1A. Construction of a Hybrid Gene Expressing Cox24p Tagged with a Hemagglutin Epitope at the Carboxyl Terminus—pG82/T1 was used as a PCR template for amplification of the COX24-HA gene coding for Cox24p with 12 carboxyl-terminal residues consisting of three glycine residues as spacers and the hemagglutinin tag (HA). The PCR primers used for amplification were: 5′-GGCGGATC-CGTCCACCTTCGCAATATCTAC and 5′-GGCAAGCTTTCAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACCCTCCTCCTCTACCCTGAGATAGCTTTCT. The PCR product was digested with a combination of BamHI and HindIII, and was cloned in the yeast/E. coli shuttle plasmids YEp352 and YIp352 (40Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) yielding pG82/ST16 and pG82/ST17, respectively. W303ΔCOX24 was transformed either with uncut pG82/ST16 or with pG82/ST17 linearized at the NcoI site of the URA3 marker for integration at the homologous site in chromosomal DNA (39Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous Procedures—Standard methods were used for plasmid manipulations (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The COX24 gene and flanking regions were sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (42Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 49-56Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria were prepared by the method of Faye et al. (43Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except that Zymolyase 20T (ICN Laboratories, Aurora, OH) instead of glusulase was used to obtain spheroplasts. Spectral analyses of mitochondrial cytochromes were performed as described previously (44Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (45Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of COX24—C149 is one of three independent respiratory deficient strains assigned to complementation group G82 of a pet mutant collection (1Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation of the derivative strain C149/L1 with a yeast genomic library yielded a leucine-independent and respiratory competent transformant (C149/L1/T1) that was used to isolate the recombinant plasmid pG82/T1. Complementation tests with subclones containing different regions of the nuclear DNA insert in this plasmid revealed that the gene responsible for restoring respiration in C149/L1 corresponds to reading frame YLR204W on chromosome XII (data not shown). The mutant W303ΔCOX24 harboring a null allele of the gene, henceforth referred to as COX24, was obtained by homologous recombination with a linear fragment of nuclear DNA in which the entire reading frame was replaced with HIS3. The identity of COX24 as the gene responsible for the respiratory defect of C149/L1 was confirmed by the lack of complementation of the point mutant by the null mutant W303ΔCOX24 and the sequence of the gene in C149/L1, which was found to have a single base (guanine) deletion in the codon corresponding to lysine at position 87 of the polypeptide chain. The deletion of this nucleotide creates a stop codon immediately after the mutation, thereby shortening the protein by 24 amino acids. Phenotype of the cox24 Null Mutant—C149/L1 and W303ΔCOX24 exhibit a clear growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources (ethanol/glycerol). The spectrum of mitochondrial cytochromes in the null mutant indicated the presence of a very low level of an “a” type cytochrome with an absorption maximum of the α peak at 595 nm instead of 605 nm, the normal positions of cytochrome a and a3 bands in cytochrome oxidase absorb normally (Fig. 1, A and B). The α absorption band of cytochrome b is also reduced in the mutant but is located at the expected wavelength (560 nm). Despite the reduction of spectrally detectable cytochrome b, in vivo labeling of mitochondrial products indicated normal translation of cytochrome b (Fig. 1C). A partial deficiency of cytochrome b is a common property of COX mutants. In contrast to cytochrome b, translation of Cox1p, Cox2p, and Cox3p, the three mitochondrially encoded subunits of cytochrome oxidase, was reduced. This was most evident for Cox1p, which was present in only trace amounts in the mutant. Subunit 6 (Atp6p) of the ATPase was normally translated (Fig. 1C), ruling out a defect in transcription or processing of the large polycistronic precursor RNA containing COX1, ATP8, and ATP6 (10Manon S. Guerin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The steady-state concentrations of COX subunits in the cox24 null mutant were examined by Western blot analysis with antibodies against Cox1p, Cox2p, and Cox3p, and the nuclear encoded subunits Cox4p and Cox5p. Of these five constituents, Cox1p and Cox2p were reduced to barely detectable levels in the mutant. A very substantial decrease was also seen in Cox3p. Both Cox4p and Cox5p were reduced but to a lesser extent (Fig. 1D). This pattern is characteristic of most mutants that fail to form functional COX, independent of whether the block occurs at a pre- or post-translation step of the assembly pathway (46Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). W303ΔCOX24 gives rise to revertants with growth properties on non-fermentable substrates intermediate between wild-type and the mutant. Although the suppressor mutation(s) has been ascertained to be in mtDNA, for unknown reasons we have not been able to map the mutations by deletion analysis with cytoplasmic petites obtained from several such revertants. The partial restoration of growth of one such revertant (W303ΔCOX24/R2) correlates with an increase in the mitochondrial steady-state concentration of Cox1p (Fig. 1D). Phenotype of a cox24 Mutant with Intronless Mitochondrial DNA—The lesion in the cox24 mutant appeared most likely to be in processing and/or translation of Cox1p. The parental W303 strains into which the cox24 null allele was introduced have mitochondrial genomes with COX1 introns aI1-aI4 and aI5γ (47Muroff I. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2765-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To probe the possible involvement of Cox24p in intron processing, the cox24 null mutation was transferred to a strain lacking mitochondrial introns by a cross of W303ΔCOX24/ρ0 (a cox24 null mutant lacking mitochondrial DNA) to the intronless strain W303/I0. Diploid cells issued from the cross yielded meiotic progeny with the cox24 null allele in an intronless mitochondrial background (aW303ΔCOX24/I0 and W303ΔCOX24/I0). These strains were able to grow on non-fermentable substrates (YPEG), albeit not as well as the wild-type strains W303-1A or W303-1A/I0 (Fig. 2A). Growth of W303ΔCOX24/I0 on glycerol/ethanol correlated with a partial restoration of Cox1p translation (Fig. 1C). Western analysis of mitochondria with a polyclonal antibody against Cox1p indicated a substantial increase in the steady-state concentration of this subunit in the mutant cells (Fig. 2B). Paradoxically, a Cox1p monoclonal antibody detected only trace amounts of Cox1p, even at very high loading of mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the Cox1p produced in W303ΔCOX24/I0 may be different from the normal protein. COX1 Transcript Processing in cox24 Mutants—The partial rescue of the cox24 null mutation in a strain with intronless mtDNA pointed to a role of Cox24p in processing of the COX1 pre-mRNA. This is supported by the mitochondrial COX1 transcripts present in wild-type and mutant strains harboring mtDNAs with or without introns (Fig. 3A). Northern blots of total mitochondrial RNA hybridized to a probe from exon aE4 of COX1 indicated the accumulation of partially processed COX1 RNA intermediates in the cox24 null mutant with the original intron-containing mtDNA. In this background the mature COX1 mRNA was not detected. As expected, COX1 processing intermediates were absent in the wild-type or cox24 mutant with the intronless genome. In this background the only COX1 transcript detected by the probe had a size corresponding to the mature mRNA. This reinforces the conclusion that the cox24 mutation does not affect endonucleolytic cleavage of the primary polycistronic transcript. Northern blots of the same RNAs with an exon probe from the cytochrome b (COB) gene revealed the presence in the cox24 mutant of the mature size of COB mRNA. Although there was some accumulation of COB precursor transcripts in the mutant, the mRNA concentration was not appreciably less than in the wild type (Fig. 3B). The presence of the processed COB mRNA in the mutant is consistent with the in vivo labeling results showing normal translation of cytochrome b (Fig. 1C) and support a role of Cox24p confined to processing of the COX1 pre-mRNA. The function of Cox24p in splicing of the COX1 precursor was assessed by hybridization of total mitochondrial RNAs with probes from introns aI1, aI2, aI3, aI4, and aI5γ. The results of these Northern analyses indicated that the cox24 mutant is able to splice group II introns aI1 and aI5γ. Both introns are stable and accumulate in the wild-type and mutant (Fig. 4). The concentration of aI2, the third stable group II intron of COX1, is significantly lower in the mutant and is present at nearly wild-type levels in the revertant W303ΔCOX24/R2. The results with probes against group I introns aI3 and aI4 are more difficult to interpret because the excised products are unstable and normally are degraded. The aI4 probe detected high molecular weight pre-cursors that are much less abundant in wild type and are substantially reduced in the revertant. In the case of the aI3 probe, several of the partially processed intermediates seen in wild type are absent in the mutant but are partially restored in the revertant (Fig. 4). These results point to multiple roles of Cox24p in COX1 mRNA processing, including excision of both group I and group II introns. Suppression of the cox24 Null Mutant by mtDNA with Different Intron Compositions—The COX1 processing defect was also tested by examining the suppressor activities of mitochondrial genomes differing in their intron compositions. These were introduced into a ρ0 derivative of the cox24 null mutant by cytoduction (49Conde J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3651-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). As might be predicted, the absence of COB introns did not relieve the respiratory deficiency of the mutant (CK5112 in Fig. 5). This was also true of the cox24 mutant with a COX1 gene lacking the aI4 intron (WIO4). The cox24 mutant, however, was partially rescued by mtDNA lacking introns aI1, aI2, aI3, and aI5γ (GF134-6D). These results are consistent with Northern hybridizations with intron-specific probes, indicating impaired processing of aI2 and aI3 in the mutant (Fig. 4). Cox1p Expression Is Inhibited in a cox14-cox24 Double Mutant—The incomplete suppression of the cox24 mutant by a mitochondrial genome devoid of introns suggested that in addition to transcript processing Cox24p may have another function, either in translation or assembly of cytochrome oxidase. Mutations in genes required for maturation of the COX1 precursor transcript or translation of the mRNA display the absence of Cox1p among the normal complement of mitochondrial translation products. Translation of Cox1p is also compromised by mutations that prevent assembly of the subunits into the functional complex (36Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Cox1p, in all such assembly defective mutants can be rescued when the original mutation is combined with a cox14 null mutation (36Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This circumstance permits mutations that prevent formation or translation of the Cox1p mRNA to be discriminated from mutations affecting a post-translational assembly step. A regulatory model of Cox1p translation has been invoked to explain the epistatic effect of the cox14 mutation over other mutations affecting post-translational events in COX assembly (36Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This experimental paradigm was used to examine expression of Cox1p in a cox24-cox14 double mutant with intronless mtDNA. The results of in vivo translation assays indicated that not only did inclusion of the cox14 mutation fail to enhance Cox1p synthesis over and above that seen in the single"
