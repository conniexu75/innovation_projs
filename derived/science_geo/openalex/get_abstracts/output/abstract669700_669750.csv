https://openalex.org/W3134895645,"Objective To describe how men and women divided childcare and housework demands during the height of the first Covid-19 lockdown in the UK, and whether these divisions were associated with worsening mental health during the pandemic. Background School closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, which draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. Methods Data come from the wave 9 (2017–19) of Understanding Society and the following April (n = 15,426) and May (n = 14,150) waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at both before and during the lockdown, and unpaid care work was measured during the lockdown. Linear regression models were used. Results Women spent much more time on unpaid care work than men during lockdown, and it was more likely to be the mother than the father who reduced working hours or changed employment schedules due to increased time on childcare. Women who spent long hours on housework and childcare were more likely to report increased levels of psychological distress. Working parents who adapted their work patterns increased more psychological distress than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Fathers increased more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. Conclusion There are continued gender inequalities in divisions of unpaid care work. Juggling home working with homeschooling and childcare as well as extra housework is likely to lead to poor mental health for people with families, particularly for lone mothers."

New strategies to focus the humoral immune response to conserved regions on influenza antigens are therefore required for recognition by broadly neutralizing antibodies. It has been suggested that B-cells with receptors that recognize conserved epitopes would be preferentially stimulated through avidity effects by mosaic particles presenting multiple forms of a variable antigen. We adapted SpyCatcher-based platforms, AP205 virus-like particles (VLPs) and mi3 nanoparticles (NPs), to covalently co-display SpyTagged hemagglutinin (HA) trimers from group 1 and group 2 influenza A strains. Here we show successful homotypic and heterotypic conjugation of up to 8 different HA trimers to both VLPs and NPs. We characterized the HA-VLPs and HA-NPs by cryo-electron tomography to derive the average number of conjugated HAs and their separation distances on particles, and compared immunizations of mosaic and homotypic particles in wild-type mice. Both types of HA particles elicited strong antibody responses, but the mosaic particles did not consistently elicit broader immune responses than mixtures of homotypic particles. We conclude that covalent attachment of HAs from currently-circulating influenza strains represents a viable alternative to current annual influenza vaccine strategies, but in the absence of further modifications, is unlikely to represent a method for making a universal influenza vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W3134087101,"Purpose To investigate the comparative efficacy of intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy alone with that of IPL plus meibomian gland expression (MGX) for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Methods This is a prospective randomized crossover clinical trial. Sixty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups. All of patients underwent four treatment sessions in total, which were two weeks apart. Group 1 underwent two sessions of IPL therapy with MGX, as well as two sessions of IPL alone. Group 2 received two sessions of IPL therapy alone, and two sessions of IPL therapy with MGX. The following parameters were measured at baseline (BL), 2 weeks after the second treatment session (FU1), and 2 weeks after the fourth treatment session (FU2): tearfilm break-up time (BUT), Oxford grade for corneal staining, meibomian gland expressibility (MGE), meibum quality (MQ), and ocular surface disease index (OSDI). The separate effect of MGX on improvement of MGD parameters was evaluated using generalized estimating equation (GEE). Results The mean age of the participants was 57.52 ± 10.50 years. The BUT, Oxford grade, MGE, MQ, and OSDI of both groups improved significantly (from baseline) by the end of four treatment sessions (FU2 compared to BL; all p-values &lt;0.05). The MGE and MQ significantly improved after the first and second treatment sessions (FU1 compare to BL; all p-values &lt; 0.001). However, the improvement was not statistically significant after the third and fourth treatment sessions (FU2 compared to FU1; p-value of 0.388 for MGE and 0.645 for MQ in group 1, 0.333 for MGE and 0.333 for MQ in group 2). The IPL plus MGX therapy produced greater improvements in the BUT scores than did IPL therapy alone (p = 0.003 by GEE). In contrast, the Oxford grade, MGE, MQ, and OSDI were not influenced by the addition of MGX to IPL (p = 0.642, 0.663, 0.731, and 0.840, respectively by GEE). Conclusion IPL therapy effectively improves the subjective symptoms and objective ocular findings of MGD. MGX enhanced the improvement of BUT driven by IPL therapy. The meibomian gland function (MGE and MQ) recovers faster in response to IPL therapy than did the other parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3135716486,"Histamine, which is mainly produced by mast cells and basophils, participates in various allergic symptoms, and some studies have reported that macrophages also produce histamine. Moreover, recent studies have revealed that macrophages, especially alternatively activated macrophages (M2) induced by T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, participate in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. The major source of Th2 cytokines is antigen-specific Th2 cells. To elucidate the relationship between histamine, macrophages, and Th2 cells in allergic inflammation, we established a macrophage-Th2 cell co-culture model in vitro and an antigen-specific Th2 cell transfer mouse model of rhinitis. In vitro analyses indicated that macrophages produce histamine by interacting with antigen-specific Th2 cells through the antigen. Furthermore, Th2 cells and macrophages cooperatively elicited rhinitis in the mouse model. We determined that histamine induces Th2- and macrophage-elicited sneezing responses through H1 receptor signaling, whereas it induces nasal eosinophil infiltrations through H4 receptor signaling. Collectively, these results indicate a novel histamine production mechanism by macrophages, in which Th2 cells and macrophages cooperatively induce nasal allergic inflammation through histamine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3134681765,"Background A diverse and abundant gut microbiome can improve cancer patients’ treatment response; however, the effect of pelvic chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on gut diversity and composition is unclear. The purpose of this prospective study was to identify changes in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome during and after pelvic CRT. Materials and methods Rectal swabs from 58 women with cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer from two institutions were prospectively analyzed before CRT (baseline), during CRT (weeks 1, 3, and 5), and at first follow-up (week 12) using 16Sv4 rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA marker gene. 42 of these patients received antibiotics during the study period. Observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs; representative of richness) and Shannon, Simpson, Inverse Simpson, and Fisher diversity indices were used to characterize alpha (within-sample) diversity. Changes over time were assessed using a paired t-test, repeated measures ANOVA, and linear mixed modeling. Compositional changes in specific bacteria over time were evaluated using linear discriminant analysis effect size. Results Gut microbiome richness and diversity levels continually decreased throughout CRT (mean Shannon diversity index, 2.52 vs. 2.91; all P &lt;0.01), but were at or near baseline levels in 60% of patients by week 12. Patients with higher gut diversity at baseline had the steepest decline in gut microbiome diversity. Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered during CRT, with increases in Proteobacteria and decreases in Clostridiales, but adapted after CRT, with increases in Bacteroides species. Conclusion After CRT, the diversity of the gut microbiomes in this population tended to return to baseline levels by the 12 week follow-up period, but structure and composition remained significantly altered. These changes should be considered when designing studies to analyze the gut microbiome in patients who receive pelvic CRT for gynecologic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3133731447,"The world is facing the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which began in China. By August 18, 2020, the United States, Brazil, and India were the most affected countries. Health infrastructure and socioeconomic vulnerabilities may be affecting the response capacities of these countries. We compared official indicators to identify which vulnerabilities better determined the exposure risk to COVID-19 in both the most and least affected countries. To achieve this purpose, we collected indicators from the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, and the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE). All indicators were normalized to facilitate comparisons. Speed, incidence, and population were used to identify the groups of countries with the highest and lowest risks of infection. Countries’ response capacities were determined based on socioeconomic, political, and health infrastructure conditions. Vulnerabilities were identified based on the indicator sensitivity. The highest-risk group included the U.S., Brazil, and India, whereas the lowest-risk group (with the largest population by continent) consisted of China, New Zealand, and Germany. The high-sensitivity cluster had 18 indicators (50% extra IDVI), such as merchandise trade, immunization, public services, maternal mortality, life expectancy at birth, hospital beds, GINI index, adolescent fertility, governance, political stability, transparency/corruption, industry, and water supply. The greatest vulnerability of the highest-risk group was related first to economic factors (merchandise trade), followed by public health (immunization), highlighting global dependence on Chinese trade, such as protective materials, equipment, and diagnostic tests. However, domestic political factors had more indicators, beginning with high sensitivity and followed by healthcare and economic conditions, which signified a lesser capacity to guide, coordinate, and supply the population with protective measures, such as social distancing."
https://openalex.org/W3134859377,"Valvular heart diseases are a prevalent cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting a wide spectrum of the population. In-silico modeling of the cardiovascular system has recently gained recognition as a useful tool in cardiovascular research and clinical applications. Here, we present an in-silico cardiac computational model to analyze the effect and severity of valvular disease on general hemodynamic parameters. We propose a multimodal and multiscale cardiovascular model to simulate and understand the progression of valvular disease associated with the mitral valve. The developed model integrates cardiac electrophysiology with hemodynamic modeling, thus giving a broader and holistic understanding of the effect of disease progression on various parameters like ejection fraction, cardiac output, blood pressure, etc., to assess the severity of mitral valve disorders, naming Mitral Stenosis and Mitral Regurgitation . The model mimics an adult cardiovascular system, comprising a four-chambered heart with systemic, pulmonic circulation. The simulation of the model output comprises regulated pressure, volume, and flow for each heart chamber, valve dynamics, and Photoplethysmogram signal for normal physiological as well as pathological conditions due to mitral valve disorders. The generated physiological parameters are in agreement with published data. Additionally, we have related the simulated left atrium and ventricle dimensions, with the enlargement and hypertrophy in the cardiac chambers of patients with mitral valve disorders, using their Electrocardiogram available in Physionet PTBI dataset. The model also helps to create ‘what if’ scenarios and relevant analysis to study the effect in different hemodynamic parameters for stress or exercise like conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3134821432,"Head and neck cancer is a deadly cancer that ranks among the six most common cancers worldwide. The HPV vaccine has been used to prevent head and neck cancer of the oropharynx, and changes in health policies and state law are impacting the role of dental professionals in HPV vaccination. However, relatively little is known about dental professionals' attitudes regarding the vaccine.Our study assesses dental professionals' willingness to administer the HPV vaccine, their confidence discussing HPV with patients, beliefs about the vaccine's efficacy, perceived barriers to administering it, and sites of referral.We surveyed 623 dental professionals, including dentists, hygienists, dental students, and hygiene students across Michigan. Attitudes toward the vaccine and predictive characteristics were evaluated by logistic regression, ANOVAs, and t-tests.The majority of the respondents (51% of dentists, 63% of hygienists, 82% of dental students, and 71% of hygiene students) were willing to administer the HPV vaccine if allowed by law. The role of dental and dental hygiene students would be one of advocacy, educating and recommending the vaccine, and the dental students administering it once licensed. Dental professionals were variably confident discussing HPV with patients and generally believed it enhanced patients' health. Stronger confidence and beliefs were associated with greater willingness to administer the vaccine. Barriers among professionals opposing the HPV vaccine included lack of knowledge on the subject, liability concerns, and personal beliefs.Dental professionals can become leaders in preventing HPV-related cancers. Training and continuing education courses could enhance their confidence and willingness to recommend and administer the HPV vaccine.Legislation that permits dental professionals to administer the vaccine could increase the vaccine's accessibility to patients, improve vaccination rates, and population health."
https://openalex.org/W3135207588,"Lack of tools for detailed, real-time observation of mosquito behavior with high spatio-temporal resolution limits progress towards improved malaria vector control. We deployed a high-resolution entomological lidar to monitor a half-kilometer static transect positioned over rice fields outside a Tanzanian village. A quarter of a million in situ insect observations were classified, and several insect taxa were identified based on their modulation signatures. We observed distinct range distributions of male and female mosquitoes in relation to the village periphery, and spatio-temporal behavioral features, such as swarming. Furthermore, we observed that the spatial distributions of males and females change independently of each other during the day, and were able to estimate the daily dispersal of mosquitoes towards and away from the village. The findings of this study demonstrate how lidar-based monitoring could dramatically improve our understanding of malaria vector ecology and control options."
https://openalex.org/W3134586117,"Purpose We addressed prevalence and factors associated with mental health outcomes (suicidal behavior and psychological distress) among Asian Americans (AA), who identify as transgender, a key group among sexual and gender minorities that is overlooked and understudied. Methods We used data from 2015 United States Transgender Survey during 2019–2020 with our population as census defined AA. Outcomes included suicidal ideation, suicidal thoughts, and serious psychological distress (SPD). Independent variables included any abuse, partner abuse, bathroom-related abuse, and additional covariates. Adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (aOR; 95% CI) for each outcome are adjusted for age, marital status, citizenship status, education level, employment status, as well as poverty status. Results Nearly 67% reported experiencing any abuse, 52% reported abuse from romantic/sexual partner(s), while 29% reported harassment/abuse when trying to use bathrooms. Moreover, 82% reported suicidal thoughts, 40% reported suicidal attempts, and 39% had SPD. Results demonstrated that any abuse/violence had higher odds of suicidal thoughts (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI):[1.98–3.58], suicidal attempts (aOR = 2.83, 95% CI:[2.18–3.68]), and SPD (aOR = 1.56, 95% CI:[1.20, 2.04]). Abuse from romantic/sexual partners had higher odds of suicidal thoughts (aOR = 2.47, 95% CI:[1.76–3.47]), suicidal attempts (aOR = 2.17, 95% CI:[1.68–2.80]), and SPD (aOR = 2.72, 95% CI:[2.03–3.63]). Experience of harassment/abuse during bathroom use had increased odds of suicidal attempts (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI:[1.41–2.31]). Conclusion Exposure to violence is common among AA transgender individuals and related to negative mental health outcomes. Initiatives to reduce exposure to abuse and providing resources for trauma-informed care are imperative to improve health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3135208125,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a respiratory disease frequently requiring hospital admission, and a significant cause of death worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of clinical indicators. A prospective, multi-center study was conducted (January 2017-December 2018) where patient demographic and clinical data were recorded (N = 366). The 30-day mortality rate was 5.46%. Cox Regression analyses showed that serum albumin (ALB) and respiratory rate (RR) were independent prognostic variables for 30-day survival in patients with CAP. Albumin negatively correlated with the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB-65 scores using Pearson and Spearman tests. Survival curves showed that a RR >24 breaths/min or ALB ≤30 g/L were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) for predicting 30-day mortality in patients with CAP was 0.762, 0.763, 0.790, and 0.784 for ALB, RR, PSI, and CURB-65, respectively. The AUC for the prediction of 30-day mortality using ALB combined with PSI, CURB-65 scores, and RR was 0.822 (95% CI 0.731-0.912), 0.847 (95% CI 0.755-0.938), and 0.847 (95% CI 0.738-0.955), respectively. Albumin and RR were found to be reliable prognostic factors for CAP. This combination showed equal predictive value when compared to adding ALB assessment to PSI and CURB-65 scores, which could improve their prognostic accuracy."

Among this class, cysteine dioxygenases (CDOs) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid dioxygenases (3MDOs) are the best characterized, and the mode of substrate binding for CDOs is well understood. However, the manner in which 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3MPA) coordinates to the nonheme iron site in 3MDO remains a matter of debate. A model for bidentate 3MPA coordination at the 3MDO Fe-site has been proposed on the basis of computational docking, whereas steady-state kinetics and EPR spectroscopic measurements suggest a thiolate-only coordination of the substrate. To address this gap in knowledge, we determined the structure of Azobacter vinelandii 3MDO (Av3MDO) in complex with the substrate analog and competitive inhibitor, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HPA). The structure together with DFT computational modeling demonstrates that 3HPA and 3MPA associate with iron as chelate complexes with the substrate-carboxylate group forming an additional interaction with Arg168 and the thiol bound at the same position as in CDO. A chloride ligand was bound to iron in the coordination site assigned as the O2-binding site. Supporting HYSCORE spectroscopic experiments were performed on the (3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO iron nitrosyl (S = 3/2) site. In combination with spectroscopic simulations and optimized DFT models, this work provides an experimentally verified model of the Av3MDO enzyme–substrate complex, effectively resolving a debate in the literature regarding the preferred substrate-binding denticity.

Both kinetic and spectroscopic studies demonstrate additional interactions between the CYS-bound Fe-site and outer sphere residues (Tyr157 and Arg60) within the CDO active site (27Driggers C.M.

These multiple points of interaction are likely responsible for the high substrate specificity exhibited by this enzyme (35Li W. Pierce B.S. Steady-state substrate specificity and O2-coupling efficiency of mouse cysteine dioxygenase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2015; 565: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To illustrate, cysteamine [2-aminoethanethiol, (CA)] is structurally similar to CYS, lacking only the α-carboxylate group. It is therefore reasonable that this substrate analogue could coordinate to the CDO Fe-site in a similar bidentate fashion as CYS. However, relative to CYS, a 10,000-fold decrease in kcat/KM was reported in steady-state reactions with CA (35Li W. Pierce B.S. Steady-state substrate specificity and O2-coupling efficiency of mouse cysteine dioxygenase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2015; 565: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, removal of the CYS carboxylate has a profound impact on the formation of the CDO ES complex. More dramatically, no activity whatsoever is observed in reactions with similarly sized thiol substrates lacking an amine functional group. This observation demonstrates that coordination of the substrate amine to the CDO Fe-site is required for activity. By contrast, 3MDO (Fig. 1B) is capable of accommodating a variety of thiol-bearing substrates, such as 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3MPA), CYS, and CA to catalyze dioxygenation over a broad pH range (10Fellner M.

While a modest decrease in kcat is observed in reactions with CA [0.29 ± 0.08 s−1] relative to 3MPA and CYS [1.0 ± 0.1 s−1], the vast difference in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) identifies 3MPA as the preferred substrate for MDO (14Pierce B.S. Subedi B.P. Sardar S. Crowell J.K.

Since 3MPA lacks an amine functional group, the first coordination sphere for the Av3MDO Fe-site cannot be equivalent to CDO. To date, structures for the 3MPA-bound enzyme have been unavailable; however, two models for substrate binding at the Fe-site have been proposed. A bidentate model for 3MPA coordination to the Fe-site via substrate thiol and carboxylate functional groups was recently proposed by Jameson and Karplus (9Aloi S. Davies C.G. Karplus P.A. Wilbanks S.M. Jameson G.N.L. Substrate specificity in thiol dioxygenases.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 2398-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this report, docking of 3MPA into the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3MDO (Pa3MDO) crystal structure led to the conclusion that a salt bridge formed between the Arg168 guanidinium group and 3MPA carboxylate was catalytically essential (9Aloi S. Davies C.G. Karplus P.A. Wilbanks S.M. Jameson G.N.L. Substrate specificity in thiol dioxygenases.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 2398-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Fellner M. Aloi S. Tchesnokov E.P. Wilbanks S.M. Jameson G.N.L. Substrate and pH-dependent kinetic profile of 3-mercaptopropionate dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Structurally, this model closely matches the CYS-bound mammalian CDO, although the relevant Arg group is in a position nonhomologous to that of mammalian CDO. The proposed salt bridge provided a reasonable explanation for the decreased affinity of the enzyme for amino-bearing substrates. However, the instability of Pa3MDO Arg168 variants precluded experimental validation of this model by site-directed mutagenesis. Alternatively, we have previously argued that 3MPA Fe-coordination occurs via thiolate only based on the results of two key experiments (12Sardar S. Weitz A. Hendrich M.P. Pierce B.S. Outer-sphere tyrosine 159 within the 3-mercaptopropionic acid dioxygenase S-H-Y motif gates substrate-coordination denticity at the non-heme iron active site.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 5135-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). First, pH-dependent kinetic data for Av3MDO-catalyzed reactions with a substrate lacking a carboxyl group (cysteamine, CA) reveal only a modest decrease in kcat-values [v0/[E], 0.29 ± 0.08 s−1] relative to reactions performed with 3MPA and CYS [1.0–1.2 s−1] (14Pierce B.S. Subedi B.P. Sardar S. Crowell J.K. The “Gln-type” thiol dioxygenase from Azotobacter vinelandii is a 3-mercaptopropionic acid dioxygenase.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 7477-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since both CDO and 3MDO exhibit an obligate-ordered binding of organic substrate prior to molecular oxygen, we conclude that Fe-coordination of the substrate–carboxylate group is not required to produce the O2-activating enzyme–substrate (ES) complex. Second, experiments using the O2-mimetic nitric oxide corroborate this argument. EPR spectroscopy verifies formation of a substrate-bound iron-nitrosyl species using thiol substrates lacking carboxylate groups [such as CA and ethanethiol (ET)] (14Pierce B.S. Subedi B.P. Sardar S. Crowell J.K. The “Gln-type” thiol dioxygenase from Azotobacter vinelandii is a 3-mercaptopropionic acid dioxygenase.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 7477-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, direct Fe-coordination of a substrate carboxylate is not required for converting the Fe(II) site into an NO-reactive state. These results clearly demonstrate that direct carboxylate coordination to the iron center is not obligatory to trigger oxygen activation. In order to address this discrepancy in 3MDO substrate-binding models, we present the structure of Av3MDO in complex with the substrate analog and competitive inhibitor, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HPA). Using the Av3MDO-3HPA complex as a starting point, density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed to model the coordination of the native 3MPA substrate. Supporting HYSCORE experiments performed on the (3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO confirm the NO-binding site and corroborate bidentate 3MPA coordination in the substrate-bound iron-nitrosyl site. As suggested by Jameson and Karplus, these experiments support bidentate coordination of 3MPA with the substrate carboxylate group forming an additional interaction with Arg168 and the thiol bound at the same position as CDO. Following extensive sparse matrix screening, we identified a condition giving rise to well-diffracting, rod-shaped Av3MDO crystals. The optimized crystals diffracted X-rays to ∼2.2 Å resolution and belonged to space group P31 (Table S1). Structure determination was initially complicated by the presence of tetartohedral twinning and pseudosymmetry (see Experimental procedures section for further details), but eventually the structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined against reflections extending to 2.25 Å resolution (Table S1). The polypeptide is clearly resolved except for the extreme N- and C termini, which are omitted from the final model. The asymmetric unit of the Av3MDO crystals consists of 12 monomers arranged in pairs of C2 symmetric dimers. The moderately hydrophobic dimer interface buries an average of ∼1260 Å2 (1199–1322 Å2 depending on the specific dimer pair) or ∼13% of the total monomer surface area (39Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) and is structurally similar to the dimers observed for 3MDOs from other bacteria (11Tchesnokov E.P. Fellner M. Siakkou E.

This finding contrasts with cysteine dioxygenases, which are monomeric proteins (37McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr., G.N.

Av3MDO exhibits the classic thiol dioxygenase cupin fold consisting of three N-terminal alpha-helices followed by a series of 11 β-strands forming the cupin β-barrel structure that houses the enzymatic active site (Fig. 2A). Owing to the near uniformity in structure between the 12 monomers (Cα RMSD <0.4 Å), chain B was used as the representative monomer for structural comparisons. Among 3MDOs of known structure, Av3MDO exhibits greatest sequence and structural similarity to the 3MDO enzyme from P. aeruginosa (Pa3MDO, PDB accession code: 4TLF) with 70% sequence identity and a Cα RMSD of ∼1 Å. The largest main chain difference is found within the Leu113-Leu117 β hairpin where the insertion of an Arg in Pa3MDO results in a 5.8 Å shift at the tips of the β hairpins (Fig. 2B, asterisk). Like in Pa3MDO and other thiol dioxygenases (11Tchesnokov E.P. Fellner M. Siakkou E. Kleffmann T. Martin L.W. Aloi S. Lamont I.L. Wilbanks S.M. Jameson G.N.L.

Although the Av3MDO sample used for crystallization was ∼36% loaded with iron, the iron B-factors are similar to those of the surrounding His ligands when the metal is modeled at full occupancy, indicating the metal-loaded enzyme selectively crystallized (Table S1). Additionally, the metal is modeled as an Fe(III) ion given that a bulk of the iron in the enzyme sample used for crystallization was in the ferric oxidation state. However, some portion of the iron may have been photoreduced to Fe(II) during data collection. Analysis of residual electron density maps revealed two strong features near the Av3MDO iron center, which could not be successfully modeled with aquo ligands as was the case for Pa3MDO (11Tchesnokov E.P.

In this study, we analyzed 129 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses of a Canadian population during early phase of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three major paths of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into Canada. Twenty-one substitutions that have frequencies greater than 3% of viral population were identified. Analysis of these substitutions indicated that P1427I (ORF1b), Y1464C (ORF1b), and Q57H (ORF3a) might affect functions of the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins. Additionally, we found the evidence of positive selection on the ORF3a and codon 614 of Spike protein, suggesting the viral components responsible for host entry and activation of inflammation response were targeted by host immune responses. The study showed genomic variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a Canadian population. These information may help develop preventive strategies and be used for further study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutics development."

This present research intends to identify the function of lncRNA LINC00857/miR-340-5p/Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) in the progression of PAAD.Bioinformatics analysis was used to explore the differentially expressed lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA and analyze the relationship between lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA expression and prognosis of PAAD by enquiring TCGA, GEO and GTEX. KEGG pathway analysis and GO enrichment analysis were implemented to annotate the crucial genes regulated by LINC00857. The biological behaviors of PAAD cells were detected by CCK-8, colony formation and transwell assays. Interactive associations between LINC00857 and miR-340-5p, as well as miR-340-5p and TGFA were analyzed by dual luciferase assay.By enquiring TCGA database, we got that LINC00857 was highly expressed in patients with PAAD and positively associated with worse prognosis in PAAD patients. Moreover, LINC00857 upregulation promoted the proliferation and clone formation abilities of PAAD cells. Afterwards, the downstream miRNA and mRNA targets of LINC00857 were picked up to construct a ceRNA network. Further study revealed that TGFA expression was positively regulated by LINC00857 and negatively regulated by miR-340-5p. Besides that, the inhibitory effect of miR-340-5p on PAAD cells growth and movement can be blocked by LINC00857 upregulation. While, the malignant behavior of PAAD cells induced by TGFA overexpression can be eliminated by LINC00857 knockdown.Upregulation of LINC00857 improved growth, invasion and migration abilities of PAAD cells by modulation of miR-340-5p/TGFA, affording potential targets and biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3135070364,"Brood parasitized and/or colonial birds use egg features as visual identity signals, which allow parents to recognize their own eggs and avoid paying fitness costs of misdirecting their care to others' offspring. However, the mechanisms of egg recognition and discrimination are poorly understood. Most studies have put their focus on individual abilities to carry out these behavioural tasks, while less attention has been paid to the egg and how its signals may evolve to enhance its identification. We used 92 clutches (460 eggs) of the Eurasian coot Fulica atra to test whether eggs could be correctly classified into their corresponding clutches based only on their external appearance. Using SpotEgg, we characterized the eggs in 27 variables of colour, spottiness, shape and size from calibrated digital images. Then, we used these variables in a supervised machine learning algorithm for multi-class egg classification, where each egg was classified to the best matched clutch out of 92 studied clutches. The best model with all 27 explanatory variables assigned correctly 53.3% (CI = 42.6-63.7%) of eggs of the test-set, greatly exceeding the probability to classify the eggs by chance (1/92, 1.1%). This finding supports the hypothesis that eggs have visual identity signals in their phenotypes. Simplified models with fewer explanatory variables (10 or 15) showed lesser classification ability than full models, suggesting that birds may use multiple traits for egg recognition. Therefore, egg phenotypes should be assessed in their full complexity, including colour, patterning, shape and size. Most important variables for classification were those with the highest intraclutch correlation, demonstrating that individual recognition traits are repeatable. Algorithm classification performance improved by each extra training egg added to the model. Thus, repetition of egg design within a clutch would reinforce signals and would help females to create an internal template for true recognition of their own eggs. In conclusion, our novel approach based on machine learning provided important insights on how signallers broadcast their specific signature cues to enhance their recognisability."
https://openalex.org/W3135689813,"Background There are currently 1.5 million indigenous people in Bangladesh, constituting 1.8% of the total population and representing one of the country’s most deprived communities. This study explores the health status and quality of life along with their determinants among indigenous older people in Bangladesh in order to fill the knowledge and evidence gap on this topic. Methods A mixed-methods approach was deployed in October 2019 in the Sylhet division of Bangladesh which involved a cross-sectional survey among 400 indigenous older adults (200 males, 200 females) from 8 tea gardens using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Ten in-depth interviews were also conducted with providers of the tea garden health facilities. Descriptive analysis, multiple logistic and multi-nominal linear regression were performed to explore associated factors around health and quality of life. Results Of the total respondents, the majority (79.5%) had chronic diseases, with visual difficulty being predominant (74%) among the conditions. Almost all (94%) of the respondents experienced delays in receiving treatment and poverty was identified by most (85%) as the primary cause of those delays. Extreme age, being male, living alone and low family income were significantly associated with suffering from chronic conditions. Furthermore, having a chronic condition and extreme age were found to be significantly associated with a low quality of life. Health service providers identified lack of logistical support in the health facilities, the economic crisis and lack of awareness as the major causes of poor health status and poor health seeking behaviour of the indigenous older adults. Conclusion Indigenous older men in extreme old age are more vulnerable to adverse health conditions and poor quality of life. Health literacy and health seeking behaviour is poor among indigenous older adults generally and there is a huge gap in the health services and social supports available to them."

A pool experiment was conducted to test the effect of distance (1, 2, 3 or 5 m), angle of incidence (AOI; 0° to 40° at 5° increments), and SC baseline distance (BD; BD1 = 406, BD2 = 610, and BD3 = 762 mm camera separation) on the accuracy and precision of fish model length (288, 552, or 890 mm fork length) estimates compared to a red laser scaler (RLS). A field experiment was then conducted at 20 reef sites with SCs positioned at BD1 to compare fish length distribution estimates between the SC and RLS systems under in situ conditions. In the pool experiment, mean percent errors were consistently within the a priori selected threshold of ±5% at AOIs ≤10° at all distances with all four systems. However, SCs produced accurate estimates at AOIs up to 30° at all distances tested; 2-3 m was optimal. During reef site surveys, SCs collected 10.4 times as many length estimates from 4.3 times as many species compared to the RLS. Study results demonstrate that, compared to laser scalers, ROV-based SC systems can substantially increase the number of available fish length estimates by producing accurate length estimates at a wider range of target orientations while also enabling measurements from a greater portion of the cameras' field of view."
https://openalex.org/W3134217401,"Introduction With over 500 000 infections and nearly 12 000 deaths, South Africa (SA) is the African epicenter of the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. SA has implemented a 5-stage Risk-Adjusted Strategy which includes a phased national lockdown, requiring social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing face masks. Strict adherence to this strategy is crucial to reducing COVID-19 transmission, flattening the curve, and preventing resurgence. As part of the 22-country International Citizens Project COVID-19 (ICPcovid), this study aimed to describe the SA adherence to the Risk-Adjusted Strategy and identify determinants of adherence. Method During 24 April-15 May 2020, people were electronically invited, through social media platforms and a text blast, to complete an online survey, accessible via www.icpcovid.com . The survey investigated COVID-19 testing and preventative adherence measures, then used logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of adherence. Results There were 951 participants, with 731(76.9%) 25 to 54 years. Most (672;70.7%) were female, and 705(74.1%) had a university degree. Since the epidemic started, 529(55.6%) and 436(45.9%) participants stated they were eating healthier and taking more vitamins, respectively. Only 82(8.6%) had been COVID-19 tested, and 1(1.2%) tested positive. In public, 905(95.2%) socially distanced, however 99(10.4%) participants had recently attended meetings with over ten people. Regular hand washing was practiced by 907(95.4%) participants, 774(81.4%) wore face masks and 854(89.8%) stayed home when they experienced flu-like symptoms. The odds of adhering to the guidelines were lower among men versus women (AOR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.528, 0.971) and those who had flu-like symptoms (AOR 0.42, 95% CI = 0.277, 0.628). In contrast, increased odds were reported for those who reported increased vitamin intake (AOR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.044,1.798), and were either cohabiting or married (AOR 1.39, 95% CI = 1.042,1.847). Conclusion Despite high reported adherence, face mask use and symptomatic individuals not self-isolating, were areas for improvement. However, these factors cannot solely account for SA’s increasing COVID-19 cases. Larger general population studies are needed to identify other adherence predictors for a strengthened SA COVID-19 response. While the government must continue to educate the entire population on preventative measures, provide personal protective equipment and stress the importance of adherence, there also needs to be implementation of prioritised prevention strategies for men and single individuals to address their demonstrated lower adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3134681856,"Background Endoscopy under propofol sedation has become a routine procedure. Given the number of Canadians undergoing an endoscopy annually, as well as the pervasive use of cannabis by many patients, understanding the effect of cannabis use on the propofol dose at endoscopy is highly relevant. We aimed to evaluate the association between cannabis exposure and the propofol dose needed to achieve adequate sedation at endoscopy. Methods A case-control study of individuals undergoing endoscopy was conducted at a single outpatient endoscopy clinic in London, Ontario between 2014 and 2017. Cases included all individuals with any self-reported cannabis exposure, while controls included all individuals without any self-reported history of cannabis use. Dose of propofol administered by a single anesthetist was collected on each subject as well as additional demographic and procedure-related covariates. Results Three hundred and eighteen participants were included (cases, n = 151; controls, n = 167). Cannabis exposure was associated with an increase in propofol dose (cases 0.33 mg/kg/minute ±0.24; controls, 0.18 mg/kg/minute ±0.11; p&lt;0.0001). Cannabis exposure remained an independent predictor of propofol dose on multivariate linear regression accounting for other important covariates (p&lt;0.0001). Daily cannabis users required a higher propofol dose than weekly or monthly users. Three procedural sedation-related complications occurred in the cannabis-exposed group, while none occurred in the unexposed group. Conclusion Our data suggest that cannabis use is significantly associated with the quantity of propofol needed for sedation at endoscopy. Further study is needed to better understand the molecular basis for this possible drug-drug interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3135333937,"Mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) is an important food grain legume, but its production capacity is threatened by global warming, which can intensify plant stress and limit future production. Identifying new variation of key root traits in mungbean will provide the basis for breeding lines with effective root characteristics for improved water uptake to mitigate heat and drought stress. The AVRDC mungbean mini core collection consisting of 296 genotypes was screened under modified semi-hydroponic screening conditions to determine the variation for fourteen root-related traits. The AVRDC mungbean mini core collection displayed wide variations for the primary root length, total surface area, and total root length, and based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering eight homogeneous groups displaying different root traits could be identified. Germplasm with potentially favorable root traits has been identified for further studies to identify the donor genotypes for breeding cultivars with enhanced adaptation to water-deficit stress and other stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3135375170,"Plant breeding and disease management practices have increased the grain yield of hard winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) adapted to the Great Plains of the United States during the last century. However, the effect of genetic gains for seed yield and the application of fungicide on the micronutrient and cadmium (Cd) concentration in wheat grains is still unclear. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of fungicide application on the productivity and nutritional quality of wheat cultivars representing 80 years of plant breeding efforts. Field experiments were conducted over two crop years (2017 and 2018) with eighteen hard winter wheat genotypes released between 1933 and 2013 in the presence or absence of fungicide application. For each growing season, the treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with the fungicide levels (treated and untreated) as the whole plot treatments and the genotypes as split-plot treatments in triplicate. The effects on seed yield, grain protein concentration (GPC), micronutrients, phytic acid, and Cd in grains were measured. While the yield of wheat was found to increase at annualized rates of 26.5 and 13.0 kg ha -1 yr -1 in the presence and absence of fungicide ( P &lt; 0.001), respectively, GPC (-190 and -180 mg kg -1 yr -1 , P &lt; 0.001), Fe (-35.0 and -44.0 μg kg -1 yr -1 , P &lt; 0.05), and Zn (-68.0 and -57.0 μg kg -1 yr -1 , P &lt; 0.01) significantly decreased during the period studied. In contrast to the other mineral elements, grain Cd significantly increased over time (0.4 μg kg -1 yr -1 , P &lt; 0.01) in the absence of fungicide. The results from this study are of great concern, as many mineral elements essential for human nutrition have decreased over time while the toxic heavy metal, Cd, has increased, indicating modern wheats are becoming a better vector of dietary Cd."
https://openalex.org/W3133527534,"Post-colonial land tenure reforms in emerging countries have partly aimed at poverty reduction through equitable land access. However, the poverty rate keeps rising in rural and peri-urban settings in Sub-Saharan Africa dominated by agricultural activities. This article reviews land tenure reforms in Mali, from the year 2000 to 2017 regarding poverty alleviation and evaluates their impacts on indigenous smallholder farmers, using multiple linear and logistic regression models and local experts’ elicitations. The results indicate that the advent of land titles as the only definitive evidence of land ownership, following the reforms, has generally weakened customary land management. Smallholder farmers face several barriers to obtaining land titles, limiting equity in land access and security. This has paved way for land markets marred by irregularities and resulted in colossal loss of agricultural lands, which are the main source of rural livelihood. Thus, the reforms have not yielded the intended poverty reduction outcomes. The study recommends that land transfers must be authorised by a single institution, represented at the various administrative levels, which issues an authentic and incorruptible document using appropriate technology. Moreover, since pro-poor provisions in the reforms usually lack implementing decrees in Mali, political will is key to achieving equitable land access and security."

The Rab8 small GTPases are regulators of intracellular transport of membrane-bound structural and signaling cargo. However, the physiological contribution of the intrinsic trafficking network controlled by Rab8 to mesenchymal tissue differentiation has not been fully defined in vivo and in primary tissue cultures. Here, we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Rab8 have severely impaired adipocyte differentiation in vivo and ex vivo. Immunofluorescent localization and biochemical analyses of Rab8a-deficient, Rab8b-deficient, and Rab8a and Rab8b double-deficient MEFs revealed that Rab8 controls the Lrp6 vesicular compartment, clearance of basal signalosome, traffic of frizzled two receptor, and thereby a proper attenuation of Wnt signaling in differentiating MEFs. Upon induction of adipogenesis program, Rab8a- and Rab8b-deficient MEFs exhibited severely defective lipid-droplet formation and abnormal cilia morphology, despite overall intact cilia growth and ciliary cargo transport.

Subcellular spatial regulation of canonical Wnt signalling at the primary cilium.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins are secreted extracellular growth factors that bind the coreceptors LRP5/6 and Fzd (37Lorenowicz M.J. Korswagen H.C.

Upon ligand binding, the downstream effectors Axin, CK1, and Dvl are recruited, forming a ternary complex at the plasma membrane that stabilizes cytosolic β-catenin. Once stable, β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it binds its transcription cofactor TCF/Lef and activates the transcription of genes necessary for the progenitor fate, cell growth, and proliferation. In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3β and targeted to proteasomes for degradation by a destruction complex consisting of the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-Trcp, Axin, GSK3β, and APC (39Feng Q. Gao N. Keeping Wnt signalosome in check by vesicular traffic.J. Cell Physiol. 2015; 230: 1170-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A fundamental Wnt-stimulated cellular response is the rapid assembly and trafficking of multiprotein intracellular plasma membrane associated complex known as the LRP6 signalosome (40Bilic J. Huang Y.L. Davidson G. Zimmermann T. Cruciat C.M. Bienz M. Niehrs C. Wnt induces LRP6 signalosomes and promotes dishevelled-dependent LRP6 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 316: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). These signalosomes are marked by elevated levels of phosphorylated LRP6 (pLRP6) that recruit key Wnt components, such as Axin and Dvl, to inactivate the β-catenin destruction complex (40Bilic J. Huang Y.L. Davidson G. Zimmermann T. Cruciat C.M. Bienz M. Niehrs C.

The larger subunits SPTLC1 and SPTLC2/SPTLC3 together form the catalytic core while a smaller third subunit either SSSPTA or SSSPTB has been shown to increase the catalytic efficiency and provide substrate specificity for the fatty acyl-CoA substrates. The in vivo biological significance of these smaller subunits in mammals is still unknown. Here, using two null mutants, a conditional null for ssSPTa and a null mutant for ssSPTb, we show that SSSPTA is essential for embryogenesis and mediates much of the known functions of the SPT complex in mammalian hematopoiesis. The ssSPTa null mutants are embryonic lethal at E6.5 much like the Sptlc1 and Sptlc2 null alleles. Mx1-Cre induced deletion of ssSPTa leads to lethality and myelopoietic defect. Chimeric and competitive bone marrow transplantation experiments show that the defect in myelopoiesis is accompanied by an expansion of the Lin−Sca1+c-Kit+ stem and progenitor compartment. Progenitor cells that fail to differentiate along the myeloid lineage display evidence of endoplasmic reticulum stress. On the other hand, ssSPTb null mice are homozygous viable, and analyses of the bone marrow cells show no significant difference in the proliferation and differentiation of the adult hematopoietic compartment. SPTLC1 is an obligatory subunit for the SPT function, and because Sptlc1−/− and ssSPTa−/− mice display similar defects during development and hematopoiesis, we conclude that an SPT complex that includes SSSPTA mediates much of its developmental and hematopoietic functions in a mammalian model.

They are 2-amino-1,3-dihydroxyalkanes-or-enes (4Merrill Jr., A.H. De novo sphingolipid biosynthesis: A necessary, but dangerous, pathway.J. Biol.

The alkyl chain length could be variable, have double bonds, and further modified with N-acylation and other modifications to generate a diverse array of sphingolipids in eukaryotes and some specific sphingolipid containing prokaryotes. Sphingolipids are a minor but very important class of lipids with important roles in the biology of eukaryotes. They are amphipathic in nature providing barrier functions and influence membrane fluidity (5Wigger D. Gulbins E. Kleuser B. Schumacher F.

Because many of the intermediates are bioactive, several of the enzymes of the pathway are regulated. The de novo pathway is essential for survival of all eukaryotes and is initiated by the condensation of serine with a fatty acyl-CoA (usually palmitoyl-CoA) to form 3-ketosphinganine (11Pinto W.J.

Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1737: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This is the first, committed, and rate limiting step of the pathway. It is catalyzed by a heterotrimeric enzyme complex called serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) (25Hanada K. Serine palmitoyltransferase, a key enzyme of sphingolipid metabolism.Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In mammals, the complex consists of two large subunits called SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 (or SPTLC3) and one of the two small subunits SSSPTA or SSSPTB (27Han G. Gupta S.D. Gable K. Niranjanakumari S. Moitra P. Eichler F. Brown Jr., R.H. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M. Identification of small subunits of mammalian serine palmitoyltransferase that confer distinct acyl-CoA substrate specificities.Proc. Natl.

Rep. 2018; 35: 921-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two large subunits are homologous and contain several structural elements essential for binding to the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), although a critical residue for binding is mutated in the SPTLC1 subunit. Hence, the PLP binding is mediated by the large SPTLC2 or three subunits. The active site of the enzyme is believed to be created by an interface generated by SPTLC1-SPTLC2 interaction. Amongst the small subunits, SSSPTA primary sequence is about 99% conserved between human and mouse (1 homologous substitution in 71 amino acids). Although there are about 11 amino acid changes between the human and mouse SSSPTB sequences, most of them are conservative substitutions indicating a high degree of conservation. In mammals, SSSPTA (about 71 amino acids) and SSSPTB (about 76 amino acids) share about 63% sequence similarity (Fig. 1A). While SPTLC1-SPTLC2 dimers show basal enzymatic activity, the binding of the third subunit increases the catalytic efficiency by as much as 100-fold and also provide some fatty acyl-CoA preference to the complex (27Han G.

The incorporation of SSSPTA into the complex allows for preferential utilization of palmitoyl-CoA as substrate, whereas the presence of SSSPTB has been shown in vitro to allow the incorporation of both palmitoyl-CoA or longer chain (C18-C20) fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates for the condensation reaction (2Zhao L.

We show that germline deletion of ssSPTa results in embryonic lethality around E6.5, and embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from ES cells show differentiation defects. We demonstrate that loss of ssSPTa in the adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in defective myelopoietic differentiation while erythropoiesis is relatively spared. Chimeric and competitive bone marrow transplantation studies showed that defects in myelopoiesis are accompanied by relative expansion of the stem and progenitor compartment. Molecular analysis indicates that aberrant myelopoiesis is accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum stress. These phenotypes are similar to the defects observed in Sptlc1 null mutants (30Parthibane V. Acharya D. Srideshikan S.M. Lin J. Myerscough D.G. Abimannan T. Vijaykrishna N. Blankenberg D. Bondada L. Klarmann K.D. Fox S.D. Andresson T. Tessarollo L. Acharya U. Keller J.R. et al.Sptlc1 is essential for myeloid differentiation and hematopoietic homeostasis.Blood Adv. 2019; 3: 3635-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). On the other hand, germline null mutants of ssSPTb are homozygous viable and do not show defects in adult hematopoiesis. Our results indicate that SSSPTA mediates much of the developmental and hematopoietic functions of the SPT complex in mammals. To understand the in vivo functional significance of the SSSPTA subunit, we generated a floxed allele for the gene. The ssSPTa gene is localized to chromosome 12 (Chromosome 12, 23.46 cM), and the ORF of the gene is encoded by two exons. Using the standard Cre-lox system and Bac recombineering, we targeted exon 1 (aa 1–39) for conditional deletion of the gene (Fig. 1B) (31Sharan S.K. Thomason L.C. Kuznetsov S.G. Court D.L. Recombineering: A homologous recombination-based method of genetic engineering.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 206-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To generate a zygotic null allele of ssSPTa, we employed Actin-Cre (32Lewandoski M. Meyers E.N. Martin G.R. Analysis of Fgf8 gene function in vertebrate development.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; 62: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genotyping of about 289 live-born progenies from heterozygous intercross indicated that about 64% were heterozygous and about 36% were wild type, and no homozygous mutants were recovered (Table S1). To determine the embryonic stage at which the fetuses were dying, we set up timed mating of heterozygous intercross and genotyped the embryos at different times of gestation. We noticed that ssSPTa−/− embryos begin to degenerate and get absorbed between E6.5 and E7.5. Sptlc1−/− and Sptlc2−/− null have also been reported to be early embryonic lethal (24Hojjati M.R. Li Z. Jiang X.C. Serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase (SPT) deficiency and sphingolipid levels in mice.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1737: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Parthibane V.

E6.5 embryos were smaller than the corresponding ssSPTa+/+ harvested from the same uterus, indicating disruption of the normal developmental process in the mutant embryos (Figs. 1C and S1A). Mutant embryos displayed significant lysotracker dye and TUNEL staining implying increased apoptosis compared with the wild-type embryos (Fig. S1, B and C). Mutant embryos also showed reduced staining with bromodeoxyuridine staining indicating reduced proliferation (Fig. S1D). Blastocysts were obtained from ssSPTa+/+, sSPTa+/−, and ssSPTa−/− conceptus, and the blastocyst inner cell mass outgrowth was assessed for 8 days. For the first 2 days, no changes were observed between control and mutant samples. The ssSPTa+/+, ssSPTa+/−, and ssSPTa−/− blastocysts successfully hatched from zona pellucida and initiated growth (Fig. 1D). However, ssSPTa−/− inner mass cells gradually stopped proliferating and were lost around day 6. The impaired growth of inner mass cells of ssSPTa−/− blastocysts suggests that ssSPTa deficiency causes a developmental arrest and eventually leads to the death of the embryos. EBs were derived from ssSPTa+/+ and ssSPTa−/− embryonic stem cells (Fig. 1E). Because EBs have been considered to be the developmental equivalent of the egg cylinder–staged mouse embryos, we compared the SSSPTA-depleted EBs with wild-type EBs. After 14 days of culture in suspension, the wild-type EBs had a distinct outer layer surrounding differentiated cells and EB cavity. In contrast, although ssSPTa null ESCs were able to form putative EBs, these EBs appeared blocked in the differentiation process, forming undifferentiated masses of cells that lacked cavity formation and differentiated structures. The differentiation of germ layers in the EBs was examined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using markers for ectoderm (Nestin), endoderm (Sox17), and mesoderm (Gsc). Despite morphological differences in the appearance of the EBs, there were no major differences in expression of ectodermal and endodermal markers Nestin and Sox17, respectively (Fig. 1, F and G). On the other hand, Gsc and Brachyury, markers for mesoderm, showed a consistent decrease in the mutant EBs especially around day 6 (Fig. 1, H and I). Collectively, the experiments described above indicated that ssSPTa null mutants have differentiation defects and are embryonic lethal between E6.5 and E7.5 like Sptlc1 and Sptlc2 null mutants. Our observations support the notion that ssSPTa is a functional third subunit of the SPT complex necessary for mouse embryonic development. The adult hematopoietic system is a tissue of mainly mesodermal origin (33Dzierzak E. Bigas A. Blood development: Hematopoietic stem cell dependence and independence.Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22: 639-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of SSSPTA subunit to SPT function in adult hematopoiesis, we deleted ssSPTa in the adult hematopoietic stem cells using Mx1-Cre (34Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). For these experiments, to activate the Mx1-Cre promoter, ssSPTaflox/flox, and control ssSPTa+/+, Mx1-Cre mice were subjected to poly(I:C) treatment. Treated animals begin to die after 8 days after poly(I:C) treatment while control animals remain relatively healthy. Therefore, for these experiments, the bone marrow cells (BMCs) were harvested at day 8 and the genotype ascertained by PCR (Fig. S2A). The disruption of the gene was confirmed by qPCR analysis of the ssSPTa transcript (Fig. 2A). Similar to Sptlc1−/− mice, ssSPTa−/− mutants also showed intestinal fluid accumulation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the intestine revealed loss of villi and altered appearance of the mucosal and submucosal layers (Fig. S2, B and C). Bone marrow suspensions isolated from the ssSPTa−/− were red in color, and cytocentrifuged preparations of the BMCs contained more RBCs and fewer differentiated myeloid cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The total BM cellularity of the ssSPTa−/− mice was reduced compared with similarly treated ssSPTa+/+ mice (Fig. S2D). To define how loss of ssSPTa influences lineage development in hematopoiesis, we analyzed BMCs, thymocytes, and splenocytes for lineage markers expressed on myeloid cells (Mac1;Gr1); erythroid cells (CD71;Ter119); B lymphoid cells (IgM), and T lymphocytes (CD4;CD8) using flow cytometry. Mac1+Gr1+ that mark cells of granulocytic lineage are reduced 5-fold in the ssSPTa−/− BMCs (Fig. 2, D and E). The monocyte (Ly6C+;Ly6G−) and macrophage (Mac1+;F4/80+) lineages were substantially decreased (Fig. 2, F and G). On the other hand, cells of the erythrocytic lineage were increased (Fig. 2H, Fig. S2, E–G). The cellularity of the spleen was slightly decreased, and there was a modest but consistent decrease in the number of Mac1+Gr1+ (Fig. S2, H and I). There were no significant changes in thymus except for a slight reduction in CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. S2, J–M). Also, the number of IgM+ BMCs were not affected (Fig. S2N). These data indicate that loss of ssSPTa in the adult hematopoietic system primarily compromises myeloid differentiation while relatively sparing erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Mass spectrometric quantitative analysis of sphingolipids in the BMCs of the ssSPTa−/− indicated a severe reduction in the levels of almost all species of the major sphingomyelins, ceramides, and hexosylceramides compared with that of ssSPTa+/+ (Fig. 3, A–C). Thus, the hematopoietic defects observed in the ssSPTa null BMCs is accompanied by a severe deficiency of majority of the sphingolipids in these cells. The comparison of the sphingolipid profile between ssSPTa+/+ and ssSPTa−/− described above suggests that SSSPTA plays a major role in the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids in the adult hematopoietic system. As with Sptlc1−/− BMCs, we see a correlation between loss of SSSPTA function, significant decrease in major sphingolipids, and defective myelopoiesis in the BMCs (30Parthibane V. Acharya D. Srideshikan S.M. Lin J. Myerscough D.G. Abimannan T. Vijaykrishna N. Blankenberg D. Bondada L. Klarmann K.D. Fox S.D. Andresson T. Tessarollo L. Acharya U. Keller J.R. et al.Sptlc1 is essential for myeloid differentiation and hematopoietic homeostasis.Blood Adv. 2019; 3: 3635-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It is likely that SSSPTA is a critical component of the SPT complex in mammalian adult hematopoietic system. To assess the cell intrinsic requirement of SSSPTA in adult hematopoiesis, we performed noncompetitive and competitive bone marrow repopulation assays using ssSPTa+/+ Mx1-Cre and ssSPTaflox/flox Mx1-Cre BMCs. These assays gauge reconstitution of different lineages of BMCs in irradiated mice transplanted with donor cells and is routinely used to determine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function in vivo. For noncompetitive experiments, the transplanted mice were treated with poly(I:C) (15 μg per gram of body weight, followed by a second dose 2 days later) 6 weeks after transplantation of ssSPTa+/+ Mx1-Cre and ssSPTaflox/flox Mx1-Cre BMCs. The chimeric ssSPTa−/− mice did not survive beyond 4 to 5 weeks, and therefore, we analyzed mice 3 weeks after the last injection (Fig. S3A). The BM cellularity was reduced in the mutant compared with the control (Fig. S3B). In the chimeric mice, the total donor Mac1+Gr1+ neutrophils were decreased 6-fold, suggesting that SSSPTA is intrinsically required for the development of granulocytes (Fig. 4, A and B). Macrophage and monocytic lineages were also compromised (Fig. 4, C and D). Because CD45 is expressed in the early stages of erythroid development, we examined BMCs for donor erythroid progenitor cells and found that these cells were slightly increased in the BM of ssSPTa−/− mice, indicating erythroid development was not compromised (Fig. 4E and Fig. S3, C–E). The total number of ssSPTa−/− thymocytes were decreased accompanied by a decrease in the number of the immature CD4+CD8+ double positive cells (Fig. S3, F and G). However, we did not see a significant difference in the number of mature single positive CD4+ or CD8+ cells (Fig. S3, H and I). Finally, we observed no significant difference in B-lymphoid cells in the BM of ssSPTa+/+ and ssSPTa−/− chimeric mice (Fig. S3J). These experiments reveal that loss of SSSPTA causes defects in myeloid differentiation in the adult hematopoietic system. To understand how loss of ssSPTa leads to defects in myelopoiesis, we evaluated HSPC development in the chimeric mice 21 days after loss of ssSPTa. HSCs were gated by forward and side scatter for live cells, CD45.2 to distinguish donor cells and then for lineage-negative cells (Lin−). The Lin− cells were analyzed for the expression of c-Kit and Sca-1 which identifies Lin−c-Kit+, Sca1+ (LSK), and Lin− c-Kit+ Sca1− (LK) cells (Fig. 4F). The LSK cells were subgated using FLT3 and CD34 to isolate long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs), and multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) (Fig. S4A). We found a trend toward expansion of the stem and progenitor cell LSK compartment (Fig. 4G) with significant increase in the ST-HSC and MPP compartments (Fig. 4, H and I), whereas LT-HSC was not significantly changed (Fig. 4J). We also subgated the LK cells for FCR and CD34 to identify common myeloid precursor (CMP, Lin−, Sca-1− c-Kit+ CD34+"
https://openalex.org/W3135373951,"Background Healthcare facilities in Ethiopia are responsible for collecting samples for testing and treating COVID-19 patients, providing COVID-19 information to staff, establishment of response teams, and provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). Working at the frontlines against the pandemic, health care providers’ level of knowledge about COVID-19, attitude towards their work, and confidence in the preparedness of their facilities are essential factors in mounting a successful response. Objectives This study investigated the knowledge level of HCP in Ethiopia on this novel coronavirus, and their perspectives on whether their workplaces have sufficient preparedness to handle this disease. Methods A self-administered online survey was conducted. Results The knowledge related to COVID-19 among HCPs was high, with an overall average of 91.5%. The majority of our respondents were supportive to the government’s measures to minimize disease transmission, but most of them were also frustrated by how COVID affected their day to day lives. The majority of them were worried about contracting COVID at work and transmitting the infection to their families. Most respondents did not feel safe going to work (P&lt;0.001). Apart from providing adequate information on COVID-19, most workplaces did not have sufficient PPE (P&lt;000.1) and medical supplies (P&lt;0.001). Close to 50% of respondents agreed and disagreed that their workplaces had clear protocols for handling COVID-19 (P = 0.144). Those who handled known COVID patients were more likely to agree their workplaces had clear protocols (OR = 2.69, P&lt;0.001). Conclusion Improving supplies of PPEs and establishing a clear communicating protocol in handling COVID patients are highly recommended."

This study presents recommendations for the outpatient management of moderate SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia implemented at the Geneva University Hospital, Switzerland, from April 4 to June 30, 2020 and evaluated the impact of these recommendations on patient safety, patient satisfaction, and overall hospital capacity.Recommendations for the outpatient management of moderate pneumonia implemented in the Geneva University Hospital (PneumoCoV-Ambu) between April 4 and June 30, 2020, were evaluated prospectively. The primary endpoint was hospitalization. Secondary endpoints were: severity of COVID-19 disease based on a 7-points ordinal scale assessed at 1 and 2 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection; patient satisfaction using a satisfaction survey and the analysis of number of beds and costs potentially averted.A total of 36 patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia were followed between April 4 and May 5, 2020. Five patients (14%) were hospitalized and none died over a median of 30 days follow-up. The majority of patients (n = 31; 86%) were satisfied with the ambulatory care they received. These novel recommendations for outpatient management resulted in sparing an estimated potential 124 hospital bed-nights and CHF 6'826 per capita averted hospitalization costs over the three months period.Recommendations developed for the outpatient management of COVID-19-related pneumonia were able to spare hospital capacity without increasing adverse patient outcomes. Widely implementing such recommendations is crucial in preserving hospital capacity during this pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3133568034,"Alpha-particle emitting radionuclides continue to be the subject of medical research because of their high energy and short range of action that facilitate effective cancer therapies. Radium-224 ( 224 Ra) is one such candidate that has been considered for use in combating micrometastatic disease. In our prior studies, a suspension of 224 Ra-labeled calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) microparticles was designed as a local therapy for disseminated cancers in the peritoneal cavity. The progenies of 224 Ra, of which radon-220 ( 220 Rn) is the first, together contribute three of the four alpha particles in the decay chain. The proximity of the progenies to the delivery site at the time of decay of the 224 Ra-CaCO 3 microparticles can impact its therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we show that the diffusion of 220 Rn was reduced in labeled CaCO 3 suspensions as compared with cationic 224 Ra solutions, both in air and liquid volumes. Furthermore, free-floating lead-212 ( 212 Pb), which is generated from released 220 Rn, had the potential to be re-adsorbed onto CaCO 3 microparticles. Under conditions mimicking an in vivo environment, more than 70% of the 212 Pb was adsorbed onto the CaCO 3 at microparticle concentrations above 1 mg/mL. Further, the diffusion of 220 Rn seemed to occur whether the microparticles were labeled by the surface adsorption of 224 Ra or if the 224 Ra was incorporated into the bulk of the microparticles. The therapeutic benefit of differently labeled 224 Ra-CaCO 3 microparticles after intraperitoneal administration was similar when examined in mice bearing intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenografts. In conclusion, both the release of 220 Rn and re-adsorption of 212 Pb are features that have implications for the radiotherapeutic use of 224 Ra-labeled CaCO 3 microparticles. The release of 220 Rn through diffusion may extend the effective range of alpha-particle dose deposition, and the re-adsorption of the longer lived 212 Pb onto the CaCO 3 microparticles may enhance the retention of this nuclide in the peritoneal cavity."
https://openalex.org/W3134505127,"In the era of precision medicine, analyzing the transcriptomic profile of patients is essential to tailor the appropriate therapy. In this study, we explored transcriptional differences between two invasive breast cancer subtypes; infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) and lobular carcinoma (LC) using RNA-Seq data deposited in the TCGA-BRCA project. We revealed 3854 differentially expressed genes between normal ductal tissues and IDC. In addition, IDC to LC comparison resulted in 663 differentially expressed genes. We then focused on DNA repair genes because of their known effects on patients’ response to therapy and resistance. We here report that 36 DNA repair genes are overexpressed in a significant number of both IDC and LC patients’ samples. Despite the upregulation in a significant number of samples, we observed a noticeable variation in the expression levels of the repair genes across patients of the same cancer subtype. The same trend is valid for the expression of miRNAs, where remarkable variations between patients’ samples of the same cancer subtype are also observed. These individual variations could lie behind the differential response of patients to treatment. The future of cancer diagnostics and therapy will inevitably depend on high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic data analysis. However, we propose that performing analysis on individual patients rather than a big set of patients’ samples will be necessary to ensure that the best treatment is determined, and therapy resistance is reduced."

This prospective study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) for the staging of liver fibrosis and proposed a diagnostic algorithm using DWI to identify cirrhosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis.One hundred twenty-one treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B or C were evaluated with DWI followed by liver biopsy on the same day. Breath-hold single-shot echo-planar DWI was performed to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the liver and spleen. Normalized liver ADC was calculated as the ratio of liver ADC to spleen ADC.There was an inverse correlation between fibrosis stage and normalized liver ADC (p<0.05). For the prediction of fibrosis stage ≥2, stage ≥3, and cirrhosis, the area under the receiver-operating curve of normalized liver ADC was 0.603, 0.704, and 0.847, respectively. The normalized liver ADC value ≤1.02×10-3 mm2/s had 88% sensitivity, 81% specificity, 25% positive predictive value (PPV), and 99% negative predictive value (NPV) for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Using a sequential approach with the Fibrosis-4 index followed by DWI, normalized liver ADC ≤1.02×10-3 mm2/s in patients with Fibrosis-4 >3.25 yielded an 80% PPV for cirrhosis, and a 100% NPV to exclude cirrhosis in patients with Fibrosis-4 between 1.45 and 3.25. Only 15.7% of patients would require a liver biopsy. This sequential strategy can reduce DWI examinations by 53.7%.Normalized liver ADC measurement on DWI is an accurate and noninvasive tool for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis."

From the QTL analysis, we narrowed down Serpina3 with two SNPs in senescence-accelerated mouse prone (SAMP) 8 strain. Our study showed SAMP8 type Serpina3 prolonged retention of oligomeric Aβ 42 for longer duration (72 hr) while observing under transmission electron microscope (TEM). From Western blot results, we confirmed presence of Aβ 42 oligomeric forms (trimers, tetramers) were maintained for longer duration only in the presences of SAMP8 type Serpina3. Using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, we observed until 36 hr preincubated Aβ 42 with SAMP8 type Serpina3 caused neuronal cell death compared to 12 hr preincubated Aβ 42 with SAMR1 or JF1 type Serpina3 proteins. Similar results were found by extending this study to analyze the effect of polymorphism of SERPINA3 gene of the Japanese SNP database for geriatric research (JG-SNP). We observed that polymorphic SERPINA3 I308T (rs142398813) prolonged toxic oligomeric Aβ 42 forms till 48 hr in comparison to the presence wild type SERPINA3 protein, resulting neuronal cell death.

https://openalex.org/W3134069688,"Background and purpose Ankle function declines with age. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between ankle function and balance in older adults, with a focus on range of motion (ROM) and strength. Methods This was a cross-sectional study that included 88 healthy community-dwelling older adults. Ankle mobility was measured while bearing weight (lunge test) and not bearing weight. The plantar-flexor muscle strength was assessed using a hand-held dynamometer. Balance was measured in terms of dynamic balance and mobility (timed up and go test), monopodal and bipodal static balance with open and closed eyes (single-leg stand test and platform measures), and margins of stability (functional reach test). Linear correlation and multiple regression analyses were conducted with a 95% CI. Results and discussion Most participants had limited ankle mobility (n = 75, 86%). Weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion ROM was the strongest predictor of dynamic balance and included general mobility and stability ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = [0.34]; β = [-0.50]). In contrast, plantar-flexor muscle strength was a significant predictor of static standing balance with open eyes ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M2""><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = [0.16–0.2]; β = [0.29–0.34]). Overall, weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion ROM was a more representative measure of balance and functional performance; however, a non-weight-bearing mobility assessment provides complementary information. Therefore, both measures can be used in clinical practice. Conclusion This study supports the concept that ankle mobility contributes to the performance of dynamic tasks, while the plantar-flexor muscle strength helps to develop a standing static balance. Identification of alterations in ankle function is warranted and may assist in the design of tailored interventions. These interventions can be used in isolation or to augment conventional balance training in order to improve balance performance in community-dwelling older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3135553373,"Keloids are a type of disordered scar formation which not only show heterogeneity between individuals and within the scar itself, but also share common features of hyperproliferation, abnormal extra-cellular matrix deposition and degradation, as well as altered expression of the molecular markers of wound healing. Numerous reports have established that cells from keloid scars display Warburg metabolism-a form of JAK2/STAT3-induced metabolic adaptation typical of rapidly dividing cells in which glycolysis becomes the predominant source of ATP over oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Using the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, along with cells from patients with STAT3 loss of function (STA3 LOF; autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome) we examined the role of JAK/STAT signaling in the hyperproliferation and metabolic dysregulation seen in keloid fibroblasts. Although ruxolitinib inhibited hyperactivity in the scratch assay in keloid fibroblasts, it paradoxically exacerbated the hyper-glycolytic state, possibly by further limiting OxPhos via alterations in mitochondrial phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3Ser727). In healthy volunteer fibroblasts, folic acid exposure recapitulated the exaggerated closure and hyper-glycolytic state of keloid fibroblasts through JAK1/2- and STAT3-dependent pathways. Although additional studies are needed before extrapolating from a representative cell line to keloids writ large, our results provide novel insights into the metabolic consequences of STAT3 dysfunction, suggest a possible role for folate metabolism in the pathogenesis of keloid scars, and offer in vitro pre-clinical data supporting considerations of clinical trials for ruxolitinib in keloid disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3135768518,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental pathogen that can cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients. P. aeruginosa infections are typically treated with multiple antibiotics including tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem. However, antibiotics do not always entirely clear the bacteria from the infection site, where they may remain virulent. This is because the effective antibiotic concentration and diffusion in vitro may differ from the in vivo environment in patients. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of non-lethal sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations on bacterial phenotype. Here, we investigate if sub-inhibitory antimicrobial concentrations cause alterations in bacterial virulence factor production using pyocyanin as a model toxin. We tested this using the aforementioned antibiotics on 10 environmental P. aeruginosa strains. Using on-the-spot electrochemical screening, we were able to directly quantify changes in production of pyocyanin in a measurement time of 17 seconds. Upon selecting 3 representative strains to further test the effects of sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs), we found that pyocyanin production changed significantly when the bacteria were exposed to 10-fold MIC of the 3 antibiotics tested, and this was strain specific. A series of biologically relevant measured pyocyanin concentrations were also used to assess the effects of increased virulence on a culture of epithelial cells. We found a decreased viability of the epithelial cells when incubated with biologically relevant pyocyanin concentrations. This suggests that the antibiotic-induced virulence also is a value worth being enclosed in regular testing of pathogens."

In an inorganic nitrogen-deficient environment, some vegetative cells of the cyanobacterium Anabaena differentiate into heterocysts. We assessed the photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixing capacities of heterocysts and vegetative cells, respectively, at the transcriptome level. RNA extracted from nitrogen-replete vegetative cells (NVs), nitrogen-deprived vegetative cells (NDVs), and nitrogen-deprived heterocysts (NDHs) in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 was evaluated by transcriptome sequencing. Paired comparisons of NVs vs. NDHs, NVs vs. NDVs, and NDVs vs. NDHs revealed 2,044 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and several nitrogen metabolism-related pathways were significantly enriched. Synthesis of Gvp (Gas vesicle synthesis protein gene) in NVs was blocked by nitrogen deprivation, which may cause Anabaena cells to sink and promote nitrogen fixation under anaerobic conditions; in contrast, heterocysts may perform photosynthesis under nitrogen deprivation conditions, whereas the nitrogen fixation capability of vegetative cells was promoted by nitrogen deprivation. Immunofluorescence analysis of nitrogenase iron protein suggested that the nitrogen fixation capability of vegetative cells was promoted by nitrogen deprivation. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis in vegetative cells and heterocysts at the transcriptome level. This study provides a foundation for further functional verification of heterocyst growth, differentiation, and water bloom control."

Objective To develop an unbiased and semi-automated imaging methodology to quantify dermal cystine crystal accumulation in patients to correlate with disease status. Design, setting and participants 101 participants, 70 patients and 31 healthy controls, were enrolled at the University of California, San Diego, Cystinosis Clinics, Rady Children’s Hospital, San Diego and at the annual Cystinosis Research Foundation family conference for an ongoing prospective longitudinal cohort study of cystinosis patients with potential yearly follow-up. Exposures Intradermal reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging, blood collection via standard venipuncture, medical record collection, and occasional skin punch biopsies. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was to establish an automated measure of normalized confocal crystal volume (nCCV) for each subject. Secondary analysis examined the association of nCCV with various clinical indicators to assess nCCV’s possible predictive potential. Results Over 2 years, 57 patients diagnosed with cystinosis (median [range] age: 15.1 yrs [0.8, 54]; 41.4% female) were intradermally assessed by RCM to produce 84 image stacks. 27 healthy individuals (38.7 yrs [10, 85]; 53.1% female) were also imaged providing 37 control image stacks. Automated 2D crystal area quantification revealed that patients had significantly elevated crystal accumulation within the superficial dermis. 3D volumetric analysis of this region was significantly higher in patients compared to healthy controls (mean [SD]: 1934.0 μm 3 [1169.1] for patients vs. 363.1 μm 3 [194.3] for controls, P &lt;0.001). Medical outcome data was collected from 43 patients with infantile cystinosis (media [range] age: 11 yrs [0.8, 54]; 51% female). nCCV was positively associated with hypothyroidism (OR = 19.68, 95% CI: [1.60, 242.46], P = 0.02) and stage of chronic kidney disease (slope estimate = 0.53, 95%CI: [0.05, 1.00], P = 0.03). Conclusions and relevance This study used non-invasive RCM imaging to develop an intradermal cystine crystal quantification method. Results showed that cystinosis patients had increased nCCV compared to healthy controls. Level of patient nCCV correlated with several clinical outcomes suggesting nCCV may be used as a potential new biomarker for cystinosis to monitor long-term disease control and medication compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3134567435,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) cause the over-production of blood cells such as erythrocytes (polycythemia vera) or platelets (essential thrombocytosis). JAK2 V617F is the most prevalent somatic mutation in many MPNs, but previous modeling of this mutation in mice relied on transgenic overexpression and resulted in diverse phenotypes that were in some cases attributed to expression level. CRISPR-Cas9 engineering offers new possibilities to model and potentially cure genetically encoded disorders via precise modification of the endogenous locus in primary cells. Here we develop “scarless” Cas9-based reagents to create and reverse the JAK2 V617F mutation in an immortalized human erythroid progenitor cell line (HUDEP-2), CD34+ adult human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), and immunophenotypic long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). We find no overt in vitro increase in proliferation associated with an endogenous JAK2 V617F allele, but co-culture with wild type cells unmasks a competitive growth advantage provided by the mutation. Acquisition of the V617F allele also promotes terminal differentiation of erythroid progenitors, even in the absence of hematopoietic cytokine signaling. Taken together, these data are consistent with the gradually progressive manifestation of MPNs and reveals that endogenously acquired JAK2 V617F mutations may yield more subtle phenotypes as compared to transgenic overexpression models."
https://openalex.org/W3135326581,"Studies have shown an association between depression and frailty, even though the literature has not reached a consensus regarding how these syndromes interact. Although prospective cohort studies on this topic are still scarce, they could contribute to understanding this relationship. We aimed to observe whether depressive symptoms are risk factors for the onset of frailty among older adults living in São Paulo, Brazil.Prospective cohort study using the ""Health, Well-being and Aging"" (SABE) Study databases of 2006 and 2010. The sample was representative of the community-dwelling older adults living in São Paulo, and it is composed of non-frail men and women aged 60 years and older without cognitive decline. We calculated the frailty incidence rate between older adults with and without depressive symptoms and calculated the incidence rate ratio. Multiple analysis was carried out through Poisson regression with robust variance estimation.The initial sample (n = 1,109) presented a mean age of 72 years (from 60 to 96) and 61.1% were women. The final sample was composed of 830 individuals, and the mean follow-up time in the study was 3.8 years. After adjusting the model, depressive symptoms did not predict the onset of frailty at follow-up.Depressive symptoms were not shown to be a risk factor for frailty among older adults living in São Paulo in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3135362111,"Invertebrates in general have long been underrepresented in studies on biodiversity, biogeography and conservation. Boundaries of biodiversity hotspots are often delimited intuitively based on floristic endemism and have seldom been empirically tested using actual species distributions, and especially invertebrates. Here we analyse the zoogeography of terrestrial malacofauna from south-eastern Africa (SEA), proposing the first mollusc-based numerical regionalisation for the area. We also discuss patterns and centres of land snail endemism, thence assessing the importance and the delimitation of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany (MPA) biodiversity hotspot for their conservation. An incidence matrix compiled for relatively well-collected lineages of land snails and slugs (73 taxa in twelve genera) in 40 a priori operational geographic units was subjected to (a) phenetic agglomerative hierarchical clustering using unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA), (b) parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) and biotic element analysis (BEA). Fulfilling the primary objective of our study, the UPGMA dendrogram provided a hierarchical regionalisation and identified five centres of molluscan endemism for SEA, while the PAE confirmed six areas of endemism, also supported by the BEA. The regionalisation recovers a zoogeographic province similar to the MPA hotspot, but with a conspicuous westward extension into Knysna (towards the Cape). The MPA province, centres and areas of endemism, biotic elements as well as the spatial patterns of species richness and endemism, support the MPA hotspot, but suggest further extensions resulting in a greater MPA region of land snail endemism (also with a northward extension into sky islands-Soutpansberg and Wolkberg), similar to that noted for vertebrates. The greater MPA region provides a more robustly defined region of conservation concern, with centres of endemism serving as local conservation priorities."
https://openalex.org/W3133563285,"The Abstinence-Related Motivational Engagement (ARME) scale was developed to assess motivation to remain abstinent after a smoking cessation attempt. The ARME demonstrated reliability and validity among a small sample of ex-smokers. This study expands the psychometric evaluation of the ARME and tests the ARME as a predictor of smoking status among a sample of participants quitting smoking. The parent trial tested the efficacy of a self-help smoking cessation intervention (N = 1874), with assessments every 6 months. Internal consistency and factor structure of the ARME was evaluated at each assessment to confirm use of the measure as designed. Discriminant validity was assessed by comparing the ARME to the Situation-specific Abstinence Self-Efficacy (SSE) scale via inter-correlations and prediction of future smoking status. Finally, the trajectories of both the ARME and SSE were compared among continuous abstainers and continuous smokers. A single-factor structure was observed at each assessment. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from 0.88–0.91 for the total sample. Correlations between the ARME and the SSE ranged from 0.38–0.47 ( p s &lt;0.001) among smokers; and from 0.09–0.15 (most p s &gt; 0.05) among abstainers. Among current smokers, the ARME and SSE were independent positive predictors of subsequent abstinence (AORs 1.28–2.29, p s &lt;0.001). For those currently abstinent, only the SSE predicted subsequent abstinence (AORs 1.69–2.60, p s &lt;0.05). GEE analyses showed different trajectories for the two measures, as well as between abstainers and smokers. In conclusion, the ARME is a reliable, valid measure with unique predictive utility for current smokers and a distinct trajectory among those who have successfully quit."
https://openalex.org/W3133670752,"This study aimed to identify factors affecting the occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Korean adults aged 19 years and older. Specifically, we identified the factors in women’s victimization in and men’s perpetration of IPV. This study adopted a cross-sectional and correlational design in conducting secondary data analysis of the 2016 Domestic Violence Survey in Korea. Men (N = 1,272) and women (N = 2,689) with partner were included in the analysis. The ecological model was used as a conceptual framework. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors affecting women’s victimization in and men’s perpetration of IPV. The results showed that the prevalence of IPV against female partner was 12.1%. IPV occurrence was higher among women (Odds ratios (OR) = 2.92, Confidence intervals (CI): 1.84–4.63) and men (OR = 2.64, CI: 1.62–4.32) who experienced witnessing inter-parental violence in childhood, and among women (OR = 2.25, CI: 1.40–3.61) and men (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.59–4.52) with a tolerant attitude toward IPV. The occurrence was higher among women who experienced childhood maltreatment by the parents (OR = 1.70, CI: 1.03–2.82) and women whose income was 2 million Korean Won(KRW) to 3 million KRW compared with women whose income was above 4 million KRW (OR = 1.97, CI: 1.10–3.55). The occurrence was lower among women with office jobs compared with other jobs (OR = 0.47, CI: 0.26–0.84). Based on the results of this study, early intervention in abusive families to reduce the negative impact of abuse experiences and witnessing inter-parental violence in childhood, and education and publicity for changing attitudes toward IPV are necessary at the individual and societal levels. The formation of policies for the stable workplace and income of women are required."
https://openalex.org/W3133823482,"Fatal familial insomnia (FFI), genetic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (gCJD), and Gerstmann–Straussler–Scheinker (GSS) syndrome are neurodegenerative disorders linked to prion protein (PrP) mutations. The pathogenic mechanisms are not known, but increasing evidence points to mutant PrP misfolding and retention in the secretory pathway. We previously found that the D178N/M129 mutation associated with FFI accumulates in the Golgi of neuronal cells, impairing post-Golgi trafficking. In this study we further characterized the trafficking defect induced by the FFI mutation and tested the 178N/V129 variant linked to gCJD and a nine-octapeptide repeat insertion associated with GSS. We used transfected HeLa cells, embryonic fibroblasts and primary neurons from transgenic mice, and fibroblasts from carriers of the FFI mutation. In all these cell types, the mutant PrPs showed abnormal intracellular localizations, accumulating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. To test the efficiency of the membrane trafficking system, we monitored the intracellular transport of the temperature-sensitive vesicular stomatite virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), a well-established cargo reporter, and of endogenous procollagen I (PC-I). We observed marked alterations in secretory trafficking, with VSV-G accumulating mainly in the Golgi complex and PC-I in the ER and Golgi. A redacted version of mutant PrP with reduced propensity to misfold did not impair VSV-G trafficking, nor did artificial ER or Golgi retention of wild-type PrP; this indicates that both misfolding and intracellular retention were required to induce the transport defect. Pharmacological activation of Src family kinase (SFK) improved intracellular transport, suggesting that mutant PrP impairs secretory trafficking through corruption of SFK-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3135324342,"The diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the breeding season, foraging trips by lactating female fur seals are constrained by their need to return to land to provision their pups. Post-breeding, seals disperse in order to feed and recover condition; estimates indicate c.70% of females remain near to South Georgia, whilst others head west towards the Patagonian Shelf or south to the ice-edge. The krill fishery at South Georgia operates only during the winter, providing the potential for fur seal: fishery interaction during these months. Here we use available winter (May to September) tracking data from Platform Terminal Transmitter (PTT) tags deployed on female fur seals at Bird Island, South Georgia. We develop habitat models describing their distribution during the winters of 1999 and 2003 with the aim of visualising and quantifying the degree of spatial overlap between female fur seals and krill harvesting in South Georgia waters. We show that spatial distribution of fur seals around South Georgia is extensive, and that the krill fishery overlaps with small, highly localised areas of available fur seal habitat. From these findings we discuss the implications for management, and future work."
https://openalex.org/W3134477399,"The research on rural population distribution from a climate perspective is rare. Therefore, this study adopts this perspective and uses the ordinary least squares and spatial econometric models to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of the rural population in the Poyang Lake ecological economic zone. Results show that (1) a significant spatial autocorrelation is present in the distribution of rural population, and a spatial correlation exists between the population distribution and climatic factors, (2) the influence of climatic factors on the distribution of rural population in the Poyang Lake ecological economic zone is greater than that of economic factors, and (3) the annual average sunshine and annual average rainfall have a significant negative effect on the distribution of the regional rural population, which is contrary to the expectations., so we then analyze this negative effect on the regional rural population distribution. It is found that (1) the influence of climate factors on the distribution of rural population in lake area is far more than that of economic factors, and more consideration should be given to the influence of climate factors on the population distribution in the lake area, (2) different geographical capital and natural resource endowment, the influence of climate on micro-regional population distribution may be different from the general law, (3) the spatial measurement model which takes spatial dependence into account can reveal the influence of climate on rural population distribution more accurately."
https://openalex.org/W3134542686,"Objective A positive relationship between breastfeeding and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in infants has been suggested due to the presence of BDNF in human milk. This study aimed to determine the relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and BDNF serum levels in Spanish schoolchildren. Methods A cross-sectional analysis including 202 schoolchildren, aged eight to 11 years, from Cuenca, Spain, was conducted. Information on sociodemographic and anthropometric variables, sexual maturation, birth weight and exclusive breastfeeding (‘no exclusive breastfeeding’, and exclusive breastfeeding for ≤6 and &gt;6 months), and BDNF serum levels using an ELISA method were obtained. Covariance analyses (ANCOVA) were conducted to examine the relationship between serological BDNF and exclusive breastfeeding after controlling for potential confounders. Results ANCOVA models showed no significant differences in BDNF levels between children who were exclusively breastfed for more than six months versus those who were not (p &gt; 0.05). No significant differences were observed by age group (eight to nine years versus 10 to 11 years; p &gt; 0.05). Additionally, no clear negative trend in BDNF serum levels according to sexual maturation categories was found (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion These findings suggest that exclusive breastfeeding does not have a significant positive association on BDNF from eight to 11 years, since children who were exclusively breastfed did not have significantly higher BDNF levels than those who were not exclusively breastfed. Likewise, BDNF levels were not found to be negatively affected by hormonal development. Future research should examine the influence of exclusive breastfeeding on BDNF over the different developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W3133877318,"Gastric perforation after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is an infrequent complication. There is lack of evidence regarding the risk factors for this postoperative complication. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of postoperative gastric perforation in patients undergoing CRS for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) and to evaluate risk factors predisposing to this complication.We designed a unicentric retrospective study to identify all patients who underwent an open upfront or interval CRS after a primary diagnosis of PC of different origins between March 2007 and December 2018 at a French Comprehensive Cancer Center. The main outcome was the occurrence of postoperative gastric perforation.Five hundred thirty-three patients underwent a CRS for PC during the study period and 13 (2.4%) presented a postoperative gastric perforation with a mortality rate of 23% (3/13). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 283 (53.1%) patients and 99 (18.6%) received hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). In the univariate analysis, body mass index (BMI), peritoneal cancer index, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and histology were significantly associated with postoperative gastric perforation. After multivariate analysis, BMI (OR [95%CI] = 1.13 [1.05-1.22], p = 0.002) and splenectomy (OR [95%CI] = 26.65 [1.39-509.67], p = 0.029) remained significantly related to the primary outcome.Gastric perforation after CRS is a rare event with a high rate of mortality. While splenectomy and increased BMI are risk factors associated with this complication, HIPEC does not seem to be related. Gastric perforation is probably an ischemic complication due to a multifactorial process. Preventive measures such as preservation of the gastroepiploic arcade and prophylactic suture of the greater gastric curvature require further assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3135184594,"The study of linguistic transfer-understood here in terms of the copying of previous linguistic representations-seeks to reveal how domain-relevant prior language knowledge impacts the acquisition and development of new mental representations more generally. Studying sequential multilingualism offers a natural laboratory to observe cognitive-economical mechanisms that avoid redundancy in language learning. One of the key dividing questions between theories of transfer in sequential multilingualism is the extent of transfer, that is, whether a whole previous grammar is transferred (full transfer) or a potentially different source language is selected for each linguistic property (property-by-property transfer). We adopted a novel methodological approach to this question, examining four different linguistic properties from unrelated domains of grammar across the three languages of a heterogeneous population of highly proficient, early Catalan/Spanish bilinguals with different degrees of language dominance and order of acquisition, at the very beginning of (adult) L3 English. Results are variably complex across the different properties, but compatible with a scenario where one of the previous languages, Catalan, was selected as the basis for the initial L3 English grammar of these speakers. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3134886471,"Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) or Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) suffer from substantial interpersonal dysfunction and have difficulties establishing social bonds. A tendency to form negative first impressions of others could contribute to this by way of reducing approach behavior. We tested whether women with BPD or SAD would show negative impression formation compared to healthy women (HCs). We employed the Thin Slices paradigm and showed videos of 52 authentic target participants to 32 women with BPD, 29 women with SAD, and 37 HCs. We asked participants to evaluate whether different positive or negative adjectives described targets and expected BPD raters to provide the most negative ratings, followed by SAD and HC. BPD and SAD raters both agreed with negative adjectives more often than HCs (e.g., ‘Yes, the person is greedy’), and BPD raters rejected positive adjectives more often (e.g., ‘No, the person is not humble.’). However, BPD and SAD raters did not differ significantly from each other. Additionally, we used the novel process tracing method mouse-tracking to assess the cognitive conflict (via trajectory deviations) raters experienced during decision-making. We hypothesized that HCs would experience more conflict when making unfavorable (versus favorable) evaluations and that this pattern would flip in BPD and SAD. We quantified cognitive conflict via maximum absolute deviations (MADs) of the mouse-trajectories. As hypothesized, HCs showed more conflict when rejecting versus agreeing with positive adjectives. The pattern did not flip in BPD and SAD but was substantially reduced, such that BPD and SAD showed similar levels of conflict when rejecting and agreeing with positive adjectives. Contrary to the hypothesis for BPD and SAD, all three groups experienced substantial conflict when agreeing with negative adjectives. We discuss therapeutic implications of the combined choice and mouse-tracking results."

We previously reported flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery as a predictor of AAA growth. We hence hypothesised that other physical characteristics of the brachial artery correlate with AAA growth. Using a prospectively cohort of AAA patients, we devised a 'brachial artery relaxation index' (BARI) and examined its role as a biomarker for AAA growth. However, no correlation between BARI and future aneurysm growth was observed (p = 0.45). Therefore, our investigations did not substantiate the hypothesis that other physical characteristics of the brachial artery predicts AAA growth."
https://openalex.org/W3135812535,"Fundamental ecological principles of ecosystem-level respiration are extensively applied in greenhouse gas and elemental cycle studies. A laboratory system termed CEMS (Carbon Dioxide Evolution Measurement System), developed to explore microbial biofilm growth and metabolic responses, was evaluated as an early-warning system for microbial disturbances in industrial settings: in (a) potable water system contamination, and (b) bioreactor inhibition. Respiration was detected as CO 2 production, rather than O 2 consumption, including aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Design, thresholds, and benefits of the remote CO 2 monitoring technology were described. Headspace CO 2 correlated with contamination levels, as well as chemical (R 2 &gt; 0.83–0.96) and microbiological water quality indicators (R 2 &gt; 0.78–0.88). Detection thresholds were limiting factors in monitoring drinking water to national and international standards (0 CFU/100 mL fecal coliforms) in both open- (&gt;1500 CFU/mL) and closed-loop CO 2 measuring regimes (&gt;100 CFU/100 mL). However, closed-loop detection thresholds allow for the detection of significant contamination events, and monitoring less stringent systems such as irrigation water (&lt;100 CFU/mL). Whole-system respiration was effectively harnessed as an early-warning system in bioreactor performance monitoring. Models were used to deconvolute biological CO 2 fluctuations from chemical CO 2 dynamics, to optimize this real-time, sustainable, low-waste technology, facilitating timeous responses to biological disturbances in bioreactors."
