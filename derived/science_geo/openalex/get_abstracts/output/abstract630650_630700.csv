However, it is not known whether these changes are also present in individuals with early AD (eAD) or amnestic type mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), an enriched pre-AD population with a higher risk for progressing to dementia. We performed a prospective case-control clinical study to investigate whether optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) parameters in the macula and disc are altered in those with aMCI and eAD.This is a single center study of 32 participants. Individuals with aMCI/eAD (n = 16) were 1:1 matched to cognitively normal controls (n = 16). We evaluated OCTA images of the parafoveal superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and two vascular layers in the peripapillary region, the radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) and superficial vascular complex (SVC). Outcome vascular and structural parameters included VD, vessel length density (VLD), adjusted flow index (AFI) and structural retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. We compared these parameters between the two groups and examined the correlation between OCTA parameters and cognitive performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).Cognitively impaired participants demonstrated statistically significant decrease in parafoveal SCP VD and AFI as compared to controls, but no statistically significant difference in peripapillary parameters. Furthermore, we found a significant positive correlation between MoCA scores for the entire study cohort and both the parafoveal SCP VD and peripapillary RPC VLD.OCTA shows significant decline in parafoveal flow and VD in individuals with early cognitive impairment related to AD, suggesting that these parameters could have potential utility as early disease biomarkers. In contrast, the presence of larger vascular channels in the peripapillary region may have obscured subtle capillary changes in that region. Overall, the correlation between vascular OCTA parameters and cognitive performance supports further OCTA studies in this population."

This represents a fertile ground for the development of Exercise Addiction (EA) alongside other disorders, such as Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). This study aims to explore the diffusion of EA in fitness settings in the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Hungary and the previously unexplored association with appearance anxiety, BDD, self-esteem and the use of fitness supplements.A large cross-sectional sample (N = 1711) was surveyed in fitness settings using the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI) and Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale (RSE) in addition to questions surrounding the use of fitness supplements.Compulsive exercise, appearance anxiety and low self-esteem were present in this sample according to the psychometric measures used (EAI, AAI, RSE). 11.7% scored over the cut off for EA, with alarming peaks in the Netherlands (20.9%) and the United Kingdom (16.1%). 38.5% were found at risk of BDD, mainly female (47.2%). 39.8% used fitness enhancing supplements without medical consultation (95.5%). This cohort of supplement users scored higher in both EAI and AAI. The logistic regression model revealed a strong association between the consumption of sport products and the level of EA across the sample with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.03. Other co-variable factors among female were appearance anxiety (AAI; OR 1.59) and to a lesser extent self-esteem (RSE) (OR 1.08).This study identified a high risk of EA, appearance anxiety and BDD amongst a cohort of gym users internationally. The previously-unexplored association between these disorders and the unsupervised use of a variety of fitness products, including illicit drugs, highlights the need for informed and integrated responses targeting such vulnerable individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2951506786,"Myosteatosis is the pathologic accumulation of lipid that can occur in conjunction with atrophy and fibrosis following skeletal muscle injury. Little is known about the mechanisms by which lipid accumulates in myosteatosis, but many clinical studies have demonstrated that the degree of lipid infiltration negatively correlates with muscle function and regeneration. Our objective was to determine the pathologic changes that result in lipid accumulation in injured muscle fibers. We used a rat model of rotator cuff injury in this study because the rotator cuff muscle group is particularly prone to the development of myosteatosis after injury. Muscles were collected from uninjured controls or 10, 30, or 60 d after injury and analyzed using a combination of muscle fiber contractility assessments, RNA sequencing, and undirected metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics, along with bioinformatics techniques to identify potential pathways and cellular processes that are dysregulated after rotator cuff tear. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that mitochondrial function was likely disrupted after injury. Based on these findings and given the role that mitochondria play in lipid metabolism, we then performed targeted biochemical and imaging studies and determined that mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced fatty acid oxidation likely leads to the accumulation of lipid in myosteatosis.—Gumucio, J.

https://openalex.org/W2925894164,"The subcellular mechanism by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induce apoptosis in gastric cancer and normal mucosal cells is elusive because of the diverse cyclooxygenase-independent effects of these drugs. Using human gastric carcinoma cells (AGSs) and a rat gastric injury model, here we report that the NSAID indomethacin activates the protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ)–p38 MAPK (p38)–dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) pathway and thereby disrupts the physiological balance of mitochondrial dynamics by promoting mitochondrial hyper-fission and dysfunction leading to apoptosis. Notably, DRP1 knockdown or SB203580-induced p38 inhibition reduced indomethacin-induced damage to AGSs. Indomethacin impaired mitochondrial dynamics by promoting fissogenic activation and mitochondrial recruitment of DRP1 and down-regulating fusogenic optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and mitofusins in rat gastric mucosa. Consistent with OPA1 maintaining cristae architecture, its down-regulation resulted in EM-detectable cristae deformity. Deregulated mitochondrial dynamics resulting in defective mitochondria were evident from enhanced Parkin expression and mitochondrial proteome ubiquitination. Indomethacin ultimately induced mitochondrial metabolic and bioenergetic crises in the rat stomach, indicated by compromised fatty acid oxidation, reduced complex I– associated electron transport chain activity, and ATP depletion. Interestingly, Mdivi-1, a fission-preventing mito-protective drug, reversed indomethacin-induced DRP1 phosphorylation on Ser-616, mitochondrial proteome ubiquitination, and mitochondrial metabolic crisis. Mdivi-1 also prevented indomethacin-induced mitochondrial macromolecular damage, caspase activation, mucosal inflammation, and gastric mucosal injury. Our results identify mitochondrial hyper-fission as a critical and common subcellular event triggered by indomethacin that promotes apoptosis in both gastric cancer and normal mucosal cells, thereby contributing to mucosal injury."

The androgen receptor (AR) antagonist enzalutamide is a Food and Drug Administration–approved drug for treatment of patients with late-stage prostate cancer and is currently under clinical study for early-stage prostate cancer treatment. After a short positive response period, tumors will develop drug resistance. In this study using RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analyses, we observed that NOTCH signaling is a deregulated pathway in enzalutamide-resistant cells. NOTCH2 and c-MYC gene expression positively correlated with AR expression in samples from patient with hormone refractory disease in which AR expression levels correspond to those typically observed in enzalutamide resistance. Cleaved NOTCH1, HES1 (Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1), and c-MYC protein expression levels are elevated in two enzalutamide-resistant cell lines, MR49F and C4-2R, indicating NOTCH signaling activation. Moreover, inhibition of the overexpressed ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) in the resistant cells induces an exclusive reduction in cleaved NOTCH1 expression. Furthermore, exposure of enzalutamide-resistant cells to both PF-03084014 and enzalutamide increased cell death, decreased colony formation ability, and resensitized cells to enzalutamide. Knockdown of NOTCH1 in C4-2R increased enzalutamide sensitivity by decreasing cell proliferation and increasing cleaved PARP expression. In a 22RV1 xenograft model, PF-03084014 and enzalutamide decreased tumor growth through reducing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis. These results indicate that NOTCH1 signaling may contribute to enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer, and inhibition of NOTCH signaling can resensitize resistant cells to enzalutamide.

https://openalex.org/W2925819582,"The purpose of the current study was to establish an in vitro model for osteoarthritis (OA) by co-culture of osteochondral and synovial membrane explants. Osteochondral explants were cultured alone (control-1) or in co-culture with synovial membrane explants (control-2) in standard culture medium or with interleukin-1β (IL1β) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) added to the culture medium (OA-model-1 = osteochondral explant; OA-model-2 = osteochondroal-synovial explant). In addition, in OA-model groups a 2-mm partial-thickness defect was created in the centre of the cartilage explant. Changes in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes (collagen type-1 (Col1), Col2, Col10 and aggrecan) as well as presence and quantity of inflammatory marker genes (IL6, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), MMP3, MMP13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with-thrombospondin-motif-5 (ADAMTS5) were analysed by immunohistochemistry, qPCR and ELISA. To monitor the activity of classically-activated pro-inflammatory (M1) versus alternatively-activated anti-inflammatory/repair (M2) synovial macrophages, the nitric oxide/urea ratio in the supernatant of osteochondral-synovial explant co-cultures was determined. In both OA-model groups immunohistochemistry and qPCR showed a significantly increased expression of MMPs and IL6 compared to their respective control group. ELISA results confirmed a statistically significant increase in MMP1and MMP3 production over the culturing period. In the osteochondral-synovial explant co-culture OA-model the nitric oxide/urea ratio was increased compared to the control group, indicating a shift toward M1 synovial macrophages. In summary, chemical damage (TNFα, IL1β) in combination with a partial-thickness cartilage defect elicits an inflammatory response similar to naturally occurring OA in osteochondral explants with and without osteochondral-synovial explant co-cultures and OA-model-2 showing a closer approximation of OA due to the additional shift of synovial macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype."

In many cases, secretion of IL-1 cytokines appears to be closely coupled to cell death, yet the secretory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the secretion of the three best-characterized members of the IL-1 superfamily, IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-18, in a range of conditions and cell types, including murine bone marrow–derived and peritoneal macrophages, human monocyte–derived macrophages, HeLa cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We discovered that IL-1β and IL-18 share a common secretory pathway that depends upon membrane permeability and can operate in the absence of complete cell lysis and cell death. We also found that the pathway regulating the trafficking of IL-1α is distinct from the pathway regulating IL-1β and IL-18. Although the release of IL-1α could also be dissociated from cell death, it was independent of the effects of the membrane-stabilizing agent punicalagin, which inhibited both IL-1β and IL-18 release. These results reveal that in addition to their role as danger signals released from dead cells, IL-1 family cytokines can be secreted in the absence of cell death. We propose that models used in the study of IL-1 release should be considered context-dependently.

IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-18 are initially produced as precursor pro-forms. In cells of hematopoietic lineage, such as macrophages, expression of precursor forms of IL-1β and IL-1α occurs after stimulation of membrane pattern recognition receptors such as TLR4, which can be activated by bacterial endotoxin for example, whereas pro-IL-18 is constitutively expressed. Both precursor forms of IL-1β and IL-18 are cleaved directly by the protease caspase-1, which then also, indirectly, influences Ca2+- and calpain-dependent processing of pro-IL-1α (3Gross O. Yazdi A.S. Thomas C.J. Masin M. Heinz L.X. Guarda G. Quadroni M. Drexler S.K. Tschopp J.

Activation of caspase-1 occurs after the assembly of macromolecular protein complexes called inflammasomes, upon which caspase-1 is activated. Inflammasomes are formed by a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, the best-studied of which is NLRP3, which nucleates oligomerization of an adaptor protein, ASC, into an inflammasome complex (4Latz E. Xiao T.S. Stutz A. Activation and regulation of the inflammasomes.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 (23702978): 397-41110.1038/nri3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). A consequence of inflammasome activation is an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis (5Kovacs S.B. Miao E.A. Gasdermins: effectors of pyroptosis.Trends Cell Biol. 2017; 27 (28619472): 673-68410.1016/j.tcb.2017.05.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Thus, a consequence of studying IL-1 release after inflammasome activation has been the concomitant death of the secreting cell, so it has long been considered that IL-1β release occurred through membrane rupture and lysis (6Cullen S.P.

However, there are numerous examples, namely in human monocytes and neutrophils, where inflammasome activation can drive the release of IL-1β in the absence of cell death (8Gaidt M.M. Ebert T.S.

The mechanism through which IL-18 and IL-1α are secreted and the question of whether they are common with IL-1β remain underexplored. Here, we show that IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-1α can be secreted when cell lysis is prevented and that IL-1β and IL-18 share a common mechanism that relies on gasdermin D–dependent plasma membrane permeabilization. Here we set out to test the initial hypothesis that release of IL-1β following NLRP3 inflammasome activation depended on a change in membrane permeability and not cell lysis. To interrogate this, we used the membrane-stabilizing reagent punicalagin. Punicalagin is a complex polyphenolic compound isolated from pomegranate extract that we previously reported to inhibit ATP-induced IL-1β release and uptake of the dye Yo-PRO-1 (as a measure of membrane permeability) with comparable potency and kinetics. Punicalagin also inhibits Yo-PRO-1 uptake and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in response to membrane detergents digitonin and Triton X-100. Punicalagin also inhibits release of IL-1β independent of the inflammasome (10Martín-Sanchez F. Diamond C. Zeitler M. Gomez A.I. Baroja-Mazo A. Bagnall J. Spiller D. White M. Daniels M.J. Mortellaro A. Peńalver M. Paszek P. Steringer J.P. Nickel W. Brough D. Pelegrín P.

However, punicalagin is also reported to have additional effects, including potent anti-oxidant activity in macrophages (15Xu X. Li H. Hou X. Li D. He S. Wan C. Yin P. Liu M. Liu F. Xu J. Punicalagin induces Nrf2/HO-1 expression via upregulation of PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress in RAW264.7 macrophages.Mediators Inflamm. 2015; 2015 (25969626)38021810.1155/2015/380218Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), so some care must be taken when interpreting its effects. We also used the cytoprotectant glycine, which does not inhibit IL-1β release but limits cell lysis (16Verhoef P.A. Kertesy S.B. Lundberg K. Kahlenberg J.M. Dubyak G.R. Inhibitory effects of chloride on the activation of caspase-1, IL-1β secretion, and cytolysis by the P2X7 receptor.J.

We initially tested the effects of punicalagin (50 μm) and glycine (5 mm) directly on membrane permeability. LPS-primed (1 μg/ml, 2 h) immortalized mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages (iBMDMs) were incubated with CellTox Green dye, which would label cells after permeabilization, and were then incubated with vehicle, the NLRP3-activating stimulus nigericin (10 μm), or nigericin and either punicalagin or glycine, with the effects on dye uptake monitored by microscopy (for 100 min). In untreated cells, there was no dye uptake, whereas nigericin treatment caused a robust increase in fluorescence (Fig. 1A). Glycine had no effect on nigericin-induced dye uptake, whereas punicalagin significantly delayed it, suggesting that these two reagents were having significantly different effects on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Sixty minutes of nigericin treatment of LPS-primed iBMDMs caused significant cell lysis, as measured by release of the cytoplasmic protein LDH (Fig. 1B). Nigericin-induced LDH release at 60 min was completely inhibited by both punicalagin and glycine. At 90 min of nigericin treatment, there was more LDH released, and this was still significantly decreased by punicalagin and glycine (Fig. 1B), suggesting that both reagents had a protective effect. We next assessed the effects of punicalagin and glycine on nigericin-induced IL-1β release. Sixty minutes of nigericin treatment caused significant release of IL-1β that was partially inhibited by both punicalagin and glycine (Fig. 1C). At 90 min of nigericin treatment, punicalagin still decreased IL-1β release to some degree, but the inhibitory effect of glycine observed at 60 min was absent (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that whereas punicalagin was an effective inhibitor of IL-1β release, glycine slowed its release, likely by preventing release due to cell lysis. We then tested the effects of punicalagin and glycine on inflammasome-dependent processing of pro-IL-1β and gasdermin D by Western blotting of combined cell lysates and supernatants after nigericin treatment. Neither punicalagin nor glycine blocked the caspase-1–dependent processing of pro-IL-1β or gasdermin D, suggesting that they did not inhibit the inflammasome (Fig. 1D).

Recent research has demonstrated that microglia form inflammasomes during Alzheimer’s disease (19Venegas C. Kumar S. Franklin B.S. Dierkes T. Brinkschulte R. Tejera D. Vieira-Saecker A. Schwartz S. Santarelli F. Kummer M.P. Griep A. Gelpi E. Beilharz M. Riedel D. Golenbock D.T. et al.Microglia-derived ASC specks cross-seed amyloid-β in Alzheimer’s disease.Nature. 2017; 552 (29293211): 355-36110.1038/nature25158Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), and inflammasomes are implicated in the progression of a number of other neurological and neurodegenerative conditions (20Swanton T. Cook J. Beswick J.A. Freeman S. Lawrence C.B. Brough D. Is targeting the inflammasome a way forward for neuroscience drug discovery?.SLAS Discov. 2018; 23 (29969573): 991-101710.1177/2472555218786210PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the relationship between IL-1β release and membrane permeability and cell death in cultures of glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) isolated from the brains of mice. These mixed glial cultures from the brains of neonates have microglial inflammasome responses very similar to those from primary microglia isolated from adult mice (21Redondo-Castro E. Faust D. Fox S. Baldwin A.G. Osborne S. Haley M.J. Karran E. Nuthall H. Atkinson P.J. Dawson L.A. Routledge C. Allan S.M. Freeman S. Brownlees J. Brough D. Development of a characterised tool kit for the interrogation of NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent responses.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 (29618797)566710.1038/s41598-018-24029-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). LPS-primed (1 μg/ml, 3 h) glial cells were treated with the NLRP3 inflammasome activator nigericin (10 μm, 1 h), which caused robust cell death, and this was significantly reduced by punicalagin and by glycine (Fig. 1E). Nigericin also induced release of IL-1β from glial cells, which was inhibited by punicalagin (50 μm) but not by glycine (5 mm) (Fig. 1F). These data confirm the data obtained using the iBMDM cultures, which suggested that the release of IL-1β depends on a change in membrane permeability rather than cell lysis. These data also suggest that mechanisms of inflammasome activation and IL-1β release under these conditions are common between macrophages and microglia. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome often forms an ASC speck, which itself can be released and is known to have pro-inflammatory effects in the extracellular space (22Baroja-Mazo A. Martín-Sánchez F. Gomez A.I. Martínez C.M. Amores-Iniesta J. Compan V. Barberà-Cremades M. Yagüe J. Ruiz-Ortiz E. Antón J. Buján S. Couillin I. Brough D. Arostegui J.I. Pelegrín P. The NLRP3 inflammasome is released as a particulate danger signal that amplifies the inflammatory response.Nat.

Watremez W. Fasolino V. Booth S.J. White C.S. Baldwin A.G. Freeman S. Wong R. Latta C. Yu S. Jackson J. Fischer N. et al.Fenamate NSAIDs inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and protect against Alzheimer's disease in rodent models.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27509875)1250410.1038/ncomms12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), we observed that the number of visible ASC specks increased with nigericin treatment (10 μm) and that the number of visible specks increased further when the cells were treated with nigericin plus punicalagin (50 μm) or glycine (5 mm) (Fig. 2A). We then repeated this experiment, except we included the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, which allowed ASC speck formation, but inhibited potential ASC speck loss through caspase-1–dependent pyroptotic cell death. Incubation of the cells with Z-VAD increased the number of specks produced by nigericin treatment but had no further effect on the increase of ASC specks observed in nigericin-treated cells in the presence of punicalagin or glycine (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that ASC specks are released by pyroptotic cell lysis and that both punicalagin and glycine inhibited this release. This further supports a regulated mechanism for IL-1β release dependent upon a change in membrane permeability, as its release was unaffected by glycine (Fig. 1). We investigated the release of ASC further by analyzing the oligomeric forms released into the cell supernatant using cross-linking and Western blotting. LPS-treated iBMDMs did not release any ASC into the supernatant (Fig. 2C). Nigericin treatment caused the release of a monomeric and a range of oligomeric ASC forms, which was reduced by punicalagin treatment (Fig. 2C). Glycine treatment inhibited the release of high-molecular weight oligomeric ASC, but lower-molecular weight forms were released (Fig. 2C). This suggested that monomeric ASC may follow the same pathway out of the cell as IL-1β. The inflammasome inhibitor NBC6 inhibited the release of all forms of ASC, confirming that its release was inflammasome-dependent (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that oligomeric ASC and ASC specks are released by pyroptotic cell lysis but that changes in membrane permeability allow the release of monomeric ASC. Western blotting of combined cell lysates and supernatants after nigericin treatment confirmed this, showing that punicalagin and glycine did not inhibit ASC oligomerization in response to nigericin, whereas the inflammasome inhibitor NBC6 did (Fig. 2D). IL-18 is also produced as a precursor pro-form and is directly regulated by the inflammasome and caspase-1. However, the mechanisms underpinning release of IL-18 are poorly understood. In these studies, we used primary human monocyte–derived macrophage cultures (MDMs), which also allowed us to interrogate the release pathway in human cells. MDMs were primed with LPS (1 μg/ml, 4 h) and then stimulated with nigericin (10 μm, 45 min) to induce release of IL-1β and IL-18. Under these conditions, nigericin induced release of both IL-1β and IL-18, and in both cases release was inhibited by a 15-min pre-incubation with punicalagin (25 μm) (Fig. 3, A and B). Under these conditions, punicalagin did not significantly reduce nigericin-induced LDH release (Fig. 3C). Under the same conditions, incubation with glycine (5 mm) did not inhibit nigericin-induced IL-1β or IL-18 release from MDMs (Fig. 3, D and E) but did inhibit nigericin-induced LDH release (Fig. 3F), suggesting that the release of IL-18 was also dependent upon a change in membrane permeability. These data also suggest that IL-1β release after NLRP3 inflammasome activation is common in mouse and human macrophages, highlighting that under these conditions the mouse BMDMs are representative of a range of macrophage IL-1 release models. Release of IL-1α can also be regulated by inflammasomes, albeit indirectly (3Gross O. Yazdi A.S. Thomas C.J. Masin M. Heinz L.X. Guarda G. Quadroni M. Drexler S.K. Tschopp J. Inflammasome activators induce interleukin-1α secretion via distinct pathways with differential requirement for the protease function of caspase-1.Immunity. 2012; 36 (22444631): 388-40010.1016/j.immuni.2012.01.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Release of IL-1α is thought to be dependent upon Ca2+-activated calpain proteases (3Gross O. Yazdi A.S. Thomas C.J. Masin M. Heinz L.X. Guarda G. Quadroni M. Drexler S.K. Tschopp J. Inflammasome activators induce interleukin-1α secretion via distinct pathways with differential requirement for the protease function of caspase-1.Immunity. 2012; 36 (22444631): 388-40010.1016/j.immuni.2012.01.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), although a number of other proteases are known to also cleave pro-IL-1α (25Clancy D.M. Sullivan G.P. Moran H.B.T. Henry C.M. Reeves E.P. McElvaney N.G. Lavelle E.C. Martin S.J. Extracellular neutrophil proteases are efficient regulators of IL-1, IL-33, and IL-36 cytokine activity but poor effectors of microbial killing.Cell Rep. 2018; 22 (29539422): 2937-2950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In primary mouse peritoneal macrophages primed with LPS (1 μg/ml, 2 h) and treated with NLRP3 inflammasome activator ATP (30 min) or MSU or CPPD crystals (250 μg/ml, 1 h), there was a release of both mature IL-1α and mature IL-1β into the culture supernatants (Fig. 4A). Incubation of the cells with calpain inhibitor III (50 μm) or in Ca2+-free buffer with subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation by ATP or by MSU or CPPD crystals inhibited the release of mature IL-1α but not IL-1β (Fig. 4A), highlighting the divergence of the secretory signaling pathways. Whereas the pharmacological data produced by us and others has strongly suggested that a calpain protease is required for pro-IL-1α processing, genetic proof for this is lacking. To address this, we generated a reconstituted cellular model of IL-1α secretion. Macrophage cells are difficult to transfect, and they respond to DNA with inflammasome activation. Thus, we investigated whether we could model IL-1α release in easy-to-transfect HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected to express pro-IL-1α-GFP and were then treated with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (10 μm, 1 h) to induce calpain activation and IL-1α processing and release (Fig. 4B). In this model, release of mature IL-1α was also inhibited by calpain inhibitor III (40 μm) and by the removal of extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the pathways of IL-1α processing and release in our reconstituted HeLa cell model are representative of the pathways of IL-1α release in primary macrophages (Fig. 4B). There are 14 members of the calpain family in mammals, with calpains 1 and 2 the best characterized (26Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83 (12843408): 731-80110.1152/physrev.00029.2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (2362) Google Scholar). We therefore knocked down expression of calpain 1, calpain 2, or both calpains 1 and 2 in HeLa cells using siRNAs that were transfected to express pro-IL-1α-GFP and then treated them with ionomycin to induce calpain activation and mature IL-1α release (Fig. 4C). We were able to selectively knock down expression of calpain 1 and calpain 2 (Fig. 4C). Knockdown of either calpain inhibited release of mature IL-1α as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 4C), confirming the importance of calpain to this pathway and suggesting that both calpains 1 and 2 can process pro-IL-1α. This was further confirmed by ELISA of the HeLa cell supernatants after ionomycin treatment, which contained significantly less IL-1α after calpain knockdown (Fig. 4, D–F). Calpain knockdown also significantly reduced ionomycin-induced cell death (Fig. 4, G–I). IL-1α may be released and processed as a consequence of cell death (27Afonina I.S. Tynan G.A. Logue S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2930883569,"Background Tuberculosis remains a major public-health problem in the world, despite several efforts to improve case identification and treatment compliance. It is well known cause of ill-health among millions of people each year and ranks as the second leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide. Despite implementation of the World health organization recommended strategy, the reductions in the incidence of TB have been minimal in high burden countries. Objectives and methods A case control study was carried out to assess the risk factors of TB, where cases were newly registered bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB patients with age greater than 15 years who present at twenty health centres in Addis Ababa. Controls were age and sex matched attendees who presented in the same health centers for non-TB health problems. Results A total of 260 cases and 260 controls were enrolled in the study and 45.8% of cases and 46.2% of controls were in the 26–45 years age bracket. According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, seven variables were found to be independent predictors for the occurrence of TB after controlling possible confounders. Patients who live in house with no window or one window were almost two times more likely to develop tuberculosis compared to people whose house has multiple windows (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI:1.06, 3.07). Previous history of hospital admission was found to pose risk almost more than three times (AOR = 3.39; 95% CI: 1.64–7.03). Having a household member who had TB was shown to increase risk of developing TB by three fold (AOR = 3.00; 95% CI: 1.60, 5.62). The study showed that illiterate TB patients were found to be more than twice more likely to develop TB compared to subjects who can atleast read and write (AOR, 95% CI = 2.15, 1.05, 4.40). Patients with household income of less than 1000 birrs per month were more than two times more likely to develop TB compared to those who had higher income (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.78). Smoking has also been identified as important risk factor for developing TB by four times (AOR = 4.43; 95% CI: 2.10, 9.3). BCG was found to be protective against TB reducing the risk by one-third (AOR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.54). Conclusion This study showed that TB is more common among the most agile and economically active age group, and number of windows, history of hospital admission, a household member who had TB, illiteracy, low household income and smoking and lack of BCG scar were identified as independent risk factors. Therefore it is imperative that the TB control effort need a strategy to address socio economic issues such as poverty, overcrowding, smoking, and infection control at health care facilities level is an important intervention to prevent transmission of TB within the facilities."

In this study, we have identified five small molecules, T138067, N,N′-ethylene-bis(iodoacetamide) (EBI), 3The abbreviations used are: EBIN,N′-ethylene-bis(iodoacetamide)AITCallyl isothiocyanateDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidePPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketonePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinIRESinternal ribosome entry siteMSCVmurine stem cell virus. allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), T0070907, and T007-1, a T0070907 derivative, with diverse structures that promote tubulin degradation via covalent binding to Cys-239 of β-tubulin. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that T007-1 promotes tubulin degradation with high selectivity. Mass spectrometry findings demonstrated that both T007-1 and T0070907 bind covalently to Cys-239 of β-tubulin. Furthermore, T007-1 exerted a degradative effect on β2-, β4-, and β5(β)-tubulin isoforms, which possess a cysteine residue at position 239, but not β3- and β6-tubulin isoforms with serine at this position or mutant β-tubulin with a C239S substitution. The collective results suggest that this covalent binding activity of T007-1 accounts for its tubulin degradation effect. Notably, three small molecules (T138067, EBI, and AITC) reported to bind covalently to Cys-239 of β-tubulin also induced tubulin degradation while exerting no effect on mutant β-tubulin with C239S. All five small molecules identified in this study with totally different structures effectively promoted tubulin degradation by binding covalently to Cys-239 of β-tubulin. Based on the collective results, we propose that these small-molecule tubulin-degradation agents exert their effects via covalent modification of Cys-239 of β-tubulin and constitute a third novel class of tubulin inhibitors.

T0070907, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) inhibitor (Fig. 1A), promotes proteasome-dependent tubulin degradation and exerts anticancer effects on colorectal carcinoma cells (13Harris G.

J. Cancer. 2007; 120 (17096328): 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying T0070907-mediated tubulin degradation remains to be established. To uncover the associated mechanisms and obtain anticancer lead compounds with improved activity, a series of T0070907 derivatives were synthesized. T007-1 (Fig. 1A, supporting methods), one of the T0070907 derivatives, showed better anticancer activity than the parent compound against the human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, HeLa, and human colon colorectal carcinoma cell line, Hct116 (Fig. 1B). Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of T007-1-treated HeLa cells showed that T007-1 induced suppression of the protein levels of α- and β-tubulin isoforms with high specificity. The top four most down-regulated proteins among the 1114 identified proteins were α- and β-tubulin isoforms (β, β4B, β8, and α1; Fig. 1C, supporting Data Set 1). Tubulin down-regulation was confirmed via immunofluorescence staining of T007-1-treated HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, HeLa cells treated with T007-1 showed little tubulin staining (green staining with anti-α-tubulin antibody). Immunoblot analysis revealed that T007-1 promotes α-tubulin and β-tubulin degradation in HeLa and Hct116 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). Our results indicate that T007-1 mediates down-regulation of tubulin with high selectivity. To determine whether T007-1 affects α-tubulin and β-tubulin mRNA expression, a quantitative PCR assay was performed. As shown in Figs. 2, A and B, T007-1 induced time-dependent down-regulation of α-tubulin and β-tubulin proteins in both HeLa and Hct116 cells but exerted no inhibitory effects on the corresponding mRNA levels. In fact, α-tubulin and β-tubulin mRNA levels were increased following reduction of the corresponding protein levels in both cell lines treated with T007-1. Our results suggest that α-tubulin and β-tubulin down-regulation by T007-1 is a post-transcriptional event and gene expression patterns are negatively regulated in response to the levels of the corresponding proteins. As T0070907 is reported to promote α-tubulin and β-tubulin degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway, we examined whether T007-1 induces degradation via a similar mechanism. Pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, completely blocked α-tubulin and β-tubulin degradation by T007-1 (Fig. 2C), confirming similar proteasome-dependent activity to the parent compound. Because conventional tubulin inhibitors, such as paclitaxel and colchicine, inhibit spindle formation and induce G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in cancer cells (2Stanton R.A. Gernert K.M. Nettles J.H. Aneja R. Drugs that target dynamic microtubules: a new molecular perspective.Med. Res. Rev. 2011; 31 (21381049): 443-48110.1002/med.20242Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 21Yang J. Yan W.

As depicted in Fig. 3A, T007-1 promoted cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner in HeLa and Hct116 cells. Tubulin inhibitors are reported to promote apoptosis in cancer cells after induction of G2/M phase cell cycle arrest (22Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Microtubules, microtubule-interfering agents and apoptosis.Apoptosis. 2003; 8 (12975575): 413-45010.1023/A:1025513106330Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated the effects of T007-1 on two apoptosis marker proteins, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. T007-1 promoted time-dependent cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, clearly indicative of apoptosis induction (Fig. 3B). T007-1-induced cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, further suggesting that the apoptotic pathway is caspase-dependent. Based on these findings, we conclude that T007-1 induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells in a similar manner to conventional tubulin inhibitors. As T007-1 promotes tubulin degradation at the post-transcriptional stage, we examined whether the agent directly binds tubulin with the aid of a microscale thermophoresis assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, both colchicine and T007-1 interacted with tubulin with KD values of 4.96 ± 1.93 and 0.39 ± 0.11 μm, respectively. We further conducted an in vitro tubulin polymerization assay to determine the effects of T007-1 on tubulin assembly by measuring the increase in absorbance of tubulin at 340 nm and 37 °C using colchicine and paclitaxel as comparative agents. Paclitaxel clearly promoted, whereas colchicine inhibited tubulin polymerization (Fig. 4B). Analogous to colchicine, T007-1 inhibited tubulin polymerization in a dose-dependent manner. Earlier studies have shown that T0070907 binds covalently to Cys-313 of PPARγ, resulting in inhibition of its activity (14Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K. Nakamura M. Miao S. Cao P. Learned R.M. Chen J.L. Li Y. T0070907, a selective ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, functions as an antagonist of biochemical and cellular activities.J. Biol.

Because T007-1 is a T0070907 derivative, we speculated that this compound may similarly form covalent interactions with tubulin. T007-1 was incubated with purified tubulin heterodimers, digested with trypsin, and subjected to LC electrospray ionization tandem MS (LC-ESI MS/MS) for analysis. As expected, T007-1 (molecular mass of 474.5 Da) bound the 217LTTPTYGDLNHLVSATMSGVTTCLR241 peptide of β-tubulin (leading to mass shift from 2652 to 3089 Da with a 437-Da mass change in the modified tryptic peptide because of loss of one molecule of HCl (36.5) to allow for the formation of the S-C bond). This finding indicates that the fluorophenyl of T007-1 is the key functional group in covalent binding to tubulin. Fragmentation of this peptide revealed that T007-1 attaches to Cys-239 in β-tubulin (Fig. 4C). Using the same method, we showed that T0070907 similarly binds covalently to Cys-239 of β-tubulin (Fig. 4D). Because Cys-239 is adjacent to the colchicine site, we additionally conducted a competition assay. The two colchicine-binding site inhibitors (colchicine and plinabulin) suppressed tubulin degradation induced by T007-1 (Fig. 4E), suggesting that binding of T007-1 to tubulin underlies its degradation activity. We further investigated whether T007-1-induced tubulin degradation is mediated through binding to Cys-239. Data obtained from label-free quantitative proteomic analysis showed no degradation activity of T007-1 on β6-tubulin in which cysteine was substituted with serine at position 239 (Fig. 5A). Immunoblot analysis consistently revealed that T007-1 specifically promotes degradation of β2-, β4-, and β5-tubulin isoforms containing cysteine at position 239, whereas exerting no effect on β3- and β6-tubulin isoforms, which possess serine at this position (Fig. 5B). These findings gave rise to the speculation that covalent modification of Cys-239 by T007-1 contributes to its tubulin degradation activity. To validate this theory, a FLAG tag was fused to the C termini of WT and C239S β-tubulin genes, which were subsequently cloned into MSCV-IRES-GFP expression vectors. FLAG-wt or FLAG-C239S β-tubulin and GFP were co-expressed in HeLa cells. T007-1 clearly promoted FLAG-wt β-tubulin degradation while exerting no effect on FLAG-C239S β-tubulin (Fig. 5C), confirming that Cys-239 is necessary for tubulin degradation induced by T007-1. As determined from LC-ESI MS/MS, fluorophenyl of T007-1 was the key functional group in covalent binding to Cys-239. We further synthesized a T007-1 derivative, 180422 (Fig. 5D, the synthesis method is described in supporting methods), lacking fluorophenyl that could not bind covalently to Cys-239 of β-tubulin. As expected, 180422 displayed loss of anti-proliferative and tubulin degradation activities (Fig. 5, E and F). Our collective data suggest that covalent modification of Cys-239 is a prerequisite for tubulin degradation by T007-1. Next, we investigated whether tubulin degradation is a common biochemical consequence of covalent modification of Cys-239 in β-tubulin by small molecules. To this end, small molecules reported to form covalent interactions with Cys-239 of β-tubulin, such as T138067 and EBI (Fig. 6A), were selected for analysis (23Shan B. Medina J.C. Santha E.

Similar to T0070907 and T007-1, T138067 and EBI promoted tubulin degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Pretreatment with colchicine inhibited T138067- and EBI-induced tubulin degradation (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, T138067 and EBI specifically promoted degradation of FLAG-wt β-tubulin and not that of FLAG-C239S β-tubulin (Fig. 6D). These results support the theory that covalent modification of Cys-239 by T138067 and EBI plays a role in tubulin degradation by these two compounds. Isothiocyanates, nonspecific tubulin cysteine modifiers, reversibly bind to Cys-127, Cys-347, and Cys-376 of α-tubulin and Cys-12, Cys-239, Cys-303, and Cys-354 of β-tubulin (12Geng F. Tang L. Li Y.

However, the specific cysteine residues responsible for the degradation effect remain to be established. Here, we examined the involvement of Cys-239 in isothiocyanate-induced tubulin degradation using one of the isothiocyanates, AITC (Fig. 6E). Similar to T138067 and EBI, AITC promoted FLAG-wt β-tubulin degradation but had no effect on FLAG-C239S β-tubulin (Fig. 6F). Our results clearly demonstrate that small molecules that covalently bind Cys-239 of β-tubulin promote tubulin degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2926064662,"Purpose To examine the foveal structure and vasculature in eyes with an idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM). Methods Forty-nine eyes of 48 patients with an idiopathic ERM were studied. The superficial foveal avascular zone (FAZ) was measured by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA; RTVue XR Avanti, Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA), and the central foveal thickness (CFT) was measured by swept source OCT (DRI-OCT, Topcon, Japan). Twenty eyes underwent vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, and the FAZ and CFT were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. Forty-nine eyes of 49 age-matched healthy subjects were also examined as control. Results The FAZ in eyes with an ERM was significantly smaller than that of the control eyes (0.188±0.16 mm2 vs 0.328±0.14 mm2, P<0.01). The CFT in eyes with an ERM was significantly thicker than that of control eyes (315±0.14 μm vs 193±0.14 μm, P<0.01). The size of the FAZ was strongly correlated with the CFT (ERM, R = -0.753; control, R = -0.61, both P<0.01). The postoperative size of the FAZ was not significantly different from the preoperative size (0.115 mm2 vs 0.128 mm2, P = 0.17) but the CFT was significantly thinner (370 μm vs 288 μm, P<0.01) after the vitrectomy with ILM peeling in 20 eyes. Conclusions The results indicate that an ERM might affect the morphology and vasculature of not only the inner but also the outer retina before and after vitrectomy with ILM peeling. The FAZ area might have been affected by the ILM peeling."

A convenience sampling approach was employed in selecting 38 slums from 675 un-notified slums across four geographic zones. Ten percent of the households in each slum site were selected from each zone, and one household member was interviewed, based on their availability and fulfilment of the eligibility criteria. Eligible individuals included those aged 18 years and above, who were resident in the selected slums and provided consent. Individuals with mental or physical challenges were excluded. A total sample of 907 study participants were included. Results showed that 43% (n = 393) of the participants were food insecure. More than half were females (73%, n = 285), who had not completed any schooling (51%, n = 202). One-third (n = 128) resided in the Northern Region of Delhi. SDG-related predictors of food insecurity included: household educational level (SDG 4 Quality education) (p = 0.03), coverage of health service needs (SDG 3 Good health and well-being) (p = 0.0002), electricity needs (SDG 7 affordable and clean energy) (p<0.0001), and employment needs (SDG 8 Decent and economic growth) (p = 0.003). Having healthcare needs that were partially or fully met was equally associated with higher food insecurity: this could be attributed to high healthcare costs and the lack of federal subsidies in un-notified slums, collectively contributing to high out-of-pocket health costs. Failure to fully meet employment needs was also significantly associated with higher food insecurity. However, met needs for electricity, finance, women’s safety and satisfactory family relationships, were associated with lower food insecurity. Household predictors of food insecurity included: number of household members, and the presence of physically disabled household members. Necessary interventions should include connecting food insecure households to existing social services such as India’s Public Distribution System, and multi-sector partnerships to address the existing challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2933245010,"DNA damage response Ser/Thr kinases, including ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related (ATR), control cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. ATR is activated by ETAA1 activator of ATR kinase (ETAA1) or DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1). Both ETAA1 and TOPBP1 contain experimentally defined ATR activation domains (AADs) that are mostly unstructured and have minimal sequence similarity. A tryptophan residue in both AADs is required for ATR activation, but the other features of these domains and the mechanism by which they activate ATR are unknown. In this study, using bioinformatic analyses, kinase assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence measures of signaling, we more specifically defined the TOPBP1 and ETAA1 AADs and identified additional features of the AADs needed for ATR activation. We found that both ETAA1 and TOPBP1 contain a predicted coiled-coil motif that is required for ATR activation in vitro and in cells. Mutation of the predicted coiled coils does not alter AAD oligomerization but does impair binding of the AADs to ATR. These results suggest that TOPBP1 and ETAA1 activate ATR using similar motifs and mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2950734213,"The fossil record constitutes the primary source of information about the evolutionary history of extant and extinct groups, and many analyses of macroevolution rely on fossils that are accurately placed within phylogenies. To avoid misinterpretation of the fossil record, especially by non-palaeontologists, the proper assessment and communication of uncertainty in fossil placement is crucial. We here use Bayesian morphological phylogenetics to evaluate the classifications of fossil parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae) and introduce ‘RoguePlots’ to illustrate placement uncertainty on the phylogeny of extant taxa. Based on an extensive, newly constructed morphological matrix of 222 characters in 24 fossil and 103 extant taxa, we test three different aspects of models of morphological evolution. We find that a model that includes ordered characters, among-character rate variation, and a state-space restricted to observed states achieves the highest marginal likelihoods. The individual RoguePlots reveal large differences in confidence in the placement of the different fossils and allow some refinements to their classification: Polyhelictes bipolarus and Ichninsum appendicrassum are moved from an uncertain subfamily placement to Pimplinae, Plectiscidea lanhami is transferred to Allomacrus in Cylloceriinae (Allomacrus lanhami, comb. nov.), Lithotorus cressoni is moved from Diplazontinae to Orthocentrinae, and we note uncertainty in the generic placements of Rhyssella? vera and Xanthopimpla? messelensis. We discuss potential artefacts that might result in biased posterior probabilities in Bayesian morphological phylogenetic analyses, pertaining to character and taxon sampling, fossilization biases, and model misspecification. Finally, we suggest future directions both in ichneumonid palaeontology and in the way RoguePlots can improve both assessment and representation of placement uncertainty, both in fossils and other rogue taxa."

https://openalex.org/W2927960391,"Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs), the major stem cells responsible for the regeneration of skeletal muscle, are normally cell cycle arrested but differentiate to generate myocytes upon muscle damage, forming new myofibers along with self-renewing stem cells in preparation for subsequent injury. In this study, we investigated which factors stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of SMSCs and found that pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, stimulates their differentiation. Pyruvate antagonizes the effects of hypoxia on preferential self-renewal of SMSCs through dephosphorylation or activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which mediates opening of the gateway from glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by producing acetyl coenzyme A from pyruvate. PDH kinase 1, highly expressed under hypoxia, is down-regulated under normoxic conditions, leading to an increase in dephosphorylated PDH. Conditional deletion of PDH in SMSCs affects cell divisions generating myocytes and subsequent myotube formation, inefficient skeletal muscle regeneration upon injury, and aggravated pathogenesis of a dystrophin-deficient mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Thus, the flow from glycolysis to the TCA cycle mediated by PDH plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of SMSCs, which is critical for the progression of skeletal muscle regeneration.—Hori, S., Hiramuki, Y., Nishimura, D., Sato, F., Sehara-Fujisawa, A.

https://openalex.org/W2950485079,"Agroforestry is a common traditional practice in China-especially in the southern Xinjiang of Northwest China. However, the productivity of many agroforestry systems has been lower than expected in recent years, highlighting the need for an actionably deep mechanistic understanding of the competition between crops and trees. Here, three different fruit tree/wheat (jujube/wheat, apricot /wheat, and walnut /wheat) intercropping agroforestry systems were chosen to investigate influence of different fruit tree shade intensity on the growth, yield and quality of intercropping wheat. Compared to the monoculture wheat system, the mean daily shade intensity of the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems were, respectively, 23.2%, 57.5%, and 80.7% shade. The photosynthetic rate of wheat in the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems decreased by, respectively, 11.3%, 31.9%, and 36.2% compared to monoculture wheat, and the mean number of fertile florets per spike decreased by 26.4%, 37.4%, and 49.5%. Moreover, the apricot- and walnut-based intercropping systems deleteriously affected grain yield (constituent components spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight) and decreased the total N, P, and K content of intercropping wheat. Tree shading intensity strongly enhanced the grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time of wheat, but significantly decreased the softening degree. Strong negative linear correlations were observed between tree shade intensity and the number of fertile florets, grain yield related traits (including spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight), nutrient content (N, P and K), and softening degree of wheat. In contrast, Daily shade intensity was positively linearly correlated with grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time. We conclude that jujube-based intercropping systems can be practical in the region, as they do not decrease the yield and quality of intercropping wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2927166626,"Depressive symptoms are related to abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and physiological signals that can be used to measure and evaluate such abnormalities have previously been used as indicators for diagnosing mental disorder, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we investigate the feasibility of developing an objective measure of depressive symptoms that is based on examining physiological abnormalities in individuals when they are experiencing mental stress. To perform this, we recruited 30 patients with MDD and 31 healthy controls. Then, skin conductance (SC) was measured during five 5-min experimental phases, comprising baseline, mental stress, recovery from the stress, relaxation, and recovery from the relaxation, respectively. For each phase, the mean amplitude of the skin conductance level (MSCL), standard deviations of the SCL (SDSCL), slope of the SCL (SSCL), mean amplitude of the non-specific skin conductance responses (MSCR), number of non-specific skin conductance responses (NSCR), and power spectral density (PSD) were evaluated from the SC signals, producing 30 parameters overall (six features for each phase). These features were used as input data for a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm designed to distinguish MDD patients from healthy controls based on their physiological responses. Statistical tests showed that the main effect of task was significant in all SC features, and the main effect of group was significant in MSCL, SDSCL, SSCL, and PSD. In addition, the proposed algorithm achieved 70% accuracy, 70% sensitivity, 71% specificity, 70% positive predictive value, 71% negative predictive value in classifying MDD patients and healthy controls. These results demonstrated that it is possible to extract meaningful features that reflect changes in ANS responses to various stimuli. Using these features, detection of MDD was feasible, suggesting that SC analysis has great potential for future diagnostics and prediction of depression based on objective interpretation of depressive states."
https://openalex.org/W2932483010,"Atherosclerotic plaque formation is an inflammatory process that involves the recruitment of neutrophil granulocytes and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS formation by myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme in H2O2 degradation, can be modulated by addition of sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN). However, the therapeutic use of NaSCN to counteract atherogenesis has been controversial, because MPO oxidizes NaSCN to hypothiocyanous acid, which is a reactive oxygen species itself. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of NaSCN treatment on atherogenesis in vivo.Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice on western-diet were treated with NaSCN for 8 weeks. Blood levels of total cholesterol, IL-10, and IL-6 were measured. Aortic roots from these mice were analyzed histologically to quantify plaque formation, monocyte, and neutrophil granulocyte infiltration. Oxidative damage was evaluated via an L-012 chemiluminescence assay and staining for chlorotyrosine in the aortic walls. Endothelial function was assessed by use of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in isolated aortic rings. Neointima formation was evaluated in wild-type mice following wire injury of the carotid artery.NaSCN treatment of ApoE-/- mice lead to a reduction of atherosclerotic plaque size in the aortic roots but had no effect on monocyte or granulocyte infiltration. Serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 decreased whereas anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased upon NaSCN treatment. In our experiments, we found oxidative damage to be reduced and the endothelial function to be improved in the NaSCN-treated group. Additionally, NaSCN inhibited neointima formation.NaSCN has beneficial effects on various stages of atherosclerotic plaque development in mice."

The desired number of clusters within the patient database was estimated using Calinski-Harabasz criteria. Complex (self-organizing map, SOM) and standard (k-means) clustering tools were used, and the formed clusters were compared.A total of 96 patients (81.3% male, age (median [IQR]): 25.0[10.8]) who were expected to suffer from sports-related concussion or post-concussive syndrome (52[140] days between diagnostic testing and the concussive episode) were included. The cluster evaluation indicated dividing the data into two groups. Only the SOM gave a stable clustering outcome, dividing the patients in group-1 (n = 38) and group-2 (n = 58). A large significant difference was found for the caloric summary score for the maximal speed of the slow phase, where group-1 scored 30.7% lower than group-2 (27.6[18.2] vs. 51.0[31.0]). Group-1 also scored significantly lower on the sensory organisation test composite score (69.0[22.3] vs. 79.0[10.5]) and higher on the visual acuity (-0.03[0.33] vs. -0.14[0.12]) and dynamic visual acuity (0.38[0.84] vs. 0.20[0.20]) tests. The importance of caloric, SOT and DVA, was supported by the PCA outcomes. Group-1 tended to report headaches, blurred vision and balance problems more frequently than group-2 (>10% difference).The SOM divided the data into one group with prominent vestibular disorders and another with no clear vestibular or balance problems, suggesting that artificial intelligence might help improve the diagnostic process."
https://openalex.org/W2930213008,"Cervical cancer is the second most deadly gynecological tumor worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play very important roles in tumor oncogenesis and progression. The mechanism of post-transcription regulation of WTX gene is still unknown. A series of differential miRNAs were discovered by microarray analysis comparing three pairs of primary cervical cancer specimens and their relapsed tumors from three patients. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), Western Blot (WB) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression of miR-4524b-5p and WTX in cervical cell lines and tissues. The biological function of miR-4524b-5p and WTX was investigated through knockdown and overexpression with inhibitor/siRNA and mimic/plasmid in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found that miR-4524b-5p is highly expressed in relapsed cervical cancer specimens. Combined in vitro and in vivo experiments, showed that miR-4524b-5p could regulate the migration and invasion ability of cervical cancer. Furthermore, we also found that miR-4524b-5p could regulate the migration and invasion of cervical cancer by targeting WTX and that WTX could regulate the expression of β-catenin. Taken together, our data identified a miR-4524b-5p/WTX/β-catenin regulatory axis for cervical cancer, and miR-4524b-5p may be a potential target for cervical cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2932296880,"Improving mental health outcomes for children and young people has become a priority for policy makers in the developed world. In Australia, up to half of all children and adolescents meeting criteria for mental health disorders receive suboptimal levels of treatment (or no treatment at all) despite the availability of effective treatments. Children with complex mental health conditions are particularly at risk of inadequate treatment as optimal care requires coordination from medical, educational and social services. In Australia, clinicians including pediatricians, psychologists and child and adolescent psychiatrists deliver the bulk of mental health care for children with complex mental health conditions. We aimed to determine perspectives of these Australian clinicians on barriers and enablers within the current system and components of an optimal model of care.Inductive content analysis was used to analyse 30 semi-structured interviews with key clinicians managing the care of children with complex mental health conditions across Australia. Interviews were conducted using vignettes with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism as exemplars.Multiple barriers to optimal care exist at a systemic, clinician and family level. However, regional health systems provide an enabling environment from which metropolitan models could learn. Transitioning to adult services was highlighted as the most compromised area of care. Clinicians identified short (e.g. empowering parents to advocate for and deliver their child's care, case conferencing with schools) and long term (e.g. co-locating disciplines to deliver care, workforce training) solutions.Whilst multiple barriers to optimal care for children with complex mental health conditions exist, clinicians identify several enablers including developing networks with other disciplines and empowering parents to advocate for and co-ordinate care. Systemic changes based on multidisciplinary, co-located and integrated care services should be developed as longer term solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2949625633,"A chronosequence approach, i.e., a comparison of spatially distinct plots with different stages of succession, is commonly used for studying microbial community dynamics during paedogenesis. The successional traits of prokaryotic communities following sand fixation processes have previously been characterized for arid and semi-arid regions, but they have not been considered for the tundra zone, where the environmental conditions are unfavourable for the establishment of complicated biocoenoses. In this research, we characterized the prokaryotic diversity and abundance of microbial genes found in a typical tundra and wooded tundra along a gradient of increasing vegetation-unfixed aeolian sand, semi-fixed surfaces with mosses and lichens, and mature soil under fully developed plant cover. Microbial communities from typical tundra and wooded tundra plots at three stages of sand fixation were compared using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries. The abundances of ribosomal genes increased gradually in both chronosequences, and a similar trend was observed for the functional genes related to the nitrogen cycle (nifH, bacterial amoA, nirK and nirS). The relative abundance of Planctomycetes increased, while those of Thaumarchaeota, Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi decreased from unfixed sands to mature soils. According to β-diversity analysis, prokaryotic communities of unfixed sands were more heterogeneous compared to those of mature soils. Despite the differences in the plant cover of the two mature soils, the structural compositions of the prokaryotic communities were shaped in the same way. Thus, sand fixation in the tundra zone increases archaeal, bacterial and fungal abundances, shifts and unifies prokaryotic communities structure."

Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for gonorrhea infection. Materials and methods In this study, we determined the prevalence of and risk factors associated with gonococcal infections by three anatomical sites among MSM. We have conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a sexually transmitted disease (STD), gonorrhea among MSM attending two STD clinics in Khon Kaen, Thailand. We included 358 MSM over 18 years of age. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaire. In each participant, an oropharyngeal, anorectal, and endourethral swab were tested with culture and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). However, 267 urine samples were tested by both methods. Factors associated with gonorrhea infections were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results One hundred and ninety-five out of 358 (54.47%) MSM tested were found to be positive for gonorrhea using a porA gene targeted NAAT by Real-time PCR with TaqMan probes, but there was no positive result by culture. The gonorrheal prevalence for male genital site, anal, and oropharyngeal, were 34.73% (95%CI 33.07, 45.08), 29.01% (95%CI 24.61, 34.33), and 27.93% (95%CI 23.35, 32.89), respectively, while 5.9% (21/355) were positive for gonococcal infection in all anatomic sites (oropharynx + anus + urethra) of one participant. Previous history of diagnosed STDs was a significant factor associated urethral gonorrhea (odds ratio = 3.52, 95%CI 1.87–6.66, P Value< 0.001). In addition, having more than one partner was increased urethral gonorrhea (adjusted odds ratio = 2.26, 95%CI 1.10–4.68, P Value = 0.026). 100% of condom use was found decreasing urethral infection (adjusted odds ratio = 0.39, 95%CI 0.15–0.99, P Value = 0.046). Conclusions The most common anatomic site of gonorrhea infection was male genital site, and the independent risk factors were having history of diagnosed STDs and having more than one partner in the past 3 months, but 100% condom use was a protective factor of this infection."

This study was to determine the changes of liver stiffness (LS), controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value and FIB-4 and their associated factors for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients who underwent direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Patients and methods Consecutive patients with CHC in advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis undergoing paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir plus dasabuvir therapy and with LS and CAP before and 12 weeks after treatment were enrolled. The demographics, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were reviewed. The changes of LS, FIB-4, CAP and their associated factors were analyzed. Results A total of 213 patients (mean age: 63.7 years) with complete recommended treatment were enrolled. All patients achieved sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR12) of follow-up. The mean values of LS, CAP and FIB-4 index before treatment were 18.5kPa, 283dB/m and 5.05 respectively. While there was no significant change in CAP, LS and FIB-4 decreased significantly at the time of SVR12 (p<0.001). Compared with follow-up period, LS and FIB-4 decreased rapidly during DDAs. Multivariate analysis showed that higher baseline LS and FIB-4 were associated with greater reductions at the time of SVR12. Conclusion For CHC patients in advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis, DAAs improved LS and FIB-4 index at SVR12. Higher baseline LS and FIB-4 contributed to greater reductions. However, there was no significant change in CAP value."
https://openalex.org/W2931397240,"Resveratrol (RSV) has broad prospective applications as a radiation protection drug, but its mechanism of action is not yet clear. Here, we found that 5 µM RSV can effectively reduce the cell death caused by irradiation. Irradiation leads to G2/M phase arrest in the cell cycle, whereas RSV treatment increases S-phase cell cycle arrest, which is associated with sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) regulation. Meanwhile, RSV promotes DNA damage repair, mainly by accelerating the efficiency of homologous recombination repair. Under oxidative stress, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is transported to the nucleus to protect against DNA damage. RSV can promote TyrRS acetylation, thus promoting TyrRS to enter the nucleus, where it regulates the relevant signaling proteins and reduces apoptosis and DNA damage. SIRT1 is a deacetylase, and SIRT1 knockdown or inhibition can increase TyrRS acetylation levels, further reducing radiation-induced apoptosis after RSV treatment. Our study revealed a new radiation protection mechanism for RSV, in which the acetylation of TyrRS and its translocation into the nucleus is promoted, and this mechanism may also represent a novel protective target against irradiation.—Gao, P., Li, N., Ji, K., Wang, Y., Xu, C., Liu, Y., Wang, Q., Wang, J., He, N., Sun, Z., Du, L., Liu, Q.

In this cross-sectional study, simultaneous collection of 24h and spot urines were performed from 1,039 (derivation cohort) and 204 CKD patients (validation cohort) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, from 2007 to 2017. The correlations between spot UPCR and 24h proteinuria were compared. The mean age of patients of derivation and validation cohort was 63 and 55 years and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 62 ± 35 and 59 ± 36 mL/min/m2, respectively. The correlation coefficient was 0.819 between UPCR and 24hUP. Prediction equation was derived as: Log1024hUP (g) = 0.814 x Log10UPCR (mg/mg) + 0.110 x Gender- 0.004 x Age + 0.004 x Body weight (kg) + 0.002 x CKD stage coefficient- 0.018, where CKD stage coefficient: CKD stage G1 = 1, G2 = 2, G3a = 3.1, G3b = 3.2, G4 = 4, G5 = 5. Correlation coefficient between measured and predicted 24hUP among derivation group and validation group is 0.866 and 0.915, respectively. However, the agreement of spot and daily estimates was less pronounced with proteinuria > 3g than lower values in Bland-Altman analysis. Spot UPCR can accurately predict 24hUP in patients with daily proteinuria below 3g. The development of this equation may facilitate estimation of 24hUP in the clinical practice."

Herein we retrospectively reviewed our institutional experience with the aim to explore the association between the occurrence of panniculitis and vitiligo-like lesions during combination therapy with dabrafenib (D) and trametinib (T) and outcome of advanced melanoma patients. Among 52 consecutive BRAF V600 mutated melanoma patients submitted to DT in our center, 12 (23%) developed immune related skin lesions (IRSLs): 8 panniculitis and 4 vitiligo. Patients with IRSLs diagnosis obtained a better disease response (83% versus 25%) (p = 0.001) than their counterpart and had a longer progression free survival and overall survival. The association of IRSLs and lower risk of disease progression (HR 0.19; CI 95% 0.04-0.90; p = 0.043) was confirmed after adjusting for major prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. IRSLs might represent an easy predictive surrogate marker for treatment response and favourable outcome in melanoma patients submitted to DT combination therapy."

All participants (N = 74;48 females;mean age 66.0 yrs at the third wave) performed the Color-Word Interference Test (CWIT). Response time on the third condition of CWIT, divided into fast, medium and slow, was used as outcome measure in a machine learning framework. Initially, we performed a linear mixed-effect (LME) analysis to describe subject-specific trajectories of the left and right LV volumes (LVV). These features were input to a multinomial logistic regression classification procedure, predicting individual belongings to one of the three RI classes. To obtain results that might generalize, we evaluated the significance of a k-fold cross-validated f1-score with a permutation test, providing a p-value that approximates the probability that the score would be obtained by chance. We also calculated a corresponding confusion matrix.The LME-model showed an annual ∼ 3.0% LVV increase. Evaluation of a cross-validated score using 500 permutations gave an f1-score of 0.462 that was above chance level (p = 0.014). 56% of the fast performers were successfully classified. All these were females, and typically older than 65 yrs at inclusion. For the true slow performers, those being correctly classified had higher LVVs than those being misclassified, and their ages at inclusion were also higher.Major contributions were: (i) a longitudinal design, (ii) advanced brain imaging and segmentation procedures with longitudinal data analysis, and (iii) a data driven machine learning approach including cross-validation and permutation testing to predict behaviour, solely from the individual's brain ""signatures"" (LVV trajectories)."
https://openalex.org/W2925790069,"Objective To design and evaluate the accuracy of a novel navigation template suitable for posterior cervical screw placement surgery by using 3D printing technology to improve the existing guiding template design. Methods The researchers (including spine surgeons and technicians) used CT to perform thin-slice scanning on 12 cases of normal upper cervical vertebral specimens and defined the screw channels that were completely located in the pedicle without penetrating the cortex as ideal screw channels, then designed the ideal channel of the upper cervical vertebral (atlantoaxial) pedicle screw by computer software which was regarded as the preset values, and recorded the screw entrance point, transverse angle and sagittal angle of the ideal channel. Then, researchers designed the novel navigation templates for placement pedicle screw according to the ideal screw channel preset values and manufactured them with one for every single vertebra by 3D printer. A senior spine surgeon performed the posterior surgery to implant pedicle screw on the specimens by the novel navigation templates, then performed CT thin-slice scanning on the specimens again after removing the screws, and reconstructed the actual screws channel by computer software, recorded the screw entrance point, transverse angle and sagittal angle of the actual channels which were defined as the actual values and evaluated them according to Kawaguchi’s pedicle screw evaluation standard finally. The differences between the preoperative preset values of ideal screw channel and the postoperative actual values of actual screw channel were compared by a nonparametric paired rank test. Results 48 screws were placed on 12 cases of upper cervical vertebral specimens in total. It showed that the grade 0, I, II, III channels in this study were 47, 1, 0, 0, respectively. The grade 0 channels accounted for 97.92% of the total number of channels. There was no significant difference with regard to the screw entrance point, the transverse angle, and the sagittal angle between the preoperative preset values of ideal screw channels and the postoperative actual values of actual screw channels. Conclusion To implant pedicle screw assisted with the novel individually navigation template designed by 3D printed in the posterior cervical surgery can improve accuracy of pedicle screw placement and safety of the surgery."

The median cigarette pack-years of smoking among both cases and controls was 30.0. Serum, red blood cell (RBC) folates and serum homocysteine concentrations were measured. The genotypes in selected polymorphic sites of the MTHFR, CBS, SHMT1, MTHFD1, MTRR, MTR, TYMS DHFR, TCN2, and SLC19A1 genes were determined. All study participants underwent scanning with low-dose computed tomography.Serum folate concentrations above the median (> 17.5 nmol/l among the healthy controls) were associated with an increased lung cancer risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.54, 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.04-2.29, P = 0.031). An analogous trend was observed when the population was analysed after subdivision according to RBC folate concentrations, that is, above a value of 506.5 nmol/l (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.95-2.47; P = 0.084).

Methods The clinical effectiveness of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine therapy (DHA-PPQ) has been evaluated in three districts characterized by different rates of ART resistance markers: K13(C580Y) mutation and delayed parasite clearance on day 3 (DPC3). Patients were stratified in 3 groups a) no markers, b) one marker (suspected resistance), c) co-presence of both markers (confirmed resistance). In the studied areas, the clinical effectiveness of DHA-PPQ has been estimated as malaria recrudescence within 60 days. Results The rate of K13(C580Y) ranged from 75.8% in Krong Pa to 1.2% in Huong Hoa district. DPC3 prevalence was higher in Krong Pa than in Huong Hoa (86.2% vs 39.3%). In the two districts, the prevalence of confirmed resistance was found in 69.0% and 1.2% of patients, respectively. In Thuan Bac district, we found intermediate prevalence of confirmed resistance. Treatment failure was not evidenced in any district. PPQ resistance was not evidenced. Confirmed resistance was associated to the persistence of parasites on day 28 and to 3.4-fold higher parasite density at diagnosis. The effectiveness of malaria control strategies was very high in the studied districts. Conclusion No treatment failure has been observed in presence of high prevalence of ART resistance and in absence of PPQ resistance. K13(C580Y) was strongly associated to higher parasitemia at admission, on days 3 and 28. Slower parasite clearance was also observed in younger patients."
https://openalex.org/W2927400066,"Recent studies have highlighted the extraordinary cell type diversity that exists within mammalian organs, yet the molecular drivers of such heterogeneity remain elusive. To address this issue, much attention has been focused on profiling the transcriptome and epigenome of individual cell types. However, standard cell type isolation methods based on surface or fluorescent markers remain problematic for cells residing within organs with significant connective tissue. Since the nucleus contains both genomic and transcriptomic information, the isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types (INTACT) method provides an attractive solution. Although INTACT has been successfully applied to plants, flies, zebrafish, frogs, and mouse brain and adipose tissue, broad use across mammalian organs remains challenging. Here we describe the PAN-INTACT method, which can be used to isolate cell type specific nuclei from fibrous mouse organs, which are particularly problematic. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate successful isolation of cell type-specific nuclei from the mouse heart, which contains substantial connective tissue and harbors multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epicardial cells. Compared to established techniques, PAN-INTACT allows more rapid isolation of cardiac nuclei to facilitate downstream applications. We show cell type-specific isolation of nuclei from the hearts of Nkx2-5Cre/+; R26Sun1-2xsf-GFP-6xmyc/+ mice, which we confirm by expression of lineage markers. Furthermore, we perform Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-Seq to provide high-fidelity chromatin accessibility maps of Nkx2-5+ nuclei. To extend the applicability of PAN-INTACT, we also demonstrate successful isolation of Wt1+ podocytes from adult kidney. Taken together, our data suggest that PAN-INTACT is broadly applicable for profiling the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of specific cell types. Thus, we envision that our method can be used to systematically probe mechanistic details of cell type-specific functions within individual organs of intact mice."
https://openalex.org/W2932069706,"Among the repertoire of immunoregulatory proteins encoded by myxoma virus, M013 is a viral homologue of the viral pyrin domain-only protein (vPOP) family. In myeloid cells, M013 protein has been shown to inhibit both the inflammasome and NF-κB signaling pathways by direct binding to ASC1 and NF-κB1, respectively. In this study, a three-dimensional homology model of the M013 pyrin domain (PYD) was built based on similarities to known PYD structures. A distinctive feature of the deduced surface electrostatic map of the M013 PYD is the presence of a negatively region consisting of numerous aspartate and glutamate residues in close proximity. Single-site mutations of aspartate and glutamate residues reveal their role in interactions with ASC-1. The biological significance of charge complementarity in the M013–ASC-1 interaction was further confirmed by functional assays of caspase-1 activation and subsequent secretion of cytokines. M013 also has a unique 33-residue C-terminal tail that follows the N-terminal PYD, and it is enriched in positively charged residues. Deletion of the tail of M013 significantly inhibited the interactions between M013 and NF-κB1, thus compromising the ability of the viral protein to suppress the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results demonstrate that vPOP M013 exploits distinct structural motifs to regulate both the inflammasome and NF-κB pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2928933724,"Mandatory fortification of edible oil (soybean and palm) with vitamin A was decreed in Bangladesh in 2013. Yet, there is a dearth of data on the availability and consumption of vitamin A fortifiable oil at household level across population sub-groups. To fill this gap, our study used a nationally representative survey in Bangladesh to assess the purchase of fortifiable edible oil among households and project potential vitamin A intake across population sub-groups. Data is presented by strata, age range and poverty-the factors that potentially influence oil coverage. Across 1,512 households, purchase of commercially produced fortifiable edible oil was high (87.5%). Urban households were more likely to purchase fortifiable oil (94.0%) than households in rural low performing (79.7%) and rural other strata (88.1%) (p value: 0.01). Households in poverty were less likely to purchase fortifiable oil (82.1%) than households not in poverty (91.4%) (p <0.001). Projected estimates suggested that vitamin A fortified edible oil would at least partially meet daily vitamin A estimated average requirement (EAR) for the majority of the population. However, certain population sub-groups may still have vitamin A intake below the EAR and alternative strategies may be applied to address the vitamin A needs of these vulnerable sub-groups. This study concludes that a high percentage of Bangladeshi population across different sub-groups have access to fortifiable edible oil and further provides evidence to support mandatory edible oil fortification with vitamin A in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W2931070204,"Introduction Electrical coupling index (ECI) and contact force (CF) have been developed to aid lesion formation during catheter ablation. ECI measures tissue impedance and capacitance whilst CF measures direct contact. The aim was to determine whether the presence of catheter / tissue interaction information, such as ECI and CF, reduce time to achieve bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block during atrial flutter (AFL) ablation. Methods Patients with paroxysmal or persistent AFL were randomised to CF visible (range 5-40g), CF not visible, ECI visible (change of 12%) or ECI not visible. Follow-up occurred at 3 and 6 months and included a 7 day ECG recording. The primary endpoint was time to bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block. Results 114 patients were randomised, 16 were excluded. Time to bidirectional block was significantly shorter when ECI was visible (median 30.0 mins (IQR 31) to median 10.5mins (IQR 12) p 0.023) versus ECI not visible. There was a trend towards a shorter time to bidirectional block when CF was visible. Higher force was applied when CF was visible (median 9.03g (IQR 7.4) vs. 11.3g (5.5) p 0.017). There was no difference in the acute recurrence of conduction between groups. The complication rate was 2%, AFL recurrence was 1.1% and at 6 month follow-up, 12% had atrial fibrillation. Conclusion The use of tissue contact information during AFL ablation was associated with reduced time taken to achieve bidirectional block when ECI was visible. Contact force data improved contact when visible with a trend towards a reduction in the procedural endpoint. ClinicalTrials.gov trial identifier: NCT02490033."
https://openalex.org/W2932767927,"Adhesive interactions of soft materials play an important role in nature and technology. Interaction energies can be quantified by determining contact areas of deformable microparticles with the help of reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM). For high throughput screening of adhesive interactions, a method to automatically evaluate large amounts of interacting microparticles was developed. An image is taken which contains circular interference patterns with visual characteristics that depend on the probe’s shape due to its surface interaction. We propose to automatically detect radial profiles in images, and to measure the contact radius and size of the spherical probe, allowing the determination of particle-surface interaction energy in a simple and fast imaging and image analysis setup. To achieve this, we analyze the image gradient and we perform template matching that utilizes the physical foundations of reflection interference contrast microscopy."

https://openalex.org/W2927636426,"Bryophytes have been proposed as ideal indicators of ecosystem change, because they are important components of forest integrity, and considerable research indicates that some groups are sensitive to the changes associated with specific human disturbances. Bryophyte richness and abundance have been found to vary predictably along elevational gradients, but the role of human impacts on these distribution patterns remains unclear. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of human disturbance on the elevational patterns of bryophyte diversity, along an elevational gradient. Along the gradient we collected three datasets in the following sites: preserved (P), forest track roadsides (R) and disturbed by agriculture/silviculture practices (D). Two survey plots of 100 m2 were established at every 200 m elevational step for each sites P, R, D, and in each plot bryophytes were sampled in a stratified manner. At each plot we recorded all species on available substrates and estimated their percentage cover. Our results showed that species number did not differ among studied sites, but that species diversity pattern differs among the three gradient types and species life strategy composition along the elevational gradient showed a clear response to the disturbance of mature communities. We conclude that human impact has strongly changed the elevational pattern of diversity, and that these changes vary depending on the ecological and taxonomical group considered."
https://openalex.org/W2927780986,"Neointimal hyperplasia, stimulated by injury and certain vascular diseases, promotes artery obstruction and tissue ischemia. In vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs), multiple modulators of protein handling machinery regulate intimal hyperplasia. These include elements of the VSMC unfolded protein response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (UPRER), and transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which catalyzes post-translational protein modification. Previous results for deficiency of UPRER-specific mediator XBP1, and of TG2, have been significant, but in multiple instances contradictory, for effects on cultured VSMC function, and, using multiple models, for neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. Here, we engineered VSMC-specific deficiency of XBP1, and studied cultured VSMCs, and neointimal hyperplasia in response to carotid artery ligation in vivo. Intimal area almost doubled in Xbp1fl/fl SM22α-CRE+ mice 21 days post-ligation. Cultured murine Xbp1 deficient VSMCs migrated more in response to platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) than control VSMCs, and had an increased level of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (Ire1α), a PDGF receptor-binding UPRER transmembrane endonuclease whose substrates include XBP1. Cultured XBP1-deficient VSMCs demonstrated decreased levels of TG2 protein, in association with increased TG2 polyubiquitination, but with increased TG transamidation catalytic activity. Moreover, IRE1α, and TG2-specific transamidation cross-links were increased in carotid artery neointima in Xbp1fl/fl SM22α-CRE+ mice. Cultured TG2-deficient VSMCs had decreased XBP1 associated with increased IRE1α, and increased migration in response to PDGF. Neointimal hyperplasia also was significantly increased in Tgm2fl/fl SM22α-CRE+ mice at 21 days after carotid ligation. In conclusion, a VSMC regulatory circuit between XBP1 and TG2 limits neointimal hyperplasia in response to carotid ligation."
https://openalex.org/W2953361354,"Many lung diseases, such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), display significant regional heterogeneity with patches of severely injured tissue adjacent to apparently healthy tissue. Current mouse models that aim to mimic ARDS generally produce diffuse injuries that cannot reproducibly generate ARDS's regional heterogeneity. This deficiency prevents the evaluation of how well therapeutic agents reach the most injured regions and precludes many regenerative medicine studies since it is not possible to know which apparently healing regions suffered severe injury initially. Finally, these diffuse injury models must be relatively mild to allow for survival, as their diffuse nature does not allow for residual healthy lung to keep an animal alive long enough for many drug and regenerative medicine studies. To solve all of these deficiencies in current animal models, we have created a simple and reproducible technique to selectively induce lung injury in specific areas of the lung. Our technique, catheter-in-catheter selective lung injury (CICSLI), involves guiding an inner catheter to a particular area of the lung and delivering an injurious agent mixed with nanoparticles (fluorescently and/or radioactively labeled) that can be used days later to track the location and extent of where the initial injury occurred. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CICSLI can produce a more severe injury than diffuse models, yet has much higher survival since CICSLI intentionally leaves lung regions undamaged. Collectively, these attributes of CICSLI will allow investigators to better study how drugs act within heterogeneous lung pathologies and how regeneration occurs in severely damaged lung tissue, thereby aiding the development of new therapies for ARDS and other heterogenous lung diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2927319593,"Flow patterns of a Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille flow were studied at low axial Reynolds and rotational Taylor numbers (Re ≤ 10.5, Ta ≤ 319). The radius ratio of the inner and outer cylinders was 0.804 and the ratio of the length of the annulus to the gap width was 44.5. Complete map of the studied flow regimes was elaborated. The axial and azimuthal components of the wall shear rate γ were measured at the outer fixed cylinder using a three-segment electrodiffusion probe. The components of the wall shear rate of helices have never been measured in previous investigations. Spatio-temporal description of multiple flow patterns was obtained using flow visualizations and simultaneous measurements of wall shear rate components. The flow structures include Taylor vortices, helices winding in the same direction as the base flow or in the opposite direction, helices that were stagnant or moving in the axial direction, smooth or with superposed azimuthal waves, among others. The influence of different flow structures on the wall shear stress components is discussed with and without axial base flow. It was found that the wall shear stress is a function of Ta but no significant dependence on Re was observed for the studied flow regimes and that the mean wall shear stress increases with the number of azimuthal waves. It was also noted that the ED probes provide a more detailed information about flow patterns than torque measurements and visualizations described in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2931241533,"The properties and behaviour of stem cells rely heavily on signaling from the local microenvironment. At the apical end of Drosophila testis, self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells (GSCs) are tightly controlled by distinct somatic cells that comprise a specialised stem cell niche known as the hub. The hub maintains GSC homeostasis through adhesion and cell signaling. The Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway, which suppresses the transcriptional co-activator YAP/Yki via a kinase cascade, is a known regulator of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we show that increasing YAP/Yki expression in the germline, as well as reducing Warts levels, blocks the decrease of GSC numbers observed in aging flies, with only a small increase on their proliferation. An increased expression of YAP/Yki in the germline or a reduction in Warts levels also stymies an age-related reduction in hub cell number, suggesting a bilateral relationship between GSCs and the hub. Conversely, RNAi-based knockdown of YAP/Yki in the germline leads to a significant drop in hub cell number, further suggesting the existence of such a SC-to-niche relationship. All together, our data implicate the SWH pathway in Drosophila GSC maintenance and raise questions about its role in stem cell homeostasis in aging organisms."

In contrast to other RGS proteins, little is known about RZ subfamily structure and regulation. Herein, we present the 1.5-Å crystal structure of RGS17, the most complete and highest-resolution structure of an RZ subfamily member to date. RGS17 cocrystallized with Ca2+ bound to conserved positions on the predicted Gα-binding surface of the protein. Using NMR chemical shift perturbations, we confirmed that Ca2+ binds in solution to the same site. Furthermore, RGS17 had greater than 55-fold higher affinity for Ca2+ than for Mg2+. Finally, we found that Ca2+ promotes interactions between RGS17 and activated Gα and decreases the Km for GTP hydrolysis, potentially by altering the binding mechanism between these proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ca2+ positively regulates RGS17, which may represent a general mechanism by which increased Ca2+ concentration promotes the GAP activity of the RZ subfamily, leading to RZ-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ signaling.
