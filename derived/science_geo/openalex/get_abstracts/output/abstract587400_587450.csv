https://openalex.org/W2618161600,"Calcification-related chronic inflammatory diseases are multifactorial pathological processes, involving a complex interplay between inflammation and calcification events in a positive feed-back loop driving disease progression. Gla-rich protein (GRP) is a vitamin K dependent protein (VKDP) shown to function as a calcification inhibitor in cardiovascular and articular tissues, and proposed as an anti-inflammatory agent in chondrocytes and synoviocytes, acting as a new crosstalk factor between these two interconnected events in osteoarthritis. However, a possible function of GRP in the immune system has never been studied. Here we focused our investigation in the involvement of GRP in the cell inflammatory response mechanisms, using a combination of freshly isolated human leucocytes and undifferentiated/differentiated THP-1 cell line. Our results demonstrate that VKDPs such as GRP and matrix gla protein (MGP) are synthesized and γ-carboxylated in the majority of human immune system cells either involved in innate or adaptive immune responses. Stimulation of THP-1 monocytes/macrophages with LPS or hydroxyapatite (HA) up-regulated GRP expression, and treatments with GRP or GRP-coated basic calcium phosphate crystals resulted in the down-regulation of mediators of inflammation and inflammatory cytokines, independently of the protein γ-carboxylation status. Moreover, overexpression of GRP in THP-1 cells rescued the inflammation induced by LPS and HA, by down-regulation of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β and NFkB. Interestingly, GRP was detected at protein and mRNA levels in extracellular vesicles released by macrophages, which may act as vehicles for extracellular trafficking and release. Our data indicate GRP as an endogenous mediator of inflammatory responses acting as an anti-inflammatory agent in monocytes/macrophages. We propose that in a context of chronic inflammation and calcification-related pathologies, GRP might act as a novel molecular mediator linking inflammation and calcification events, with potential therapeutic application."
https://openalex.org/W2616551000,"Language comprehension involves the simultaneous processing of information at the phonological, syntactic, and lexical level. We track these three distinct streams of information in the brain by using stochastic measures derived from computational language models to detect neural correlates of phoneme, part-of-speech, and word processing in an fMRI experiment. Probabilistic language models have proven to be useful tools for studying how language is processed as a sequence of symbols unfolding in time. Conditional probabilities between sequences of words are at the basis of probabilistic measures such as surprisal and perplexity which have been successfully used as predictors of several behavioural and neural correlates of sentence processing. Here we computed perplexity from sequences of words and their parts of speech, and their phonemic transcriptions. Brain activity time-locked to each word is regressed on the three model-derived measures. We observe that the brain keeps track of the statistical structure of lexical, syntactic and phonological information in distinct areas."
https://openalex.org/W2614852519,"Social influence plays an important role in human behavior and decisions. Sources of influence can be divided as external, which are independent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and friends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by peers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and observational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the extent of contagion based on large-scale observational data with an unknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap between the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human dynamics and the detailed approach of social sciences, we present a parsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in political science—elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical expression of the county vote-share distribution, which is in excellent agreement with almost a century of observed U.S. presidential election data. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an abrupt phase transition from low to high levels of social contagion, and robust differences among regions. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more instrumental in shaping large-scale collective political behavior, with implications on democratic electoral processes and policies."
https://openalex.org/W2617433362,"The present work describesthe development of highly potent mushroom tyrosinase inhibitor better than the standard kojic acid. Carvacrol derivatives 4a-f and 6a-d having substituted benzoic acid and cinnamic acidresidues were synthesized with the aim to possess potent tyrosinase inhibitory activity.The structures of the synthesized compounds were ascertained by their spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR and Mass Spectroscopy).Mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity of synthesized compounds was determined and it was found that one of the derivative 6c possess higher activity (IC50 0.0167μM) than standard kojic acid (IC50 16.69μM). The derivatives 4c and 6b also showed good tyrosinase inhibitory activity with (IC50 16.69μM) and (IC50 16.69μM) respectively.Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots were used for the determination of kinetic mechanism of the compounds 4c and 6b and 6c. The kinetic analysis revealed that compounds 4c and 6b showed mixed-type inhibition while 6c is a non-competitive inhibitor having Ki values19 μM, 10 μM, and 0.05 μMrespectively. The enzyme inhibitory kinetics further showed thatcompounds 6b and 6c formed irreversible enzyme inhibitor complex while 4c bind reversibly with mushroom tyrosinase.The docking studies showed that compound 6c have maximum binding affinity against mushroom tyrosinase (PDBID: 2Y9X) with binding energy value (-7.90 kcal/mol) as compared to others.The 2-hydroxy group in compound 6c interacts with amino acid HIS85 which is present in active binding site. The wet lab results are in good agreement with the dry lab findings.Based upon our investigation we may propose that the compound 6c is promising candidate for the development of safe cosmetic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2618276868,"Persistent inflammatory environment and abnormal macrophage activation are characteristics of chronic diabetic wounds. Here, we attempted to characterize the differences in macrophage activation and temporal variations in cytokine expression in diabetic and non-diabetic wounds, with a focus on interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA expression and the p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Cutaneous wound closure, CD68- and arginase-1 (Arg-1)-expressing macrophages, and cytokine mRNA expression were examined in non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice at different time points after injury. The effect of IL-6 on p38 MAPK and Akt phosphorylation was investigated, and an in vitro scratch assay was performed to determine the role of IL-6 in primary skin fibroblast migration. Before injury, mRNA expression levels of the inflammatory markers iNOS, IL-6, and TNF-α were higher in diabetic mice; however, IL-6 expression was significantly lower 6 h post injury in diabetic wounds than that in non-diabetic wounds. Non-diabetic wounds exhibited increased p38 MAPK and Akt phosphorylation; however, no such increase was found in diabetic wounds. In fibroblasts from non-diabetic mice, IL-6 increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and levels of its downstream factor CREB, and also significantly increased Akt phosphorylation and levels of its upstream factor P13K. These effects of IL-6 were not detected in fibroblasts derived from the diabetic mice. In scratch assays, IL-6 stimulated the migration of primary cultured skin fibroblasts from the non-diabetic mice, and the inhibition of p38 MAPK was found to markedly suppress IL-6–stimulated fibroblast migration. These findings underscore the critical differences between diabetic and non-diabetic wounds in terms of macrophage activation, cytokine mRNA expression profile, and involvement of the IL-6-stimulated p38 MAPK–Akt signaling pathway. Aberrant macrophage activation and abnormalities in the cytokine mRNA expression profile during different phases of wound healing should be addressed when designing effective therapeutic modalities for refractory diabetic wounds."
https://openalex.org/W2619089870,"Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a medical emergency and can represent a life-threatening complication for hematology patients treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens. In clinical practice, the diagnostic yield of blood cultures and other investigations which aim to identify a causative organism or site of infection is low. We have retrospectively examined all blood cultures collected in a ""real world"" cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia and patients with aggressive lymphoma treated with Hyper-CVAD/MTX-cytarabine, at a single tertiary center over a five-year period. In this cohort, the 30-day mortality following confirmed blood stream infection (BSI) was 5.9%, which is lower than most reports in the recent literature. We compared the blood culture results of inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy and outpatients presenting with fevers and found a significantly higher rate of proven BSI in the outpatient group. In all settings, gram-negative organisms were most common. The rate of resistance to first-line empiric antibiotics among pathogenic isolates was 11.6% in the whole cohort, independent of blood culture circumstances. There was a trend to higher resistance rates among inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy compared to patients presenting to the emergency department (17.4% vs 7.5%) but this did not reach statistical significance. We also report low rates of ciprofloxacin resistance (5% of isolates), in a center where universal fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is not employed. Our low resistance and mortality rates support our current therapeutic strategies, however presence of resistant organisms across the spectrum of indications for BC collection highlights the importance of surveilling local patterns, escalating antimicrobial therapy in the deteriorating patient, and considering advanced techniques for the rapid identification of resistance in this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2620206953,"Genetic manipulation of the deadly malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum remains challenging, but the rise of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing tools is increasing the feasibility of altering this parasite’s genome in order to study its biology. Of particular interest is the investigation of drug targets and drug resistance mechanisms, which have major implications for fighting malaria. We present a new method for introducing drug resistance mutations in P. falciparum without the use of plasmids or the need for cloning homologous recombination templates. We demonstrate this method by introducing edits into the sodium efflux channel PfATP4 by transfection of a purified CRISPR/Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex and a 200-nucleotide single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) repair template. Analysis of whole genome sequencing data with the variant-finding program MinorityReport confirmed that only the intended edits were made, and growth inhibition assays confirmed that these mutations confer resistance to the antimalarial SJ733. The method described here is ideally suited for the introduction of mutations that confer a fitness advantage under selection conditions, and the novel finding that an ssODN can function as a repair template in P. falciparum could greatly simplify future editing attempts regardless of the nuclease used or the delivery method."
https://openalex.org/W2619593102,"The period from conception to 24 months of age is a crucial window for nutrition interventions. Personalized maternal counseling may improve childbirth outcomes, growth, and health. We assessed the effectiveness of facility-based personalized maternal nutrition counseling (from pregnancy to 18 months after birth) in improving child growth and health in rural Burkina Faso. We conducted a paired cluster randomized controlled trial in a rural district of Burkina Faso with 12 primary health centers (clusters). Healthcare providers in the intervention centers received patient-centered communication and nutrition counseling training. Pregnant women in the third trimester living in the center catchment areas and intending to stay for the next 2 years were prospectively included. We followed 2253 mother-child pairs quarterly until the child was aged 18 months. Women were interviewed about counseling experiences, dietary practices during pregnancy, and their child’s feeding practices and morbidity history. Anthropometric measurements were taken at each visit using standardized methods. The primary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of wasting, and changes in child weight-for-height z-score (WHZ). Secondary outcomes were the women’s prenatal dietary practices, early breastfeeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, timely introduction of complementary food, child’s feeding frequency and dietary diversity, children’s mean birth weight, endpoint prevalence of stunting, and cumulative incidence of diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infection. All analyses were by intention-to-treat using mixed effects models. The intervention and control arms each included six health centers. Mothers in the intervention arm had a significantly higher exposure to counseling with 11.2% for breastfeeding techniques to 75.7% for counseling on exclusive breastfeeding. Mothers of infants below 6 months of age in the intervention arm were more likely to exclusively breastfeed (54.3% vs 42.3%; Difference of Proportion (DP) 12.8%; 95% CI: 2.1, 23.6; p = 0.020) as compared to the control arm. Between 6 and 18 months of age, more children in the intervention arm benefited from the required feeding frequency (68.8% vs 53.4%; DP 14.1%; 95% CI: 9.0, 19.2; p<0.001) and a larger proportion had a minimum dietary diversity (28.6% vs 22.0%; DP 5.9%; 95% CI: 2.7, 9.2; p<0.001). Birth weight of newborns in the intervention arm was on average 84.8 g (p = 0.037) larger compared to the control arm. However, we found no significant differences in child anthropometry or morbidity between study arms. Facility-based personalized maternal nutrition counseling was associated with an improved prenatal dietary practices, Infant and Young Child Feeding practices, and child birth weight. Complementary strategies are warranted to obtain meaningful impact on child growth and morbidity. This includes strategies to ensure good coverage of facility-based services and effective nutrition/care practices in early childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2616111824,"Mitochondria perform critical functions including aerobic ATP production and calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis, but are also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. To maintain cellular function and survival in neurons, mitochondria are transported along axons, and accumulate in regions with high demand for their functions. Oxidative stress and abnormal mitochondrial axonal transport are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. However, we know little about the connection between these two. Using the Drosophila third instar larval nervous system as the in vivo model, we found that ROS inhibited mitochondrial axonal transport more specifically, primarily due to reduced flux and velocity, but did not affect transport of other organelles. To understand the mechanisms underlying these effects, we examined Ca2+ levels and the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase) pathway, which have been shown to regulate mitochondrial transport and general fast axonal transport, respectively. We found that elevated ROS increased Ca2+ levels, and that experimental reduction of Ca2+ to physiological levels rescued ROS-induced defects in mitochondrial transport in primary neuron cell cultures. In addition, in vivo activation of the JNK pathway reduced mitochondrial flux and velocities, while JNK knockdown partially rescued ROS-induced defects in the anterograde direction. We conclude that ROS have the capacity to regulate mitochondrial traffic, and that Ca2+ and JNK signaling play roles in mediating these effects. In addition to transport defects, ROS produces imbalances in mitochondrial fission-fusion and metabolic state, indicating that mitochondrial transport, fission-fusion steady state, and metabolic state are closely interrelated in the response to ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2620008399,"Exact estimates of soil clay (<2 μm) and silt (2-20 μm) contents are crucial as these size fractions impact key soil functions, and as pedotransfer concepts based on clay and silt contents are becoming increasingly abundant. We examined the effect of removing soil organic matter (SOM) by H2O2 before soil dispersion and determination of clay and silt. Soil samples with gradients in SOM were retrieved from three long-term field experiments each with uniform soil mineralogy and texture. For soils with less than 2 g C 100 g-1 minerals, clay estimates were little affected by SOM. Above this threshold, underestimation of clay increased dramatically with increasing SOM content. Silt contents were systematically overestimated when SOM was not removed; no lower SOM threshold was found for silt, but the overestimation was more pronounced for finer textured soils. When exact estimates of soil particles <20 μm are needed, SOM should always be removed before soil dispersion."
https://openalex.org/W2619991818,"A NaCl-modified zeolite was used to simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphate from biogas slurry. The effect of pH, contact time and dosage of absorbants on the removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphate were studied. The results showed that the highest removal efficiency of NH4+-N (92.13%) and PO43--P (90.3%) were achieved at pH 8. While the zeolite doses ranged from 0.5 to 5 g/100 ml, NH4+-N and PO43--P removal efficiencies ranged from 5.19% to 94.94% and 72.16% to 91.63% respectively. The adsorption isotherms of N and P removal with NaCl-modified zeolite were well described by Langmuir models, suggesting the homogeneous sorption mechanisms. While through intra-particle diffusion model to analyze the influence of contact time, it showed that the adsorption process of NH4+-N and PO43--P followed the second step of intra-particle diffusion model. The surface diffusion adsorption step was very fast which was finished in a short time."
https://openalex.org/W2620335464,"Anthrosols known as Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) have borne witness to the intensification of sedentary patterns and the demographic increase in Central Amazon. As a result, a recurring pattern has been observed of mounds with ADE arising from domestic activities and the disposal of waste. The objective of this research was to demonstrate the relationship of these anthropic activities with pedogenetic formation processes of ADE in the municipality of Iranduba, Brazil. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken from two areas of ADE (pretic horizon) and from a non-anthropic pedon. Physical, chemical, micromorphological and SEM-EDS analyses were performed. The coarse material of the pretic horizons consisted predominantly of quartz, iron nodules, ceramics and charcoal fragments, and the fine material is organo-mineral. There was a direct relationship between the color of pretic horizons and the number of charcoal fragments. The thickness of the ADE results from the redistribution of charcoal at depth through bioturbation, transforming subsurface horizons into anthropic horizons. ADE presents granular microaggregates of geochemical and zoogenetic origin. Degradation of iron nodules is intensified in pretic horizons, promoting a reverse pedogenic process contributing to the xanthization process. Surprisingly the anthropic activities also favor clay dispersion and argilluviation; clay coatings on the ceramic fragments and in the pores demonstrate that this is a current process. Processes identified as contributing to ADE genesis included: i) addition of organic residues and ceramic artifacts (cumulization) with the use of fire; ii) mechanical action of humans, roots and macrofauna (bioturbation); iii) melanization of deeper horizons as a result of bioturbation; iv) argilluviation and degradation of iron nodules. This study offers new support to archaeological research in respect to ADE formation processes in Central Amazon and confirmed the hypothesis that ancient anthropic activities may trigger and/or accelerate pedogenetic processes previously credited only to natural causes."
https://openalex.org/W2620211742,"Abnormal angiogenesis plays an important role in impaired wound healing and development of chronic wounds in diabetes mellitus. Angelica dahurica radix is a common traditional Chinese medicine with wide spectrum medicinal effects. In this study, we analyzed the potential roles of Angelica dahurica ethanolic extract (ADEE) in correcting impaired angiogenesis and delayed wound healing in diabetes by using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. ADEE treatment accelerated diabetic wound healing through inducing angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation. The angiogenic property of ADEE was subsequently verified ex vivo using aortic ring assays. Furthermore, we investigated the in vitro angiogenic activity of ADEE and its underlying mechanisms using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ADEE treatment induced HUVECs proliferation, migration, and tube formation, which are typical phenomena of angiogenesis, in dose-dependent manners. These effects were associated with activation of angiogenic signal modulators, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) as well as increased NO production, and independent of affecting VEGF expression. ADEE-induced angiogenic events were inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin, and the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME. Our findings highlight an angiogenic role of ADEE and its ability to protect against impaired wound healing, which may be developed as a promising therapy for impaired angiogenesis and delayed wound healing in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2618561054,"Perioperative hypoxia may induce microglial inflammation and apoptosis, resulting in brain injury. The neuroprotective effect of propofol against hypoxia has been reported, but the underlying mechanisms are far from clear. In this study, we explored whether and how propofol could attenuate microglia BV2 cells from CoCl2-induced hypoxic injury.Mouse microglia BV2 cells were pretreated with propofol, and then stimulated with CoCl2. TNF-α level in the culture medium was measured by ELISA kit. Cell apoptosis and intracellular calcium concentration were measured by flow cytometry analysis. The effect of propofol on CoCl2-modulated expression of Ca2+/Calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKIIα), phosphorylated CAMKIIα (pCAMKIIα), STAT3, pSTAT3Y705, pSTAT3S727, ERK1/2, pERK1/2, pNFκB(p65), pro-caspase3, cleaved caspase 3, JAK1, pJAK1, JAK2, pJAK2 were detected by Western blot.In BV2 cell, CoCl2 treatment time-dependently increased TNF-α release and induced apoptosis, which were alleviated by propofol. CoCl2 (500μmol/L, 8h) treatment increased intracellular Ca2+ level, and caused the phosphorylation of CAMKIIα, ERK1/2 and NFκB (p65), as well as the activation of caspase 3. More importantly, these effects could be modulated by 25μmol/L propofol via maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and via up-regulating the phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 at Tyr705.Propofol could protect BV2 microglia from hypoxia-induced inflammation and apoptosis. The potential mechanisms may involve the maintaining of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and the activation of JAK1/STAT3 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2619071412,"Ocular surface and corneal epithelial wounds are common and potentially debilitating problems. Ideal treatments for these injuries would promote epithelial healing without inflammation, infection and scarring. In addition the best treatments would be cost-efficient, effective, non-toxic and easily applied. Histatin-1 peptides have been shown to be safe and effective enhancers of epithelial wound healing in other model systems. We sought to determine whether histatin-1 peptides could enhance human corneal epithelial wound healing in vitro.Histatin-1 peptides were applied to human corneal epithelial cells and compared over useful dose ranges in scratch assays using time-lapse microscopy. In addition, path finding analysis, cell spreading assays, toxicity and proliferation assays were performed to further characterize the effects of histatin-1 peptide on human corneal limbal epithelial (HCLE).Histatin-1 enhanced human corneal epithelial wound healing in typical wound healing models. There was minimal toxicity and no significant enhancement of proliferation of corneal epithelium in response to histatin-1 application. Corneal epithelial spreading and pathfinding appeared to be enhanced by the application of histatin-1 peptides.Histatin -1 peptide may enhance migration of HCLE cells and wound healing in vitro. These peptides may have benefit in corneal epithelial wounds and need to be investigated further."
https://openalex.org/W2619632075,"To study the impact of epigenetic changes on biological functions, the ability to manipulate the epigenetic status of certain genomic regions artificially could be an indispensable technology. ""Epigenome editing"" techniques have gradually emerged that apply TALE or CRISPR/Cas9 technologies with various effector domains isolated from epigenetic code writers or erasers such as DNA methyltransferase, 5-methylcytosine oxidase, and histone modification enzymes. Here we demonstrate that a TALE recognizing a major satellite, consisting of a repeated sequence in pericentromeres, could be fused with the bacterial CpG methyltransferase, SssI. ChIP-qPCR assays demonstrated that the fusion protein TALMaj-SssI preferentially bound to major chromosomal satellites in cultured cell lines. Then, TALMaj-SssI was expressed in fertilized mouse oocytes with hypomethylated major satellites (10-20% CpG islands). Bisulfite sequencing revealed that the DNA methylation status was increased specifically in major satellites (50-60%), but not in minor satellites or other repeat elements, such as Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) or long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (Line1) when the expression level of TALMaj-SssI is optimized in the cell. At a microscopic level, distal ends of chromosomes at the first mitotic stage were dramatically highlighted by the mCherry-tagged methyl CpG binding domain of human MBD1 (mCherry-MBD-NLS). Moreover, targeted DNA methylation to major satellites did not interfere with kinetochore function during early embryonic cleavages. Co-injection of dCas9 fused with SssI and guide RNA (gRNA) recognizing major satellite sequences enabled increment of the DNA methylation in the satellites, but a few off-target effects were also observed in minor satellites and retrotransposons. Although CRISPR can be applied instead of the TALE system, technical improvements to reduce off-target effects are required. We have demonstrated a new method of introducing DNA methylation without the need of other binding partners using the CpG methyltransferase, SssI."
https://openalex.org/W2617202428,"Background Limited data is available regarding the pharmacological prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Asian patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty (TKA/THA). Methods We performed a population-based epidemiological study using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database to estimate the rate of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and its impact on VTE in Korean patients who underwent TKA/THA between 2009 and 2013. Results We identified 306,912 cases (TKA, 261,260; THA, 45,652). The pharmacological thromboprophylaxis rate was 57.16% (TKA, 58.32%; THA, 50.51%), which increased from 42.81% in 2009 to 65.92% in 2013 (P = 0.0165). Both low-molecular-weight-heparin (22.42%) and rivaroxaban (22.71%) were the most common drugs for prophylaxis. The number of patients aged ≥ 60 years (87.31% vs. 81.01%, P < 0.0001), cases requiring general anesthesia (20.70% vs. 18.37%, P < 0.0001), and cases requiring long hospital stay (median, 13 days vs. 12 days, P < 0.0001) were significantly greater in the pharmacological prophylaxis group. The incidence of VTE within 3 months of surgery was 1.52% (TKA, 1.46%; THA, 1.87%). Patients with pharmacological prophylaxis had higher VTE rates (TKA, 1.69% vs. 1.14%; THA, 2.30% vs. 1.43%) than those without prophylaxis, with advanced age, use of general anesthesia, and a longer hospital stay increasing the risk of VTE. However, rivaroxaban significantly reduced the incidence of VTE following TKA (0.82% vs. 1.14%; odd ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65–0.79). Moreover, ≥ 10 days of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was significantly associated with lower incidence of VTE after TKA (1.33% vs. 1.52%; OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81–0.94). Conclusion This represents the largest epidemiological study showing a gradual increase in the use of pharmacological prophylaxis in Korean patients undergoing TKA/THA. Although the incidence of VTE is still low without pharmacological prophylaxis, this study demonstrates that the incidence of VTE can be reduced further using appropriate pharmacological thromboprophylaxis strategies."

We investigated the effect of colour categories for two groups who differed in whether they categorised a blue-green boundary colour as the same- or different-category to a reliably-named blue colour and a reliably-named green colour. Colour differences were equated in just-noticeable differences to be equally discriminable. We analysed event-related potentials for these colours elicited on a passive visual oddball task and investigated the time course of categorical effects on colour processing. Support for category effects was found 100 ms after stimulus onset, and over frontal sites around 250 ms, suggesting that colour naming affects both early sensory and later stages of chromatic processing."
https://openalex.org/W2616932765,"Hypoalbuminemia of Hemodialysis (HD) patients is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, however, there is no mechanistic explanation between hypoalbuminemia and vascular injury. In the event of oxidative stress and inflammation to which HD patients are exposed, albumin is oxidized and undetected by common laboratory methods, rendering an apparent hypoalbuminemia. We wanted to show that these circulating modified oxidized albumin molecules cause direct vascular damage, mediating inflammation. Once these in-vivo albumin modifications were reduced in- vitro, the apparent hypoalbuminemia concomitantly with its inflammatory effects, were eliminated. Albumin modification profiles from 14 healthy controls (HC) and 14 HD patients were obtained by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses before and after reduction in- vitro, using redox agent 1,4 dithiothreitol (DTT). Their inflammatory effects were explored by exposing human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) to all these forms of albumin. Albumin separated from hypoalbuminemic HD patients increased endothelial mRNA expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules, and augmented secretion of IL-6. This endothelial inflammatory state was almost fully reverted by exposing HUVEC to the in-vitro reduced HD albumin. MS profile of albumin modifications peaks was similar between HD and HC, but the intensities of the various peaks were significantly different. Abolishing the reversible oxidative modifications by DTT prevented endothelial injury and increased albumin levels. The irreversible modifications such as glycation and sulfonation show low intensities in HD albumin profiles and are nearly unobserved in HC. We showed, for the first time, a mechanistic link between hypoalbuminemia and the pro-inflammatory properties of in-vivo oxidized albumin, initiating vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2617574808,"Background The Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating in Schools (APPLE Schools) has been recognized as a “best practice” in preventing childhood obesity. To inform decision making on the economic implications of APPLE Schools and to justify investment, we evaluated the project’s cost-effectiveness following a life-course approach. Methods We developed a state transition model for the lifetime progression of body weight status comparing elementary school students attending APPLE Schools and control schools. This model quantified the lifetime impact of APPLE Schools in terms of prevention of excess body weight, chronic disease and improved quality-adjusted life years (QALY), from a school system’s cost perspective. Both costs and health outcomes were discounted to their present value using 3% discount rate. Results The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio(ICER) of APPLE schools was CA$33,421 per QALY gained, and CA$1,555, CA$1,709 and CA$14,218 per prevented person years of excess weight, obesity and chronic disease, respectively. These estimates show that APPLE Schools is cost effective at a threshold of ICER < CA$50,000. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, APPLE Schools was cost effective more than 64% of the time per QALY gained, when using a threshold of ICER<CA$50,000, and more than 93% of the time when using a threshold of ICER<CA$100,000. Conclusion School-based health promotion, such as APPLE Schools is a cost-effective intervention for obesity prevention and reduction of chronic disease risk over the lifetime. Expanding the coverage and allocating resources towards school-based programs like the APPLE Schools program, is likely to reduce the public health burden of obesity and chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2616198637,"Concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are high in Inuit living predominately on the traditional marine diet. Adverse effects of POPs include disruption of the immune system and cardiovascular diseases that are frequent in Greenland Inuit. We aimed to assess the association between exposure to POPs from the marine diet and inflammation, taking into account other factors such as vitamin D. We invited Inuit and non-Inuit living in settlements or the town in rural East Greenland or in the capital city Nuuk. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire and donated a blood sample for measurement of the two markers of inflammation YKL-40 and hsCRP, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, eleven organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), fourteen polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), one polybrominated biphenyl, and nine polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) adjusted to the serum lipid content. Participants were 50 through 69 years old, living in settlements, town or city (n = 151/173/211; 95% participation rate). ΣOCP, ΣPCB and ΣPBDE serum levels were higher in Inuit than in non-Inuit (p<0.001/ p<0.001/ p<0.001), in older individuals (p<0.001/p<0.001/p = 0.002) and in participants with the highest intake of Greenlandic food items (p<0.001/p<0.001/p<0.001). Both YKL-40 and hsCRP serum levels were higher in Inuit compared to non-Inuit (p<0.001/p = 0.001), and increased with age (p<0.001/p = 0.001) and with the intake of Greenlandic food items (p<0.001/p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis conformed to a marked influence on both YKL-40 and hsCRP by ΣOCP (p<0.001/p<0.001) and ΣPCBs (p<0.001/p = 0.001) after adjusting for age, BMI, vitamin D, alcohol and smoking. POP levels were associated with the intake of the traditional Inuit diet and with markers of inflammation. This supports a pro-inflammatory role of POPs to promote chronic diseases common to populations in Greenland. These data inform guidelines on ‘the Arctic dilemma’ and encourage follow-up on the ageing Arctic populations."
https://openalex.org/W2617305534,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance (IR) and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. IR is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, few studies have investigated IR in women with PCOS and normal glucose tolerance. The objective of this study was to evaluate IR and β-cell function in women with PCOS and normal glucose tolerance. Additionally, we sought to evaluate the usefulness of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived IR indices in lean women with PCOS.We recruited 100 women with PCOS and normal glucose tolerance and 100 age- and BMI-matched women as controls. IR and insulin secretory indices, including the homeostasis-model assessment (HOMA)-IR, HOMA-M120, HOMA-F and the Stumvoll index, were calculated from an OGTT. Increased β-cell function was defined as>75th percentile for the HOMA-F in control women.Women with PCOS had higher values for post-load 2-hour glucose, fasting insulin, post-load 2-hour insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-M120, HOMA-F and lower values for the Stumvoll index than the controls (all Ps<0.05). Women with PCOS and increased β-cell function showed lower Stumvoll index values than the matched controls (P<0.05). The HOMA-F was significantly associated with the HOMA-M120 and Stumvoll index when adjusted for age and BMI in a multiple regression analysis (all Ps<0.05). The HOMA-M120 was positively correlated with triglycerides and free testosterone, and the Stumvoll index was negatively correlated with triglycerides and free testosterone in lean women with PCOS (all Ps<0.05).Women with PCOS and normal glucose tolerance showed higher IR than controls matched for age, BMI, and β-cell function. β-cell function was increased in women with PCOS when compared to the matched controls, but not when the lean subjects were compared to the matched controls separately. Therefore, early evaluation of IR in women with PCOS and normal glucose tolerance may be needed."
https://openalex.org/W2618870760,"Protein misfolding and aggregation is a pathogenic feature shared among at least ten polyglutamine (polyQ) neurodegenerative diseases. While solvent-solution interaction is a key factor driving protein folding and aggregation, the solvation properties of expanded polyQ tracts are not well understood. By using GPU-enabled all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of polyQ monomers in an explicit solvent environment, this study shows that solvent-polyQ interaction propensity decreases as the lengths of polyQ tract increases. This study finds a predominance in long-distance interactions between residues far apart in polyQ sequences with longer polyQ segments, that leads to significant conformational differences. This study also indicates that large loops, comprised of parallel β-structures, appear in long polyQ tracts and present new aggregation building blocks with aggregation driven by long-distance intra-polyQ interactions. Finally, consistent with previous observations using coarse-grain simulations, this study demonstrates that there is a gain in the aggregation propensity with increased polyQ length, and that this gain is correlated with decreasing ability of solvent-polyQ interaction. These results suggest the modulation of solvent-polyQ interactions as a possible therapeutic strategy for treating polyQ diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2620554003,"Because xenosensing nuclear receptors are also lipid sensors that regulate lipid allocation, we hypothesized that toxicant-induced modulation of HR96 activity would alter lipid profiles and the balance between adult survival and neonate production following exposure in Daphnia magna. Adult daphnids were exposed to unsaturated fatty acid- and toxicant- activators or inhibitors of HR96 and later starved to test whether chemical exposure altered allocation toward survival or reproduction. The HR96 activators, linoleic acid and atrazine, decreased reproduction as expected with concomitant changes in the expression of HR96 regulated genes such as magro. The HR96 inhibitors, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and triclosan, increased reproduction or neonate starvation survival, respectively. However, pre-exposure to triclosan increased in neonate survival at the expense of reproductive maturation. Lipidomic analysis revealed that sphingomyelins (SM) are predominantly found in neonates and therefore we propose are important in development. DHA and triclosan increased neonatal SM, consistent with HR96's regulation of Niemann-Pick genes. While DHA altered expression of magro, Niemann-Pick 1b, mannosidase, and other HR96-regulated genes as expected, triclosan primarily perturbed sphingomyelinase and mannosidase expression indicating different but potentially overlapping mechanisms for perturbing SM. Overall, SM appears to be a key lipid in Daphnia maturation and further support was provided by carmofur, which inhibits sphingomyelin/ceramide metabolism and in turn severely represses Daphnia maturation and initial brood production. In conclusion, toxicants can perturb lipid allocation and in turn impair development and reproduction."

https://openalex.org/W2619335683,"The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a framework to assess ocean health by considering many benefits (called ‘goals’) provided by the ocean provides to humans, such as food provision, tourism opportunities, and coastal protection. The OHI framework can be used to assess marine areas at global or regional scales, but how various OHI goals should be weighted to reflect priorities at those scales remains unclear. In this study, we adapted the framework in two ways for application to Canada as a case study. First, we customized the OHI goals to create a national Canadian Ocean Health Index (COHI). In particular, we altered the list of iconic species assessed, added methane clathrates and subsea permafrost as carbon storage habitats, and developed a new goal, 'Aboriginal Needs', to measure access of Aboriginal people to traditional marine hunting and fishing grounds. Second, we evaluated various goal weighting schemes based on preferences elicited from the general public in online surveys. We quantified these public preferences in three ways: using Likert scores, simple ranks from a best-worst choice experiment, and model coefficients from the analysis of elicited choice experiment. The latter provided the clearest statistical discrimination among goals, and we recommend their use because they can more accurately reflect both public opinion and the trade-offs faced by policy-makers. This initial iteration of the COHI can be used as a baseline against which future COHI scores can be compared, and could potentially be used as a management tool to prioritise actions on a national scale and predict public support for these actions given that the goal weights are based on public priorities."
https://openalex.org/W2617370155,"Rice tiller angle is an important agronomic trait that contributes to crop production and plays a vital role in high yield breeding. In this study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross of a glabrous tropical japonica rice D50 and an indica rice HB277, was used to investigate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rice tiller angle. Two major QTLs, qTAC8 and qTAC9, were detected. While qTAC9 mapped with a previously identified gene (TAC1), using a BC2F2 population qTAC8 was mapped to a 16.5 cM region between markers RM7049 and RM23175. Position of qTAC8 was narrowed to a 92 kb DNA region by two genetic segregating populations. Finally, one opening reading frame (ORF) was regarded as a candidate gene according to genomic sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis. In addition, a set of four near isogenic lines (NILs) were created to investigate the genetic relationship between those two QTLs, and one line carrying qTAC8 and qTAC9 presented additive effect of tiller angle, suggesting that these QTLs are involved in different genetic pathways. Our results provide a foundation for the cloning of qTAC8 and genetic improvement of the rice plant architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2619706123,"Age is the main risk factor for Alzheimer´s disease (AD). With an increasingly aging population, development of affordable screening techniques to determine cognitive status will help identify population-at-risk for further follow-up. Because physical exercise is known to modulate cognitive performance, we used it as a functional test of cognitive health. Mice were submitted to treadmill running at moderate speed for 30 min, and their brain activity was monitored before and after exercise using electrocorticogram (ECG) recordings. After exercise, normal, but not APP/PS1 mice, a well established AD model, showed significantly increased ECG theta rhythm. At the same time normal, but not AD mice, showed significantly enhanced performance in a spatial memory test after exercise. Therefore, we postulate that a running bout coupled to pre- and post-exercise brain activity recordings will help identify individuals with cognitive alterations, by determining the presence or absence of exercise-specific changes in brain activity. Work in humans using a bout of moderate exercise plus electroencephalography, a clinically affordable procedure, is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2620105740,"Recent studies of animal personality have focused on its proximate causation and ecological and evolutionary significance in particular, but the question of its development was largely overlooked. The attributes of personality are defined as between-individual differences in behaviour, which are consistent over time (differential consistency) and contexts (contextual generality) and both can be affected by development. We assessed several candidates for personality variables measured in various tests with different contexts over several life-stages (juveniles, older juveniles, subadults and adults) in the Northern common boa. Variables describing foraging/feeding decision and some of the defensive behaviours expressed as individual average values are highly repeatable and consistent. We found two main personality axes—one associated with foraging/feeding and the speed of decision, the other reflecting agonistic behaviour. Intensity of behaviour in the feeding context changes during development, but the level of agonistic behaviour remains the same. The juveniles and adults have a similar personality structure, but there is a period of structural change of behaviour during the second year of life (subadults). These results require a new theoretical model to explain the selection pressures resulting in this developmental pattern of personality. We also studied the proximate factors and their relationship to behavioural characteristics. Physiological parameters (heart and breath rate stress response) measured in adults clustered with variables concerning the agonistic behavioural profile, while no relationship between the juvenile/adult body size and personality concerning feeding/foraging and the agonistic behavioural profile was found. Our study suggests that it is important for studies of personality development to focus on both the structural and differential consistency, because even though behaviour is differentially consistent, the structure can change."
https://openalex.org/W2616179126,"Aims The study aims to describe the construct of cognitive distortions based on the narratives of older adult gamblers (aged 60 years and above) in Singapore. Methods Singapore residents (citizens or permanent residents) aged 60 years and above, who were current or past regular gamblers were included in the study. Participants were recruited using a combination of venue based approach, referrals from service providers as well as by snowball sampling. In all, 25 in-depth interviews were conducted with older adult gamblers. The six-step thematic network analysis methodology was adopted for data analysis. Results The mean age of the participants was 66.2 years. The majority were male (n = 18), of Chinese ethnicity (n = 16), with a mean age of gambling initiation at 24.5 years. Among older adult gamblers, cognitive distortions emerged as a significant global theme comprising three organizing themes–illusion of control, probability control and interpretive control. The organizing themes comprised nine basic themes: perception of gambling as a skill, near miss, concept of luck, superstitious beliefs, entrapment, gambler’s fallacy, chasing wins, chasing losses, and beliefs that wins are more than losses. Conclusions Cognitive distortions were endorsed by all gamblers in the current study and were shown to play a role in both maintaining and escalating the gambling behaviour. While the surface characteristics of the distortions had a culture-specific appearance, the deeper characteristics of the distortions may in fact be more universal than previously thought. Future research must include longitudinal studies to understand causal relationships between cognitive distortions and gambling as well as the role of culture-specific distortions both in the maintenance and treatment of the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2620124833,"Increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in renal tubular epithelia accelerates the progression of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Thus, decreasing cAMP levels by an adenylyl cyclase inhibitory G protein activator is considered to be an effective approach in ameliorating PKD. In fact, pasireotide (PAS) was effective in reducing disease progression in animal models of PKD. However, hyperglycemia caused by the administration of PAS is an adverse effect in its clinical use. Whereas, co-administration of octreotide (OCT) with PAS did not increase serum glucose in normal rats. In the current study, we examined the efficacy of combined treatment with OCT and PAS in PCK rats, an autosomal recessive PKD model. Four-week-old PCK males were treated with the long-acting release type of OCT, PAS, or a combination of both (OCT/PAS) for 12 weeks. After termination, serum and renal tissue were used for analyses. Kidney weight, kidney weight per body weight, renal cyst area, renal Ki67 expression, and serum urea nitrogen were significantly decreased either in the PAS or OCT/PAS group, compared with vehicle. Renal tissue cAMP content was significantly decreased by PAS or OCT/PAS treatment, but not OCT, compared with vehicle. As a marker of cellular mTOR signaling activity, renal phospho-S6 kinase expression was significantly decreased by OCT/PAS treatment compared with vehicle, OCT, or PAS. Serum glucose was significantly increased by PAS administration, whereas no difference was shown between vehicle and OCT/PAS, possibly because serum glucagon was decreased either by the treatment of OCT alone or co-application of OCT/PAS. In conclusion, since serum glucose levels are increased by the use of PAS, its combination with OCT may reduce the risk of hyperglycemia associated with PAS monotherapy against PKD progression."

The interim vaccine effectiveness (VE) of influenza vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated using test-negative design through the tertiary hospital-based influenza surveillance system in South Korea. From 1 September, 2016 to 7 January, 2017, adjusted VE of influenza vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed A(H3N2) was -52.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], -147.2 to 6.4); -70.0% (95% CI, -212.0 to 7.4) in 19–64 years and 4.3% (95% CI, -137.8 to 61.5) in the elderly. Circulating A(H3N2) viruses belonged to the three phylogenetic subclades of 3C.2a, differently to A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, the current vaccine strain. Amino acid substitutions in hemagglutinin of circulating viruses seem to contribute to low VE. In conclusion, interim VE analysis presented that the protection of laboratory-confirmed influenza by seasonal influenza vaccination did not show the statistical significance in South Korea in the 2016–2017 influenza season."
https://openalex.org/W2617189977,"Pythiosis is a severe and life-threatening disease that affects humans and various animal species. We report a model of vascular/disseminated pythiosis occurring after subcutaneous inoculation of 2 x 104 Pythium insidiosum zoospores/mL in immunocompromised BALB/c mice. For this model, we carried out two rounds of experiments. First, we evaluated two protocols of immunosuppression before inoculation: cyclophosphamide at 150 mg/kg (CYP group) and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg plus hydrocortisone acetate at 250 mg/kg (CYP+HCA group). It was not possible to obtain mortality in the CYP group; however, the combination of CYP+HCA altered disease outcomes, with mortality rates reaching 60%. Second, we used the CYP+HCA immunosuppression protocol to analyze the histological and immunological statuses triggered by disease. When we inoculated immunocompetent mice with P. insidiosum zoospores, self-healing occurred via increased levels of IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-17A, which are characteristic of the Th1/Th17 cytokine response. For infected and immunosuppressed mice, the cytokine profiles showed high levels of IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α. Increased IL-10 values are related to fungal infection susceptibility and led us to speculate that infection may be established through suppression of the host immune response. In addition, histopathological evaluation of the kidneys and liver demonstrated the presence of hyphae and the cellular findings suggested an acute vascular inflammation that mimics vascular/disseminated pythiosis in humans. This is the first murine model for pythiosis that is useful both for understanding the pathogenesis of this disease and for evaluating new treatment approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2617954171,"Recent emerging data indicate that the increase in the expression and activity of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgf-β1) signaling may have detrimental effect to mature articular cartilage of knee joints. However, there is no information about whether or not this is the case in condylar cartilages. The objective of this study is to investigate the protein expression and activity of Tgf-β1 signaling in degenerative condylar cartilages. We also investigate biological effects of the conditional deletion of transforming growth factor receptor type II (Tgfbr2) in condylar cartilage of adult mice after a partial discectomy. Two mouse models of osteoarthritis (OA) were used to examine protein expressions of Tgf-β1 and p-Smad2/3 in condylar cartilages at early degenerative stages. In addition, cartilage specific Tgfbr2-deficient adult mice were subjected to a partial discectomy. The morphological condition of condylar cartilages was evaluated in mice at 4 and 12 weeks after the surgery. We found that protein levels of Tgf-β1 and p-Smad2/3 were increased in the degenerative condylar cartilage of the mouse models. The conditional removal of Tgfbr2 in mature condylar cartilage significantly delayed the progressive progression of the cartilage degeneration induced by a partial discectomy. We conclude that the increase in the expression and activity of Tgf-β1 signaling may have detrimental effect to mature condylar cartilages. Therefore, inhibition of Tgf-β1 signaling may be able to protect condylar cartilages from being degraded in mature temporomandibular joints."
https://openalex.org/W2615955472,"In many mammals, including rodents and humans, removal of one lung results in the compensatory growth of the remaining lung; however, the mechanism of compensatory lung growth is unknown. Here, we investigated the changes in morphology and phenotype of pleural cells after pneumonectomy. Between days 1 and 3 after pneumonectomy, cells expressing α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), a cytoplasmic marker of myofibroblasts, were significantly increased in the pleura compared to surgical controls (p < .01). Scanning electron microscopy of the pleural surface 3 days post-pneumonectomy demonstrated regions of the pleura with morphologic features consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); namely, cells with disrupted intercellular junctions and an acquired mesenchymal (rounded and fusiform) morphotype. To detect the migration of the transitional pleural cells into the lung, a biotin tracer was used to label the pleural mesothelial cells at the time of surgery. By post-operative day 3, image cytometry of post-pneumonectomy subpleural alveoli demonstrated a 40-fold increase in biotin+ cells relative to pneumonectomy-plus-plombage controls (p < .01). Suggesting a similar origin in space and time, the distribution of cells expressing biotin, SMA, or vimentin demonstrated a strong spatial autocorrelation in the subpleural lung (p < .001). We conclude that post-pneumonectomy compensatory lung growth involves EMT with the migration of transitional mesothelial cells into subpleural alveoli."
https://openalex.org/W2617390969,"There are many strategies to purify recombinant proteins of interest, and affinity purification utilizing monoclonal antibody that targets a linear epitope sequence is one of the essential techniques used in current biochemistry and structural biology. Here we introduce a new protein purification system using a very short CP5 tag. First, we selected anti-dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) rabbit monoclonal antibody clone Ra62 (Ra62 antibody) as capture antibody, and identified its minimal epitope sequence as a 5-amino-acid sequence at C-terminal of DRD1 (GQHPT-COOH, D1CE sequence). We found that single amino acid substitution in D1CE sequence (GQHVT-COOH) increased dissociation rate up to 10-fold, and named the designed epitope sequence CP5 tag. Using Ra62 antibody and 2 peptides with different affinity, we developed a new affinity protein purification method, CP5 system. Ra62 antibody quickly captures CP5-tagged target protein, and captured CP5-tagged protein was eluted by competing with higher affinity D1CE peptide. By taking the difference of the affinity between D1CE and CP5, sharp elution under mild condition was achieved. Using CP5 system, we successfully purified deubiquitinase CYLD and E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH3, and detected their catalytic activity. As to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 9 out of 12 cell-free synthesized ones were purified, demonstrating its purification capability of integral membrane proteins. CP5 tagged CHRM2 expressed by baculovirus-insect cell was also successfully purified by CP5 system. CP5 system offers several distinct advantages in addition to its specificity and elution performance. CP5 tag is easy to construct and handle because of its short length, which has less effect on protein characters. Mild elution of CP5 system is particulaly suitable for preparing delicate proteins such as enzymes and membrane proteins. Our data demonstrate that CP5 system provides a new promising option in protein sample preparation with high yield, purity and activity for downstream applications in functional and structural analysis."

Nevertheless, whether the drinking pattern is associated with CHD incidence still remains inconclusive.We included 8,469 Chinese men aged 45-81 years, who were free of CHD, stroke, or cancer at baseline from Dongfeng-Tongji cohort. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on alcohol consumption and other covariates. Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to estimate the multivariable-adjusted hazard rations (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).During an average of 4.36 years of follow-up, we identified 959 incident CHD events. Compared with non-drinkers, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) of CHD incidence was 0.84 (0.71-0.98) in current drinkers. With respect to drinking pattern, men who consumed 20.01-40 grams ethanol once a time had a 24% lower risk of incident CHD (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.62, 0.94) compared with non-drinkers. The adjusted HRs (95% CI) of CHD incidence were 0.80 (0.65, 0.99), 1.02 (0.84, 1.22), and 0.75 (0.59-0.96) in subjects who consumed 0.01-10, 10.01-30, and > 30 grams ethanol per day, respectively. Participants who consumed 20.01-40 grams ethanol per time with less than 5 times per week had the lowest risk of CHD incidence (HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.52, 0.96). No significant associations were observed between type or frequency of alcohol consumption and CHD incidence.Drinking was associated with a lower risk of CHD incidence in middle-aged and older Chinese men and moderate quantity of ethanol amounts once a time with lower frequency could been considered as a healthy drinking pattern, which might modify the relationship between alcohol consumption and incident CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2614790484,"Cryptorchidism or undescended testis (UDT) is a common congenital abnormality associated with increased risk for developing male infertility and testicular cancer. This study elucidated the effects of endogenous ghrelin or growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) deletion on mouse reproductive performance and evaluated the ability of ghrelin to prevent testicular damage in a surgical cryptorchid mouse model. Reciprocal matings with heterozygous/homozygous ghrelin and GHSR knockout mice were performed. Litter size and germ cell apoptosis were recorded and testicular histological evaluations were performed. Wild type and GHSR knockout adult mice were subjected to creation of unilateral surgical cryptorchidism that is a model of heat-induced germ cell death. All mice were randomly separated into two groups: treatment with ghrelin or with saline. To assess testicular damage, the following endpoints were evaluated: testis weight, seminiferous tubule diameter, percentage of seminiferous tubules with spermatids and with multinucleated giant cells. Our findings indicated that endogenous ghrelin deletion altered male fertility. Moreover, ghrelin treatment ameliorated the testicular weight changes caused by surgically induced cryptorchidism. Testicular histopathology revealed a significant preservation of spermatogenesis and seminiferous tubule diameter in the ghrelin-treated cryptorchid testes of GHSR KO mice, suggesting that this protective effect of ghrelin was mediated by an unknown mechanism. In conclusion, ghrelin therapy could be useful to suppress testicular damage induced by hyperthermia, and future investigations will focus on the underlying mechanisms by which ghrelin mitigates testicular damage."

Emphysema quantification of these images was performed by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation lung area (LAA%). The following values related to HEQ were obtained: nb0 and nb1. LAA% and HEQ were calculated at various threshold levels ranging from -1000 HU to -700 HU. Spearman's correlation coefficients between emphysema quantification and visual score were calculated at the various threshold levels. Visual score was predicted by machine learning and emphysema quantification (LAA% or HEQ). Random Forest was used as a machine learning algorithm, and accuracy of prediction was evaluated by leave-one-patient-out cross validation. The difference in the accuracy was assessed using McNemar's test.The correlation coefficients between emphysema quantification and visual score were as follows: LAA% (-950 HU), 0.567; LAA% (-910 HU), 0.654; LAA% (-875 HU), 0.704; nb0 (-950 HU), 0.552; nb0 (-910 HU), 0.629; nb0 (-875 HU), 0.473; nb1 (-950 HU), 0.149; nb1 (-910 HU), 0.519; and nb1 (-875 HU), 0.716. The accuracy of prediction was as follows: LAA%, 55.7% and HEQ, 66.1%. The difference in accuracy was statistically significant (p = 0.0290).LAA% and HEQ at -875 HU showed a stronger correlation with visual score than those at -910 or -950 HU. HEQ was more useful than LAA% for predicting visual score."
https://openalex.org/W2619489607,"The nuclear lamina can bind and sequester transcription factors (TFs), a function lost if the lamina is abnormal, with missing or mutant lamin proteins. We now show that TF sequestration is not all-or-nothing, but a dynamic physiological response to external signals. We show that the binding of the ubiquitous TF, Oct-1, to lamin B1 was reversed under conditions of cellular stress caused, inter alia, by the chemical methylating agent methylmethanesulfonate (MMS). A search for lamin B1 post-translational modifications that might mediate changes in Oct-1 binding using kinase inhibitors uncovered a role for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Phosphoproteomic and site-directed mutagenesis analyses of lamin B1 isolated from control and MMS-treated nuclei identified T575 as a JNK site phosphorylated after stress. A new phospho-T575 specific anti-peptide antibody confirmed increased interphase cellular T575 phosphorylation after cell exposure to certain stress conditions, enabling us to conclude that lamin B1 acts as an interphase kinase target, releasing Oct-1 to execute a protective response to stress."
https://openalex.org/W2620141143,"Several types of associative learning are dependent upon the presence or absence of food, and are crucial for the survival of most animals. Target of rapamycin (TOR), a kinase which exists as a component of two complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), is known to act as a nutrient sensor in numerous organisms. However, the in vivo roles of TOR signaling in the nervous system remain largely unclear, partly because its multifunctionality and requirement for survival make it difficult to investigate. Here, using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic analyses, we show that TORC1 and TORC2 contribute to associative learning between salt and food availability in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in a process called taste associative learning. Worms migrate to salt concentrations experienced previously during feeding, but they avoid salt concentrations experienced under starvation conditions. Administration of the TOR inhibitor rapamycin causes a behavioral defect after starvation conditioning. Worms lacking either RICT-1 or SINH-1, two TORC2 components, show defects in migration to high salt levels after learning under both fed and starved conditions. We also analyzed the behavioral phenotypes of mutants of the putative TORC1 substrate RSKS-1 (the C. elegans homolog of the mammalian S6 kinase S6K) and the putative TORC2 substrates SGK-1 and PKC-2 (homologs of the serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1, SGK1, and protein kinase C-α, PKC-α, respectively) and found that neuronal RSKS-1 and PKC-2, as well as intestinal SGK-1, are involved in taste associative learning. Our findings shed light on the functions of TOR signaling in behavioral plasticity and provide insight into the mechanisms by which information sensed in the intestine affects the nervous system to modulate food-searching behaviors."

We therefore aimed to develop an experimental porcine model for stepwise reduction of the renal venous blood flow and to compare an implantable Doppler probe and microdialysis for fast detection of vascular occlusion.In 20 pigs, implantable Doppler probes were placed on the renal artery and vein and a microdialysis catheter was placed in the renal cortex. An arterial flowprobe served as gold standard. Following two-hour baseline measurements, the pigs were randomised to stepwise venous occlusion, complete venous occlusion, complete arterial occlusion or controls.All parameters were stable through baseline measurements. Glutamate and lactate measured by microdialysis increased significantly (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03 respectively) 30 minutes after a 2/3 (66%) reduction in renal blood flow. The implantable Doppler probe was not able to detect flow changes until there was total venous occlusion. Microdialysis detected changes in local metabolism after both arterial and venous occlusion; the implantable Doppler probe could only detect vascular occlusions on the vessel it was placed.We developed a new model for stepwise renal venous blood flow occlusion. Furthermore, the first comparison of the implantable Doppler probe and microdialysis for detection of renal vascular occlusions was made. The implantable Doppler probe could only detect flow changes after a complete occlusion, whereas microdialysis detected changes earlier, and could detect both arterial and venous occlusion. Based on these results, the implantable Doppler probe for early detection of vascular occlusions cannot be recommended."

Methods Community-supported SAT for patients who completed the intensive phase was piloted in five primary care clinics in Khayelitsha. We compared final treatment outcomes among RR-TB patients initiating treatment before (standard-of-care (SOC)-cohort, January 2010-July 2013) and after the implementation of the pilot (SAT-cohort, January 2012-December 2014). All patients with outcomes before January 1, 2017 were considered in the analysis of outcomes. Results One-hundred-eighteen patients in the SOC-cohort and 174 patients in the SAT-cohort had final RR-TB treatment outcomes; 70% and 73% were HIV-co-infected, respectively. The proportion of patients with a final outcome of loss to follow-up (LTFU) did not differ whether treated in the SOC (25/118, 21.2%) or SAT-cohort (31/174, 17.8%) (P = 0.47). There were no significant differences in the time to 24-month LTFU among HIV-infected and uninfected patients (HR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.51–1.6, P = 0.71), or among patients enrolled in the SOC-cohort versus the SAT-cohort (HR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.49–1.4, P = 0.50) who received at least 6-months of RR-TB treatment. Conclusion The introduction of SAT during the continuation phase of RR-TB treatment does not adversely affect final RR-TB treatment outcomes in a high TB and HIV-burden setting. This differentiated, patient-centred model of care could be considered in RR-TB programmes to decrease the burden of DOT on patients and health facilities."

Defects in autophagy related genes are considered to show genetic heterogeneity between populations. We evaluated the association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the autophagy related 16 like 1 (ATG16L1) gene with IBD in Indians. The ATG16L1 gene was genotyped for ten different SNPs using DNA extracted from peripheral blood of 234 patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), 249 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 393 healthy controls The SNPs rs2241880, rs4663396, rs3792106, rs10210302, rs3792109, rs2241877, rs6737398, rs11682898, rs4663402 and rs4663421 were genotyped using the Sequenom MassArray platform. PLINK was used for the association analysis and pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) values. Haplotype analysis was done using Haploview. All SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in cases and controls. The G allele at rs6737398 exhibited a protective association with both CD and UC. The T allele at rs4663402 and C allele at rs4663421 were positively associated with CD and UC. The T allele at rs2241877 exhibited protective association with UC only. The AA genotype at rs4663402 and the GG genotype at rs4663421 were protectively associated with both CD and UC. Haplotype analysis revealed that all the SNPs in tight LD (D’ = 0.76–1.0) and organized in a single haplotype block. Haplotype D was positively associated with IBD (P = 5.8 x 10−6 for CD and 0.002 for UC). SNPs in ATG16L1 were associated with IBD in Indian patients. The relevance to management of individual patients requires further study."
https://openalex.org/W2616546024,"Background Current anti-cancer therapeutic antibodies that are used in the clinic are predominantly humanized or fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). These antibodies bind with high affinity to the target antigen and are efficient in activating the immune system via IgG Fc receptors and/or complement. In addition to IgG1, three more isotypes are present in humans, of which IgG3 has been found to be superior compared to human IgG1 in inducing antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis or activation of complement in some models. Nonetheless, no therapeutic human IgG3 mAbs have been developed due to the short in vivo half-life of most known IgG3 allotypes. In this manuscript, we compared the efficacy of V-gene matched IgG1 and IgG3 anti-tumour mAb (TA99) in mice, using natural variants of human IgG3 with short- or long half-life, differing only at position 435 with an arginine or histidine, respectively. Results In vitro human IgG1 and IgG3 did not show any differences in opsonisation ability of B16F10-gp75 mouse melanoma cells. IgG1, however, was superior in inducing phagocytosis of tumour cells by mouse macrophages. Similarly, in a mouse peritoneal metastasis model we did not detect an improved effect of IgG3 in preventing tumour outgrowth. Moreover, replacing the arginine at position 435 for a histidine in IgG3 to enhance half-life did not result in better suppression of tumour outgrowth compared to wild type IgG3 when injected prior to tumour cell injection. Conclusion In conclusion, human IgG3 does not have improved therapeutic efficacy compared to human IgG1 in a mouse tumour model."
https://openalex.org/W2618612676,"Background Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae and Bunyaviridae families show considerable genetic diversity. However, this diversity is not necessarily taken into account when developing diagnostic assays, which are often based on the pairwise alignment of a limited number of sequences. Our objective was to develop and evaluate a bioinformatics workflow addressing two recurrent issues of molecular assay design: (i) the high intraspecies genetic diversity in viruses and (ii) the potential for cross-reactivity with close relatives. Methodology The workflow developed herein was based on two consecutive BLASTn steps; the first was utilized to select highly conserved regions among the viral taxon of interest, and the second was employed to assess the degree of similarity of these highly-conserved regions to close relatives. Subsequently, the workflow was tested on a set of eight viral species, including various strains from the Flaviviridae and Bunyaviridae families. Principal findings The genetic diversity ranges from as low as 0.45% variable sites over the complete genome of the Japanese encephalitis virus to more than 16% of variable sites on segment L of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. Our proposed bioinformatics workflow allowed the selection—based on computing scores—of the best target for a diagnostic molecular assay for the eight viral species investigated. Conclusions/Significance Our bioinformatics workflow allowed rapid selection of highly conserved and specific genomic fragments among the investigated viruses, while considering up to several hundred complete genomic sequences. The pertinence of this workflow will increase in parallel to the number of sequences made publicly available. We hypothesize that our workflow might be utilized to select diagnostic molecular markers for higher organisms with more complex genomes, provided the sequences are made available."
https://openalex.org/W2619654053,"Despite optimal clinical treatment, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) inevitably recurs. Standard treatment of GBM, exposes patients to radiation which kills tumor cells, but also modulates the molecular fingerprint of any surviving tumor cells and the cross-talk between those cells and the host. Considerable investigation of short-term (hours to days) post-irradiation tumor cell response has been undertaken, yet long-term responses (weeks to months) which are potentially even more informative of recurrence, have been largely overlooked. To better understand the potential of these processes to reshape tumor regrowth, molecular studies in conjunction with in silico modeling were used to examine short- and long-term growth dynamics. Despite survival of 2.55% and 0.009% following 8 or 16Gy, GBM cell populations in vitro showed a robust escape from cellular extinction and a return to pre-irradiated growth rates with no changes in long-term population doublings. In contrast, these same irradiated GBM cell populations injected in vivo elicited tumors which displayed significantly suppressed growth rates compared to their pre-irradiated counterparts. Transcriptome analysis days to weeks after irradiation revealed, 281 differentially expressed genes with a robust increase for cytokines, histones and C-C or C-X-C motif chemokines in irradiated cells. Strikingly, this same inflammatory signature in vivo for IL1A, CXCL1, IL6 and IL8 was increased in xenografts months after irradiation. Computational modeling of tumor cell dynamics indicated a host-mediated negative pressure on the surviving cells was a source of inhibition consistent with the findings resulting in suppressed tumor growth. Thus, tumor cells surviving irradiation may shift the landscape of population doubling through inflammatory mediators interacting with the host in a way that impacts tumor recurrence and affects the efficacy of subsequent therapies. Clues to more effective therapies may lie in the development and use of pre-clinical models of post-treatment response to target the source of inflammatory mediators that significantly alter cellular dynamics and molecular pathways in the early stages of tumor recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2618686742,"The early olfactory system is organized in parallel, with numerous, specialized subsystems established by the modular and topographic projections of sensory inputs. While these anatomical sub-systems are in many cases demarcated by well-known marker genes, we stand to learn considerably more about their possible functional specializations from comprehensive, genome-scale descriptions of their molecular anatomy. Here, we leverage the resources of the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA)-a spatially registered compendium of gene expression for the mouse brain-to investigate the early olfactory system's genomic anatomy. We cluster thousands of genes across thousands of voxels in the ABA to derive several novel parcellations of the olfactory system, and concomitantly discover novel sets of enriched, subregion-specific genes that can serve as a starting point for future inquiry."
https://openalex.org/W2620424060,"The major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the development of peritonitis, an infection within the abdominal cavity, primarily caused by bacteria. PD peritonitis is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most frequently isolated cause of PD-associated peritonitis. Mesothelial cells are integral to the host response to peritonitis, and subsequent clinical outcomes, yet the effects of infection on mesothelial cells are not well characterised. We systematically investigated the early mesothelial cell response to clinical and reference isolates of S. epidermidis using primary mesothelial cells and the mesothelial cell line Met-5A. Using an unbiased whole genome microarray, followed by a targeted panel of genes known to be involved in the human antibacterial response, we identified 38 differentially regulated genes (adj. p-value < 0.05) representing 35 canonical pathways after 1 hour exposure to S. epidermidis. The top 3 canonical pathways were TNFR2 signaling, IL-17A signaling, and TNFR1 signaling (adj. p-values of 0.0012, 0.0012 and 0.0019, respectively). Subsequent qPCR validation confirmed significant differences in gene expression in a number of genes not previously described in mesothelial cell responses to infection, with heterogeneity observed between clinical isolates of S. epidermidis, and between Met-5A and primary mesothelial cells. Heterogeneity between different S. epidermidis isolates suggests that specific virulence factors may play critical roles in influencing outcomes from peritonitis. This study provides new insights into early mesothelial cell responses to infection with S. epidermidis, and confirms the importance of validating findings in primary mesothelial cells."
