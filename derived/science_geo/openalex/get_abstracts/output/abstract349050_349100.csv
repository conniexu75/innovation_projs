https://openalex.org/W2417334090,"The excretion of unchanged Benadryl accounts for only a small portion of the total administered dose in man (1, 2). Indirect evidence for the presence of degradation products in tissues and urine was obtained with Benadryl labeled with radioactive carbon (3). The experiments reported here show that degradation is produced by tissue enzymes, resulting in a loss of the basic properties of Benadryl as measured by the methyl orange technique (4)."

https://openalex.org/W1907581927,"Acid hydrolysis has long been used to free the urinary 17-ketosteroids from the water-soluble combinations in which they are excreted. Both hydrochloric acid (13,5,11) and sulfuric acid (15)’ have been employed, for this purpose. The acid treatment, while effecting relatively complete hydrolysis, may also result in destruction (13, 5, 6,3, IS), chlorine substitution (2), dehydration (20,4, 12), and in stereoisomeric transformations (6, 16). Attempts to obviate the destructive action of acid hydrolysis have been made by Talbot and his associates. They described an enzymatic hydrolytic procedure (18) and also a method of hydrolysis utilizing barium chloride at pH 5.8 (19). Their studies were conducted on urine from patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma and adrenal cortical hyperplasia (18). We have investigated the BaClz hydrolysis of the conjugated 17ketosteroids in specimens of normal male urine and have obtained by this method a much higher P (C, hydroxyl cis to the Cl0 methyl) fraction than is usually reported for normal urine. The experiments reported below further indicate that a large proportion of the p-17-ketosteroids is changed to an “a” fraction (no cis Ct hydroxyl group) by the usual HCl hydrolytic technique."

https://openalex.org/W4254233059,"THE problems education in science and of education though natural science were considered by scentific men and schoolmasters at the Dundee meeting of Bristish Association, and similar problems at the university level have now arisen in the University of Cambridge. A 'Syndicate' has been revieweing the regulations for the Natural Sciences Tripos, and the discussion of its report in the Regent House on February 22 showed that many in Cambridge have misgivings about the scientific education now being given to undergraduates. A number of tutors, directors of studies and college supervisors urged the need for drastic reforms. The position at Cambridge is probably similar to that at many other British universities, and merits the attention of all who are interested in the training of scientific men and citizens. Many of those who are closely in touch with the life and work of undergraduates are convinced that science students are being given so much formal factual teaching that they have no time for reading and reflexion. The study of the wider and more cultural aspects of their work is precluded and their intellectual development retarded. The courses of instruction seem generally designed for the production of specialist research workers ; and specialization seems on the increase, in spite of the fact that only a small percentage of the students who read science become professional scientific workers. It seems to be overlooked that many will become teachers in schools, some will go into the Civil Service, others will join the administrative staffs of business or manufacturing firms ; such students need a wider and more general training."
