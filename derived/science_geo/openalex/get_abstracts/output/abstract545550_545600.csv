https://openalex.org/W2157923000,"Deletion of Twist or Snail, two key transcription factors that induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma leads to an increase in cell proliferation, and a greater sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine, with no effect on invasion or metastasis. It has been suggested that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which epithelial cells depolarize and adopt a fibroblast-like morphology, is a requirement for metastasis to occur. Other studies imply that the importance of EMT relies on cell-culture-based manipulation of EMT regulators. In this issue of Nature, two groups present results that suggest that EMT is not a prerequisite for metasasis. Dingcheng Gao and colleagues trace the fate of cells that have undergone EMT in mouse model for breast-to-lung metastasis. They find that although some cells undergo EMT in a primary epithelial tumour, the lung metastases mainly contain cells that have not undergone EMT. However, cells that have undergone EMT appear more resistant to chemotherapy. A microRNA that targets key EMT regulators is shown not to affect metastasis, but to reduce survival of EMT cells following chemotherapy. Raghu Kalluri and colleagues delete Twist or Snail — transcription factors that induce EMT — in a mouse model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This leads to an increase in cell proliferation, and a greater sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine, with no effect on invasion and metastasis. Diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a dismal prognosis despite current best therapies; therefore new treatment strategies are urgently required. Numerous studies have suggested that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to early-stage dissemination of cancer cells and is pivotal for invasion and metastasis of PDAC1,2,3,4. EMT is associated with phenotypic conversion of epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells in cell culture conditions, although such defined mesenchymal conversion (with spindle-shaped morphology) of epithelial cells in vivo is rare, with quasi-mesenchymal phenotypes occasionally observed in the tumour (partial EMT)5,6. Most studies exploring the functional role of EMT in tumours have depended on cell-culture-induced loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments involving EMT-inducing transcription factors such as Twist, Snail and Zeb1 (refs 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10). Therefore, the functional contribution of EMT to invasion and metastasis remains unclear4,6, and genetically engineered mouse models to address a causal connection are lacking. Here we functionally probe the role of EMT in PDAC by generating mouse models of PDAC with deletion of Snail or Twist, two key transcription factors responsible for EMT. EMT suppression in the primary tumour does not alter the emergence of invasive PDAC, systemic dissemination or metastasis. Suppression of EMT leads to an increase in cancer cell proliferation with enhanced expression of nucleoside transporters in tumours, contributing to enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment and increased overall survival of mice. Collectively, our study suggests that Snail- or Twist-induced EMT is not rate-limiting for invasion and metastasis, but highlights the importance of combining EMT inhibition with chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2150322923,"The role of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in metastasis is a longstanding source of debate, largely owing to an inability to monitor transient and reversible EMT phenotypes in vivo. Here we establish an EMT lineage-tracing system to monitor this process in mice, using a mesenchymal-specific Cre-mediated fluorescent marker switch system in spontaneous breast-to-lung metastasis models. We show that within a predominantly epithelial primary tumour, a small proportion of tumour cells undergo EMT. Notably, lung metastases mainly consist of non-EMT tumour cells that maintain their epithelial phenotype. Inhibiting EMT by overexpressing the microRNA miR-200 does not affect lung metastasis development. However, EMT cells significantly contribute to recurrent lung metastasis formation after chemotherapy. These cells survived cyclophosphamide treatment owing to reduced proliferation, apoptotic tolerance and increased expression of chemoresistance-related genes. Overexpression of miR-200 abrogated this resistance. This study suggests the potential of an EMT-targeting strategy, in conjunction with conventional chemotherapies, for breast cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2149934794,"Porous materials find use in applications such as gas separation, drug delivery and energy storage, but have hitherto been solid rather than liquid; now a combination of cage molecules and a crown-ether solvent that cannot enter the cage molecules is used to create a porous liquid that can solubilize methane gas better than non-porous liquids. Materials that are intrinsically porous, consisting of molecules organized in cage-like structures, are generally solid at usable temperatures. A few liquefiable, rigid cavity-containing molecules have been described, but they do not contain permanent pores as liquids inevitably flow to fill any available spaces. Now Nicola Giri et al. have developed a new type of 'porous liquid' consisting of a high concentration of modified cage molecules in a crown ether solvent that combine to generate permanent, unoccupied cavities in the liquid phase. The authors show that this free-flowing liquid can solubilize methane gas more efficiently than non-porous liquids. Porous liquids have potential in applications such as catalysis, extraction, and gas capture or separation. Porous solids such as zeolites1 and metal–organic frameworks2,3 are useful in molecular separation and in catalysis, but their solid nature can impose limitations. For example, liquid solvents, rather than porous solids, are the most mature technology for post-combustion capture of carbon dioxide because liquid circulation systems are more easily retrofitted to existing plants. Solid porous adsorbents offer major benefits, such as lower energy penalties in adsorption–desorption cycles4, but they are difficult to implement in conventional flow processes. Materials that combine the properties of fluidity and permanent porosity could therefore offer technological advantages, but permanent porosity is not associated with conventional liquids5. Here we report free-flowing liquids whose bulk properties are determined by their permanent porosity. To achieve this, we designed cage molecules6,7 that provide a well-defined pore space and that are highly soluble in solvents whose molecules are too large to enter the pores. The concentration of unoccupied cages can thus be around 500 times greater than in other molecular solutions that contain cavities8,9,10, resulting in a marked change in bulk properties, such as an eightfold increase in the solubility of methane gas. Our results provide the basis for development of a new class of functional porous materials for chemical processes, and we present a one-step, multigram scale-up route for highly soluble ‘scrambled’ porous cages prepared from a mixture of commercially available reagents. The unifying design principle for these materials is the avoidance of functional groups that can penetrate into the molecular cage cavities."

https://openalex.org/W2129003604,"Plant genomes, and eukaryotic genomes in general, are typically repetitive, polyploid and heterozygous, which complicates genome assembly. The short read lengths of early Sanger and current next-generation sequencing platforms hinder assembly through complex repeat regions, and many draft and reference genomes are fragmented, lacking skewed GC and repetitive intergenic sequences, which are gaining importance due to projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). Here we report the whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the desiccation-tolerant grass Oropetium thomaeum. Using only single-molecule real-time sequencing, which generates long (>16 kilobases) reads with random errors, we assembled 99% (244 megabases) of the Oropetium genome into 625 contigs with an N50 length of 2.4 megabases. Oropetium is an example of a 'near-complete' draft genome which includes gapless coverage over gene space as well as intergenic sequences such as centromeres, telomeres, transposable elements and rRNA clusters that are typically unassembled in draft genomes. Oropetium has 28,466 protein-coding genes and 43% repeat sequences, yet with 30% more compact euchromatic regions it is the smallest known grass genome. The Oropetium genome demonstrates the utility of single-molecule real-time sequencing for assembling high-quality plant and other eukaryotic genomes, and serves as a valuable resource for the plant comparative genomics community."
https://openalex.org/W2129920232,"ASS1, a urea cycle enzyme, promotes cancer cell proliferation by facilitating pyrimidine synthesis via CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase complex) activation. The urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) is silenced in multiple cancers, but it has not been clear how or why this happens. Ayelet Erez and colleagues now show that ASS1 downregulation promotes cancer cell proliferation by activating CAD (a multifunctional complex of carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase complex) and facilitating the synthesis of pyrimidines. This work identifies CAD blockade as a possible therapeutic strategy in cancers in which ASS1 is downregulated and demonstrates a metabolic link between urea cycle enzymes and pyrimidine synthesis. Cancer cells hijack and remodel existing metabolic pathways for their benefit. Argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) is a urea cycle enzyme that is essential in the conversion of nitrogen from ammonia and aspartate to urea. A decrease in nitrogen flux through ASS1 in the liver causes the urea cycle disorder citrullinaemia1. In contrast to the well-studied consequences of loss of ASS1 activity on ureagenesis, the purpose of its somatic silencing in multiple cancers is largely unknown2. Here we show that decreased activity of ASS1 in cancers supports proliferation by facilitating pyrimidine synthesis via CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase complex) activation. Our studies were initiated by delineating the consequences of loss of ASS1 activity in humans with two types of citrullinaemia. We find that in citrullinaemia type I (CTLN I), which is caused by deficiency of ASS1, there is increased pyrimidine synthesis and proliferation compared with citrullinaemia type II (CTLN II), in which there is decreased substrate availability for ASS1 caused by deficiency of the aspartate transporter citrin. Building on these results, we demonstrate that ASS1 deficiency in cancer increases cytosolic aspartate levels, which increases CAD activation by upregulating its substrate availability and by increasing its phosphorylation by S6K1 through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Decreasing CAD activity by blocking citrin, the mTOR signalling, or pyrimidine synthesis decreases proliferation and thus may serve as a therapeutic strategy in multiple cancers where ASS1 is downregulated. Our results demonstrate that ASS1 downregulation is a novel mechanism supporting cancerous proliferation, and they provide a metabolic link between the urea cycle enzymes and pyrimidine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2120663217,"M-dwarf stars--hydrogen-burning stars that are smaller than 60 per cent of the size of the Sun--are the most common class of star in our Galaxy and outnumber Sun-like stars by a ratio of 12:1. Recent results have shown that M dwarfs host Earth-sized planets in great numbers: the average number of M-dwarf planets that are between 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of Earth is at least 1.4 per star. The nearest such planets known to transit their star are 39 parsecs away, too distant for detailed follow-up observations to measure the planetary masses or to study their atmospheres. Here we report observations of GJ 1132b, a planet with a size of 1.2 Earth radii that is transiting a small star 12 parsecs away. Our Doppler mass measurement of GJ 1132b yields a density consistent with an Earth-like bulk composition, similar to the compositions of the six known exoplanets with masses less than six times that of the Earth and precisely measured densities. Receiving 19 times more stellar radiation than the Earth, the planet is too hot to be habitable but is cool enough to support a substantial atmosphere, one that has probably been considerably depleted of hydrogen. Because the host star is nearby and only 21 per cent the radius of the Sun, existing and upcoming telescopes will be able to observe the composition and dynamics of the planetary atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2191896778,"Contraction of both skeletal muscle and the heart is thought to be controlled by a calcium-dependent structural change in the actin-containing thin filaments, which permits the binding of myosin motors from the neighbouring thick filaments to drive filament sliding. Here we show by synchrotron small-angle X-ray diffraction of frog (Rana temporaria) single skeletal muscle cells that, although the well-known thin-filament mechanism is sufficient for regulation of muscle shortening against low load, force generation against high load requires a second permissive step linked to a change in the structure of the thick filament. The resting (switched 'OFF') structure of the thick filament is characterized by helical tracks of myosin motors on the filament surface and a short backbone periodicity. This OFF structure is almost completely preserved during low-load shortening, which is driven by a small fraction of constitutively active (switched 'ON') myosin motors outside thick-filament control. At higher load, these motors generate sufficient thick-filament stress to trigger the transition to its long-periodicity ON structure, unlocking the major population of motors required for high-load contraction. This concept of the thick filament as a regulatory mechanosensor provides a novel explanation for the dynamic and energetic properties of skeletal muscle. A similar mechanism probably operates in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2396693700,"Animals have evolved homeostatic responses to changes in oxygen availability that act on different timescales. Although the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional pathway that controls long-term responses to low oxygen (hypoxia) has been established, the pathway that mediates acute responses to hypoxia in mammals is not well understood. Here we show that the olfactory receptor gene Olfr78 is highly and selectively expressed in oxygen-sensitive glomus cells of the carotid body, a chemosensory organ at the carotid artery bifurcation that monitors blood oxygen and stimulates breathing within seconds when oxygen declines. Olfr78 mutants fail to increase ventilation in hypoxia but respond normally to hypercapnia. Glomus cells are present in normal numbers and appear structurally intact, but hypoxia-induced carotid body activity is diminished. Lactate, a metabolite that rapidly accumulates in hypoxia and induces hyperventilation, activates Olfr78 in heterologous expression experiments, induces calcium transients in glomus cells, and stimulates carotid sinus nerve activity through Olfr78. We propose that, in addition to its role in olfaction, Olfr78 acts as a hypoxia sensor in the breathing circuit by sensing lactate produced when oxygen levels decline."

https://openalex.org/W2160181722,"The first stars and their immediate successors should be found today in the central regions (bulges) of galaxies; old, metal-poor stars have now been found in the Milky Way bulge, including one star with an iron abundance about 10,000 times lower than that of the Sun without noticeable carbon enhancement, making it possibly the oldest known star in the Galaxy. Galaxy formation models predict that the first stars born after the Big Bang and their immediate descendants should now be found preferentially near the centres (or bulges) of galaxies. Louise Howes et al. report observations of stars in the Milky Way bulge with some of the properties expected for these early stars formed during the 'cosmic dawn'. The authors identify more than 500 stars with an iron abundance less than 1/100th of the solar value, including one star with an iron abundance more than 10,000 times lower than solar value — without the carbon enhancement seen in stars in the outer regions of the Galaxy. Their chemical compositions are in general similar to typical halo stars of the same metallicity, although intriguing differences exist, including lower abundances of carbon. The first stars are predicted to have formed within 200 million years after the Big Bang1, initiating the cosmic dawn. A true first star has not yet been discovered, although stars2,3,4 with tiny amounts of elements heavier than helium (‘metals’) have been found in the outer regions (‘halo’) of the Milky Way. The first stars and their immediate successors should, however, preferentially be found today in the central regions (‘bulges’) of galaxies, because they formed in the largest over-densities that grew gravitationally with time5,6. The Milky Way bulge underwent a rapid chemical enrichment during the first 1–2 billion years7, leading to a dearth of early, metal-poor stars8,9. Here we report observations of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way bulge, including one star with an iron abundance about 10,000 times lower than the solar value without noticeable carbon enhancement. We confirm that most of the metal-poor bulge stars are on tight orbits around the Galactic Centre, rather than being halo stars passing through the bulge, as expected for stars formed at redshifts greater than 15. Their chemical compositions are in general similar to typical halo stars of the same metallicity although intriguing differences exist, including lower abundances of carbon."
https://openalex.org/W2118668903,"Chromatin undergoes a rapid ATP-dependent, ATM and H2AX-independent decondensation when DNA damage is introduced by laser microirradiation. Although the detailed mechanism of this decondensation remains to be determined, the kinetics of decondensation are similar to the kinetics of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. We used laser microirradiation to introduce DNA strand breaks into living cells expressing a photoactivatable GFP-tagged histone H2B. We find that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation mediated primarily by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is responsible for the rapid decondensation of chromatin at sites of DNA damage. This decondensation of chromatin correlates temporally with the displacement of histones, which is sensitive to PARP inhibition and is transient in nature. Contrary to the predictions of the histone shuttle hypothesis, we did not find that histone H1 accumulated on poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) in vivo. Rather, histone H1, and to a lessor extent, histones H2A and H2B were rapidly depleted from the sites of PAR accumulation. However, histone H1 returns to chromatin and the chromatin recondenses. Thus, the PARP-dependent relaxation of chromatin closely correlates with histone displacement."
https://openalex.org/W2179862626,"Soil labile organic carbon and soil enzymes play important roles in the carbon cycle of coastal wetlands that have high organic carbon accumulation rates. Soils under three vegetations (Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora, and Scirpusm mariqueter) as well as bare mudflat in Hangzhou Bay wetland of China were collected seasonally. Seasonal dynamics and correlations of soil labile organic carbon fractions and soil enzyme activities were analyzed. The results showed that there were significant differences among vegetation types in the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), excepting for that of microbial biomass carbon (MBC). The P. australis soil was with the highest content of both SOC (7.86 g kg-1) and DOC (306 mg kg-1), while the S. mariqueter soil was with the lowest content of SOC (6.83 g kg-1), and the bare mudflat was with the lowest content of DOC (270 mg kg-1). Soil enzyme activities were significantly different among vegetation types except for urease. The P. australis had the highest annual average activity of alkaline phosphomonoesterase (21.4 mg kg-1 h-1), and the S. alterniflora had the highest annual average activities of β-glycosidase (4.10 mg kg-1 h-1) and invertase (9.81mg g-1 24h-1); however, the bare mudflat had the lowest activities of alkaline phosphomonoesterase (16.2 mg kg-1 h-1), β-glycosidase (2.87 mg kg-1 h-1), and invertase (8.02 mg g-1 24h-1). Analysis also showed that the soil labile organic carbon fractions and soil enzyme activities had distinct seasonal dynamics. In addition, the soil MBC content was significantly correlated with the activities of urease and β-glucosidase. The DOC content was significantly correlated with the activities of urease, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, and invertase. The results indicated that vegetation type is an important factor influencing the spatial-temporal variation of soil enzyme activities and labile organic carbon in coastal wetlands."
https://openalex.org/W2114007970,"Brachylophosaurini is a clade of hadrosaurine dinosaurs currently known from the Campanian (Late Cretaceous) of North America. Its members include: Acristavus gagslarsoni, which lacks a nasal crest; Brachylophosaurus canadensis, which possesses a flat paddle-shaped nasal crest projecting posteriorly over the dorsal skull roof; and Maiasaura peeblesorum, which possesses a dorsally-projecting nasofrontal crest. Acristavus, from the lower Two Medicine Formation of Montana (~81-80 Ma), is hypothesized to be the ancestral member of the clade. Brachylophosaurus specimens are from the middle Oldman Formation of Alberta and equivalent beds in the Judith River Formation of Montana; the upper Oldman Formation is dated 77.8 Ma.A new brachylophosaurin hadrosaur, Probrachylophosaurus bergei (gen. et sp. nov.) is described and phylogenetically analyzed based on the skull and postcranium of a large individual from the Judith River Formation of northcentral Montana (79.8-79.5 Ma); the horizon is equivalent to the lower Oldman Formation of Alberta. Cranial morphology of Probrachylophosaurus, most notably the nasal crest, is intermediate between Acristavus and Brachylophosaurus. In Brachylophosaurus, the nasal crest lengthens and flattens ontogenetically, covering the supratemporal fenestrae in large adults. The smaller nasal crest of Probrachylophosaurus is strongly triangular in cross section and only minimally overhangs the supratemporal fenestrae, similar to an ontogenetically earlier stage of Brachylophosaurus. Sutural fusion and tibial osteohistology reveal that the holotype of Probrachylophosaurus was relatively more mature than a similarly large Brachylophosaurus specimen; thus, Probrachylophosaurus is not simply an immature Brachylophosaurus.The small triangular posteriorly oriented nasal crest of Probrachylophosaurus is proposed to represent a transitional nasal morphology between that of a non-crested ancestor such as Acristavus and the large flat posteriorly oriented nasal crest of adult Brachylophosaurus. Because Probrachylophosaurus is stratigraphically and morphologically intermediate between these taxa, Probrachylophosaurus is hypothesized to be an intermediate member of the Acristavus-Brachylophosaurus evolutionary lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2275318470,"Ants are able to climb effortlessly on vertical and inverted smooth surfaces. When climbing, their feet touch the substrate not only with their pretarsal adhesive pads but also with dense arrays of fine hairs on the ventral side of the 3rd and 4th tarsal segments. To understand what role these different attachment structures play during locomotion, we analysed leg kinematics and recorded single-leg ground reaction forces in Weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) climbing vertically on a smooth glass substrate. We found that the ants engaged different attachment structures depending on whether their feet were above or below their Centre of Mass (CoM). Legs above the CoM pulled and engaged the arolia (‘toes’), whereas legs below the CoM pushed with the 3rd and 4th tarsomeres (‘heels’) in surface contact. Legs above the CoM carried a significantly larger proportion of the body weight than legs below the CoM. Force measurements on individual ant tarsi showed that friction increased with normal load as a result of the bending and increasing side contact of the tarsal hairs. On a rough sandpaper substrate, the tarsal hairs generated higher friction forces in the pushing than in the pulling direction, whereas the reverse effect was found on the smooth substrate. When the tarsal hairs were pushed, buckling was observed for forces exceeding the shear forces found in climbing ants. Adhesion forces were small but not negligible, and higher on the smooth substrate. Our results indicate that the dense tarsal hair arrays produce friction forces when pressed against the substrate, and help the ants to push outwards during horizontal and vertical walking."

The examination of eye movement control gains deep insights into brain network pathology and provides the opportunity to detect both disturbance of the brainstem oculomotor circuitry as well as executive deficits of oculomotor function associated with higher brain networks.To study systematically oculomotor characteristics in ALS and its underlying network pathology in order to determine whether eye movement deterioration can be categorized within a staging system of oculomotor decline that corresponds to the neuropathological model.Sixty-eight ALS patients and 31 controls underwent video-oculographic, clinical and neuropsychological assessments.Oculomotor examinations revealed increased anti- and delayed saccades' errors, gaze-palsy and a cerebellary type of smooth pursuit disturbance. The oculomotor disturbances occurred in a sequential manner: Stage 1, only executive control of eye movements was affected. Stage 2 indicates disturbed executive control plus 'genuine' oculomotor dysfunctions such as gaze-paly. We found high correlations (p<0.001) between the oculomotor stages and both, the clinical presentation as assessed by the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) score, and cognitive scores from the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS).Dysfunction of eye movement control in ALS can be characterized by a two-staged sequential pattern comprising executive deficits in Stage 1 and additional impaired infratentorial oculomotor control pathways in Stage 2. This pattern parallels the neuropathological staging of ALS and may serve as a technical marker of the neuropathological spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2167047044,"European guidelines recommend the routine offer of an HIV test in patients with a number of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS conditions believed to share an association with HIV; so called indicator conditions (IC). Adherence with this guidance across Europe is not known. We audited HIV testing behaviour in patients accessing care for a number of ICs. Participating centres reviewed the case notes of either 100 patients or of all consecutive patients in one year, presenting for each of the following ICs: tuberculosis, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, anal and cervical cancer, hepatitis B and C and oesophageal candidiasis. Observed HIV-positive rates were applied by region and IC to estimate the number of HIV diagnoses potentially missed. Outcomes examined were: HIV test rate (% of total patients with IC), HIV test accepted (% of tests performed/% of tests offered) and new HIV diagnosis rate (%). There were 49 audits from 23 centres, representing 7037 patients. The median test rate across audits was 72% (IQR 32–97), lowest in Northern Europe (median 44%, IQR 22–68%) and highest in Eastern Europe (median 99%, IQR 86–100). Uptake of testing was close to 100% in all regions. The median HIV+ rate was 0.9% (IQR 0.0–4.9), with 29 audits (60.4%) having an HIV+ rate >0.1%. After adjustment, there were no differences between regions of Europe in the proportion with >0.1% testing positive (global p = 0.14). A total of 113 patients tested HIV+. Applying the observed rates of testing HIV+ within individual ICs and regions to all persons presenting with an IC suggested that 105 diagnoses were potentially missed. Testing rates in well-established HIV ICs remained low across Europe, despite high prevalence rates, reflecting missed opportunities for earlier HIV diagnosis and care. Significant numbers may have had an opportunity for HIV diagnosis if all persons included in IC audits had been tested."

However, healthcare systems in low-income countries are inadequately equipped to deal with the growing disease burden, which requires chronic care for patients. The aim of this study was to assess the capacity of health facilities to manage hypertension in two districts in Uganda.In a cross-sectional study conducted between June and October 2012, we surveyed 126 health facilities (6 hospitals, 4 Health Center IV (HCIV), 23 Health Center III (HCIII), 41 Health Center II (HCII) and 52 private clinics/dispensaries) in Mukono and Buikwe districts in Uganda. We assessed records, conducted structured interviews with heads of facilities, and administered questionnaires to 271 health workers. The study assessed service provision for hypertension, availability of supplies such as medicines, guidelines and equipment, in-service training for hypertension, knowledge of hypertension management, challenges and recommendations.Of the 126 health facilities, 92.9% reported managing (diagnosing/treating) patients with hypertension, and most (80.2%) were run by non-medical doctors or non-physician health workers (NPHW). Less than half (46%) of the facilities had guidelines for managing hypertension. A 10th of the facilities lacked functioning blood pressure devices and 28% did not have stethoscopes. No facilities ever calibrated their BP devices except one. About a half of the facilities had anti-hypertensive medicines in stock; mainly thiazide diuretics (46%), beta blockers (56%) and calcium channel blockers (48.4%). Alpha blockers, mixed alpha & beta blockers and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were only stocked by private clinics/dispensaries. Most HCIIs lacked anti-hypertensive medicines, including the first line thiazide diuretics. Significant knowledge gaps in classification of patients as hypertensive were noted among respondents. All health workers (except 5, 1.9%) indicated that they needed additional training in hypertension management. Several provider and patient related challenges were also observed in this study.Health facilities in this setting are inadequately equipped to provide services for management of hypertension. Diagnostic equipment, anti-hypertensive drugs and personnel present great challenges. To address the increasing burden of hypertension and other chronic diseases, measures are needed to substantially strengthen the healthcare facilities, including training of personnel in management of hypertension and other chronic diseases, and improving diagnostic and treatment supplies."

Electrophysiology experiments showed that cAMP, cGMP, and cCMP were effective agonists of the channel and produced similar increases in the extent of channel activation. In contrast, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on the isolated CNBD indicated that the induced conformational changes and the degrees of stabilization of the active conformation differed for the three cyclic nucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W2247837647,"Overexpression of TOP2A is associated with risk of systemic progression in prostate cancer patients, and higher levels of TOP2A were found in hormone-resistant cases. To elucidate the mechanism by which high levels of TOP2A contribute to tumor progression we generated TOP2A overexpressing prostate cancer cell lines. We show that TOP2A promotes tumor aggressiveness by inducing chromosomal rearrangements of genes that contribute to a more invasive phenotype. Anti-androgen treatment alone was ineffective in killing TOP2A overexpressing cells due to activation of an androgen receptor network. TOP2A poisons killed tumor cells more efficiently early in the progression course, while at later stages they provided greater benefit when combined with anti-androgen therapy. Mechanistically, we find that TOP2A enhances androgen signaling by facilitating transcription of androgen responsive genes, thereby promoting tumor cell growth. These studies revealed a relationship between TOP2A and androgen receptor signaling pathway that contributes to prostate cancer progression and confers sensitivity to treatments."

Three almost identical isoforms, HRAS, KRAS and NRAS, are ubiquitously expressed yet have differing biological and oncogenic properties. In order to help understand the relative biological contributions of each isoform we have optimised a quantitative proteomics method for accurately measuring Ras isoform protein copy number per cell. The use of isotopic protein standards together with selected reaction monitoring for diagnostic peptides is sensitive, robust and suitable for application to sub-milligram quantities of lysates. We find that in a panel of isogenic SW48 colorectal cancer cells, endogenous Ras proteins are highly abundant with ≥260,000 total Ras protein copies per cell and the rank order of isoform abundance is KRAS>NRAS≥HRAS. A subset of oncogenic KRAS mutants exhibit increased total cellular Ras abundance and altered the ratio of mutant versus wild type KRAS protein. These data and methodology are significant because Ras protein copy number is required to parameterise models of signalling networks and informs interpretation of isoform-specific Ras functional data."

Increased release of lactate dehydrogenase in OmpU-treated cells indicates that the OmpU-mediated cell death also has characteristics of necrosis. Further, we show that the mechanism of OmpU-mediated cell death involves major mitochondrial changes in the target cells. We observe that OmpU treatment leads to the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). AIF translocates to the host cell nucleus, implying that it has a crucial role in OmpU-mediated cell death. Finally, we observe that OmpU translocates to the target cell mitochondria, where it directly initiates mitochondrial changes leading to mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and AIF release. Partial blocking of AIF release by cyclosporine A in OmpU-treated cells further suggests that OmpU may be inducing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. All of these results lead us to the conclusion that OmpU induces cell death in target cells in a programmed manner in which mitochondria play a central role. Porins, a major class of outer membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria, primarily act as transport channels. OmpU is one of the major porins of human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae.

https://openalex.org/W2174986070,"Health technology assessment (HTA) has been continuously used for value-based healthcare decisions over the last decade. Healthcare databases represent an important source of information for HTA, which has seen a surge in use in Western countries. Although HTA agencies have been established in Asia-Pacific region, application and understanding of healthcare databases for HTA is rather limited. Thus, we reviewed existing databases to assess their potential for HTA in Thailand where HTA has been used officially and Japan where HTA is going to be officially introduced.Existing healthcare databases in Thailand and Japan were compiled and reviewed. Databases' characteristics e.g. name of database, host, scope/objective, time/sample size, design, data collection method, population/sample, and variables were described. Databases were assessed for its potential HTA use in terms of safety/efficacy/effectiveness, social/ethical, organization/professional, economic, and epidemiological domains. Request route for each database was also provided.Forty databases- 20 from Thailand and 20 from Japan-were included. These comprised of national censuses, surveys, registries, administrative data, and claimed databases. All databases were potentially used for epidemiological studies. In addition, data on mortality, morbidity, disability, adverse events, quality of life, service/technology utilization, length of stay, and economics were also found in some databases. However, access to patient-level data was limited since information about the databases was not available on public sources.Our findings have shown that existing databases provided valuable information for HTA research with limitation on accessibility. Mutual dialogue on healthcare database development and usage for HTA among Asia-Pacific region is needed."

In some teleost species another protein kinase, Z-DNA-dependent protein kinase (PKZ), plays a similar role but instead of dsRNA binding domains, PKZ has Zα domains. These domains recognize the left-handed conformer of dsDNA and dsRNA known as Z-DNA/Z-RNA. Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 infects common and koi carp, which have PKZ, and encodes the ORF112 protein that itself bears a Zα domain, a putative competitive inhibitor of PKZ. Here we present the crystal structure of ORF112-Zα in complex with an 18-bp CpG DNA repeat, at 1.5 Å. We demonstrate that the bound DNA is in the left-handed conformation and identify key interactions for the specificity of ORF112.

Localization of ORF112 protein in stress granules induced in Cyprinid herpesvirus 3-infected fish cells suggests a functional behavior similar to that of Zα domains of the interferon-regulated, nucleic acid surveillance proteins ADAR1 and DAI. The nucleic acid double-helix can adopt three main conformations termed A, B, and Z. Among these conformations, the Z-DNA or Z-RNA is the only one that has a left-handed configuration and is named for its characteristic zig-zag backbone shape (1Wang A.H. Quigley G.J. Kolpak F.J.

Molecular structure of a left-handed double helical DNA fragment at atomic resolution.Nature. 1979; 282: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Because the Z conformation is energetically unfavorable under physiological conditions, for long it was not clear whether it plays a role in biological processes (2Rich A. Zhang S. Timeline: Z-DNA: the long road to biological function.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This changed with the discovery of Zα domains, which belong to the winged helix-turn-helix fold family and bind with high specificity and affinity to both Z-DNA and Z-RNA (reviewed in Ref. 3Athanasiadis A. Zalpha-domains: at the intersection between RNA editing and innate immunity.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 23: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Until now, these domains have only been found in proteins involved in the antiviral interferon response pathway and act either as part of host foreign nucleic acid surveillance proteins or as their viral inhibitors (3Athanasiadis A. Zalpha-domains: at the intersection between RNA editing and innate immunity.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 23: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The unique ability of Zα domains to stabilize the left-handed conformation under physiological conditions of both DNA and RNA has led to extensive structural studies aiming at understanding the underlying mechanism. Crystal structures of DNA complexes with Zα domains from the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), the DNA sensor DAI (DNA activator of interferon regulatory factors), the Z-DNA dependent protein kinase PKZ, 3The abbreviations used are: PKZZ-DNA-dependent protein kinaseCyHV-3cyprinid herpesvirus 3CCBcommon carp brainRMSDroot mean square deviationdsRNAdouble-stranded RNASGstress granulePDBProtein Data Bank. and the poxviral interferon response inhibitor E3L have revealed a highly conserved set of interactions (4Schwartz T.

Despite extensive in vitro studies, little is known about the context of Zα targeting in vivo or other functional roles of the domain. Recent studies showed that Zα domains localize in stress granules (SGs): ribonucleoprotein particles formed by stalled ribosomes upon translational arrest during different forms of cellular stress (9Ng S.K. Weissbach R. Ronson G.E. Scadden A.D.

The same work showed that nucleic acid binding is a requirement for this localization and that a Zα domain fusion can target other proteins to arsenite-induced SGs. These findings suggest that Zα domains can also bind endogenous nucleic acid and that viral infection is not the only condition under which they are functional. Genomes of several bony fish species (Cyprinoformes and Salmoniformes such as Danio rerio, Cyprinus carpio, Carassius auratus, and Salmo salar) encode a paralogue of the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR named PKZ (11Rothenburg S.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1602-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PKR is a well studied cytoplasmic sensor of dsRNA that, upon recognition of dsRNA by its dsRNA-binding domains, is activated by autophosphorylation (12Cole J.L. Activation of PKR: an open and shut case?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 57-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The activated PKR then phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, leading to a shutdown of protein translation. PKZ, which instead of dsRNA-binding domains has two Zα domains (11Rothenburg S. Deigendesch N. Dittmar K. Koch-Nolte F. Haag F. Lowenhaupt K. Rich A.

Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3; species Cyprinid herpesvirus 3, genus Cyprinivirus, family Alloherpesviridae, order Herpesvirales) is an emerging fish pathogen that has a major negative impact in common and koi carp populations both in the wild and in aquaculture (15Rakus K.

Recently, we demonstrated that CyHV-3 ORF112 encodes a Zα-like domain (17Tomé A.R. Kuś K. Correia S. Paulo L.M. Zacarias S. de Rosa M. Figueiredo D. Parkhouse R.M. Athanasiadis A.

Virol. 2013; 87: 3998-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), leading us to hypothesize that this protein could represent an inhibitor of PKZ. This parallels poxviruses that use E3L, another Zα-containing protein, to block PKR and other elements of the interferon response (18Haig D.M. McInnes C.J. Thomson J. Wood A. Bunyan K. Mercer A.

Recombinant vaccinia virus with deleted the E3L-Zα domain was shown to lose pathogenicity in mice (19Kim Y.G. Muralinath M. Brandt T. Pearcy M. Hauns K. Lowenhaupt K. Jacobs B.L. Rich A.

Jacobs B.L. The amino terminus of the vaccinia virus E3 protein is necessary to inhibit the interferon response.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 5895-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the structure of the apo-protein of CyHV-3 ORF112 adopts the Zα fold, whereas our in vitro experiments suggested that ORF112 interacts with CpG DNA in the left-handed conformation (17Tomé A.R. Kuś K. Correia S. Paulo L.M. Zacarias S. de Rosa M. Figueiredo D. Parkhouse R.M. Athanasiadis A. Crystal structure of a poxvirus-like zalpha domain from Cyprinid herpesvirus 3.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 3998-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we aimed at understanding the specificity and mechanism of binding of ORF112 by determining the crystal structure of its complex with dsDNA. We find that ORF112-Zα forms dimeric structures on DNA that have a role in stabilizing the protein·DNA complex and shows interactions that extend beyond the minimal (CG)3 binding site. Furthermore, we use this structural information to understand its relationship with PKZ and the poxvirus inhibitor of interferon response, E3L. Finally, we show evidence that ORF112 localizes in stress granules, cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins involved in antiviral responses, as do Zα domains of ADAR1 and DAI (9Ng S.K. Weissbach R. Ronson G.E. Scadden A.D. Proteins that contain a functional Z-DNA-binding domain localize to cytoplasmic stress granules.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 9786-9799Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Zα domain of ORF112 (BAF48926.1 residues 187–278) was cloned in a pET28a vector with NheI/XhoI restriction enzymes as a His tag N-terminal fusion protein. The construct was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cell cultures with 0.6–0.9 OD were induced with 0.7 mm IPTG. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g) at 4 °C. Chemical cell lysis was performed with Bugbuster (Novagen) in the presence of 1 mm PMSF, mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche), and Benzonase (Novagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein extract was loaded on a HiTrap IMAC-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare). The column was then washed with 30 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted using a gradient of 30–250 mm imidazole. The His tag was cleaved with 10 units of thrombin during an overnight dialysis at 4 °C against MonoS buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 20 mm NaCl) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. The cleaved protein was loaded on a Mono S 4.6/100 PE (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with a gradient of 20–120 mm NaCl. The protein was then eluted with 120–500 mm NaCl gradient, and the fraction content was evaluated by gel electrophoresis. Buffer exchange and concentration was performed with Amicon-Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore). Finally, the protein was concentrated at 35 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl and used in crystallization trials. A T(CG)9 DNA oligonucleotide was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and dissolved in MilliQ water. The oligonucleotides were annealed overnight in a PCR machine using a temperature gradient from 80 °C to room temperature, decreasing 1 °C every 12 min. Protein and oligonucleotide concentration estimations were based on absorbance measurements using a NanoDrop device. For crystallization a complex mix of ORF112-Zα (1.2 mm) with T(CG)9 (0.3 mm) was screened against solutions of three-dimensional structure screen (Molecular Dimensions). Initial small hexagonal crystals were obtained in 1.05 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. The crystals were optimized, and the best quality ones were obtained in 0.9 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.6. Such crystals were harvested and cryoprotected either in 20% glycerol, 20% PEG200, or Paratone-N and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data of crystals frozen in liquid nitrogen were collected at Beamline ID29 of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility/Grenoble synchrotron at 100 K using 0.976 Å x-ray wavelength. The best quality data were obtained from crystals cryoprotected in 20% PEG200. The XDS package was used to process the data (21Kabsch W. XDS. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11225) Google Scholar). The complex crystallized in the P3221 space group with unit cell dimensions and angles a = 44.82 Å, b = 44.82 Å, c = 140.08 Å, α = β = 90.00°, γ = 120.00°. Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using a composite model of a truncated chain (48 residues of 69) of Zα ORF112 (PDB code 4HOB) with 5 bases of a Z-DNA strand from the ADAR1-Zα DNA complex (PDB code 1QBJ). The composite model was constructed after superposition of the two structures in PyMOL. Our starting model was then refined in Phenix (22Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W.

The final model has phi-psi angles for all protein residues within the favored region of the Ramachandran plot. The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two Zα domains and two Z-DNA chains of 6 bases (one third of the T(CG)9). The electron density for the DNA shows continuity between asymmetric units and neighboring unit cells forming infinite helixes spanning the crystal lattice in three directions. The overhanging T is disordered and not visible in the electron density. A form of crystal disorder in which the missing terminal phosphates of the DNA backbone in the continuous helices are not aligned among them explains the disappearance of the DNA ends and leads to an apparent asymmetric unit that contains only a third of the physical DNA molecule. Similar cases have been observed in crystal structures of Z-DNA when the helical axis coincides with a crystallographic axis (7de Rosa M. Zacarias S. Athanasiadis A.

In the final model, the density of two solvent exposed residues (Lys-233A and Gln-270A) was very weak, and thus these side chains were not modeled. In addition the N-terminal 36 residues (6 originating from the expression vector), as well as the last C-terminal residue, are not seen in the electron density and thus are not modeled. Arg-258B also did not show strong density but guided by the interaction of the same residue in chain A, we were able to model this residue in two alternative conformational states. The final model contains 120 waters as well as 4 sulfate ions bound to the highly charged ORF112 surfaces. Details about data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.

To induce stress granule formation, CCB cells were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in media supplemented with 1 mm sodium arsenite (Sigma) and then were washed twice with complete medium and allowed to recover for 15 min before further processing. Purification of CyHV-3 virions (American strain: accession code ABG42939.1) and mass spectrometry analyses by two-dimensional LC MS/MS were performed as described previously (33Michel B. Leroy B.

After washing with PBS, samples were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 at 20 °C for 10 min. Immunofluorescent staining (incubation and washes) was performed in PBS containing 10% FCS (v/v). CCB cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with mouse polyclonal sera raised against CyHV-3 ORF112 protein and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against CyHV-3 purified virions or rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against HuR/ELAVL1 protein (Proteintech). After three washes, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies) and with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies) as the secondary antibodies.

Oligonucleotides T(CG)3 and T(CG)6 were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and annealed. Protein and DNA storage solutions were exchanged against 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl with Amicon ultracentrifugal filters (Merck Millipore). Briefly, experiments consisted of 18 injections of 2 μl of protein to oligonucleotide (concentrations used were optimized for optimal curve fit and are indicated in the corresponding figure legends). After each injection, the system was allowed to equilibrate for 3 min. Raw data were integrated using NITPIC software (35Keller S. Vargas C. Zhao H. Piszczek G. Brautigam C.A. Schuck P.

For ORF112-Zα, we performed several trials with different oligonucleotide lengths and were able to obtain co-crystals with a T(CG)9 dsDNA (attempts to crystallize CyHV-3 ORF112-Zα with smaller DNA fragments proved unsuccessful). The crystals of the complex belong to P3221 space group. We determined the structure of the complex at 1.5 Å using molecular replacement. The asymmetric unit consists of two Zα monomers and two strands of 6-bp DNA with the DNA forming apparent pseudocontinuous helices along the crystal lattice. Thus, we chose the bases in the asymmetric unit in a way that captures the maximal number of interactions without the need to apply crystal symmetry operators (Fig. 1a). Symmetry operations can then recreate the pseudocontinuous helix, which is spanning the entire crystal. Structural alignment shows that the two monomers in the asymmetric unit are very similar (0.257 Å RMSD). In agreement with our findings from the structure of the apo-protein (17Tomé A.R. Kuś K. Correia S. Paulo L.M. Zacarias S. de Rosa M. Figueiredo D. Parkhouse R.M. Athanasiadis A. Crystal structure of a poxvirus-like zalpha domain from Cyprinid herpesvirus 3.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 3998-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the ORF112-Zα represents a typical winged helix-turn-helix domain fold. The free and DNA-bound forms are very similar (0.253–0.361 Å RMSD depending on the monomer choice). Structural alignment with other members of the Zα family, despite low sequence identity, reveals extensive structural conservation, with the most prominent differences found in the wing region (Fig. 1b). The arrangement of ORF112-Zα domains along the DNA helix was defined by taking as reference the critical and conserved CH-π interaction between Tyr-257 and guanosine 4 (G4) in syn conformation. ORF112-Zα binding sites are separated by 6 bp on the same strand. Binding to the other strand is shifted by 3 bases (Fig. 1, c–e). This arrangement was previously observed only in the tetragonal crystal form of PKZ-Zα with T(CG)6 (7de Rosa M. Zacarias S. Athanasiadis A.

We identified proteasome inhibitors as the first type of drugs that target FOXM1 in cancer cells. Here we found that HSP90 inhibitor PF-4942847 and heat shock also suppress FOXM1. The common effector, which was induced after treatment with proteasome and HSP90 inhibitors or heat shock, was the molecular chaperone HSP70. We show that HSP70 binds to FOXM1 following proteotoxic stress and that HSP70 inhibits FOXM1 DNA-binding ability. Inhibition of FOXM1 transcriptional autoregulation by HSP70 leads to the suppression of FOXM1 protein expression. In addition, HSP70 suppression elevates FOXM1 expression, and simultaneous inhibition of FOXM1 and HSP70 increases the sensitivity of human cancer cells to anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Overall, we determined the unique and novel mechanism of FOXM1 suppression by proteasome inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2287198749,"Mammary carcinoma cells produce pro-angiogenic factors to stimulate angiogenesis and tumor growth. Trefoil factor-3 (TFF3) is an oncogene secreted from mammary carcinoma cells and associated with poor prognosis. Herein, we demonstrate that TFF3 produced in mammary carcinoma cells functions as a promoter of tumor angiogenesis. Forced expression of TFF3 in mammary carcinoma cells promoted proliferation, survival, invasion and in vitro tubule formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). MCF7-TFF3 cells with forced expression of TFF3 generated tumors with enhanced microvessel density as compared to tumors formed by vector control cells. Depletion of TFF3 in mammary carcinoma cells by siRNA concordantly decreased the angiogenic behavior of HUVEC. Forced expression of TFF3 in mammary carcinoma cells stimulated IL-8 transcription and subsequently enhanced IL-8 expression in both mammary carcinoma cells and HUVEC. Depletion of IL-8 in mammary carcinoma cells with forced expression of TFF3, or antibody inhibition of IL-8, partially abrogated mammary carcinoma cell TFF3-stimulated HUVEC angiogenic behavior in vitro, as did inhibition of the IL-8 receptor, CXCR2. Depletion of STAT3 by siRNA in MCF-7 cells with forced expression of TFF3 partially diminished the angiogenic capability of TFF3 on stimulation of cellular processes of HUVEC. Exogenous recombinant hTFF3 also directly promoted the angiogenic behavior of HUVEC. Hence, TFF3 is a potent angiogenic factor and functions as a promoter of de novo angiogenesis in mammary carcinoma, which may co-coordinate with the growth promoting and metastatic actions of TFF3 in mammary carcinoma to enhance tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2149860136,"Communicative interactions involve a kind of procedural knowledge that is used by the human brain for processing verbal and nonverbal inputs and for language production. Although considerable work has been done on modeling human language abilities, it has been difficult to bring them together to a comprehensive tabula rasa system compatible with current knowledge of how verbal information is processed in the brain. This work presents a cognitive system, entirely based on a large-scale neural architecture, which was developed to shed light on the procedural knowledge involved in language elaboration. The main component of this system is the central executive, which is a supervising system that coordinates the other components of the working memory. In our model, the central executive is a neural network that takes as input the neural activation states of the short-term memory and yields as output mental actions, which control the flow of information among the working memory components through neural gating mechanisms. The proposed system is capable of learning to communicate through natural language starting from tabula rasa, without any a priori knowledge of the structure of phrases, meaning of words, role of the different classes of words, only by interacting with a human through a text-based interface, using an open-ended incremental learning process. It is able to learn nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns and other word classes, and to use them in expressive language. The model was validated on a corpus of 1587 input sentences, based on literature on early language assessment, at the level of about 4-years old child, and produced 521 output sentences, expressing a broad range of language processing functionalities."
https://openalex.org/W2178536646,"The Roseobacter clade is a key group of bacteria in the ocean exhibiting diverse metabolic repertoires and a wide range of symbiotic life-styles. Many Roseobacters possess remarkable capabilities of attachment to both biotic and abiotic surfaces. When attached to each other, these bacteria form multi-cellular structures called rosettes. Phaeobacter inhibens, a well-studied Roseobacter, exhibits various cell sizes and morphologies that are either associated with rosettes or occur as single cells. Here we describe the distribution of P. inhibens morphologies and rosettes within a population. We detect an N-acetylglucosamine-containing polysaccharide on the poles of some cells and at the center of all rosettes. We demonstrate that rosettes are formed by the attachment of individual cells at the polysaccharide-containing pole rather than by cell division. Finally, we show that P. inhibens attachment to abiotic surfaces is hindered by the presence of DNA from itself, but not from other bacteria. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that cell adhesiveness is likely to play a significant role in the life cycle of P. inhibens as well as other Roseobacters."
https://openalex.org/W2255430161,"Myoglobin (MB) is not only strongly expressed in myocytes, but also at much lower levels in different cancer entities. 40% of breast tumors are MB-positive, with the globin being co-expressed with markers of tumor hypoxia in a proportion of cases. In breast cancer, MB expression is associated with a positive hormone receptor status and patient prognosis. In prostate cancer, another hormone-dependent cancer type, 53% of tumors were recently shown to express MB. Especially in more aggressive prostate cancer specimen MB expression also correlates with increased patient survival rates. Both findings might be due to tumor-suppressing properties of MB in cancer cells. In contrast to muscle, MB transcription in breast and prostate cancer mainly depends on a novel, alternative promoter site. We show here that its associated transcripts can be upregulated by hypoxia and downregulated by estrogens and androgens in MCF7 breast and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, respectively. Bioinformatic data mining of epigenetic histone marks and experimental verification reveal a hitherto uncharacterized transcriptional network that drives the regulation of the MB gene in cancer cells. We identified candidate hormone-receptor binding elements that may interact with the cancer-associated MB promoter to decrease its activity in breast and prostate cancer cells. Additionally, a regulatory element, 250 kb downstream of the promoter, acts as a hypoxia-inducible site within the transcriptional machinery. Understanding the distinct regulation of MB in tumors will improve unraveling the respiratory protein's function in the cancer context and may provide new starting points for developing therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2253044253,"Cohesive sediment deposits in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China, were used to investigate physical and geochemical properties, biofilm mass, and erosion and deposition characteristics. Biofilm cultivation was performed in a recirculating flume for three different periods (5, 10 and 15 days) under ambient temperature and with sufficient nutrients supply. Three groups of size-fractionated sediment were sequentially used, including 0–0.02 mm, 0.02–0.05 mm and 0.05–0.10 mm. Desired conditions for erosion and deposition were designed by managing high bed shear stress at the narrow part of upstream flume and low shear stress at the wide part of downstream flume. Biostabilization and transport characteristics of the biofilm coated sediment (bio-sediment) were strongly influenced by the cultivation period, and the results were compared with clean sediment. The bio-sediment was more resistant to erosion, and the mean shear stress was increased by factors of 2.65, 2.73 and 5.01 for sediment with 5, 10 and 15 days of biofilm growth compared with clean sediment, resulting in less sediment being eroded from the bed. Simultaneously, the settling velocity was smaller for bio-sediment due to higher organic content and porosity (i.e., lower density). Additionally, there was a smaller probability of deposition for sediment with a longer cultivation period after erosion, resulting in more retention time in aquatic systems. These results will benefit water management in natural rivers."

https://openalex.org/W2176909373,"Insects' fat bodies are responsible for nutrient storage and for a significant part of intermediary metabolism. Thus, it can be expected that the structure and content of the fat body will adaptively change, if an insect is going through different life stages. Bumblebee queens belong to such insects as they dramatically change their physiology several times over their lives in relation to their solitary overwintering, independent colony foundation stage, and during the colony life-cycle ending in the senescent stage. Here, we report on changes in the ultrastructure and lipid composition of the peripheral fat body of Bombus terrestris queens in relation to seasonal changes in the queens' activity. Six life stages are defined and evaluated in particular: pharate, callow, before and after hibernation, egg-laying, and senescence. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the fat body contained two main cell types-adipocytes and oenocytes. Only adipocytes reveal important changes related to the life phase, and mostly the ration between inclusion and cytoplasm volume varies among particular stages. Both electron microscopy and chemical analyses of lipids highlighted seasonal variability in the quantity of the stored lipids, which peaked prior to hibernation. Triacylglycerols appeared to be the main energy source during hibernation, while the amount of glycogen before and after hibernation remained unchanged. In addition, we observed that the representation of some fatty acids within the triacylglycerols change during the queen's life. Last but not least, we show that fat body cell membranes do not undergo substantial changes concerning phospholipid composition in relation to overwintering. This finding supports the hypothesis that the cold-adaptation strategy of bumblebee queens is more likely to be based on polyol accumulation than on the restructuring of lipid membranes."

The specimen has been reported in literature as one of the very few cases of gastric ejecta containing pterosaur bones since then. However, the detailed analysis of the bones preserved in the pellet, their study by X-ray microCT, and the comparison with those of basal pterosaurs do not support a referral to the Pterosauria. Comparison with the osteology of a large sample of Middle-Late Triassic reptiles shows some affinity with the protorosaurians, mainly with Langobardisaurus pandolfii that was found in the same formation as the pellet. However, differences with this species suggest that the bones belong to a similar but distinct taxon. The interpretation as a gastric pellet is confirmed."

The interactions between PS1 and other subunits have also been evaluated. Aph-1, Pen2, and NCT, which contain seven, three, and one transmembrane domains, respectively, interact with PS1. Pen2 associates directly with the WNF motif within the TMD4 of PS1 (22Kim S.H. Sisodia S.S.

It is difficult to study the catalytic mechanism or interaction between subunits in γ-secretase, which is a transmembrane protease with multiple subunits. However, the assay system could be constructed in the yeast cell, which does not have functional γ-secretase homologue or APP. Through a yeast transcriptional activator Gal4 system using an artificial substrate containing APP segments, Edbauer et al. (7Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Reconstitution of γ-secretase activity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the four subunits of γ-secretase are essential for its protease activity. We also established a system to evaluate the specificity of γ-secretase and to screen mutations (30Futai E. Yagishita S. Ishiura S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 13013-13022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We also observed a difference between PS1 and PS2 activities (32Yonemura Y. Futai E. Yagishita S. Suo S. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Ishiura S. Comparison of presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 γ-secretase activities using a yeast reconstitution system.J. Biol.

Futai E. Ishiura S. In vitro reconstitution of γ-secretase activity using yeast microsomes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, yeast cells are a useful model system to analyze γ-secretase. In this study, the properties of PS1 FAD mutations were analyzed using the yeast system. When FAD mutations, L166P or G384A (Leu-166 to Pro or Gly-384 to Ala, respectively), were introduced into PS1, yeast cells could not grow by lack of APP cleavage. We identified amino acid substitutions in PS1 that suppress the original mutations. Critical secondary mutations were in a catalytic pore as follows: K380E, S384P, or L432M. Using PS1/PS2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (33Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Total inactivation of γ-secretase activity in presenilin-deficient embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), we could show that the secondary mutations increased the level of Aβ and the intracellular domain but decreased Aβ42. Furthermore, we studied individual secondary mutations, and we discuss their modulatory effects. To reconstitute γ-secretasein yeast, human PS1, NCT, FLAG-Pen2, Aph-1aL-HA, APP fragment (C55), Notch-1 fragment (NotchTM), and Gal4 were cloned into respective vectors, as described previously (30Futai E.

Chem. 2009; 284: 13013-13022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, PS1 and NCT were cloned into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pBEVY-T (34Miller 3rd, C.A. Martinat M.A. Hyman L.E.

APPC55-Gal4p and NotchTM-Gal4p were fused to the SUC2 signal peptide sequence and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of p426ADH (35Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Yeast vectors for the controlled expression of heterologous proteins in different genetic backgrounds.Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). APPC55 and NotchTM represent amino acids 672–726 of human APP770 and 1703–1754 of mouse Notch-1, respectively. These recombinant plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ-69–4A (MATa trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ) (36James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for high efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter gene expression was monitored to assess substrate cleavage. The expression of HIS3 (His) and ADE2 (Ade) was estimated by colony growth on minimal SD agar medium, lacking Leu, Trp, His, Ura, and SD-LWHUAde (30Futai E. Yagishita S. Ishiura S.

Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and β-galactosidase activities and protein concentrations (Bradford protein assay, Bio-Rad) were estimated in the resulting supernatants. Random mutations were introduced into PS1 FAD mutants, L166P and G384A, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as described previously (30Futai E. Yagishita S. Ishiura S.

PCRs were performed under the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min; 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 120 s (30 cycles); and 72 °C for 10 min. The error ratio of these conditions was ∼2.6 mutations per PS1 gene. Mutagenized PS1 cDNA fragments (4 μg) were then cotransformed with 4 μg of the KpnI fragment from NCTpBEVY-T into PJ69-4A. PS1 primers containing 40-bp regions from pBEVY-T (34Miller 3rd, C.A. Martinat M.A. Hyman L.E.

This study focuses on the loss, especially in risk estimation performance, that can be inflicted by direct transformation from the paper to online versions of risk estimation calculators by ignoring the possibilities of more complex and accurate calculations that can be performed using the online calculators. We empirically compare the risk estimation performance between four major diabetes risk calculators and two, more advanced, predictive models. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999-2012 was used to evaluate the performance of detecting diabetes and pre-diabetes. American Diabetes Association risk test achieved the best predictive performance in category of classical paper-and-pencil based tests with an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.699 for undiagnosed diabetes (0.662 for pre-diabetes) and 47% (47% for pre-diabetes) persons selected for screening. Our results demonstrate a significant difference in performance with additional benefits for a lower number of persons selected for screening when statistical methods are used. The best AUC overall was obtained in diabetes risk prediction using logistic regression with AUC of 0.775 (0.734) and an average 34% (48%) persons selected for screening. However, generalized boosted regression models might be a better option from the economical point of view as the number of selected persons for screening of 30% (47%) lies significantly lower for diabetes risk assessment in comparison to logistic regression (p < 0.001), with a significantly higher AUC (p < 0.001) of 0.774 (0.740) for the pre-diabetes group. Our results demonstrate a serious lack of predictive performance in four major online diabetes risk calculators. Therefore, one should take great care and consider optimizing the online versions of questionnaires that were primarily developed as classical paper questionnaires."

We found a new type of papillomavirus, with a L1 region 82% identical to that of the known R. norvegicus Papillomavirus 2. Additionally, we found 20 different circular replication associated protein (Rep)-encoding single stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) virus-like genomes, one of which has homology to the replication-associated gene of Beak and feather disease virus. Papillomaviruses are a group of viruses known for their carcinogenic potential, and although they are known to infect several different vertebrates, they are mainly studied and characterised in humans. CRESS-DNA viruses are found in many different environments and tissue types. Both papillomaviruses and CRESS-DNA viruses are known to have pathogenic potential and screening for novel and known viruses in R. norvegicus could help identify viruses with pathogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2210910575,"The secretion of IL-1β is a central event in the initiation of inflammation. Unlike most other cytokines, the secretion of IL-1β requires two signals: one signal to induce the intracellular up-regulation of pro-IL-1β and a second signal to drive secretion of the bioactive molecule. The release of pro-IL-1β is a complex process involving proteolytic cleavage by caspase-1. However, the exact mechanism of secretion is poorly understood. Here we sought to identify novel proteins involved in IL-1β secretion and intracellular processing to gain further insights into the mechanism of IL-1 release. A human proteome microarray containing 19,951 unique proteins was used to identify proteins that bind human recombinant pro-IL-1β. Probes with a signal-to-noise ratio of >3 were defined as biologically relevant. In these analyses, calmodulin was identified as a particularly strong hit, with a signal-to-noise ratio of ∼11. Using an ELISA-based protein-binding assay, the interaction of recombinant calmodulin with pro-IL-1β, but not mature IL-1β, was confirmed and shown to be calcium-dependent. Finally, using small molecule inhibitors, it was demonstrated that both calcium and calmodulin were required for nigericin-induced IL-1β secretion in THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes. Together, these data suggest that, following calcium influx into the cell, pro-IL-1β interacts with calmodulin and that this interaction is important for IL-1β processing and release.

It has been an open question how similar human and canine lung cancers are. This has major implications in availability of human treatments for dogs and in establishing translational models to test new therapies in pet dogs. The prognosis for canine advanced lung cancer is poor and new treatments are needed. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an ATPase-dependent molecular chaperone ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells. HSP90 is essential for posttranslational conformational maturation and stability of client proteins including protein kinases and transcription factors, many of which are important for the proliferation and survival of cancer cells. We investigated the activity of STA-1474, a HSP90 inhibitor, in two canine lung cancer cell lines, BACA and CLAC."
https://openalex.org/W2138666113,"The explosive outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa in 2014 appeared to have lessened in 2015, but potentially continues be a global public health threat. A simple mathematical model, the Richards model, is utilized to gauge the temporal variability in the spread of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa in terms of its reproduction number R and its temporal changes via detection of epidemic waves and turning points during the 2014 outbreaks in the three most severely affected countries; namely, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The results reveal multiple waves of infection in each of these three countries, of varying lengths from a little more than one week to more than one month. All three countries exhibit marginally fluctuating reproduction numbers during June-October before gradually declining. Although high mobility continues between neighboring populations of these countries across the borders, outbreak in these three countries exhibits decidedly different temporal patterns. Guinea had the most waves but maintained consistently low transmissibility and hence has the smallest number of reported cases. Liberia had highest level of transmission before October, but has remained low since, with no detectable wave after the New Year. Sierra Leone has gradually declining waves since October, but still generated detectable waves up to mid-March 2015, and hence has cumulated the largest number of cases-exceeding that of Guinea and Liberia combined. Analysis indicates that, despite massive amount of international relief and intervention efforts, the outbreak is persisting in these regions in waves, albeit more sparsely and at a much lower level since the beginning of 2015."
https://openalex.org/W2273684460,"We earlier demonstrated the immunoprophylactic efficacy of recombinant heavy chain myosin (Bm-Myo) of Brugia malayi (B. malayi) in rodent models. In the current study, further attempts have been made to improve this efficacy by employing alternate approaches such as homologous DNA (pcD-Myo) and heterologous DNA/protein prime boost (pcD-Myo+Bm-Myo) in BALB/c mouse model. The gene bm-myo was cloned in a mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1(+) and protein expression was confirmed in mammalian Vero cell line. A significant degree of protection (79.2%±2.32) against L3 challenge in pcD-Myo+Bm-Myo immunized group was observed which was much higher than that exerted by Bm-Myo (66.6%±2.23) and pcD-Myo (41.6%±2.45). In the heterologous immunized group, the percentage of peritoneal leukocytes such as macrophages, neutrophils, B cells and T cells marginally increased and their population augmented further significantly following L3 challenge. pcD-Myo+Bm-Myo immunization elicited robust cellular and humoral immune responses as compared to pcD-Myo and Bm-Myo groups as evidenced by an increased accumulation of CD4+, CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells in the mouse spleen and activation of peritoneal macrophages. Though immunized animals produced antigen-specific IgG antibodies and isotypes, sera of mice receiving pcD-Myo+Bm-Myo or Bm-Myo developed much higher antibody levels than other groups and there was profound antibody-dependent cellular adhesion and cytotoxicity (ADCC) to B. malayi infective larvae (L3). pcD-Myo+Bm-Myo as well as Bm-Myo mice generated a mixed T helper cell phenotype as evidenced by the production of both pro-inflammatory (IL-2, IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines. Mice receiving pcD-Myo on contrary displayed a polarized pro-inflammatory immune response. The findings suggest that the priming of animals with DNA followed by protein booster generates heightened and mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses that are capable of providing high degree of protection against filarial larval invasion."

https://openalex.org/W2222028252,"How can we enhance the understanding of abstract mathematical principles in elementary school? Different studies found out that nonsymbolic estimation could foster subsequent exact number processing and simple arithmetic. Taking the commutativity principle as a test case, we investigated if the approximate calculation of symbolic commutative quantities can also alter the access to procedural and conceptual knowledge of a more abstract arithmetic principle. Experiment 1 tested first graders who had not been instructed about commutativity in school yet. Approximate calculation with symbolic quantities positively influenced the use of commutativity-based shortcuts in formal arithmetic. We replicated this finding with older first graders (Experiment 2) and third graders (Experiment 3). Despite the positive effect of approximation on the spontaneous application of commutativity-based shortcuts in arithmetic problems, we found no comparable impact on the application of conceptual knowledge of the commutativity principle. Overall, our results show that the usage of a specific arithmetic principle can benefit from approximation. However, the findings also suggest that the correct use of certain procedures does not always imply conceptual understanding. Rather, the conceptual understanding of commutativity seems to lag behind procedural proficiency during elementary school."
https://openalex.org/W2224459849,"To explore the views of Malaysian healthcare professionals (HCPs) on stakeholders' decision making roles in localized prostate cancer (PCa) treatment.Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with HCPs treating PCa. Data was analysed using a thematic approach. Four in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted between December 2012 and March 2013 using a topic guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically.The participants comprised private urologists (n = 4), government urologists (n = 6), urology trainees (n = 6), government policy maker (n = 1) and oncologists (n = 3). HCP perceptions of the roles of the three parties involved (HCPs, patients, family) included: HCP as the main decision maker, HCP as a guide to patients' decision making, HCP as a facilitator to family involvement, patients as main decision maker and patient prefers HCP to decide. HCPs preferred to share the decision with patients due to equipoise between prostate treatment options. Family culture was important as family members often decided on the patient's treatment due to Malaysia's close-knit family culture.A range of decision making roles were reported by HCPs. It is thus important that stakeholder roles are clarified during PCa treatment decisions. HCPs need to cultivate an awareness of sociocultural norms and family dynamics when supporting non-Western patients in making decisions about PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2231266532,"Acoustic communication is essential for the reproductive success of the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus). During the breeding season, type I males use acoustic cues to advertise nest location to potential mates, creating an audible signal that attracts reproductive females. Type II (sneaker) males also likely use this social acoustic signal to find breeding pairs from which to steal fertilizations. Estrogen-induced changes in the auditory system of breeding females are thought to enhance neural encoding of the advertisement call, and recent anatomical data suggest the saccule (the main auditory end organ) as one possible target for this seasonal modulation. Here we describe saccular transcriptomes from all three sexual phenotypes (females, type I and II males) collected during the breeding season as a first step in understanding the mechanisms underlying sexual phenotype-specific and seasonal differences in auditory function. We used RNA-Seq on the Ion Torrent platform to create a combined transcriptome dataset containing over 79,000 assembled transcripts representing almost 9,000 unique annotated genes. These identified genes include several with known inner ear function and multiple steroid hormone receptors. Transcripts most closely matched to published genomes of nile tilapia and large yellow croaker, inconsistent with the phylogenetic relationship between these species but consistent with the importance of acoustic communication in their life-history strategies. We then compared the RNA-Seq results from the saccules of reproductive females with a separate transcriptome from the non-reproductive female phenotype and found over 700 differentially expressed transcripts, including members of the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways that mediate cell proliferation and hair cell addition in the inner ear. These data constitute a valuable resource for furthering our understanding of the molecular basis for peripheral auditory function as well as a range of future midshipman and cross-species comparative studies of the auditory periphery."
https://openalex.org/W2257357572,"Heavy seismic damage tends to occur in slopes when groundwater is present. The main objectives of this paper are to determine the dynamic response and failure mode of sandy slope subjected simultaneously to seismic forces and variable groundwater conditions. This paper applies the finite element method, which is a fast and efficient design tool in modern engineering analysis, to evaluate dynamic response of the slope subjected simultaneously to seismic forces and variable groundwater conditions. Shaking table test is conducted to analyze the failure mode and verify the accuracy of the finite element method results. The research results show that dynamic response values of the slope have different variation rules under near and far field earthquakes. And the damage location and pattern of the slope are different in varying groundwater conditions. The destruction starts at the top of the slope when the slope is in no groundwater, which shows that the slope appears obvious whipping effect under the earthquake. The destruction starts at the toe of the slope when the slope is in the high groundwater levels. Meanwhile, the top of the slope shows obvious seismic subsidence phenomenon after earthquake. Furthermore, the existence of the groundwater has a certain effect of damping."
