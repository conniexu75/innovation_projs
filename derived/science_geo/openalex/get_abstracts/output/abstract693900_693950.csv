https://openalex.org/W4280522191,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex inflammatory disease involving genetic influences across cell types. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 200 loci associated with CAD, where the majority of risk variants reside in noncoding DNA sequences impacting cis-regulatory elements. Here, we applied single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing to profile 28,316 nuclei across coronary artery segments from 41 patients with varying stages of CAD, which revealed 14 distinct cellular clusters. We mapped ~320,000 accessible sites across all cells, identified cell-type-specific elements and transcription factors, and prioritized functional CAD risk variants. We identified elements in smooth muscle cell transition states (for example, fibromyocytes) and functional variants predicted to alter smooth muscle cell- and macrophage-specific regulation of MRAS (3q22) and LIPA (10q23), respectively. We further nominated key driver transcription factors such as PRDM16 and TBX2. Together, this single-nucleus atlas provides a critical step towards interpreting regulatory mechanisms across the continuum of CAD risk."
https://openalex.org/W4280590543,"Intracellular organelles change their size during trafficking and maturation. This requires the transport of ions and water across their membranes. Macropinocytosis, a ubiquitous form of endocytosis of particular importance for immune and cancer cells, generates large vacuoles that can be followed optically. Shrinkage of macrophage macropinosomes depends on TPC-mediated Na+ efflux and Cl- exit through unknown channels. Relieving osmotic pressure facilitates vesicle budding, positioning osmotic shrinkage upstream of vesicular sorting and trafficking. Here we identify the missing macrophage Cl- channel as the proton-activated Cl- channel ASOR/TMEM206. ASOR activation requires Na+-mediated depolarization and luminal acidification by redundant transporters including H+-ATPases and CLC 2Cl-/H+ exchangers. As corroborated by mathematical modelling, feedback loops requiring the steep voltage and pH dependencies of ASOR and CLCs render vacuole resolution resilient towards transporter copy numbers. TMEM206 disruption increased albumin-dependent survival of cancer cells. Our work suggests a function for the voltage and pH dependence of ASOR and CLCs, provides a comprehensive model for ion-transport-dependent vacuole maturation and reveals biological roles of ASOR."
https://openalex.org/W4285743313,"This study aimed to measure the prevalence of burnout syndrome, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic disorders (PTSD), as well as examine their associated factors among Thai healthcare workers (HCWs) during COVID-19 outbreak.We employed a multiple-method design at a tertiary-care hospital in Bangkok between May 22, 2021 and June 30, 2021 by using an online survey. The information included demographic characteristics, work details, perceived support, PTSD symptoms, Maslach Burnout Inventory: General Survey (MBI-GS), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9), and narrative response to an open-ended question. The associated factors of mental health problems were analysed by multiple logistic regression analyses. The qualitative data were analysed by the content analysis method.A total of 986 HCWs (89.1% female; mean age = 34.89 ± 11.05 years) responded to the survey. 16.3%,16%, and 53.5% of respondents had a high level of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and diminished personal achievement, respectively. 33.1%, 13.8%, and 2.3% of respondents had anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Risk factors of emotional exhaustion were male sex (ORadj = 2.29), nurses (ORadj = 3.04), doctors (ORadj = 4.29), working at COVID-19 inpatient unit (ORadj = 2.97), and working at COVID-19 intensive care unit (ORadj = 3.00). Additionally, preexisting mental illness was associated with anxiety (ORadj = 2.89), depression (ORadj = 3.47), and PTSD (ORadj = 4.06). From qualitative analysis, participants reported that these factors would improve their mental health: supportive and respectful colleagues, appropriate financial compensation, reduced workload, clarity of policy and communication channel, and adequate personal protective equipment.Thai HCWs experienced negative mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic substantially. This issue needs attention and actions should be implemented to support them."
https://openalex.org/W4280488795,"Impaired cortical maturation is a postulated mechanism in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. In the sensory cortex, activity relayed by the thalamus during a postnatal sensitive period is essential for proper cortical maturation. Whether thalamic activity also shapes prefrontal cortical maturation is unknown. We show that inhibiting the mediodorsal and midline thalamus in mice during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in thalamo-prefrontal projection density and reduced excitatory drive to prefrontal neurons. It also caused prefrontal-dependent cognitive deficits during adulthood associated with disrupted prefrontal cross-correlations and task outcome encoding. Thalamic inhibition during adulthood had no long-lasting consequences. Exciting the thalamus in adulthood during a cognitive task rescued prefrontal cross-correlations, task outcome encoding and cognitive deficits. These data point to adolescence as a sensitive window of thalamocortical circuit maturation. Furthermore, by supporting prefrontal network activity, boosting thalamic activity provides a potential therapeutic strategy for rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4280654139,"Background The emergence of newer variants with the immune escape potential raises concerns about breakthroughs and re-infections resulting in future waves of infection. We examined the protective effect of prior COVID-19 disease and vaccination on infection rates among a cohort of healthcare workers (HCW) in South India during the second wave driven mainly by the delta variant. Methods and findings Symptomatic HCWs were routinely tested by RT-PCR as per institutional policy. Vaccination was offered to all HCWs in late January, and the details were documented. We set up a non-concurrent cohort to document infection rates and estimated protective efficacy of prior infection and vaccination between 16th Apr to 31st May 2021, using a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates adjusting for daily incidence. Between June 2020 and May 2021, 2735 (23.9%) of 11,405 HCWs were infected, with 1412, including 32 re-infections, reported during the second wave. 6863 HCWs received two doses of vaccine and 1905 one dose. The protective efficacy of prior infection against symptomatic infection was 86.0% (95% CI 76.7%–91.6%). Vaccination combined with prior infection provided 91.1% (95% CI 84.1%–94.9%) efficacy. In the absence of prior infection, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection during the second wave was 31.8% (95% CI 23.5%– 39.1%). Conclusions Prior infection provided substantial protection against symptomatic re-infection and severe disease during a delta variant driven second wave in a cohort of health care workers."
https://openalex.org/W4280624022,"Early public health strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the United States relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as vaccines and therapeutic treatments were not yet available. Implementation of NPIs, primarily social distancing and mask wearing, varied widely between communities within the US due to variable government mandates, as well as differences in attitudes and opinions. To understand the interplay of trust, risk perception, behavioral intention, and disease burden, we developed a survey instrument to study attitudes concerning COVID-19 and pandemic behavioral change in three states: Idaho, Texas, and Vermont. We designed our survey (n = 1034) to detect whether these relationships were significantly different in rural populations. The best fitting structural equation models show that trust indirectly affects protective pandemic behaviors via health and economic risk perception. We explore two different variations of this social cognitive model: the first assumes behavioral intention affects future disease burden while the second assumes that observed disease burden affects behavioral intention. In our models we include several exogenous variables to control for demographic and geographic effects. Notably, political ideology is the only exogenous variable which significantly affects all aspects of the social cognitive model (trust, risk perception, and behavioral intention). While there is a direct negative effect associated with rurality on disease burden, likely due to the protective effect of low population density in the early pandemic waves, we found a marginally significant, positive, indirect effect of rurality on disease burden via decreased trust (p = 0.095). This trust deficit creates additional vulnerabilities to COVID-19 in rural communities which also have reduced healthcare capacity. Increasing trust by methods such as in-group messaging could potentially remove some of the disparities inferred by our models and increase NPI effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W4286840015,"Given the complexity of international construction projects (ICP), risk management difficulties commonly cause cost overruns. This paper analyzes the problems of risk interdependence and subjective ratings in the application of the traditional risk assessment model in ICP. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a risk assessment model for ICP that considers risk interdependence and obtains references from similar projects. The model applies the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to determine the risk interdependence and its contribution to the overall project risk. Moreover, this model recalls the risks, probabilities, impacts, and risk events records of similar historical projects as the necessary inputs, thereby addressing the issue of subjectivity. An integrated framework is provided to identify, analyze, and prioritize ICP risks to incorporate risk interdependence into the risk management process. Finally, this paper demonstrates and validates the proposed model through a real project. The proposed model is useful for international construction companies to support project selection and bidding decisions in the early stage of ICP."
https://openalex.org/W4280524620,"Siphonophores (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) are abundant and diverse gelatinous predators in open-ocean ecosystems. Due to limited access to the midwater, little is known about the diets of most deep-dwelling gelatinous species, which constrains our understanding of food-web structure and nutrient flow in these vast ecosystems. Visual gut-content methods can rarely identify soft-bodied rapidly-digested prey, while observations from submersibles often overlook small prey items. These methods have been differentially applied to shallow and deep siphonophore taxa, confounding habitat and methodological biases. DNA metabarcoding can be used to assess both shallow and deep species’ diets under a common methodological framework, since it can detect both small and gelatinous prey. We (1) further characterized the diets of open-ocean siphonophores using DNA metabarcoding, (2) compared the prey detected by visual and molecular methods to evaluate their technical biases, and (3) evaluated tentacle-based predictions of diet. To do this, we performed DNA metabarcoding analyses on the gut contents of 39 siphonophore species across depths to describe their diets, using six barcode regions along the 18S gene. Taxonomic identifications were assigned using public databases combined with local zooplankton sequences. We identified 55 unique prey items, including crustaceans, gelatinous animals, and fish across 47 siphonophore specimens in 24 species. We reported 29 novel predator-prey interactions, among them the first insights into the diets of nine siphonophore species, many of which were congruent with the dietary predictions based on tentilla morphology. Our analyses detected both small and gelatinous prey taxa underrepresented by visual methods in species from both shallow and deep habitats, indicating that siphonophores play similar trophic roles across depth habitats. We also reveal hidden links between siphonophores and filter-feeders near the base of the food web. This study expands our understanding of the ecological roles of siphonophores in the open ocean, their trophic roles within the ‘jelly-web’, and the importance of their diversity for nutrient flow and ecosystem functioning. Understanding these inconspicuous yet ubiquitous predator-prey interactions is critical to predict the impacts of climate change, overfishing, and conservation policies on oceanic ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W4286836969,"Pacific salmon and trout populations are affected by timber harvest, the removal and alteration of riparian vegetation, and the resulting physical changes to water quality, temperature, and associated delivery of high-quality terrestrial prey. Juvenile salmon and trout growth, a key predictor of survival, is poorly understood in the context of current and future (climate-change mediated) conditions, with resource managers needing information on how land use will impact future river conditions for these commercially and culturally important species. We used the Heat Source water temperature modeling framework to develop a spatiotemporal model to assess how riparian canopy and vegetation preservation and addition could influence river temperatures under future climate predictions in a coastal river fed by a moraine-dammed lake: the Quinault River in Washington State. The model predicted higher water temperatures under future carbon emission projections, representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5, with varying magnitude based on different riparian vegetation scenarios. We used the daily average temperature output from these scenarios to predict potential juvenile fish growth using the Wisconsin bioenergetics model. A combination of riparian vegetation removal and continued high carbon emissions resulted in a predicted seven-day average daily maximum temperature (7DADM) increase of 1.7°C in the lower river by 2080; increases in riparian shading mitigate this 7DADM increase to only 0.9°C. Under the current thermal regime, bioenergetics modeling predicts juvenile fish lose weight in the lower river; this loss of potential growth worsens by an average of 20-83% in the lower river by 2080, increasing with the loss of riparian shading. This study assess the impact of riparian vegetation management on future thermal habitat for Pacific salmon and trout under warming climates and provide a useful spatially explicit modeling framework that managers can use to make decisions regarding riparian vegetation management and its mechanistic impact to water temperature and rearing juvenile fish."

The study used the descriptive approach. A questionnaire consisting of 27 items was distributed to 1986 undergraduate students. The results of the study showed that undergraduate students demonstrated a moderate degree of acceptance of the implementation of e-exams during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, with females students finding them more acceptable than male students. Discipline and academic year also showed an impact on such acceptance, with Pharmacy & Health Science College students, and those in their third academic year demonstrating the highest levels of acceptance. Implications of the study raise awareness of the importance of addressing challenges associated with e-exams such as strict computer technology settings."
https://openalex.org/W4280504880,"After the Tokyo Electric Power Company Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in Japan, freshwater ecosystems near the site remained contaminated by radiocesium (RCs). Clarifying RCs concentrations in aquatic insects is crucial because fishes consume these insects that transfer RCs into freshwater ecosystems. As aquatic insects are usually measured for radioactivity in bulk samples of several tens of insects, variation in RCs concentration among individuals is not captured. In this study, we investigated the variability in 137Cs activity concentration in individual aquatic insects in detritivorous caddisfly (Stenopsyche marmorata) and carnivorous dobsonfly (Protohermes grandis) larvae from the Ota River, Fukushima. Caddisfly larvae showed sporadically higher radioactivity in 4 of the 46 caddisfly larvae, whereas no such outliers were observed in 45 dobsonfly larvae. Autoradiography and scanning electron microscopy analyses confirmed that these caddisfly larvae samples contained radiocesium-bearing microparticles (CsMPs), which are insoluble Cs-bearing silicate glass particles. CsMPs were also found in potential food sources of caddisfly larvae, such as periphyton and drifting particulate organic matter, indicating that larvae may ingest CsMPs along with food particles of similar size. Although CsMP distribution and uptake by organisms in freshwater ecosystems is relatively unknown, our study demonstrates that CsMPs can be taken up by aquatic insects."

This qualitative study elicited views regarding the challenges and opportunities for breast cancer screening and early detection among women in a low-income semi-rural community in Segamat district, Malaysia.Individual semi-structured interviews with 22 people (health professionals, cancer survivors, community volunteers and member from a non-governmental organization) and four focus group discussions (n = 22 participants) with women from a local community were conducted. All participants were purposively sampled and female residents registered with the South East Asia Community Observatory aged ≥40 years were eligible to participate in the focus group discussions. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.The thematic analysis illuminated barriers, challenges and opportunities across six domains: (i) personal experiences and barriers to help-seeking as well as financial and travel access barriers; (ii) primary care challenges (related to delivering clinical breast examination and teaching breast-self-examination); (iii) secondary care challenges (related to mammogram services); (iv) disconnection between secondary and primary care breast cancer screening pathways; and (v) opportunities to improve breast cancer early detection relating to community civil service society activities (i.e. awareness raising, support groups, addressing stigma/embarrassment and encouraging husbands to support women) and vi) links between public healthcare personnel and community (i.e. improving breast self-examination education, clinical breast examination provision and subsidised mammograms).The results point to a variety of reasons for low uptake and, therefore, to the complex nature of improving breast cancer screening and early detection. There is a need to adopt a systems approach to address this complexity and to take account of the socio-cultural context of communities in order, in turn, to strengthen cancer control policy and practices in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W4280561864,"Endothelial cell (EC) aging plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). MicroRNAs have emerged as crucial regulators of target gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation and/or promoting mRNA degradation. We identify an aging-related and oxidative stress-responsive microRNA, miR-181b, that inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis and senescence. In gain- or loss-of-function studies, miR-181b regulated the expression of key apoptosis markers (Bcl2, Bax, cleaved-Caspase3) and senescence markers (p16, p21, γH2AX) and the ratio of apoptotic cells (TUNEL-positive) and senescent cells (SA-βgal-positive) in H2 O2 -induced ECs. Mechanistically, miR-181b targets MAP3K3 and modulates a MAP3K3/MKK/MAPK signaling pathway. MAP3K3 knockdown recapitulated the phenotype of miR-181b overexpression and miR-181b was dependent on MAP3K3 for regulating EC apoptosis and senescence. In vivo, miR-181b expression showed a negative correlation with increasing age in the mouse aorta. Endothelial-specific deficiency of miR-181a2b2 increased the target MAP3K3, markers of vascular senescence (p16, p21), and DNA double-strand breaks (γH2AX) in the aorta of aged mice. Collectively, this study unveils an important role of miR-181b in regulating vascular endothelial aging via an MAP3K3-MAPK signaling pathway, providing new potential therapeutic targets for antiaging therapy in CVD."

https://openalex.org/W4280563852,"This study investigates the important role of attendant factors, such as road traffic victims' access to trauma centres, the robustness of health infrastructure, and the responsiveness of police and emergency services in the incidence of Road Traffic Injuries (RTI) during the pandemic-induced COVID-19 lockdowns. The differential effects of the first and second waves of the pandemic concerning perceived health risk and legal restrictions provide us with a natural experiment that helps us differentiate between the impact of attendant factors and the standard relationship between mobility and Road Traffic Injuries. The authors use the auto-regressive recurrent neural network method on two population levels-Tamil Nadu (TN), a predominantly rural state, and Chennai, the most significant metropolitan city of the state, to draw causal inference through counterfactual predictions on daily counts of road traffic deaths and Road Traffic Injuries. During the first wave of the pandemic, which was less severe than the second wave, the traffic flow was correlated to Road Traffic Death/Road Traffic Injury. In the second wave's partial and post lockdown phases, an unprecedented fall of over 70% in Road Traffic Injury-Grievous as against Road Traffic Injury-Minor was recorded. Attendant factors, such as the ability of the victim to approach relief centres, the capability of health and other allied infrastructures, transportation and medical treatment of road traffic crash victims, and minimal access to other emergency services, including police, assumed greater significance than overall traffic flow in the incidence of Road Traffic Injury in the more severe second wave. These findings highlight the significant role these attendant factors play in producing the discrepancy between the actual road traffic incident rate and the officially registered rate. Thus, our study enables practitioners to observe the mobility-adjusted actual incidence rate devoid of factors related to reporting and registration of accidents."
https://openalex.org/W4280621095,"Betweenness centrality (BC) is widely used to identify critical nodes in a network by exploring the ability of all nodes to act as intermediaries for information exchange. However, one of its assumptions, i.e., the contributions of all shortest paths are equal, is inconsistent with variations in spatial interactions along these paths and has been questioned when applied to spatial networks. Hence, this paper proposes a spatial interaction incorporated betweenness centrality (SIBC) for spatial networks. SIBC weights the shortest path between each node pair according to the intensity of spatial interaction between them, emphasizing the combination of a network structure and spatial interactions. To test the rationality and validity of SIBC in identifying critical nodes and edges, two specific forms of SIBC are applied to the Shenzhen street network and China's intercity network. The results demonstrate that SIBC is more significant than BC when we also focus on the network functionality rather than only on the network structure. Moreover, the good performance of SIBC in robustness analysis illustrates its application value in improving network efficiency. This study highlights the meaning of introducing spatial configuration into empirical models of complex networks."
https://openalex.org/W4285742446,"Introduction Equity in the access and use of health services is critical if countries are to make progress towards universal health coverage and address the systematic exclusion of the most vulnerable groups. The purpose of this study was to assess if the Co-ordinated Approach To Community Health programme implemented by Sightsavers was successful in reaching the poorest population, women, and people living with disabilities in Kasungu district, Malawi. Methods Between April and September 2017, data on socio-economic status, household characteristics and functional disability were collected from patients attending at eye camps in Kasungu district, Malawi. Using asset-based tools to measure household wealth (EquityTool© and Simple Poverty Scorecard©) and the Washington Group Short Set of Questions, individuals were categorised by wealth quintiles, poverty status, and functional disability status and then compared to relevant representative national household surveys. In addition, a follow-up household survey was conducted to check the validity of self-reported household characteristics at eye camps. Results A total of 1,358 individuals participated in the study. The study shows that self-reported data on household characteristics and assets are reliable and can be collected in clinical settings (instead of relying on direct observations of assets). Individuals attending outreach camps were poorer in terms of relative wealth and absolute poverty rates compared to the rest of the population in Kasungu. It was estimated that 9% of the participants belonged to the poorest quintile compared to 4% for the population in Kasungu (DHS 2015–2016). The ultra-poverty rate was also lower among respondents (13%) compared to 15% for Kasungu district (IHS 2017). The functional disability rate was 27.5% for study participants, and statistically higher than the general population (5.6%, SENTIF 2017). Even though women are more at risks than men, 54% of the participants were men. Conclusions Our study shows that existing tools can be reliably used, and combined, if based on recent population data, to assess equity of access to health services for vulnerable groups of the population. The findings suggest that the programme was successful in reaching the poorest people of the Kasungu district population as well as those with disabilities through outreach camps but that more men than women were reach through the programme. Subsequently, our study showed that self-reported household characteristics are a reliable method to measure asset-based wealth of camps’ attendee. However, it is essential to use sub-national data (district or regional level) from recent surveys for the purpose of benchmarking in order to produce accurate results."
https://openalex.org/W4285743239,"Nonhost disease resistance is the most common type of plant defense mechanism against potential pathogens. In the present study, the metabolic enzyme formate dehydrogenase 1 (FDH1) was identified to associate with nonhost disease resistance in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. In Arabidopsis, AtFDH1 was highly upregulated in response to both host and nonhost bacterial pathogens. The Atfdh1 mutants were compromised in nonhost resistance, basal resistance, and gene-for-gene resistance. The expression patterns of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) marker genes after pathogen infections in Atfdh1 mutant indicated that both SA and JA are involved in the FDH1-mediated plant defense response to both host and nonhost bacterial pathogens. Previous studies reported that FDH1 localizes to mitochondria, or both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Our results showed that the AtFDH1 mainly localized to mitochondria, and the expression level of FDH1 was drastically increased upon infection with host or nonhost pathogens. Furthermore, we identified the potential co-localization of mitochondria expressing FDH1 with chloroplasts after the infection with nonhost pathogens in Arabidopsis. This finding suggests the possible role of FDH1 in mitochondria and chloroplasts during defense responses against bacterial pathogens in plants."
https://openalex.org/W4280584598,"While most social network research focuses on positive relational ties, such as friendship and information exchange, scholars are beginning to examine the dark side of human interaction, where negative connections represent different forms of interpersonal conflict, intolerance, and abuse. Despite this recent work, the extent to which positive and negative social network structure differs remains unclear. The current project considers whether a network's small-scale, structural patterns of reciprocity, transitivity, and skew, or its ""structural signature,"" can distinguish positive versus negative links. Using exponential random graph models (ERGMs), we examine these differences across a sample of twenty distinct, negative networks and generate comparisons with a related set of twenty positive graphs. Relational ties represent multiple types of interaction such as like versus dislike in groups of adults, friendship versus cyberaggression among adolescents, and agreements versus disputes in online interaction. We find that both positive and negative networks contain more reciprocated dyads than expected by random chance. At the same time, patterns of transitivity define positive but not negative graphs, and negative networks tend to exhibit heavily skewed degree distributions. Given the unique structural signatures of many negative graphs, our results highlight the need for further theoretical and empirical research on the patterns of harmful interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4280648458,"This study aims to explore the effects of COVID-19 indicators and the oil price crash on the Saudi Exchange (Tadawul) Trading Volume and Tadawul Index (TASI) for the period from January 1, 2020, to December 2, 2020. The independent variable is oil price, and the COVID-19 indicators are lockdown, first and second decreases of Repo and Reverse Repo rates, Saudi government response, and cumulative deceased cases. The study adopts two phases. In the first phase, linear regression is used to identify the most influential variables affecting Trading volume and TASI. According to the results, the trading volume model is significant with an adjusted R2 of 65.5% and a standard error of 81. The findings of this model indicate a positive effect of cumulative deceased cases and first decrease of Repo and Reverse Repo rates and a negative effect of oil prices on Trading Volume. The TASI model is significant with an adjusted R2 of 86% and a standard error of 270. The results of this model indicate that lockdown and first decrease of Repo and Reverse Repo rates have a significant negative effect on TASI while the cumulative decrease in cases and oil prices have a positive effect on TASI. In the second phase, linear regression, and neural network predictors (with and without validation) are applied to predict the future TASI values. The neural network model indicates that the neural networks can achieve the best results if all independent variables are used together. By combining the collected results, the study finds that oil price has the most substantial effect on the changes in TASI as compared to the COVID-19 indicators. The results indicate that TASI rapidly follows the changes in oil prices."

Objectives This study analyzed differential gene expression in surgical specimens diagnosed with multi nodular and compared the data to that of thyroid tissue without multinodular goiter from patients undergoing thyroidectomy in Manaus-AM, Brazil using RNA-seq technology. Methodology The transcriptome information of the surgical specimen fragments with and without multinodular goiter was accessed by Illumina HiSeq 2000 New Generation Sequencing (NGS) using the RNA-seq NEBNext ® Ultra ™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina ® —#E7530L protocol and differential gene expression analysis. Results Differences were found between the gene expression profiles of the diseased tissues and those of the healthy control tissues; at least 70 genes were differentially expressed. The HOTS gene was expressed only in multinodular goiter tissues ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion These results demonstrate that the gene expression profile of multinodular goiter is pro-tumoral and that HOTS can play a central role in multinodular goiter development."

Using these data to inform change could improve the death certification process and reliability of this data."
https://openalex.org/W4286832376,"Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Trivalent arsenic (As3+) is known to cure APL by binding to cysteine residues of PML and enhance the degradation of PML-retinoic acid receptor α (RARα), a t(15;17) gene translocation product in APL cells, and restore PML-nuclear bodies (NBs). The size, number, and shape of PML-NBs vary among cell types and during cell division. However, topological changes of PML-NBs in As3+-exposed cells have not been well-documented. We report that As3+-induced solubility shift underlies rapid SUMOylation of PML and late agglomeration of PML-NBs. Most PML-NBs were toroidal and granular dot-like in GFPPML-transduced CHO-K1 and HEK293 cells, respectively. Exposure to As3+ and antimony (Sb3+) greatly reduced the solubility of PML and enhanced SUMOylation within 2 h in the absence of changes in the number and size of PML-NBs. However, the prolonged exposure to As3+ and Sb3+ resulted in agglomeration of PML-NBs. Exposure to bismuth (Bi3+), another Group 15 element, did not induce any of these changes. ML792, a SUMO activation inhibitor, reduced the number of PML-NBs and increased the size of the NBs, but had little effect on the As3+-induced solubility change of PML. These results warrant the importance of As3+- or Sb3+-induced solubility shift of PML for the regulation intranuclear dynamics of PML-NBs."

However, the association of OSA and hearing impairment is controversial. Our objective was to observe the incidence of hearing loss in middle-aged males with different risks for OSA.794 men aged 40-65 who participated in health examination and pure tone hearing screening between January and June 2021 were recruited in the study. Medical history was collected. Height, weight and blood pressure were tested, and biochemical test including blood lipids and blood glucose was performed. According to the STOP-BANG score, the observed subjects were divided into low, intermediate and high groups for OSA risk. Hearing impairment was defined as failure in responding to any pure tone of 25 dB HL in any ear at the frequencies: 4 kHz for high frequency range and 0.5k, 1k, 2 kHz for low/medium frequency range. The incidence of hearing loss in those groups was compared after adjusting the cardiovascular risk factors.The incidence of hearing impairment in the groups of intermediate, high, and intermediate/high risk for OSA (46.9%, 45.2%, 46.3%, respectively) were higher than that in the group of low risk for OSA (33.3%, P<0.001). After adjusting cardiovascular risk factors, the risk of hearing impairment in the group of high risk for OSA is 1.64 times of the group of low risk for OSA (95%CI: 1.02-2.69, P<0.05). The risk of hearing impairment at high frequency(4kHz) in the group of intermediate/high risk for OSA is 1.43 times of the group of low-risk for OSA (95%CI: 1.00-2.06, P<0.05).The risk of hearing impairment in midlife men with high, intermediate/high risk for OSA is significantly increased, especially at high frequency of 4 kHz."
https://openalex.org/W4280510387,"The remarkable upsurge in the attention for STEM education globally has inspired many countries including Malaysia to formulate STEM education policies to reform the existing segmented teaching of the four STEM subjects towards integrated teaching. One of the Malaysian government’s initiatives include establishing a framework as a guide for teachers to practise STEM teaching. This exploratory, mixed methods study aimed to explore Malaysian science and mathematics teachers’ perceptions to practise STEM teaching and develop a questionnaire to measure factors that explain their teaching practices. The interview findings identified teachers’ knowledge of interdisciplinary and related pedagogical strategies, challenges encountered in STEM teaching practices, and teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs to perform STEM teaching as factors that explain STEM teaching practices. Following that, a 33-item questionnaire was developed based on the qualitative findings. The results of exploratory factor analysis produced four distinct factors echoing the qualitative findings with 29 items, which were then validated using confirmatory composite analysis (CCA). CCA results in retaining all four factors and removing six items with lower loading values. Thus, the final version of the questionnaire consists of 23 items. The findings of this study were expected to benefit STEM advocates and educators globally. Additionally, the developed questionnaire would allow collective measurement of the factors that explain STEM teaching practices."
https://openalex.org/W4280595454,"Invariants for complicated objects such as those arising in phylogenetics, whether they are invariants as matrices, polynomials, or other mathematical structures, are important tools for distinguishing and working with such objects. In this paper, we generalize a complete polynomial invariant on trees to a class of phylogenetic networks called separable networks, which will include orchard networks. Networks are becoming increasingly important for their ability to represent reticulation events, such as hybridization, in evolutionary history. We provide a function from the space of internally multi-labelled phylogenetic networks, a more generic graph structure than phylogenetic networks where the reticulations are also labelled, to a polynomial ring. We prove that the separability condition allows us to characterize, via the polynomial, the phylogenetic networks with the same number of leaves and same number of reticulations by considering their internally labelled versions. While the invariant for trees is a polynomial in [Formula: see text] where n is the number of leaves, the invariant for internally multi-labelled phylogenetic networks is an element of [Formula: see text], where r is the number of reticulations in the network. When the networks are considered without leaf labels the number of variables reduces to r + 2."
https://openalex.org/W4280599974,"The study examined the relationship between ownership structure and financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya for the period 2009-2020. The data were collected from audited financial statements of 39 commercial banks in Kenya. Regression results found strong evidence on ownership structures in explaining the differences in commercial banks' financial performance. The results established that the greatest influence of ownership structures was on net interest margin at 53.04% and return on assets at 31.37%. Influence of ownership structures was found to be low on return on equity at 3.32% and earnings per share at 2.13%. The results found a negative association between state ownership and net interest margin, negative association between management ownership and both net interest margin and earnings per share, negative association between institutional ownership and return on assets and a negative association between foreign ownership and earnings per share. Based on the findings, commercial banks should vary their ownership structures to boost financial performance. Secondly, banks with high percentage of state ownership should consider partial privatization to improve corporate governance practices. Third, banks should adopt managerial ownership policy limiting the proportion of equity stock on executives to limit their powers in strategic decision making. Fourth, the study proposes a percentage limit on equity stock of an individual institutional investor. Lastly, the study proposes that bank's management to come up with a policy detailing the role and place of foreign investors in strategic decision making to ensure their presence in every decision undertaken by bank managers."

To understand this interrelationship a uniaxial discretised model of the hammer/introducer/implant/bone/soft-tissues was developed. A parametric analysis of applied energy, component materials and geometry, and interactions between implant and bone and between bone and soft-tissues was performed, with implant seating and component stresses as outcome variables. To reduce the impaction effort (energy) required by the surgeon for implant seating and also reduce stresses in the hardware the following outcomes were observed: Reduce energy per hit with more hits / Increase hammer mass / Decrease introducer mass / Increase implant-bone resistance (eg stem roughness). Hardware stiffness and patient mechanics were found to be less important and soft tissue forces, due to inertial protection by the bone mass, were so low that their damage would be unlikely. This simple model provides a basic understanding of how stress waves travel through the impacted system, and an understanding of their relevance to implantation technique and component design."
https://openalex.org/W4285739709,"Introduction Malaria is a severe health threat in the World, mainly in Africa. It is the major cause of health problems in which the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with malaria cases are characterized by spatial variations across the county. This study aimed to investigate the spatial patterns and predictors of malaria distribution in Ethiopia. Methods A weighted sample of 15,239 individuals with rapid diagnosis test obtained from the Central Statistical Agency and Ethiopia malaria indicator survey of 2015. Global Moran’s I and Moran scatter plots were used in determining the distribution of malaria cases, whereas the local Moran’s I statistic was used in identifying exposed areas. The auto logistics spatial binary regression model was used to investigate the predictors of malaria. Results The final auto logistics regression model was reported that male clients had a positive significant effect on malaria cases as compared to female clients [AOR = 2.401, 95% CI: (2.125–2.713) ]. The distribution of malaria across the regions was different. The highest incidence of malaria was found in Gambela [AOR = 52.55, 95%CI: (40.54–68.12)] followed by Beneshangul [AOR = 34.95, 95%CI: (27.159–44.963)]. Similarly, individuals in Amhara [AOR = 0.243, 95% CI:(0.195–0.303], Oromiya [AOR = 0.197, 955 CI: (0.158–0.244)], Dire Dawa [AOR = 0.064, 95%CI(0.049–0.082)], Addis Ababa[AOR = 0.057,95%CI:(0.044–0.075)], Somali[AOR = 0.077,95%CI:(0.059–0.097)], SNNPR[OR = 0.329, 95%CI: (0.261–0.413)] and Harari [AOR = 0.256, 95%CI:(0.201–0.325)] were less likely to had low incidence of malaria as compared with Tigray. Furthermore, for one meter increase in altitude, the odds of positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) decreases by 1.6% [AOR = 0.984, 95% CI: (0.984–0.984)]. The use of a shared toilet facility was found as a protective factor for malaria in Ethiopia [AOR = 1.671, 95% CI: (1.504–1.854)]. The spatial autocorrelation variable changes the constant from AOR = 0.471 for logistic regression to AOR = 0.164 for auto logistics regression. Conclusions This study found that the incidence of malaria in Ethiopia had a spatial pattern which is associated with socio-economic, demographic, and geographic risk factors. Spatial clustering of malaria cases had occurred in all regions, and the risk of clustering was different across the regions. The risk of malaria was found to be higher for those who live in soil floor-type houses as compared to those who lived in cement or ceramics floor type. Similarly, households with thatched, metal and thin, and other roof-type houses have a higher risk of malaria than ceramics tiles roof houses. Moreover, using a protected anti-mosquito net was reducing the risk of malaria incidence."
https://openalex.org/W4285741881,"A major challenge in sustainable agriculture is finding solutions to manage crop-damaging pests such as herbivores while protecting beneficial organisms such as pollinators. Squash is a highly pollinator-dependent crop that is also attractive to herbivores like the striped cucumber beetle. While synthetic insecticides can provide control of insect pests, they can also affect non-target organisms such as pollinators. Thus, growers need to balance pest management with pollinator protection to ensure optimal yield. Thiamethoxam is a commonly used systemic insecticide that translocates throughout plants, leaving residues in nectar and pollen. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there are uses of this insecticide that provides efficient pest control while minimizing pesticide pollinator exposure. Specifically, we tested how different prophylactic application methods (seed treatments, in-furrow applications, and early foliar sprays) of commercially available thiamethoxam products impact pest control, bee visitation, yield, and pesticide residues in flowers of squash crops. We found that among the different methods of thiamethoxam application, in-furrow application best prevented defoliation and resulted in the highest fruit weight and number. However, it also produced the most frequent and highest concentrations of thiamethoxam in nectar and pollen, reaching lethal levels for squash bees. Our study provides evidence that under current application methods, thiamethoxam does not provide a sustainable solution for squash growers and further research is required on more efficient pesticide delivery methods, as well as non-pesticide pest control measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4285743152,"Objective This secondary analysis of a randomised controlled patient-blinded trial comparing effectiveness and side effect briefings in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) investigated the association between patients’ pre-treatment expectations about minimal acupuncture treatment and pain intensity as outcome during and after the end of the treatment. Methods Chronic low back pain patients with a pain intensity of at least 4 on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10 received eight sessions of minimal acupuncture treatment over 4 weeks. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity rated on a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS 0–10) from inclusion visit to treatment session 4 and to the end of the treatment. Patients’ expectations about the effectiveness of acupuncture were assessed using the Expectation for Treatment Scale (ETS) before randomization. Linear regression was applied to investigate whether patients’ pre-treatment expectations predicted changes in pain intensity during and after treatment. Results A total of 142 CLBP patients (40.1 ± 12.5 years; 65.5% female) were included in our analysis. Patients’ pre-treatment expectations about acupuncture treatment were associated with changes in pain intensity after four sessions of minimal acupuncture treatment ( b = -0.264, p = 0.002), but not after the end of the treatment. This association was found in females and males. Conclusions Our results imply that higher pre-treatment expectations only lead to larger reductions in pain intensity in the initial phase of a treatment, with a similar magnitude for both females and males. As the treatment progresses in the second half of the treatment, adapted expectations or other non-specific effects might play a more important role in predicting treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4285744187,"Background Optimizing women’s health and knowledge of preconception healthcare before conceiving a pregnancy decreases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, preconception health care is one of the missing pillars in the continuum of maternal and child health care in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge of pre-conception health, its relation to planned pregnancy, parity, family planning use, and education among married women in Southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 337 married women recruited from March 25 to April 30, 2018 in Jinka town. A simple random sampling technique was employed and the data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Data analysis involved calculating frequencies, percentages, and logistic regression. Associations were assessed using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals with statistical significance determined at a p-value &lt; 0.05. Results The overall women’s preconception health care knowledge score in this study was 55.2%, which is a moderate score. In multivariable analyses, women’s secondary level of education [AOR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.13–4.87], family planning use [AOR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.37–4.87], planned pregnancy [AOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.35–7.44], Nullyparity [AOR = 21.2; 95% CI = 4.92–91.5], and market trade vendors [AOR = 2.5; 95%CI = 1.06–6.03], were significantly associated with knowledge of preconception health care. Conclusion The findings show that women’s knowledge of preconception health care is moderate. Women’s knowledge of preconception health care can be linked to their level of education, use of family planning methods, pregnancy planning, and Nullyparity. Therefore, the government and other key stakeholders need to develop a specific education package that improves women’s knowledge of preconception care and pregnancy planning, taking into account factors such as levels of education and literacy when designing implementation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4286839525,"The trend of the number of publications on a research field is often used to quantify research interest and effort, but this measure is biased by general publication record inflation. This study introduces a novel metric as an unbiased and quantitative tool for trend analysis and bibliometrics. The metric was used to reanalyze reported publication trends and perform in-depth trend analyses on patent groups and a broad range of field in the life-sciences. The analyses confirmed that inflation bias frequently results in the incorrect identification of field-specific increased growth. It was shown that the metric enables a more detailed, quantitative and robust trend analysis of peer reviewed publications and patents. Some examples of the metric's uses are quantifying inflation-corrected growth in research regarding microplastics (51% ± 10%) between 2012 and 2018 and detecting inflation-corrected growth increase for transcriptomics and metabolomics compared to genomics and proteomics (Tukey post hoc p<0.0001). The developed trend-analysis tool removes inflation bias from bibliometric trend analyses. The metric improves evidence-driven decision-making regarding research effort investment and funding allocation."
https://openalex.org/W4280489233,"Radar sensors are becoming crucial for environmental perception in a world with the tremendous growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones. When public safety is a concern, the localization of drones are of great significance. However, a drone used for a wrong motive can cause a serious problem for the environment and public safety, given the fact that the dynamic movement of a drone’s emission signal and location tracking is different from existing positioning. This study proposes a safety zone characterized by the presence of N radars sensors with a goal to track and destabilized rogue drones attending to penetrate safety zones (stadium and school). Specifically, a new joint estimation based on a Gaussian filter has been introduced for spectrum sharing and detection awareness. The profit of this novel sensing method can be clearly seen when the two joint hidden states are taken into consideration. Therefore, the drone’s emission state is analyzed by estimating its movement jointly. Considering the drone’s unknown states and actual positioning, an algorithm is developed based on dynamic states space model. Where Bernoulli filter model is designed to estimate recursively the unknown stages of the drone and its changing location based on time. Meanwhile a power control acted from the radar to the targeted drones so that rogue drones are optimally tracked and destabilized over time. Furthermore, an expanding mechanism has been generated to accurately track the drone and enhance detection. A thoughtful result of the experimentation shows clearly that, even when the drone is moving, spectral detection can be performed accurately by chasing its positions. Its demonstrates at 90% of credibility that the original signal has a direct effect on the propagated signal. Therefore, the magnitude of the Doppler shift increases with frequency. And the clue of its positioning can be used for cognitive radio optimization."
https://openalex.org/W4280514480,"Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF), a genetic cholangiopathy characterized by fibropolycystic changes in the biliary tree, is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene, leading to defective fibrocystin (FPC), changes in planar cell polarity (PCP) and increased β-catenin-dependent chemokine secretion. In this study, we aimed at understanding the role of Scribble (a protein involved in PCP), Yes-associated protein (YAP), and β-catenin in the regulation of the fibroinflammatory phenotype of FPC-defective cholangiocytes. Immunohistochemistry showed that compared with wild type (WT) mice, in FPC-defective (Pkhd1del4/del4 ) mice nuclear expression of YAP/TAZ in cystic cholangiocytes, significantly increased and correlated with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression and pericystic fibrosis, while Scribble expression on biliary cyst cells was markedly decreased. Cholangiocytes isolated from WT mice showed intense Scribble immunoreactivity at the membrane, but minimal nuclear expression of YAP, which conversely increased, together with CTGF, after small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of Scribble. In FPC-defective cholangiocytes, inhibition of YAP nuclear import reduced β-catenin nuclear expression, and CTGF, integrin β6, CXCL1, and CXCL10 mRNA levels, whereas inhibition of β-catenin signaling did not affect nuclear translocation of YAP. Notably, siRNA silencing of Scribble and YAP in WT cholangiocytes mimics the fibroinflammatory changes of FPC-defective cholangiocytes. Conditional deletion of β-catenin in Pkhd1del4/del4 mice reduced cyst growth, inflammation and fibrosis, without affecting YAP nuclear expression. In conclusion, the defective anchor of Scribble to the membrane facilitates the nuclear translocation of YAP and β-catenin with gain of a fibroinflammatory phenotype. The Scribble/YAP/β-catenin axis is a critical factor in the sequence of events linking the genetic defect to fibrocystic trait of cholangiocytes in CHF."
https://openalex.org/W4280545504,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection during pregnancy reduces the transplacental transfer of protective maternal antibodies needed to confer immunity during early postnatal life. However, the mediation of MicroRNA in this dysregulation is not well understood MicroRNAs 3181 and 199a have been shown to mediate neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-like transmembrane antibody transfer and endocytosis respectively but their expression levels in the placenta and plasma in women living with HIV have not been extensively investigated. The objective of this study was to determine how the expression levels of miR-3181 and miR-199a in the placenta and plasma are affected in women chronically infected with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and are virally suppressed at delivery. In this pilot case-control study, plasma and placenta biopsies were obtained from 36 (18 HIV+ and 18 HIV-) Cameroonian women at delivery. MicroRNAs 3181 and 199a expression levels were measured using RT-qPCR, data was analyzed using SPSS22.0 and R 3.60, and p values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All the HIV-infected women were on known ART regimens and were virally suppressed. There was no significant difference in the levels of miR-3181 (p>0.05) in the placenta and plasma amongst HIV-infected and HIV uninfected women. The expression levels of miR-199a were significantly greater in the plasma compared to the placenta of HIV+ (p = 0.00005) and HIV- (p = 0.027) women. Moreover, there was a significantly higher (p = 0.02) level of miR-199a in the plasma of women with HIV and their uninfected counterparts. Linear regression models adjusted for systolic pressure showed no significant difference (p>0.05) in the levels of miR-199a and miR-3181 in both the placenta and plasma due to HIV infection. Our findings suggest that even though ART uptake and viral suppression might help in maintaining miR3181 and miR199a levels in the placenta of women with HIV at comparative levels to those of their HIV negative counterparts, the significantly higher levels of miR-199a in the plasma of women with HIV compared to the placenta might highlight lurking systemic dangers and requires further investigation."

Airway clearance therapies have long been a cornerstone of management of individuals with CF, although evidence supporting their use is lacking. We designed a randomized controlled trial to quantitatively compare the effects of different forms of airway clearance on mucociliary clearance.Three different physiotherapy methods to augment cough-clearance were studied in addition to cough-clearance alone: high-frequency chest-wall oscillating vest, oscillatory positive expiratory pressure, and whole-body vibration. We used gamma scintigraphy after inhalation of radiolabeled particles to quantify mucus clearance before, during, and after physiotherapy. As secondary endpoints, we measured concentrations of small molecules in exhaled breath that may impact mucus clearance.Ten subjects were enrolled and completed study procedures. No differences were identified between any method of airway clearance, including cough clearance alone. We did identify changes in certain small molecule concentrations in exhaled breath following airway clearance.Due to the limitations of this study, we do not believe the negative results suggest a change in clinical practice with regard to airway clearance. Findings pertaining to small molecules in exhaled breath may serve as future opportunities for study."
https://openalex.org/W4280623075,"Although both protein tyrosine phosphatases and kinases are constitutively active in healthy human red blood cells (RBCs), the preponderance of phosphatase activities maintains the membrane proteins in a predominantly unphosphorylated state. We report here that unlike healthy RBCs, proteins in sickle cells are heavily tyrosine phosphorylated, raising the question regarding the mechanism underpinning this tyrosine phosphorylation. Upon investigating possible causes, we observe that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), the major erythrocyte tyrosine phosphatase, is largely digested to a lower molecular weight fragment in sickle cells. We further find that the resulting truncated form of PTP1B is significantly less active than its intact counterpart, probably accounting for the intense tyrosine phosphorylation of Band 3 in sickle erythrocytes. Because this tyrosine phosphorylation of Band 3 promotes erythrocyte membrane weakening that causes release of both membrane vesicles and cell free hemoglobin that in turn initiates vaso-occlusive events, we conclude that cleavage of PTP1B could contribute to the symptoms of sickle cell disease. We further posit that methods to inhibit proteolysis of PTP1B could mitigate symptoms of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4280631436,"An increasing number of posterior segment disorders is routinely managed with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In older, phakic patients cataract formation is expected within the first two years after surgery. For younger patients its progression is individually fluctuating. This study uses an objective quantitative measurement for lens-status-monitoring after PPV with silicone oil to derive predictions for progression and severity of post-operative lens opacification evaluated in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).Data acquisition was performed prospectively between March 2018 and March 2021. PentacamHR® Nucleus Staging mode (PNS) was used to objectively gather data about nuclear cataracts after PPV at different time points. Data was grouped into training and test sets for a mathematical prediction model. Via backward variable selection method a mathematical formula was set up by means of which predictions about lens densitometry (LD) can be calculated.20 males [58.8%] and 14 females [41.2%] matched the inclusion criteria (mean age 50.6 years [23-75; ±12.3]). Average follow-up was 8.1 months (3,4-17.4; ±3.4). Mean baseline LD of the treated and fellow eye before surgery was 11.1% (7.7%-17.6%; ±2.0) and 11.2% (7.7%-14.8%; ±1.5), respectively. Predicted LD values by the model for five pre-selected patients closely match the observed data with an average deviation of 1.06%.Using an objective parameter like LD delivered by the PentacamHR® PNS mode additionally to the patient's age allows us to make an individual prediction for any time after PPV with silicone oil due to RRD for all ages. The accuracy of the model was stronger influenced by baseline LD as cofactor in the equation than patient's age. The application for the prediction lens opacification [which can be accessed for free under the following link (https://statisticarium.com/apps/sample-apps/LensDensityOil/)] can help vitreoretinal surgeons for patient consultation on the possibility to combine PPV with cataract surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4281263255,"The reproductive life span of females is largely determined by the number and quality of oocytes. Previously, we identified MEIOK21 as a meiotic recombination regulator required for male fertility. Here, we characterize the important roles of MEIOK21 in regulating female meiosis and oocyte number and quality. MEIOK21 localizes at recombination sites as a component of recombination bridges in oogenesis like in spermatogenesis. Meiok21-/- female mice show subfertility. Consistently, the size of the primordial follicle pool in Meiok21-/- females is only ~40% of wild-type females because a great number of oocytes with defects in meiotic recombination and/or synapsis are eliminated. Furthermore, the numbers of primordial and growing follicles show a more marked decrease in an age-dependent manner compared with wild-type females. Further analysis shows Meiok21-/- oocytes also have reduced rates of germinal vesicle breakdown and the first polar body extrusion when cultured in vitro, indicating poor oocyte quality. Additionally, Meiok21-/- oocytes have more chromosomes bearing a single distally localized crossover (chiasmata), suggesting a possible defect in crossover maturation. Taken together, our findings indicate critical roles for MEIOK21 in ensuring the number and quality of oocytes in the follicles."

Studies quantifying the impact of anticoagulant bait use on rodent populations are scarce in tropical settings. This study examined the impact of anticoagulant bait use on three measures of rodent activity in Singapore to inform rodent-borne disease control strategies. Using a controlled interrupted time-series analytical design with negative binomial and linear regression models, the average rodent activity levels were compared in the pre- and post-intervention periods. There was a 62.7% (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR): 0.373, 95% CI: [0.224, 0.620]) reduction in the number of rodents caught, a 25.8-unit (coefficient = -25.829, 95% CI: [-29.855, -21.804]) reduction in the number of 30 g/unit baits consumed and a 61.9% (IRR: 0.381, 95% CI: [0.218, 0.665]) reduction in the number of marred bait stations relative to the pre-intervention period. There was a rise in all three outcome measures within four months after the post-intervention period. This study provided strong evidence that anticoagulant baits substantially reduces rodent activity. The population resurgence after the post-intervention period reinforces the importance of timing the resumption of control measures aimed at reducing rodent-borne disease transmission."

In order to assess food web contributions to the different community recovery dynamics along the Newfoundland and Labrador shelf ecosystem, we quantified species interactions using stable isotope mixing models and food web metrics within three sub-regions. Representative samples of each species caught in trawls and plankton tows were analyzed for stomach contents and stable isotope ratios (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) to parameterize isotope mixing models. Regional variation, highlighted by the diets of three economically important species, was observed such that the southern region demonstrated a variety of trophic pathways of nutrient flow into the higher food web while the diets of fish in the northern regions were typically dominated by one or two pathways via dominant prey species, specifically shrimp ( Pandalus sp.) and hyperiids. Food web metrics indicated that the low-diversity northern regions had higher connectance and shorter food chain lengths. This observed regional variation contributes to our understanding of the role of specific forage species to the ecosystem which is an essential contribution towards ecosystem-based management decisions."

However, gene expression of adipokine leptin was not affected in both experimental (P2X4/HCV) and control (NV/HCV) groups on day 5 and day 9 of post infection. Extracellular matrix proteins, laminin and elastin genes expression also significantly increased in presence of P2X4 (HCV/P2X4) on day 9 of post-infection compared to control group NV/HCV cells.In conclusion, these findings constitute the evidence that P2X4 receptors in the presence of HCV play a significant role in the regulation of key antioxidant enzymes (HO-1, Cu/ZnSOD), in the induction of proinflammatory. cytokine (TNF-α), profibrotic cytokine (TGF-β) vasoactive cytokine (angiotensin II). P2X4 also increases the expression of extracellular matrix proteins (laminin and elastin) in the presence of HCV."
https://openalex.org/W4285743127,"Past studies have demonstrated a link between pornography use and addiction to pornography, the underlying mechanism of the association is still unclear. This study intended to examine the mediating role of perceived realism of pornography in the association between pornography use and addiction among emerging adults in Malaysia. This study recruited 222 self-identified pornography users (M age = 21.05; SD Age = 1.68; 75.1% male respondents) via the purposive sampling method. The correlation results indicated positive associations among pornography use, addiction to pornography, and perceived realism of pornography. Further, the perceived realism of pornography significantly mediated the association between pornography use and addiction to pornography after controlling for gender. Thus, this study has provided a fundamental understanding on the perceived realism role of pornography in explaining the association between its use and addiction. Although it is unlikely to stop illegal pornography use, the results pointed out a need to guide emerging adults in pornography use via media literacy programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4285744074,"The aim of this study was to emulate the MERINO trial of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem for the definitive treatment of bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or Klebsiella spp.Data from an observational study of BSI and a randomised controlled trial of a rapid diagnostic in BSI were used to emulate the MERINO trial. The primary outcome of the emulated trial was 28-day mortality after blood culture. Outcomes were compared using logistic regression adjusted for propensity score for emulated intervention.Of the 6,371 observational study and RCT participants, 1,968 had a bloodstream infection with E. coli or Klebsiella spp. of which 121 met the eligibility criteria. In the emulated trial, a total of 14/82 patients (17.1%) allocated to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome compared with 6/39 (15.4%) in the meropenem group (unadjusted odds ratio 1.13 (95% CI 0.40 to 3.21)). After adjustment for propensity score, the odds ratio increased to 1.31 (95% CI 0.40 to 4.26). This difference is in the same direction but of a smaller magnitudethan observed in the MERINO trial, where 30-day mortality was met by 23/187 patients (12.3%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam and 7/191 (3.7%) in the meropenem group (unadjusted odds ratio of 3.69 (95% CI 1.48 to 10.41)).The mortality rate in an emulated trial population was more than double the mortality rate in the MERINO trial. The methodology used attempts to address the concern that previous results could be explained by biases such as selection bias and uncontrolled confounding and provides information on how a trial such as the MERINO trial may have performed in the NHS."
https://openalex.org/W4286832092,"This study investigated the mechanical role of metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in human jumping. Eighteen healthy young men performed three types of single-leg jumps (SJ: squat jump; CMJ: countermovement jump; HJ: standing horizontal jump) on a force plate under barefoot (BARE) and forefoot immobilisation (FFIM) conditions. For FFIM, the forefoot was immobilised around the MTP joints of the dominant leg by a custom-made splint. Force-time components and the centre of pressure (COP) trajectory were measured from the ground reaction force (GRF) in the take-off phase of jumping. The vertical jump heights calculated from the net vertical impulse were lower under FFIM than under BARE during the CMJ (p < 0.05). The HJ distance under FFIM was significantly shorter than that under BARE (p < 0.01). The relative net vertical impulse was lower under FFIM than under BARE during the CMJ (p < 0.05). During the HJ, all the horizontal GRF variables were significantly lower under FFIM than under BARE (p < 0.01), but none of the vertical GRF variables differed between the two conditions. The horizontal relative GRF in the 90-95% of the final take-off phase during the HJ was significantly lower under FFIM than under BARE (p < 0.01). Under FFIM, the COP range in the antero-posterior direction in the take-off phase of the HJ decreased (p < 0.05), whereas its range in the anterior direction for the SJ and CMJ increased (p < 0.05). The results of this study indicate that MTP joint motion can play an important role in regulating force-generating capacities of toe flexor muscles in the take-off phase of human jumping, especially in the horizontal direction of horizontal jumping."
