https://openalex.org/W2112327624,"Shc is a ubiquitously expressed Src homology 2 (SH2) domain protein that can transform fibroblasts and differentiate PC12 cells in a Ras-dependent fashion. Shc binds a variety of tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors presumably via its carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain. We cloned a fragment of Shc when screening a bacterial expression library with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Surprisingly, this fragment encodes the amino terminus of Shc, a region that has no significant similarity to an SH2 domain. When expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, this amino-terminal domain binds to autophosphorylated EGF receptor, as well as HER2/neu and TrkA receptors. This fragment acts like an SH2 domain in that it does not bind non-phosphorylated EGF receptor or EGF receptor with all tyrosine phosphorylation sites mutated or deleted. Our data define a novel domain in Shc that has the potential to interact with growth factor receptors and other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1569534262,"The transformation of newly formed phagosomes into mature phagolysosomes is a process that involves a complex series of interactions between phagosomes and other vacuolar organelles. The machinery required by phagosomes to mediate these interactions is poorly understood. In this study, we allowed human and various rodent cells to take up latex beads whose density facilitates a simple purification of phagosomes using discontinuous sucrose gradients. With this system, we initiated a systematic study of phagosome proteins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the currently available two-dimensional gel protein data bases. By this approach, we were able to recognize a group of polypeptides associated with mouse J774 phagosomes-phagolysosomes including annexin II, annexin VI, the beta-1 and beta-2 subunits of trimeric G proteins, and a group of actin-binding proteins. While the amount of annexin II associated to phagosomes was similar at all times of latex internalization, the levels of annexin VI were higher on late phagosomes. Phospholipid analysis of J774 phagosomes isolated at early and late time points during phagolysosome formation also revealed significant differences in their lipid composition. In the human phagosomes, we resolved over 200 polypeptides on the two-dimensional gels. These included the proteins described in the mouse, as well as 32 polypeptides that were found to be highly enriched in phagosomes, 15 of which are not present in the current data bases. The results demonstrate that the use of latex bead phagosomes is a powerful system to identify key molecules involved in phagolysosome biogenesis."

Two novel members of this new family of ICE/CED-3-related proteases, designated ICErel-II and ICErel-III, were cloned from human monocytic cells. Both were highly homologous to human ICE (52% identical) and CED-3 (25% identical) and both contained the absolutely conserved pentapeptide sequence Gln-Ala-Cys-Arg-Asp containing the catalytic cysteine residue. Other structural motifs that were comparable with ICE suggest that ICErel-II and ICErel-III are also synthesized as larger proenzymes which are proteolytically processed to form heterodimeric active enzymes. Pro-interleukin-1β processing activity could not be detected in cells transfected with ICErel-II or ICErel-III, but pro-domain-less truncated forms of ICErel-II and ICErel-III were capable of effectively inducing fibroblast apoptosis. ICErel-II and ICErel-III may, therefore, participate in proteolytic events culminating in the apoptotic death of human cells.

Apoptosis constitutes a systematic and deliberate means by which cells conclude their presence within an organism. It is prominent in morphological development, tissue remodelling as well as in situations requiring the removal of redundant or unnecessary cells. Apoptosis is also a suicide program frequently engaged by cells in response to pathogenic infections or other irreversible cell damage. (Kerr et al., 1972Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J.

Several of the biochemical events which participate in the ongoing “live or die” decision that is actively made in eukaryotic cells have recently been elucidated. Apoptosis is clearly under the control of both positive and negative regulators. Genetic evidence in nematodes, for example, has identified several genes which control the fate of cells during development (Ellis et al., 1991Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar).

Deletion or mutation of the ced-3 gene completely prevents the apoptotic death of cells otherwise destined to die, while both CED-3 and ICE, when expressed by transfection in fibroblast cell lines or by microinjection into neuronal cells, cause programmed cell death (apoptosis) to occur (Miura et al., 1993Miura M.

The pro-apoptotic effects of both CED-3 and ICE can be prevented by co-transfection with either bcl-2, a mammalian proto-oncogene which functions as a cell death suppressor (whose nematode counterpart is the death repressor gene ced-9) (Vaux et al., 1988Vaux D.L.

ICE was the first identified member of what is clearly a new family of related cysteine proteases. In mammalian cells, this family now includes Nedd2, or its human equivalent ICH-1L, which also have pro-apoptotic properties that can be attenuated by the presence of Bcl-2, and the most recently identified member of this family of cysteine proteases, CPP32 (Kumar et al., 1994Kumar S.

Cell. 1993; 78: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), both developmental and ex vivo apoptosis in ICE-deficient mice largely occurs normally (Li et al., 1995Li P. Allen H.

In this study we describe the identification and molecular cloning from human cells of two novel members of the ICE/CED-3 family of cysteine proteases. Nominally designated ICErel-II and ICErel-III, both enzymes are capable of inducing apoptosis in transfected cells such as fibroblasts and hence may play a role in apoptotic cell death in vivo. HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville MD; ATCC CCL 2) and were maintained in culture at 37°C with 6% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml (Sigma). THP-1 cell and human peripheral blood monocyte cDNA libraries in λgt10 or λgt11, respectively, were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid vectors were from Stratagene, La Jolla CA (pBluescript II SK+) or Invitrogen, San Diego CA (pCR-II, pcDNA3). Reagents for the polymerase chain reaction were purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Restriction endonucleases and other modifying enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). DNA purification systems were from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from New England Nuclear (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Hoechst 33342 and appropriate band-pass interference filter sets (Omega Optical) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from various suppliers. Where specific procedures are not cited, methods outlined in Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

A partial length cDNA clone for ICErel-II was identified by replica-filter screening of a THP-1 cell (acute monocytic leukemia cell line) cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt10 (Clontech) using the 32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probe: 5′-ATG AAG GAT GAG GTG GCC CTG CTG GCT GCT GTG ACC CTG CTG GGC GTG CTG CTG CAG GCT GGC TTC TCC CTG CAG GTG ATC TCT GCC CGG ATT GCC TTC CGG GT-3′. This initial 748-bp clone, designated T10.3.1, corresponded to bases 544-1291 of the full-length ICErel-II clone described below. The clone was retrieved from an individual λgt10 plaque by DNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′-TGA GCA AGT TCA GCC TGG TTA AGT-3′ and 5′-GGC TTA TGA GTA TTT CTT CCA GGG-3′ which correspond to the sequence of λgt10 on the left and right side, respectively, of the EcoRI restriction enzyme site containing the cDNA insert. The resulting amplification product was ligated into the plasmid vector pCR-II (Invitrogen), transformed into competent Escherichia coli cells, colony-purified, and propagated by growth of the resulting transformed cells in liquid culture. The plasmid DNA was purified from the cells and the nucleotide sequence of the clone T10.3.1 insert was determined by dideoxy DNA sequencing. Based on the sequence of this clone, synthetic oligonucleotides specific for the clone T10.3.1 sequence were prepared and after 32P labeling were used to re-screen the THP-1 cell λgt10 cDNA library. The probes used for replica filter screening were 5′-AGG CCA CTT CCA AGG ATG CTG GA-3′ for one replica filter and 5′-CTG GAA GAT GGT GTC ATA AAG CAG C-3′ for the other paired replica filter. The largest clone identified, designated T15.1.1, was 1207 bp and corresponded to bases 64-1270 of the full-length ICErel-II clone described below. The clone was retrieved from λgt10 following expansion of the λ bacteriophage by culture on E. coli-containing agarose plates, then purifying the λ bacteriophage DNA by a combination of polyethylene glycol precipitation, macroporous silica gel chromatography, and alcohol precipitation. The T15.1.1 DNA fragment was excised by partial EcoRI restriction digestion (partial digestion was necessary owing to an internal EcoRI site in the T15.1.1 sequence) followed by agarose gel purification of the 1.2-kb fragment then ligation of the purified fragment into the EcoRI site of the plasmid vector pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). Following transformation into competent E. coli cells, colony purification, and propagation of the resulting transformed cells in liquid culture, the plasmid DNA was purified and the nucleotide sequence of the clone T15.1.1 fragment was determined. The full-length ICErel-II clone (designated P101.1.1) was identified by replica filter screening of a human peripheral blood monocyte cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt11 (Clontech). The filters were probed with a 32P-labeled PCR fragment that had been generated by amplification of the T15.1.1 ICErel-II clone using the primers 5′-GAA CTG GAA GGA AGA GGA AA-3′ and 5′-TCA TGC ACA GTT CCG CAG ATT CCC T-3′ which produced a fragment corresponding to bases 142-702 of the full-length ICErel-II sequence. (This probe was chosen since it was in a region of ICErel-II with low sequence identity to ICE and would therefore minimize the number of ICE clones identified.) The 1297-bp full-length ICErel-II clone (P101.1.1) was retrieved by EcoRI excision from purified λ bacteriophage DNA as described above for clone T15.1.1. The DNA sequence of the P101.1.1 ICErel-II clone, determined by bidirectional dideoxy DNA sequencing, was identical to four other clones that were isolated during the same series of replica filter screens. A full-length cDNA clone for ICErel-III was identified by replica-filter screening of a THP-1 cell (acute monocytic leukemia cell line) cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt10 (Clontech) using the 32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes: 5′-AGG CCA CTT CCA AGG ATG CTG GA-3′ for one replica filter and 5′-CTG GAA GAT GGT GTC ATA AAG CAG C-3′ for the other paired replica filter. (These oligonucleotides correspond to sequences within ICErel-II and were the same as those used to identify the clone T15.1.1 of ICErel-II as described above.) The largest clone identified, designated T17.1.1, was 1414 bp. The clone was retrieved from λgt10 following expansion of the λ bacteriophage by culture on E. coli-containing agarose plates, then purifying the λ bacteriophage DNA by a combination of polyethylene glycol precipitation, macroporous silica gel chromatography, and alcohol precipitation. The T17.1.1 DNA fragment was excised by partial EcoRI restriction digestion (partial digestion was necessary owing to an internal EcoRI site in the T17.1.1 sequence) followed by agarose gel purification of the 1.4-kb fragment and then ligation of the purified fragment into the EcoRI site of the plasmid vector pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). Following transformation into competent E. coli cells, colony purification, and propagation of the resulting transformed cells in liquid culture, the plasmid DNA was purified, and the nucleotide sequence of the clone T17.1.1 insert was determined by bidirectional dideoxy DNA sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from 3 x 108 THP-1 cells by guanidinium thiocyanate denaturation followed by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction using reagents from Clontech. The RNA from 1 x 108 cell equivalents was subsequently used for poly(A)+ selection using oligo(dT)-cellulose with reagents from Invitrogen. Samples were resolved on 1% (w/v) agarose gels (containing formaldehyde) then transferred to a Nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.) by capillary blotting. For tissue distribution studies, Northern blots prepared by Clontech containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane were used. For ICErel-II, a probe was generated by PCR amplification of bases 142-702 (see Fig. 1) using the full-length ICErel-II cDNA clone as template. The resulting fragment was subsequently purified, then radiolabeled by random priming in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP using reagents from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. For ICErel-III, a probe was generated in an identical manner, except that the PCR amplification product corresponded to bases 81-822 of ICErel-III (see Fig. 1; probes were generated from these regions since sequence identity between the ICE forms was lowest.). After prehybridization, heat-denatured probes were annealed overnight at 60°C in the presence of 6 x SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS and then progressively washed with buffers containing 6 x SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (20 min at ambient temperature), 1 x SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (2 x 20 min at 65°C), then 0.5 x SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (2 x 20 min at 65°C). Bands were visualized by autoradiography. Full-length cDNA clones for ICE, ICErel-II, and ICErel-III were used as templates for PCR amplification using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed to: (a) truncate the three ICE forms by eliminating the entire amino-terminal region corresponding to the pro-domain of ICE (amino acids 1-119 of ICE; 1-92 of ICErel-II; 1-133 of ICErel-III); (b) substitute the amino-terminal amino acid of the p20 subunit of ICE (Asn120), or its positional equivalent in ICErel-II (Glu93) and ICErel-III (Glu134), with an initiator methionine; (c) add XhoI, NotI, and BamHI restriction sites upstream of the open reading frame and BamHI, NotI, and XbaI restriction sites downstream of the open reading frame in order to facilitate subcloning; (d) add the Kozak translation initiation enhancer 5′-CCACC-3′ immediately upstream of the new initiator ATG (Kozak, 1991Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (e) append the octapeptide sequence (N)DYKDDDDK(C) to the carboxyl terminus of each ICE form as an epitope tag (FLAG; Hopp et al., 1988Hopp T.P.

The synthetic oligonucleotides used for these modifications were as follows (italicized letters indicate those bases corresponding to nucleotide sequences of their respective ICE clones; see Fig. 1). For ICE, the forward primer was 5′-CCG CTC GAG CGG CCG CGG ATC CAC CAT GCC AGC TAT GCC CAC ATC CTC AGG CTC AGA AG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCT CTA GAG CGG CCG CGG ATC CTA TTA TTT ATC ATC ATC ATC TTT ATA ATC ATG TCC TGG GAA GAG GTA GAA ACA TCT TGT C-3′. For ICErel-II, the forward primer was 5′-CCG CTC GAG CGG CCG CGG ATC CAC CAT GGC TGG ACC ACC TGA GTC AGG AGA ATC TAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCT CTA GAG CGG CCG CGG ATC CTA TTA TTT ATC ATC ATC ATC TTT ATA ATC ATT GCC AGG AAA GAG GTA GAA ATA TCT TGT C-3′. For ICErel-III, the forward primer was 5′-CCG CTC GAG CGG CCG CGG ATC CAC CAT GGC TGG ACC ACC TGA GTC AGC AGA ATC TAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCT CTA GAG CGG CCG CGG ATC CTA TTA TTT ATC ATC ATC ATC TTT ATA ATC ATT GCC AGG AAA GAG GTA GAA ATC TCT TGT C-3′. For each 100 μl of PCR reaction mixture, 0.5 ng of template DNA (each of the three ICE clones in pBluescript II SK+) was used in the presence of 0.5 μM of each of the appropriate forward and reverse synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Thermocycling conditions were 60 s at 94°C, 30 s at 52°C, 90 s at 72°C for 25 cycles. For each clone, replicate PCR reaction mixtures were made so that error-free clones could be recovered. The resulting modified clones were trimmed by sequential XhoI and XbaI restriction digestion and then ligated into XhoI/XbaI-cut pcDNA3 downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The nucleotide sequence of each modified clone was then confirmed by bidirectional dideoxy DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were seeded at an initial density of 1.6 x 104 cells/cm2 into six-well cluster dishes (10 cm2/well) containing glass coverslips in each well. After overnight culture at 37°C with 6% CO2, adherent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then covered with fresh medium. Transfection was performed by calcium-phosphate precipitation using 3 μg of plasmid DNA/well (0.3 μg/cm2) for 24 h at 37°C in 3% CO2. (Unless otherwise indicated, all transfections were performed using pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with inserts downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter.) The cells were washed and the medium replaced as above and culturing was continued for 72 h 37°C in 6% CO2. An identical plasmid harboring β-galactosidase was used as a control to monitor transfection efficiency, which was routinely 20-30%. Areas of the glass disks containing transfected HeLa cells were isolated using 6-mm cloning rings, and the cells were incubated for 15 min at ambient temperature in the presence of 5 μg of Hoechst 33342/ml. Cell nuclei were visualized by fluorescent microscopy using a band-pass interference filter set yielding an excitation peak of 330 nm and an emission peak of 450 nm. Cells having brightly fluorescent, condensed, and fragmented chromatin were scored as apoptotic whereas non-apoptotic cells were identified by weakly fluorescent uniformly stained nuclei. For each condition a minimum of 250 cells in five separate fields were scored by a nonparticipant in the experiment who was also blind with respect to the experimental conditions. The complete cDNA sequence of ICErel-II (clone P101.1.1) and corresponding amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1A. The longest open reading frame (bases 38-1171) encodes a 377-amino acid 43.3-kDa polypeptide which has 53% sequence identity (68% sequence similarity) with human interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, 27% sequence identity (52% sequence similarity) with ICH-1L, the human equivalent of murine Nedd2, 32% identity (53% sequence similarity) with human CPP32, and 26% sequence identity (52% sequence similarity) with the Caenorhabditis elegans CED-3 polypeptide. The longest open reading frame of ICErel-III clone T17.1.1 (bases 35-1291; Fig. 1B) encodes a 418-amino acid 47.7-kDa polypeptide which has 51% sequence identity (65% sequence similarity) with human interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, 27% sequence identity (51% sequence similarity) with ICH-1L, 30% identity (49% sequence similarity) with human CPP32, and 24% sequence identity (49% sequence similarity) with the C. elegans CED-3 polypeptide. ICErel-II and ICErel-III are more related to each other (74% sequence identity, 83% sequence similarity) than either is to ICE, ICH-1L, CPP32, or C. elegans CED-3. The high degree of sequence conservation between these proteins (Fig. 2), particularly in the region surrounding the putative catalytic cysteine residues (Cys285 of ICE, Cys258 of ICErel-II, Cys299 of ICErel-III, Cys303 of ICH-1L, Cys163 of CPP32, Cys358 of C. elegans CED-3), as well as other structural motifs throughout the polypeptides, is consistent with ICErel-II and ICErel-III being members of the newly identified ICE/CED-3 family of thiol proteases. The majority of sequence heterogeneity between the precursor forms of these proteases occurs in the region corresponding to the pro-domain, whereas those areas corresponding to the p20 and p10 subunits of the mature active enzymes are more highly conserved. In particular, those amino acids which based on the x-ray crystal structure of ICE (Wilson et al., 1994Wilson K.P. Black J.-A.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P.

There is more diversity, however, in amino acids that putatively line the groove where the P2-P4 residues of the substrate lie (corresponding to ICE Val338 340 His342, Pro343, Arg383, Gln385; see Fig. 2, open triangles). It is these latter determinants, particularly those involved in binding the P2-P4 amino acids of the substrate, that in all likelihood dictate the substrate specificity of the individual ICE/CED-3 family members. Northern blot analysis of ICErel-II in THP-1 cells (the human pro-monocytic leukemia cell line from which both ICErel-II and ICErel-III were cloned) identified a single band of approximately 1.5 kb (Fig. 3A), whereas ICErel-III mRNA was below the level of detection. The low quantities of ICErel-III transcripts in THP-1 cells are consistent with the low frequency of ICErel-III clones identified (for every ICErel-III clone there were >50 ICErel-II clones found), as well as with the weaker ICErel-III signals in tissue distribution Northern blots (Fig. 3B). Transcripts for ICErel-II were prominent in placenta, lung, and liver, and to a lesser degree in pancreas, kidney, and skeletal muscle, but were not detectable in brain tissue. The distribution of ICErel-III was similar, except that the overall signal strength was only about 10% of that for ICErel-II. (Because of the high degree of cDNA sequence identity between ICErel-II and ICErel-III (83%), we could not entirely exclude the possibility of cross-hybridization in these Northern blots. Hence the ICErel-III blot shown in Fig. 3B may not reflect the true distribution of ICErel-III.) The distribution of ICH-1L, the human equivalent of Nedd2, using Northern blots from the same commercial source (Wang et al., 1994Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu J. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) was similar to that of ICErel-II. When full-length clones for ICE, ICErel-II, and ICErel-III were originally transfected into various host cells (including COS-M6, RAT-1 and HeLa), highly variable effects on cellular apoptosis were observed. Subsequent epitope tagging of the NH2 terminus of each polypeptide with the T7 gene 10 undecapeptide MASMTGGQQMG and the COOH terminus of each with the hemagglutinin epitope YPYDVPDYA confirmed, in conjunction with specific antisera (raised against recombinant ICE or against synthetic peptides corresponding to antigenic sequences within ICErel-II and ICErel-III) that the p10 subunit or its equivalent from each precursor polypeptide was proteolytically released from the pro-enzyme, but it was the release of the pro-domain from the p20 subunit that was highly variable (data not shown; maturation of ICE was somewhat less prone to the variability seen with ICErel-II and ICErel-III). Similar results were observed when NH2-terminal T7/COOH-terminal hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ICE forms were inserted behind the polyhedrin promoter of baculovirus (AcMNPV) and used to infect insect (Sf9) cells. In this case, ICE was rapidly processed to its mature form and induced early Sf9 cell apoptosis, whereas the pro-domains of ICErel-II and ICErel-III were not separated from their respective p20 subunits (p10 subunits were released as above), and no premature apoptosis occurred (data not shown). It is possible that removal of the pro-domain from ICErel-II and ICErel-III may represent an activation step that does not normally occur when these enzymes are expressed by transfection into otherwise healthy cells. To test this possibility, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences corresponding to the pro-domain of ICE were removed from ICE, ICErel-II, and ICErel-III (Fig. 4A), and the resulting truncated proteases were transfected into fibroblasts (Fig. 4B). In all three cases, approximately 15-20% of the cells became apoptotic (corresponding approximately to the transfection efficiency), whereas few cells in the vector-only controls were apoptotic. Pro-interleukin-1β processing activity was never detectable in cells transfected with ICErel-II or ICErel-III, but was present in cells transfected with ICE (data not shown). It is becoming increasingly clear that the onset of apoptotic cell death begins by the engagement of a biochemical pathway that results in the systematic and orderly disassembly of unnecessary or irreparably damaged cells. Several of the molecules involved in these events have now been identified and many have been cloned as well (for review, see Barinaga, 1994Barinaga M. Science. 1994; 263: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Haecker and Vaux, 1994Haecker G. Vaux D.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 99-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, and Wyllie, 1994Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 272-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the common effector mechanisms that appear to mediate the early steps in the putative apoptosis cascade in response to diverse stimuli. Both genetic evidence in nematodes and transfection experiments in mammalian cells indicate that one of the key steps in the common effector pathway of apoptotic cell death is catalyzed by a cysteine protease that, surprisingly, is related to ICE: the thiol protease that is responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the 31-kDa inactive pro-interleukin-1β cytokine precursor to its active 17.5 kDa form (Kostura et al., 1989Kostura M.J. Tocci M.J. Limjuco G. Chin J. Cameron P. Hillman A.G. Chartrain N.A. Schmidt J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5227-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The lack of markedly aberrant apoptotic death in ICE-deficient mice (Li et al., 1995Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Towne E.

Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), however, indicates that one or more of the other ICE/CED-3 family members plays the key role in mammalian apoptosis. Including those described in this study, there are now five known members of the ICE/CED-3 family of cysteine proteases which are of human origin (ICE, ICErel-II, ICErel-III, ICH-1L, CPP32). ICH-1L is the human homologue of murine Nedd2, one of several gene products that is developmentally down-regulated in brain tissue following the extensive tissue remodelling, and accompanying apoptosis, that occurs during embryogenesis (Kumar et al., 1992Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). ICH-1 itself appears to be derived from two transcripts, via alternative splicing, which may produce positive (ICH-1L) as well as negative (ICH-1S) regulators of apoptosis (Wang et al., 1994Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu J. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The most recently identified member of the ICE/CED-3 family, CPP32, is also derived from two alternatively spliced transcripts, which results in a single conservative amino acid change (Asp190 or Glu190) that is unlikely to affect the function of the mature enzyme (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 1994Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Owing to the similarities between ICE and the other identified members of this family of proteases, ICE can be regarded as a structural prototype for the others. The functional ICE enzyme exits as a closely associated (p20/p10)2 tetramer with catalytic residues residing in the p20 subunit and residues from both the p10 and p20 subunits contributing to the P1 Asp side chain binding pocket (Wilson et al., 1994Wilson K.P. Black J.-A.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 343-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Only residues from the p10 subunit appear to be involved in P2-P4 binding and in particular in forming the hydrophobic channel that binds the P4 Tyr. It is these latter residues that contribute to the P2-P4 binding channel (corresponding to ICE Val338 340 His342, Pro343, Arg383, Gln385) that are the least conserved between ICE/CED-3 family members (Fig. 5). They generally fall into three subgroups: (a) Val338 and Trp340 which are conserved in most of the sequences described in Fig. 2 and 5, except ICH-1L and a Val to Tyr substitution in CPP32; (b) His342 and Pro343, which are unique to ICE only; and (c) Arg383 and Gln385, which are common to ICE, ICErel-II, and ICErel-III (except for a conservative Arg to Lys substitution), but not to ICH-1L, CPP32, or CED-3. Since it is probable that the various members of the ICE/CED-3 family have differing substrate specificities (e.g. it is not likely that all of them are involved in pro-interleukin-1β maturation nor is it likely that ICE itself is the key pro-apoptotic cysteine protease), it is probably the P2-P4 substrate determinants and their corresponding S2-S4 subsites on the protease that dictate substrate specificity. Although emerging evidence supports a key role for ICE/CED-3-like cysteine proteases in apoptosis, the substrates upon which they act and how this results in the coordinated, orderly disassembly of the cell is less clear. One probable candidate is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a key enzyme in DNA repair, genome surveillance, and integrity. Specific proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase occurs as an early event in apoptosis, resulting in the separation of the two zinc-finger DNA binding motifs at the NH2 terminus of the enzyme from the catalytic domain at the COOH terminus (Kaufmann et al., 1993Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage site within poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase resembles the cleavage site I in pro-interleukin-1β that is recognized by ICE and a protease-related but not identical to ICE, which has recently been identified as an active form of CPP32, has been implicated in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase breakdown during apoptosis (Lazebnik et al., 1994Lazebnik Y.A.

This as well as other proteolytic events catalyzed by this family of cysteine proteases (such as breakdown of the 70-kDa component of the U1 small ribonucleoprotein; Casciola-Rosen et al., 1994Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may contribute to downstream events that occur in response to apoptotic stimuli. Which of the known ICE/CED-3 family members are prominent in mediating apoptotic events and what specific roles ICErel-II and ICErel-III might play remains to be determined. The various ICE/CED-3 family members may represent tissue-specific isoforms or they might perform coordinated tasks in a cysteine protease activation cascade. Analysis of their levels in pathogenic situations where inappropriate apoptosis is prominent may yield some clues.

https://openalex.org/W1592353043,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates CREB327/341 at a single serine residue, Ser119/133, respectively. Phosphorylation at this site creates the sequence motif SXXXS(P), a consensus site of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) enzyme (Fiol, C.J., Mahrenholz, A.M., Wang, Y., Roeske, R.W., and Roach, P.J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14042-14048). We examined the phosphorylation of CREB at the SXXXS(P) consensus site and its role in CREB transactivation to cAMP induction. Neither isoform of the GSK-3 enzyme (GSK-3 alpha or beta) utilizes CREB as its substrate unless CREB is already phosphorylated at Ser119/133. A 13-amino acid peptide containing the sequence surrounding Ser119/133 was phosphorylated by GSK-3, at Ser115/129, only after the primary phosphorylation of the peptide by PKA (at Ser119/133), suggesting that Ser115/129 is a GSK-3 phosphoacceptor site. Mutant CREB327/341 proteins containing Ser-->Ala substitutions confirmed Ser115/129 as the only GSK-3 phosphorylation site. Transfection assays of wild type and mutant Gal4-CREB fusion proteins in PC12 cells demonstrated that Ser-->Ala substitution of residue 129 of CREB341 impairs the transcriptional response to cAMP induction. Analogous mutation in CREB327 results in 70% decrease in its transactivation response to cAMP. In undifferentiated F9 cells, which are refractory to cAMP induction, transfected GSK-3 beta kinase induces a 60-fold increase in cyclic AMP response element-dependent transcription, mediated via the endogenous CREB protein. We propose that the hierarchical phosphorylation at the PKA and GSK-3 sites of CREB are essential for cAMP control of CREB."

This entry pathway can also be activated by injection of inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate, application of thapsigargin, or incubation in calcium-free medium. A variety of protocols revealed highly nonlinear behavior of the calcium entry in thapsigargin-treated oocytes suggestive of positive and negative feedback by calcium at the level of its own entry. These feedback mechanisms may account for the highly damped calcium oscillations we observed in thapsigargin-treated oocytes. Low level activation of protein kinase C potentiated calcium influx in thapsigargin-treated oocytes, apparently by blocking the inactivation of the calcium influx. Higher levels of protein kinase C activity inhibited capacitative calcium entry."

Although belonging to the the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily of proteins, the molecular mechanism of maspin is currently unknown. Here we show that the reactive site loop of maspin exists in an exposed conformation that does not require activation by cofactors. The reactive site loop of maspin, however, does not act as an inhibitor of proteinases such as chymotrypsin, elastase, plasmin, thrombin, and trypsin but rather as a substrate. Maspin is also unable to inhibit tissue and urokinase type plasminogen activators. Stability studies show that maspin cannot undergo the stressed-relaxed transition typical of proteinase-inhibitory serpins, and the protein is capable of spontaneous polymerization induced by changes in pH. It is likely, therefore, that maspin is structurally more closely related to ovalbumin and angiotensinogen, and its tumor suppressor activity is independent of a latent or intrinsic trypsin-like serine proteinase-inhibitory activity.

https://openalex.org/W2021094639,"Irradiation induces the production of superoxide radicals (O2.-), which play an important causative role in radiation damage. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in scavenging O2..-. This study examined MnSOD gene regulation by irradiation in WI38 human fibroblasts. Unstimulated fibroblasts constitutively expressed MnSOD activity and mRNA; irradiation markedly increased MnSOD activity and mRNA levels. The increase in MnSOD transcripts by irradiation was both time- and dose-dependent. WI38 fibroblasts constitutively produce low levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1). The induction of MnSOD mRNA by irradiation was partially blocked by anti-IL-1 antibodies, and treatment of cells with IL-1 also increased MnSOD mRNA levels. Inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway with indomethacin augmented the induction MnSOD mRNA by irradiation and prostaglandin E2 inhibited the accumulation of MnSOD mRNA by irradiation. Transcriptional run-on analysis showed that irradiation increased the rate of MnSOD transcription 2-fold. Stability studies of MnSOD mRNA in these cells showed that the half-life increased from < 1.5 h in unirradiated cells to > 4 h in irradiated cells. These results suggest that induction of the MnSOD gene after irradiation is regulated, at least in part, by IL-1 production and that increased levels of MnSOD transcripts also occur through a pathway of endogenous prostaglandin E2 production. Our data indicate that the increase in MnSOD mRNA observed after irradiation occurs through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms."

The arrested Oee1-Dhfr precursor appears to span both the outer and inner envelope membranes. Translocational arrest of Oee1-Dhfr by low ATP levels was reversible, and import was restored upon resupplementation with higher ATP levels. Chemical cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation with monospecific antibodies indicate that two outer envelope membrane proteins (Com44 and Com70) and at least one inner envelope protein (Cim44 and Cim97) were found to be in close proximity to Oee1-Dhfr during translocation.

https://openalex.org/W1582190823,"A homologous expression system and a purification protocol for pure, highly active recombinant yeast transketolase have been developed. The invariant transketolase residue Glu418, which forms a hydrogen bond to the N-1' nitrogen atom of the pyrimidine ring of the cofactor thiamin diphosphate has been replaced by glutamine and alanine. Crystallographic analyses of the mutants show that these amino acid substitutions do not induce structural changes beyond the site of mutation. In both cases, the cofactor binds in a manner identical to the wild-type enzyme. Significant differences in the CD spectra of the mutant transketolases compared with the spectrum of wild-type enzyme indicate differences in the electron distribution of the aminopyrimidine ring of the cofactor. The E418Q mutant shows 2% and the E418A mutant shows about 0.1% of the catalytic activity of wild-type enzyme. The affinities of the mutant enzymes for thiamin diphosphate are comparable with wild-type transketolase. The hydrogen bond between the coenzyme and the side chain of Glu418 is thus not required for coenzyme binding but essential for catalytic activity. The results demonstrate the functional importance of this interaction and support the molecular model for cofactor deprotonation, the first step in enzymatic thiamin catalysis."

To obtain analogous information for the human receptor, the cDNA coding for the human A1-adenosine receptor was inserted into a plasmid placing the synthesis of the receptor protein under the control of the MalE promoter. Following induction by maltose, active receptor accumulated in Escherichia coli membranes. Binding of the antagonist 8-[3H]cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine to E. coli membranes (KD approximately 2 nM, Bmax approximately 0.2-0.4 pmol/mg) showed the appropriate pharmacological profile. Incubation of E. coli membranes with purified Go,i-reconstituted guanine nucleotide-sensitive high affinity binding of the agonist (-)[125I] N6-3-(iodo-4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl)adenosine to the receptor (KD approximately 1 nM). In the presence of purified beta gamma-subunit, the recombinant receptor interacted equally well with the recombinant G protein alpha-subunits Gi alpha-1, Gi alpha-2, Gi alpha-3; G(o) alpha displayed a lower affinity for the receptor while Gs alpha was inactive. Parallel experiments were carried out in bovine and human brain membranes pretreated with N-ethylmaleimide to inactivate the endogenous G(o)/Gi proteins; Gi alpha-3 was most potent in reconstituting 125I-HPIA binding to bovine membranes, while Gi alpha-1, Gi alpha-2, and G(o) alpha displayed similar affinities. However, in human membranes, Gi alpha-1, Gi alpha-2, and Gi alpha-3, were equipotent and high concentrations of G(o) alpha were required to promote 125I-HPIA binding. These observations show (i) that functional human A1-adenosine receptors were synthesized in E. coli; (ii) that the pattern of G protein coupling is identical for the recombinant human A1-receptor and its counterpart in the native membrane; (iii) and that species differences between bovine and human receptor exist not only in their pharmacological profile but also in their G protein specificity suggesting that species homologues of receptors may use different signaling mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1572748650,"The heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKI) was shown previously to export the kinase catalytic subunit (C) from the nucleus (Fantozzi, D.

In this study, the mechanism of PKI export is investigated. The injection of a C-PKI complex containing both labeled PKI and C-subunit revealed that both proteins exit the nucleus in unison. A fusion protein of C-subunit with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (140 kDa) cannot transverse the nuclear membrane in either direction, but can be exported from the nucleus when complexed with PKI, supporting the presence of a nuclear export signal (NES) in the C-PKI complex. Fusions of PKI alpha with GST (70 kDa) or PKI beta 1 with maltose-binding protein (MBP) (50 kDa) remain effective at exporting complexes with C-subunit. The export of C-PKI is also sensitive to temperature and energy depletion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that export is both energy- and temperature-dependent, but size-independent, consistent with an active signal-mediated export process. GST-PKI exits from the nucleus even in the absence of C-subunit, indicating that the NES resides entirely on PKI, but suggesting that fusion of PKI to GST leads to a conformational change that mimics the exposure of the NES caused by the binding of C. Since both PKI alpha and PKI beta 1 can export C-subunit, the predicted export signal is likely to reside on the residues conserved between PKI alpha and PKI beta 1."

Both depolarization-dependent Ca2+ entry and intracellular Ca2+ store release contribute to the sugar-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. Here we show that maneuvers depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores induce membrane depolarization and a sustained nitrendipine-sensitive Ca2+ influx, whereas interventions promoting Ca2+ store refilling produce a hyperpolarization and inhibit Ca2+ influx. Both intracellular Ca2+ store depletion and maitotoxin activated a depolarizing nonselective cation current carried principally by Na+ in the physiological range of membrane potentials. The activation of such a current may form the paradigm by which excitable cells refill depleted intracellular Ca2+ stores by depolarization-driven opening of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels."

We have investigated the mechanism for the biogenesis of 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) in amine oxidase with two site-specific mutants of the yeast methylamine oxidase. Our results show that the capacity for TPQ formation in vivo is abolished when a putative ligand to copper, His-456, is changed to Asp; this H456D mutant binds copper at a low level (approximately 4.1%), relative to the wild-type protein. In contrast, altering the active site consensus sequence that contains the precursor tyrosine does not affect TPQ production. The data implicate a self-catalysis mechanism for TPQ biogenesis, in which the protein-bound copper plays a key role. We propose that the minimal information required for TPQ biogenesis lies in a structural motif consisting of the copper site and the precursor tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1506810006,"The mammalian heat shock response has been investigated extensively using tissue culture cells with only a limited amount of information available on animals and intact tissues. The neurohormonal stress response mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leads to the activation of heat shock factor (HSF) in rat adrenal tissue. Here we show through the use of antibodies specific to each member of the HSF family that restraint-induced stress in intact Wistar rats and adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment of hypophysectomized animals leads to the activation of HSF1 monomers to trimers with DNA-binding activity. Because HSF1 is also the target factor for metabolic and environmental stress, these data reveal an intersection of pathways leading to HSF1 activation. Comparison of the biochemical properties and levels of HSF1 in the Wistar and Fischer 344 rat strains reveals that HSF1 is constitutively present in an activated DNA-binding state in the adrenals of Fischer 344 rats. During aging, the levels of HSF1 remain constant, yet the transcription factor from aged animals exhibits a decreased ability to bind DNA."

A significant loss of alpha-helix occurs below pH 3.5 and above pH 10 in both apoA-I and A-IM/A-IM; A-IM/A-IM constantly shows a higher alpha-helical content than apoA-I over the entire pH range (1.7-12.8), suggesting that hydrophobic forces stabilize the interaction between the two A-IM chains. Indeed, and differently from apoA-I, the alpha-helical content of A-IM/A-IM is minimally affected by solvent ionic strength. The aromatic side chains in both lipid-free and lipid-bound A-IM/A-IM are immobilized in a more asymmetric and hydrophobic environment than in lipid-free apoA-I, the conformation of A-IM/A-IM being instead similar to that achieved by apoA-I following interaction with lipids. The present findings prove that rA-IM/A-IM is structurally identical to the native protein; the conformation of A-IM/A-IM is remarkably different from that of apoA-I, thus possibly explaining some of the peculiar functional properties of the apoA-IMilano dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1538467835,"The human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) genome encodes a 15-kDa accessory gene product, Vpr, that is essential for virus replication in primary monocytes/macrophages. Being present in the virion, Vpr is believed to function in the early phases of HIV-1 replication, including nuclear migration of the pre-integration complex and/or transcription of the provirus genome. By gel filtration analysis of highly purified Vpr protein and its mutants, we demonstrate that HIV-1 Vpr exists as an oligomer. The N-terminal domain of Vpr (amino acids (aa) 1-42) is sufficient for oligomerization; however, deletion of aa 36-76 from Vpr disrupts oligomerization, suggesting that aa 36-42 are critical for Vpr oligomerization. As a result of Vpr oligomerization, basic aa residues within Vpr aa 1-73 are highly resistant to trypsin digestion, while those within Vpr aa 74-96 are easily accessible. Mutations within the leucine-/isoleucine-rich domain (aa 60-81), which was previously identified to be involved in Vpr interaction with a host cellular protein, rendered Arg62 more susceptible to trypsin digestion. Thus, the Vpr oligomeric structure must be extended into this domain. These results suggest a novel feature of HIV-1 Vpr that may be important for its functions."

Using a δ opioid receptor cDNA as a probe, we have isolated a murine μ opioid receptor cDNA clone (mMOR). Stable expression of mMOR in Chinese hamster ovary cells conferred high binding affinity for μ receptor ligands including morphine and [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin and low affinity for δ and κ preferring ligands. Treatment of these cell lines with morphine and other μ agonists inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation, demonstrating a functional coupling of mMOR to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The predicted amino acid sequence of mMOR shares ≈55% overall amino acid identity with the δ receptor and ≈97% identity with the recently reported rat μ opioid receptor. Expression of the μ receptor in mouse brain as revealed by in situ hybridization parallels the reported pattern of distribution of μ-selective ligand binding sites. Chromosomal localization (to mouse chromosome 10) and Southern analysis are consistent with a single μ opioid receptor gene in the mouse genome, suggesting that the various pharmacologically distinct forms of the μ receptor arise from alternative splicing, post-translational events, or from a highly divergent gene(s).

https://openalex.org/W2022020054,"The acidic glucagon-degrading activity of hepatic endosomes has been attributed to membrane-bound forms of cathepsins B and D. Endosomal lysates processed full-length nonradiolabeled glucagon to 32 different peptides that were identified by amino acid analysis and full-length sequencing. These indicated C-terminal carboxypeptidase, endopeptidase as well as N-terminal tripeptidyl-aminopeptidase activities in endosomes. Glucagon proteolysis was inhibited 95% by E-64 and pepstatin A, inhibitors of cathepsins B and D, respectively. This was confirmed by the pH 6-dependent chemical cross-linking of [125I]iodoglucagon to a polypeptide of 30 kDa, which was immunodepleted by polyclonal anti-cathepsin B antibody, and the removal of greater than 80% of glucagon-degrading activity by polyclonal antibodies to cathepsins B and D. By similar criteria, insulin-degrading enzyme was ruled out as a candidate enzyme for endosomal proteolysis of glucagon. Lysosomal contamination was unlikely since all forms of cathepsin B in endosomes, i.e. the major 45-kDa inactive precursor as well as the lesser amounts of the 32- and 28-kDa active forms, were tightly bound to endosomal membranes. Furthermore the mature 29-kDa single-chain and 22-kDa heavy-chain forms of cathepsin L were undetectable in endosomes, although high levels of the 37-kDa proform were observed. Membrane association of the cathepsins B and D was not to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor since association was unaffected by mannose 6-phosphate and/or EDTA, thereby indicating a distinct endosomal receptor. Hence, a pool of active cathepsins B and D as well as a poorly defined tripeptidyl aminopeptidase is maintained in endosomes by selective membrane retention. These hydrolases degrade glucagon internalized into liver parenchyma early in endocytosis."

However the processes regulating its expression have not been characterized previously. We show that the gene encoding this protein, SNAP, is strongly activated by the Brn-3a POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family transcription factor. Expression of both Brn-3a and SNAP-25 increases when ND7 neuronal cells are induced to extend neurite processes by serum removal. Inhibition of Brn-3a expression in these cells inhibits SNAP-25 expression and abolishes the neurite outgrowth that normally occurs in response to serum removal.

Its 17 kDa subunits are highly conserved throughout evolution in both sequence and tertiary structure. Using site-directed mutagenesis we investigated the function of 8 amino acids (Lys16, Tyr56, Arg92, Thr98, Arg109, Asn119, Ser124, and Glu133) that are totally conserved among all nucleoside diphosphate kinases known to date. The mutant proteins all show decreased specific activity and support roles for these residues in catalysis, substrate binding, or both, as was previously proposed on the basis of the x-ray structure (Morera, S., Lascu, I., Dumas, C., LeBras, G., Briozzo, P., Veron, M., and Janin, J. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 459-467). Furthermore, residues Lys16, Arg109, and Asn 119 were identified to play important roles in conformational stability or subunit interactions. We show that Lys16 and Asn119 form a rigid structure that is important for enzymatic function and that Arg109, known to interact with the phosphate moiety of the substrate, also plays an important role in subunit association. The dual roles of Lys16, Arg109, and Asn119 in both substrate binding and subunit assembly provide further evidence for a functional coupling between catalytic activity and quaternary structure in nucleoside diphosphate kinase."

We characterized one of the peptidases of this system, oligopeptidase PepF, together with its structural gene. PepF hydrolyzed peptides containing between 7 and 17 amino acids with a rather wide specificity. It was purified to homogeneity. The N-terminal sequences of PepF and of peptides resulting from tryptic digestion of PepF were determined and used to design degenerate oligonucleotides which served to amplify a DNA fragment internal to pepF. This fragment was used as a probe to screen a lactococcal genomic library in Escherichia coli and to clone the entire gene pepF. The gene coded for a 70 kDa protein and was located on a 55-kilobase lactose-protease plasmid. A motif His-Glu-X-X-His, characteristic of metallopeptidases was evidenced. Two regions of PepF were found similar, first to a stretch of 43 amino acids around the zinc-binding site of several other peptidases, second to a stretch of 33 amino acids well conserved among creatine and arginine kinases. Preliminary results suggest the presence of a second copy of pepF."

Acid-producing parietal cells are derived from a multipotent stem cell that also gives rise to mucus-producing pit cells and pepsinogen- and intrinsic factor-producing zymogenic cells. We used nucleotides −1035 to +24 of the mouse H+/K+-ATPase β subunit gene (H+/K+-ATPase β subunit⁻1035 to⁺24) to examine the consequences of expressing simian virus 40 T antigen (SV40 TAg) in the normally rare, nonproliferating, short-lived pre-parietal cell progenitor. Light and electron microscopic morphologic studies plus multilabel immunohistochemical analyses of postnatal day (P) 14-80-day transgenic mice revealed that SV40 TAg produces a 50-70-fold amplification of pre-parietal cells which become the predominant cell type in gastric units. Differentiation to mature parietal cells is blocked, resulting in hypochlorhydria and an associated systemic iron deficiency. SV40 TAg-induced pre-parietal proliferation is accompanied by apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1511698770,"Using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, the major sialic acid of the skin mucus of the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus was found to be 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid (KDN). We have subsequently devised a method to isolate a KDN-containing glycoprotein preparation from loach skin mucus. The method involves the sonication of the skin mucus with 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to solubilize the glycoprotein, followed by DE52-cellulose chromatography of the extract, Nuclease P1 treatment, and Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration. The purified glycoprotein preparation was found to contain 38.5% KDN, 0.4% NeuAc, 24.6% GalNAc, 3.3% Gal, and 28.2% amino acids (w/w). The amino acid composition of this glycoprotein preparation revealed that it is unusually rich in Thr, and 6 amino acids, Thr, Ser, Glu (or Gln), Pro, Gly and Ala, account for 83% of the total amino acids. This glycoprotein is extremely poor in Cys, Met, Tyr, Phe, Arg, and Trp. Treatment of this glycoprotein with alkali resulted in the destruction of 83% of Thr suggesting that most of the sugar chains in this glycoprotein are linked through Thr. Alkaline borohydride treatment of 100 mg of the glycoprotein preparation, followed by Sephadex G-25 (superfine) gel filtration, yielded two major oligosaccharide alditols, I (15.4 mg) and II (15.6 mg). Using liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry and methylation analysis, I was identified to be KDN alpha 2-->6GalNAc-ol and II, KDN alpha 2-->6(KDN alpha 2-->3)-GalNAc-o1. KDN alpha 2-->6GalNAc is structurally similar to NeuAc alpha 2-->GalNAc found in ovine submaxillary glycoprotein while II represents a novel structure which contains two sialic acids linked to a GalNAc through both alpha 2-->3 and alpha 2-->6 linkages. This structure has never been found in mucin type glycoproteins including mammalian epithelial mucin glycoproteins. This is the first report of the presence of a mucin type glycoprotein which contains KDN instead of NeuAc or NeuGc in fish skin mucus."

We have generated various base substitutions and internal deletions in and around DRE (nucleotide positions −93 to −100 with respect to the transcription initiation site) of the PCNA gene <i>in vitro</i> and subsequently examined their effects on the binding to DREF (DRE-binding factor) and PCNA gene promoter activity in cultured <i>Drosophila</i> Kc cells as well as in living flies. Gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts of Kc cells with and without competitor DNA fragments carrying the mutations indicated that the 10-bp sequence from positions −91 to −100 is essential for complex formation with DREF. Transient expression assays of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in Kc cells transfected with PCNA promoter-CAT fusion genes carrying the mutations revealed that the 8-bp sequence from −93 to −100 is essential for activation of the promoter in Kc cells. Examination of <i>lacZ</i> expression from PCNA promoter-<i>lacZ</i> fusion genes carrying the mutations, introduced into flies by germ-line transformation, revealed that the 8-bp sequence is also important for DRE function during development. However, we obtained two exceptional mutations in the 8-bp sequence that did not or only marginally affected the PCNA gene promoter activity in transgenic flies. Both of these mutations effectively reduced the promoter activity in CAT transient expression assay in Kc cells and the binding to DREF <i>in vitro</i>. Therefore, the 8-bp sequence requirement for DRE function appears to be less stringent in living flies than in the cultured cell or <i>in vitro</i> cases."
https://openalex.org/W1501446536,"Murine granzyme B (cytotoxic cell proteinase-1 (CCP1)) is a member of a family of seven serine proteases found in cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Evidence has suggested that it is involved in target cell DNA fragmentation during CTL-mediated cytotoxicity, although intracellular substrates for granzyme B have not yet been identified. The substrate specificity of granzyme B, requiring an aspartic acid residue at site P1, is unique among eukaryotic serine proteases and is shared with only one other known eukaryotic protease, interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE). ICE is responsible for processing pro-interleukin-1 beta to produce biologically active interleukin-1 beta and is itself synthesized as an inactive precursor. Recent evidence has suggested a role for ICE in programmed cell death, which led to a model for CTL-mediated cytotoxicity. In this proposal granzyme B activates ICE in the target cell by proteolytically processing the ICE precursor, resulting in active ICE heterodimer that induces apoptosis in the target cell. We have isolated the cDNA encoding murine ICE and generated in vitro translated ICE precursor. Using lysates from COS cells expressing granzyme B we show that ICE precursor is not a substrate for granzyme B and propose an alternate mechanism for CTL-mediated cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1586393492,"A baculovirus system was used to express full-length recombinant mouse thrombospondin 2 (rTSP2) as a disulfide-bonded homotrimer with an NH2 terminus beginning with Asp20.rTSP2, like TSP1, was more sensitive to trypsin digestion if depleted of calcium ion. The trypsin digestion pattern of rTSP2 and TSP1 differed in that trypsin cut between the first and second type 1 modules of rTSP2. For bovine aortic endothelial cells adhering to TSP-coated polystyrene plates, reduction after coating caused both TSPs to be much more adhesive; these adhesions were blocked completely by RGDS peptide or antibody to alpha v beta 3 integrin.rTSP2 and TSP1 also mediated the adhesion of HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells that carry alpha v beta 5 but not alpha v beta 3 integrin. Antibody to alpha v beta 5 did not inhibit adhesion of HT-29 cells to TSP1 or rTSP2. Rather, adhesion of HT-29 cells was decreased by treatment of TSPs with EDTA, abolished by reduction of the TSPs, and, in the case of rTSP2, blocked by heparin. Adhesion of MG63 cells to both TSPs was complex. Treatment with EDTA enhanced the adhesive activity of rTSP2 but decreased the adhesive activity of TSP1. These results show that TSP2 can be processed and secreted when overexpressed using baculovirus, TSP1 and rTSP2 differ in protease susceptibility in the type 1 module region, and TSP1 and rTSP2 mediate cell adhesion by complex and similar but not identical mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1592141517,"The AE1 (band 3) protein mediates the exchange of anions across the erythrocyte plasma membrane and, via association with the adapter molecule, ankyrin (Ank1), forms the major link between the membrane and the underlying spectrin cytoskeleton. The major kidney isoform of AE1 (kAE1), a protein that is otherwise identical to erythroid AE1 but lacks the NH2-terminal 79 amino acids, is localized to the basolateral plasma membrane of acid-secreting (alpha-type) intercalated cells of distal nephron. It has been proposed that this polarized distribution of kAE1 is due, at least in part, to its association with the ankyrin-spectrin cytoskeleton. In this study, we have used cell-free binding assays to investigate the interaction of anion exchangers with an Ank1 fragment, R13-H, that contains the AE1 binding site. Microsomes from cells expressing full-length erythroid AE1 bound 125I-labeled R13-H, revealing the presence of both high (Kd = 12.5 nM) and low (Kd = 166 nM) affinity sites. This binding was specific, as evidenced by the failure to observe high affinity binding of 125I-R13-H to microsomes from cells transfected with vector alone or with AE1m, a mutant lacking the approximately 400 amino acid NH2-terminal cytoplasmic ankyrin binding domain. Using this assay, we could detect no high affinity association between kAE1 and 125I-R13-H. We conclude that the NH2-terminal 79 amino acids play an essential role in high affinity and specific binding of AE1 to Ank1."

However, the cognate integrin for the RGD sequence in other cell types has not been identified. The existence of a second cell recognition site was suggested by Dedhar et al.(18Dedhar S. Jewell K. Rojiani M. Gray V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18908-18914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that entactin was recognized by the integrin receptor α3β1. This integrin receptor, however, does not interact with the RGD sequence, and the location of its binding site on entactin was not determined. We describe in this communication the identification of a potential second cell-binding site on entactin and putative receptors for both the RGD sequence and the newly identified binding site using human melanoma M21 and mouse mammary tumor (MMT) cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSMutagenesisThe RGD sequence of entactin is located at amino acid residues 672-674(17Durkin M.E. Chakravarti S. Bartos B.B. Liu S.-H. Friedman R.L. Chung A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2749-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Two mutations were made within these residues. In the entactinRGE mutant, the single amino acid change was made at residue 674 by replacing aspartic acid with glutamic acid (Asp → Glu). The mutagenic oligonucleotide was 5′-AGT CTG CCC CTC TCC TCG GAA-3′. The entactin▵RGE mutant was made with the oligonucleotide 5′-ATC ATA GCA AGT CTG CCC GAA GCC GAT GGA GCA TTC-3′ in which the nine nucleotides 5′-GTC TCC TCG-3′ complementary to nucleotides 2109-2117 (17Durkin M.E. Chakravarti S. Bartos B.B. Liu S.-H. Friedman R.L. Chung A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2749-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) encoding the the RGD tripeptide were omitted, resulting in deletion of the RGD sequence in this clone. The site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously(19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar). The Bluescript cDNA clone E663 containing nucleotides 1661-3520 of the entactin sequence was transformed into a dut-ung- Escherichia coli strain CJ236 (a gift from Dr. Duncan Groebe, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). The transformed CJ236 bacteria were grown in the presence of excess uracil in order to generate a uracil containing single-stranded DNA template. The exponentially growing bacteria were infected with the helper phage M13KO7 (Bio-Rad) at multiplicity of infection 20 to package the single-stranded phagemid DNA. After 1 h of infection, kanamycin was added to the culture medium, and incubation continued overnight. The phage particles were collected by polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation(20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1991: 8.0.3-8.2.5Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the level of the uracil incorporation into the single-stranded DNA, the titer of the phage preparation was determined on both CJ236 (dut- -) and JM109 (dut+ ung+) by following previously described procedures(21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar). A plaque ratio greater than or equal to 105-106 indicated adequate incorporation of uracil into the DNA templates(21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotides were first phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then annealed to the single-stranded templates over a period of 30 min. For the second strand synthesis, the oligonucleotide annealed to the template was extended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the ends were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The resultant heteroduplex was subsequently transformed into JM109 (dut+ ung+), and the mutants were screened by DNA sequence analysis using the dideoxy chain termination method(22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar).Construction of Recombinant Baculovirus Transfer VectorThe mutant forms of E663 (pE663-M) were sequentially restricted with SphI and HindIII to yield a 3.8-kilobase pair fragment that included the Bluescript vector sequences and a part of the entactin sequence that contained the mutation. This fragment was isolated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. An SphI-SacI fragment was removed from a previously described full-length cDNA clone of entactin (pEN) (23Tsao T. Hsieh J.-C. Durkin M.E. Wu C. Chakravarti S. Dong L.-J. Lewis M. Chung A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5188-5191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated to the 3.8-kilobase pair mutant fragment to generate a new vector (pE663-M-1). An NcoI-NcoI fragment of this new vector, which contained the mutated sequences, was isolated. This fragment was then used to replace the corresponding fragment in the recombinant baculovirus transfer vector pAcEn(23Tsao T. Hsieh J.-C. Durkin M.E. Wu C. Chakravarti S. Dong L.-J. Lewis M. Chung A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5188-5191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby generating pAcEn/RGD-M clones of pAcEn with modifications in the RGD sequence. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing as the final step for transfer vector construction.Expression of Mutant Entactin by Baculovirus Expression SystemSf9, Spodoptera frugiperda cells (2.5 X 106 were co-transfected with 12 μg of a 1:5 mixture of baculovirus DNA and the pAcEn/RGD-M. The procedures were as described by Tsao et al.(23Tsao T. Hsieh J.-C. Durkin M.E. Wu C. Chakravarti S. Dong L.-J. Lewis M. Chung A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5188-5191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that for the transfection, lipofectin was used instead of calcium phosphate(24Groebe D.R. Chung A.E. Ho C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After 7 days of culture, the culture media were collected and screened for the recombinant virus. Briefly, Sf9 cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates, and serially diluted virus was added to the wells. After 7 days of culture, the media were saved, and cells were lysed and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using a dot-blot apparatus(24Groebe D.R. Chung A.E. Ho C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The blots were then hybridized to a [32P]cDNA entactin probe. The media from positive clones were diluted and used for the next round of screening.Purification of Entactin and Its Mutant Forms from Sf9 CellsSf9 monolayers were infected with culture medium containing recombinant virus and grown for 3 days. Cells were then harvested and rinsed briefly in PBS containing protease inhibitors. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25% CHAPS in PBS, vortexed, and incubated on ice for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged, and the resulting pellet resuspended by vortexing in 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors. Entactin was extracted from the mixture by stirring overnight at 4°C. The insoluble materials were removed by centrifigation, and the supernatant solution was collected yielding partially purified entactin that was used for some experiment as indicated in the legends. Purified entactin was obtained from the partially purified sample by gel electrophoresis, as described previously(23Tsao T. Hsieh J.-C. Durkin M.E. Wu C. Chakravarti S. Dong L.-J. Lewis M. Chung A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5188-5191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing the purified entactin were pooled and dialyzed against 1 M urea in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) with 2 mM dithiothreitol. The purity of entactin and its mutant forms was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Each of the three forms of entactin yielded a single Coomassie Blue stained protein band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The bands had the expected molecular weights and were stained by anti-entactin antiserum (data not shown).Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant E Domains of Entactin as GST Fusion ProteinsA slightly modified form of the E domain containing residues 639-893 instead of residues 642-889 of entactin is here referred to as the wild-type E domain. The wild-type E domain, in which the RGD site remain unmodified, and two mutant forms with modifications within the RGD sequence were obtained as GST fusion proteins. These fusion proteins are designated GST-E, GST-ERGE, and GST-E▵RGE, which contain, respectively, the wild-type E domain, the E domain in which the RGD sequence was mutated to RGE, and the E domain in which the RGD sequence was deleted. This was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction with the specific oligonucleotide primers 5′-CAGGATCCAGAATCCATGCTACATT-3′ and 5′-CAGAATTCACTGTACTCAGACACGG-3′. cDNA clones pAcEn and pAcEn/RGD-M served as templates. The polymerase chain reaction products were gel-purified and digested with BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting DNA fragments were subcloned into the pGEX3X GST expression vector (25Hsieh J.-C. Wu C. Chung A.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) at the BamHI and EcoRI polylinker sites. The E. coli host strain DH5α, containing the three different GST-E constructions, were grown at 37°C to an A600 of 0.6-0.8. The expression of proteins was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (0.4 mM) at 37°C for 7 h. The bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation at 4°C and lysed on ice by incubation with lysozyme (1 mg/ml lysozyme buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mM EDTA) for 30 min in the presence of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting cell debris was further disrupted by a brief sonication on ice. A small volume of ice-cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 8.0)) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the cell lysate, which was subsequently vortexed at 4°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant solution was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size syringe filter unit. The filtrate was then mixed with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and incubated at 4°C, with gentle rocking, for 1 h. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed 5 times, each with 10 bed volumes of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma). The resulting eluate was then dialyzed against PBS at 4°C overnight to remove free glutathione. After the protein concentration was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm, the samples were aliquotted and stored at −70°C. The fusion proteins produced were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The three forms of the GST-E fusion proteins displayed, under reducing conditions, single Coomassie-stained bands with the expected molecular weight of 53,000 and were recognized by a polyclonal antibody against entactin (data not shown).Construction and Expression of the Domains of EntactinThe expression and isolation of GST-fusion proteins containing the G1, G2, and G3 domains of entactin were as described previously(25Hsieh J.-C. Wu C. Chung A.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These are here designated GST-G1, GST-G2, and GST-G3 to indicate that the domains are fused to GST.Expression of Subdomains of Entactin GST-G2In order to define more narrowly the peptide sequence responsible for the adhesive activity in the G2 domain of entactin, three subfragments of the G2 domain, GST-G2a, GST-G2b, and GST-G2ab were obtained as GST fusion proteins. GST-G2a contained amino residues 301-357 of entactin, which represents a short connecting peptide between G1 and the first EGF repeat of entactin. GST-G2b contained amino acid residues 358-396, a 39-amino acid peptide forming the first EGF repeat. GST-G2ab contained the amino acid residues 301-396. cDNA sequences encoding the above subfragments of the G2 domain were subcloned into the pGEX3X vector by polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotide primers. For clone G2a, the subcloning primers were 5′-CAGGATCCTCTCTCCTGGCTATGAG-3′ (a) and 5′CAGAATTCTGGGAACCT-GTGTTGTA-3′ (b); for G2b, they were 5′-CAGGATCCAGACTTGTGCCAACAAT-3′ (c) and 5′-CAGAATTCACGCACTGTCTGCCATT-3′ (d). Primers a and d were used to generate clone G2ab. The template for the subcloning was pEn(23Tsao T. Hsieh J.-C. Durkin M.E. Wu C. Chakravarti S. Dong L.-J. Lewis M. Chung A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5188-5191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of the polymerase chain reaction products and insertion into the expression vector as well as protein synthesis and purification were as described in a previous section. The DNA sequences of the three constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. The proteins produced were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a polyclonal antiserum to entactin (data not shown).Cell Adhesion Assay on Polyvinylidine Difluoride MembraneTo ensure that no major contaminating adhesive activities were present in the partially purified recombinant full-length entactin samples, a cell adhesion assay was performed on Immobilon membranes containing the partially purified entactin samples. Briefly, protein samples including unmodified entactin and mutant forms expressed in the baculovirus expression system, which were partially purified, were reduced and denatured in SDS sample buffer and run on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resulting protein bands were subsequently blotted onto a sheet of Immobilon membrane(26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar). The membrane was rinsed in PBS to remove SDS and to allow the proteins to renature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by overnight incubation at 4°C in a solution of 3% bovine serum albumin. This membrane was then used as the substrate for cell adhesion. M21 cells (a gift from Dr. David Cheresh, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) at 90% confluence were detached by a brief treatment with 5 mM EDTA in PBS. Cells, 5 X 105 in 15 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, were incubated with the membrane at 37°C for 1 h and then washed 5 times, each for 5 min with gentle agitation, with PBS prewarmed to 37°C. Attached cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. The membrane was washed in PBS and stained with 1% Amido Black. After destaining in 90% methanol, 2% acetic acid, the membrane was air-dried and examined for the pattern of adherent cells under a stereo microscope.Cell Adhesion Assay in Petri DishesIn order to compare the adhesive activities of the various forms and domains of entactin, the concentrations of the recombinant proteins were adjusted to the same molarity as determined from their sizes and optical densities at 280 nm. The proteins were coated onto 35-mm Petri dishes (Fisher) as described previously(13Chakravarti S. Tam M.F. Chung A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the Petri dishes were precoated with a thin layer of nitrocellulose. Proteins were diluted to the desired concentrations and loaded onto the dishes in a volume of 200 μl. The protein solutions were spread manually over the entire surface of the dishes and allowed to dry at room temperature. The dishes were washed with PBS 3 times and blocked in a 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS solution at 4°C overnight.Cells at 70% confluence were metabolically labeled with [3H]thymidine 24 h before the experiment. Labeled cells at approximately 90% confluence were detached either by 5 mM EDTA (M21 cells) or by trypsinizing (MMT cells, ATCC, Rockville, MD). Approximately 2 X 105 cells were loaded into each dish and then incubated at 37°C for 1-2 h. Unattached cells were removed by rinsing 3-5 times with PBS. Those remaining attached were collected by trypsinizing and quantitated by determination of radioactivity.Anti-integrin AntibodiesAnti-integrin antibodies were the generous gifts of Dr. David Cheresh (anti-αvβ3) and Dr. Elizabeth Wayner (anti-α3, anti-β1, anti-αvβ5, and αvβ3).Inhibition of Cell Attachment by Anti-integrin AntibodiesThe effects of a panel of anti-integrin antibodies on the attachment of cells to entactin and its domains were determined. 3H-Labeled cells were incubated with different mAbs at certain dilutions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium at 4°C for 1 h. The treated cells together with the medium containing the mAbs were transfered to protein-coated dishes for further incubation at 37°C to determine the effects of the antibodies on cell attachment, measured as described above.RESULTSAttachment of Human Melanoma M21 Cells to Recombinant Entactin and Its RGD-modified FormsMutant forms of recombinant entactin were tested for their potency in promoting the attachment of human melanoma M21 cells. In these initial qualitative experiments, M21 cells were allowed to bind directly to the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted unto an Immobilon membrane. Deletion of the RGD sequence (entactin▵RGE) or replacing the aspartate residue with glutamate (entactinRGE) resulted in a marked decrease in cell attachment as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1(lanes 2 and 3) when compared with the unmodified entactin (lane 1). The corresponding Coomassie-stained bands in the upper panel indicate that a comparable amount of each protein was used for the cell attachment assay. These results indicated that the RGD sequence was a major contributor to the cell attachment activity of entactin. However, the residual attachment to the modified forms of entactin suggested additional attachment sites.Assessment of the Binding of M21 Cells to RGD-modified EntactinThe attachment of M21 cells to entactin and its modified forms was quantitatively assayed. In these experiments the three forms of entactin were purified by preparative electrophoresis and loaded on nitrocellulose-coated dishes at varying concentrations. The results shown in Fig. 2A clearly demonstrate that deletion or modification of the RGD sequence resulted in approximately 50% reduction of cell attachment activity, confirming the earlier results that additional non-RGD-dependent binding site(s) were retained in entactin. Further examination of the cells attached to entactin and its mutant forms revealed that the morphology of the cells was altered by the nature of the substrate (Fig. 3). Cells attached to the unmodified entactin had a typical flattened spindle or polygonal shape (panel A); however, those cells attached to entactinRGE (panel B) or entactin▵RGE (panel C) were rounded but firmly adherent. The results indicate that the attachment sites mediate different cell responses, engagement of the RGD sequence modifies the cytoskeleton to yield a flattened morphology, while the other site(s) elicits a different response.Figure 2:Mutations in the RGD site of entactin do not completely abolish the cell attachment function of the molecule. Purified entactin, entactinRGE, and entactin▵RGE were used to coat 35-mm Petri dishes at concentrations ranging from 0 to 40 μg/dish. M21 cells were allowed to attach to the precoated dishes in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mM MnCl2 for 2 h at 37°C. The data (panel A) are expressed as a percent of cells added to each dish that remain attached, and represent means of triplicates from a single experiment. This experiment, however, was done 3 times independently with two different preparations of proteins. The results from each individual experiment were consistent. The gel electrophoretic pattern of entactin (lanes 1 and 4), entactinRGE (lanes 2 and 5), and entactin▵RGE (lanes 3 and 6) in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE are shown in panel B. Lanes 1-3 contain partially purified samples, and lanes 4-6 contain the purified samples. The purification procedures are described in detail under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in the figure, entactin and its modified forms had similar electrophoretic mobility with a molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:The RGD sequence in entactin mediates cell spreading. Phase contrast micrographs of M21 cells attached to entactin (A), entactinRGE (B), entactin▵RGE (C) are shown. M21 cells were allowed to attach to the proteins under the same conditions as in Fig. 2. At the end of incubation, dishes were washed, and cells that remain attached were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS and photographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Localization of the Cell Attachment Sites in EntactinThe cell attachment domains and sites in entactin were further examined by construction of GST fusion proteins containing each of the major domains, G1, G2, E, and G3 of entactin.The E Domain of EntactinThe E domain of entactin, amino acid residues 639-893, contains cysteine-rich EGF repeats 2-5. RGD, a major cell binding sequence in entactin, is located in repeat 2. GST-fusion proteins containing the E domain (GST-E), the E domain in which the RGD sequence was changed by site directed mutagenesis to RGE (GST-ERGE), and the E domain in which the RGD sequence was deleted (GST-E▵RGE) were synthesized in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. These fusion proteins were used to determine if the E domain contained cell attachment sites in addition to the RGD sequence. The data presented in Fig. 4 show that GST-E supported cell attachment; however, modification or deletion of the RGD sequence in the E domain in this fusion protein totally abolished the promotion of M21 cell attachment. The level of attachment to these altered fusion proteins was similar to that of the bovine serum albumin and GST controls and was independent of the assay time allowed for cell attachment (panel A) or concentration of f"

The biosynthesis of functional tRNAs involves a series of post-transcriptional events, including maturation and modification processes. Several dozen tRNA modifications have already been described (Sprinzl et al., 1989Sprinzl M. Hartmann T. Weber J. Blank J. Zeidler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: r1-r172Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Although the role of most modifications remains unknown, some of them are involved in the recognition by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Muramatsu et al., 1988Muramatsu T. Nishikawa K. Nemoto F.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Maturation events include the processing of the 5′ and 3′ ends of pre-tRNAs in all organisms as well as pre-tRNA splicing and editing in eukaryotes (see Deutscher, 1990Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar for a review on the processing of the 3′ end). The 5′ maturation of tRNAs depends on the action of a single and ubiquitous enzyme, RNase P (see Altman, 1989Altman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

In Escherichia coli, this enzyme (EC 3.1.16.5) is composed of a 377-base RNA moiety (M1 RNA) and of a 14-kDa protein subunit (C5 protein) encoded by the rnpB and rnpA genes, respectively. Although both genes are essential in vivo, the RNA moiety is active in vitro in the absence of the C5 protein (Guerrier-Takada et al., 1983Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). The regions of immature tRNAs influencing RNase P recognition are the acceptor stem, the CCA end, and the T-stem and loop (Carrara et al., 1989Carrara G. Calandra P. Fruscoloni P. Doria M.

The position of cleavage of a pre-tRNA by RNase P is directed by the occurrence of a G at position +1 of the mature tRNA, as guiding nucleotide, and by the lengths of the acceptor and T-stems, which play the role of rulers setting the distance between this G and the T-loop. The absence of a G at position +1 and the modification of the length of the ruler were shown to cause aberrant cleavage of a pre-tRNA (Svärd and Kirsebom, 1992Svärd S.G. Kirsebom L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Svärd and Kirsebom, 1993Svärd S.G. Kirsebom L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the case of the maturation of E. coli tRNAHis and tRNASel, whose acceptor stems are one base pair longer, it was found that, in addition to the above determinants, the nature of base +73 was important for the kinetics of cleavage (Burkard et al., 1988Burkard U.

Biol. 1991; 217: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E. coli tRNAfMet is characterized by the absence of a G+1 and by the occurrence of a C+1/A+72 unpairing. However, the structural motifs enabling specific pre-tRNAfMet maturation have not yet been described. This work establishes that, in E. coli, a G at position −2 in the 5′-flanking sequence of pre-tRNAfMet compensates for the negative effect caused by the unusual C+1/A+72 unpairing on the maturation process. All chemicals were from Merck. Enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, except T4 DNA ligase, which was from Life Technologies, Inc. Buffers used were those indicated by the suppliers. E. coli isoleucyl-, leucyl-, lysyl-, methionyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetases and methionyl-tRNAfMet formyltransferase were from the laboratory's stock. Oligonucleotides (18-38-mers) were synthesized on a Pharmacia Gene Assembler and purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q, Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). tRNA numbering is as follows. (i) The first base in 5′ of the matured tRNA is base +1 and the last is base +76; (ii) the bases belonging to the 5′-flanking sequence are numbered from −1 to −9. Base −1 is located immediately upstream from base +1 (see Fig. 1). tRNA species are named as follows. (i) The nature of the 5′-flanking sequence is indicated immediately after the name of the tRNA; (ii) a mutated position in the sequence of a pre-tRNA is indicated by the substituting base followed by its position. For instance, tRNAZ1fMet (U-2) stands for a tRNAfMet in which the transcribed sequence upstream from base +1 is that of the metZ1 gene (see Fig. 1B) with position −2 replaced by a U (see Fig. 1B for the numbering of the positions upstream from base +1 in the case of the different sequences). The label “fasm” designates a tRNA that has been given the acceptor stem of tRNAfMet (see Guillon et al., 1992bGuillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar; Meinnel et al., 1993Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). tRNA1Ile, tRNA3Leu, tRNALys, tRNAmMet, tRNAfMet, and tRNA1Val genes and their derivatives were constructed by assembling six overlapping oligonucleotides as described (Meinnel et al., 1988Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). tRNA genes were ligated between the EcoRI and PstI sites of the pBSTNAV2 expression vector (Meinnel et al., 1992Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4741-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To modify the 5′-flanking sequence of pre-tRNAsfMet, a specialized shuttle vector, pBStRNANfMet, was constructed. This vector features (i) a deletion of the XhoI-SacII fragment of pBStRNALfMet (this deletion overlaps the lpp promoter, the 5′-flanking sequence and the nucleotides +1 and +2 of the tRNAfMet gene, see Fig. 1A) and (ii) a SmaI restriction site inserted between XhoI and SacII. To construct the different variants, six oligonucleotides corresponding to the lpp promoter and to the desired flanking sequence (see Fig. 1A) were ligated together and cloned between the XhoI and SacII restriction sites of pBStRNANfMet. The sequence of the six oligonucleotides and of several sequences introduced upstream from base +1 are shown in Fig. 1. tRNA gene sequences were verified by dideoxy-sequencing of single-stranded DNA obtained by using the R-408 helper phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The XhoI-BamHI fragment of pBStRNALfMet was also cloned between the SalI and BamHI sites of vector pUC19, yielding pUCtRNALfMet. In addition, the XhoI-HindIII fragment of pBStRNALfMet was cloned between the SalI and HindIII sites of vector pBR322, yielding pBRtRNALfMet. Freshly transformed bacteria were grown for 20 h at 37°C in 1 liter of 2 x TY medium containing 50 mg of ampicillin. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 8.5 ml of buffer A (1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM magnesium acetate). 10 ml of phenol previously saturated with buffer A were added, and the tube was vigorously shaken for 30 s. The mixture was then centrifuged for 1 h at 12,000 rpm at 20°C (JA17 rotor; Beckman). Thereafter, the aqueous phase was collected and ethanol-precipitated. The precipitate was resuspended in 4 ml of 1 M NaCl and spun for 30 min at 10,000 rpm in a JA17 rotor. The supernatant was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 4 ml of 2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8) and left for 2 h at 37°C. After ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in 2 ml H2O. Usually, 30-50% of such RNA preparations corresponded to the overproduced tRNA, i.e. bulk tRNA preparations accepted 500-800 pmol of amino acid/A260 unit. tRNA variants were further purified on a Q-Sepharose column (1.6 x 20 cm; Pharmacia). The tRNA extract in 10 ml of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 8 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl) was loaded onto the column previously equilibrated in the same buffer; thereafter, a 0.36-0.48 M NaCl gradient in buffer B (2.5 ml/min; 0.10 M/h) separated the tRNAs. Collected fractions were assayed for tRNA by measuring the incorporation of a radioactive amino acid (Meinnel et al., 1993Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Formylation assays were as described previously (Blanquet et al., 1984Blanquet S. Dessen P. Kahn D. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; Guillon et al., 1992bGuillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fractions of interest were then pooled and ethanol precipitated. The pellet was redissolved in 0.2 ml of H2O and stored at −20°C. 10-20 mg of pure tRNA were routinely recovered from a 1-liter culture. Amino acid acceptances of the final tRNA preparations ranged from 1,350 to 1,650 pmol/A260 unit. The rnpA region was amplified from chromosome DNA of strain K37 (Miller and Friedman, 1980Miller H.I. Friedman D.I. Cell. 1980; 20: 711-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with the help of two oligonucleotides bordering the rnpA gene. The first one, 5′-CGTTCTCACGGGATCCGTGCTCGT created a BamHI restriction site at the 5′ side of the gene. The second one, 5′-TCAATTCCGTATCTAGAACAGGTTG introduced a XbaI restriction site at the 3′ end of the gene. The 570-base pair amplified fragment was then restricted in the presence of BamHI and XbaI and introduced within pUC18 under the control of the lac promoter, yielding pUCrnpA. The nucleotide sequence of the resulting rnpA gene was verified. In contrast to control plasmid pUC18, pUCrnpA relieved the thermosensitivity of strain N2020 (rnpA49,trpA36,argA52,glyA34, rpsL,lacZ,ValR) (a kind gift of B. Bachmann, Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT; see also Schedl and Primakoff, 1973Schedl P. Primakoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar for the description of the rnpA49 allele) as measured at 44°C on LB plates supplemented with 0.5 mM isoproyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. rnpB was amplified by using the following two oligonucleotides. The first one, 5′-CGATTGGAATTCGCAACGCGG, was complementary to a sequence located just upstream from the −35 region of the promoter of the rnpB gene and created an EcoRI restriction site. The second oligonucleotide, 5′-TGAAACTGATGGCAACCGCAAAAATGC, was complementary to a region located immediately after the StuI restriction site downstream to the rnpB gene. The DNA of λ515 (a kind gift of O. Fayet, LMGM, Toulouse, France), a bacteriophage of the Kohara library (Kohara et al., 1987Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), which contains a single copy of the rnpB gene (Komine and Inokuchi, 1991Komine Y. Inokuchi H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1813-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was chosen as template. The 950-base pair amplified fragment was then hydrolyzed in the presence of EcoRI and StuI and cloned within the EcoRI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript SK+, yielding pBSrnpB. The whole sequence of the rnpB gene was verified. In contrast to pBluescript SK+, pBSrnpB allowed strain N2020, which has a rnpA(Ts) phenotype (see above), to grow at 44°C on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Since an excess of wild-type M1 RNA is able to cure the effect of the rnpA49 mutation (Motamedi et al., 1984Motamedi H. Lee Y. Schmidt F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3959-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this experiment demonstrated that vector pBSrnpB indeed overexpressed this RNA. To construct a pUC derivative overexpressing both the C5 protein and the M1 RNA, the XbaI-SalI fragment of pBSrnpB, which has the rnpB gene under the control of its own promoter, was cloned between the same sites of pUCrnpA, yielding pUCrnpAB. This vector was able to complement the N2020 strain at 44°C. Finally, the SphI-NdeI fragment of pUCtRNALfMet, which contains the tRNALfMet gene under the control of the lpp promoter (see above) was cloned in pUCrnpAB, yielding pUCrnpABtRNALfMet. This vector overexpressed the M1 RNA and C5 protein components of RNase P as well as tRNALfMet (see Fig. 2). tRNA (0.25-0.5 pmol in 0.5-1 μl) was mixed with 5 μl of a denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea, 10 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol. The mixture was boiled for 1 min, chilled on ice, and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing sequencing gel (0.8-mm thickness, 50-cm length) previously preheated at 50°C. After a 3-h run at 1,500 V, the part of the gel containing tRNA was soaked for 30 min in 0.1 mg/liter ethidium bromide. Gel stainings were recorded with an imager (Appligene). Reverse images were stored on disk (TIFF format) and further processed with Image software (version 1.49, Macintosh). 1 μg of DNA from plasmid pBStRNALfMet was incubated for 15 min at 37°C with 4 units of E. coli RNA polymerase for in vitro transcription in the conditions indicated by the supplier (Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 mM EDTA, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. For primer extension analysis (see Lévque et al., 1991Lévque F. Gazeau M. Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7903-7910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, the 31-mer oligonucleotide 5′-GTGGTTGCGGGGGCCGGATTTGAACCGACGA-3′, corresponding to the sequence starting 47 bases downstream from the EcoRI restriction site located just before the first base (+1) of the tRNA, was used (Fig. 1). Two picomoles of this oligonucleotide were 5′-labeled with 0.37 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml and 111 MBq/mmol; DuPont NEN). The 32P-labeled extension products were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. A nucleotide sequence performed with the same oligonucleotide as primer and pBStRNALfMet double-stranded DNA as the template was run in parallel. Derivatives of the pGFIB plasmid, a vector allowing overexpression downstream to the lpp promoter (Masson and Miller, 1986Masson J.-M. Miller J.H. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 47: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), have been successfully used in the course of producing many wild-type or mutant tRNAs in E. coli cells (see for instance Meinnel et al., 1988Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Meinnel et al., 1992Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4741-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Meinnel et al., 1993Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and Normanly et al., 1986Normanly J. Ogden R.C. Horvath S.J. Abelson J. Nature. 1986; 321: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the case of pBSTNAV2, the tRNA genes could be inserted between the EcoRI and PstI sites (Meinnel et al., 1988Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 1992). Transcription was likely to start 3 nucleotides upstream from the EcoRI site (Fig. 1A) and to stop immediately downstream to the PstI site at the rrnC transcription terminator. It is noteworthy that a vector expressing tRNA species with an EcoRI site at the same position was used in several studies dealing with the enzymatic properties of RNase P (see the pAT derivatives used in Guerrier-Takada and Altman, 1993Guerrier-Takada C. Altman S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7152-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and McClain et al., 1987McClain W.H. Guerrier-Takada C. Altman S. Science. 1987; 238: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The extent of E. coli tRNAfMet overexpression from vector pBSTNAV was of the order of that routinely observed with other tRNAs, i.e. methionine acceptance of the crude tRNA extract was of about 600 pmol/A260 unit. The overproduced tRNA species was easily purified by anion-exchange chromatography, and pure species could be obtained, as estimated by the measurement of the formylmethionine acceptance (1, 650 pmol/A260 unit). However, upon analysis by denaturing PAGE, 5′-labeled tRNAfMet reproducibly showed two major bands. The same two bands could be detected by ethidium bromide staining, while only one band was observed with either tRNA1Ile, tRNA3Leu, tRNALys, tRNAmMet, or tRNA1Val prepared with the same method (Fig. 3). Large amounts of the two tRNAfMet subspecies were prepared by PAGE.1( 1The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. )Surprisingly, both species shared the same Michaelis-Menten parameters in the reactions catalyzed by E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase or methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (data not shown). According to enzymatic RNA sequencing (Kuchino and Nishimura, 1989Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and analysis of the modified nucleosides (Kuchino et al., 1987Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), both tRNA species had the expected sequence and modifications (data not shown). Sequencing was also monitored by means of reverse transcriptase (Hahn et al., 1989Hahn C.S. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to solve the last bases at the 5′ side (data not shown). The most rapidly migrating species had the correct 5′-sequence, while the other one showed a 5′ extension of 3 bases, 5′-UUC-3′. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The additional -3UUC-1 trinucleotide, which matched the sequence of the EcoRI restriction site at the 5′ side of the tRNA gene (see Fig. 1B), could result from an alternative transcription start point at the level of base U-3. To probe this idea, pre-tRNAfMet was transcribed in vitro by using pBStRNALfMet as the template. Its 5′ end was mapped by a primer extension experiment (Fig. 4). A single start (G-9), which exactly corresponded to that of the natural lpp promoter (Nakamura and Inouye, 1979Nakamura K. Inouye M. Cell. 1979; 18: 1109-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), was found. This demonstrated that the expected homogeneous pre-tRNA was actually produced, at least in vitro. A second possibility was that the produced pre-tRNAfMet was not a specific and/or efficient substrate of RNase P. Aberrant cleavage sites of several other pre-tRNAs have already been observed in vitro. However, the immature longer tRNAs were believed to still be substrates of RNase P (Burkard et al., 1988Burkard U. Willis I. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Kirsebom and Svärd, 1992Kirsebom L.A. Svärd S.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Kirsebom and Svärd, 1993Kirsebom L.A. Svärd S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To probe whether an increase of RNase P concentration could improve the extent of 5′ maturation of tRNAfMet, the two components of RNase P as well as tRNAfMet under the control of the lpp promoter were overexpressed from pUCrnpAB-tRNALfMet (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2 for details of the construction). The extent of tRNAfMet overproduction in JM101Tr cells from pUCrnpAB-tRNALfMet was identical to that from pBStRNALfMet (600 pmol/A260 unit) but smaller than that obtained from pUCtRNALfMet (800 pmol/A260 unit). Comparison by PAGE analysis of each purified tRNAfMet showed that the immature tRNAfMet no longer accumulated when RNase P was overexpressed (Fig. 5). Clearly, the extended tRNAsfMet could be recognized and cleaved by RNase P. This experiment suggested that, reciprocally, the relative extent of maturation of pre-tRNALfMetin vivo might be improved, provided its expression was lowered. tRNAfMet was therefore expressed under the control of the lpp promoter from pBR322, a lower copy number plasmid than pBSTNAV2. The relative amount of tRNAfMet in a crude tRNA extract obtained from cells harboring plasmid pBRtRNAfMet corresponded to 120 pmol/A260 unit, as compared to 30 pmol/A260 in the case of the control pBR322 plasmid. tRNAfMet originating from pBRtRNALfMet was nearly fully matured. However, a minor species containing one additional base was still observed (Fig. 5). This result also favored the idea that the relative intracellular concentrations of pre-tRNAfMet and of RNase P influenced the extent of maturation of tRNAfMet. To know whether immature tRNAfMet could also be detected in non-overproducing cells, a crude tRNA extract was prepared from strain JM101Tr, analyzed by PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific for tRNAfMet. A single band was observed on the autoradiography (data not shown), thus establishing that immature tRNAfMet did not accumulate under physiological conditions. Because the other tRNAs studied under identical conditions (Fig. 3) were correctly matured, the cause of the defect of maturation of tRNAfMet had to be searched in its nucleotide sequence. The sequence of the acceptor stem of the pre-tRNA, which plays a role in the processing by RNase P (see references in the Introduction), could be suspected. Four tRNA chimeras expressed from pBStRNA were therefore studied. All four tRNAs shared the acceptor stem of tRNAfMet in common, but the rest of the nucleotide sequence was that of tRNAMet, tRNA1Val, tRNA1Ile, or tRNA3Leu. In each case, a defect in maturation similar to that observed with tRNAfMet was obtained (Fig. 3). Because the acceptor stem of tRNAfMet has the 1-72 unpairing as special feature, the genes of tRNAmMet and tRNA1Val were given the C+1/A+72 pair of tRNAfMet. The resulting tRNA species exhibited a defect in maturation (Fig. 3). In a second set of experiments, all 16 possible combinations of bases were created at positions +1 and +72 of the tRNAfMet gene carried by vector pBStRNALfMet. In each case, the extent of overexpression was similar to that measured with wild-type tRNAfMet. However, full maturation could only be observed when a base pairing had been created between base +1 and base +72 (CG, AU, GC, GU, UA, and UG), or when a G occurred at either position (AG, GG, or GA) (Fig. 6). tRNAfMet species with 5′-extensions of 2 or 3 bases occurred in the other cases (CA, CC, CU, AA, AC, UC, UU). Notice that the extent of processing was particularly reduced in the case of the variants with CU, UC, or UU. In the case of the UC variant, a species with a deletion of base +1 was also produced (Fig. 6). The availability of a system measuring the extent of tRNA maturation allowed us to search for the motifs ensuring the most efficient processing of tRNAfMetin vivo. In particular, since the 5′-flanking sequence proved important in the maturation of several pre-tRNA species, changes were carried out in the 5′-flanking sequence of pre-tRNAfMet. In E. coli, four tRNAfMet genes (metY, metZ1, metZ2, and metZ3) occur, with three different 5′-flanking sequences (the two genes metZ2 and metZ3 share the same sequence; Ishii et al., 1984Ishii S. Kuroki K. Imamoto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar; Kenri et al., 1994Kenri T. Imamoto F. Kano Y. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 261-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We first substituted the 5′-flanking sequence in pBStRNALfMet (called L) by each of the three wild-type sequences, yielding pBStRNAYfMet, pBStRNAZ1fMet, and pBStRNAZ2fMet (see the sequences of the corresponding constructions in Fig. 1B). In each case, a fully homogeneous mature tRNA was produced. Clearly, the extent of maturation did not depend on the length of the introduced 5′-flanking sequence, since full processing occurred similarly with 5 (Z1), 8 (Y), or 9 (Z2) additional bases. To evidence, if any, the nucleotide(s) favoring the in vivo maturation of tRNAfMet, bases −5 to −1 in the Y sequence were systematically substituted by those found in the L sequence (A-5, A-4, U-3, U-2, or C-1). Analysis of the corresponding tRNAfMet (Fig. 7A) showed that an incomplete maturation occurred only upon the substitution of base G-2 by U. The same conclusion could be reached in the context of the Z1 sequence. We also substituted base G-2 of the Y and Z1 sequences by a C. Incomplete maturation was observed in either case. However, when an A was introduced at position −2 of the Y, Z1, or Z2 sequences, full processing occurred. Clearly, a pyrimidine at position −2 disfavored the maturation. To further evidence the role of the 5′-flanking bases in the maturation process, each of the first 6 bases of the L sequence (bases −1 to −6) were systematically substituted by the corresponding ones of Y. The resulting tRNAs are shown in Fig. 7B. Full maturation could only be obtained upon replacement of base −2 by a G or of base A-4 by a C. Incomplete maturation still occurred with an A-2, or with G or U at position −4. Clearly, base G-2 appeared to be of utmost importance for the maturation. Interestingly, this base is the only one that is conserved in the 5′-flanking sequences of all E. coli tRNAfMet genes. One possibility to explain the importance of G-2 was that it could pair with C74 of pre-tRNAfMet, compensating thereby for the atypical 1-72 pair. To probe thi"

The Michaelis constant (Km) for protoporphyrinogen IX was 0.1 microM. Due to the high affinity of the enzyme toward oxygen, the Km for oxygen could only be approximated to 0.5-1.5 microM. The purified enzyme contained a flavin as cofactor. Studies with rabbit antibodies to yeast protoporphyrinogen oxidase showed that the enzyme is synthesized as a high molecular weight precursor (58 kDa) that is rapidly converted in vivo to the mature (55 kDa) membrane-bound form. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity was found only in purified yeast mitochondrial inner membrane (not in the outer membrane). Acifluorfen-methyl, a potent diphenylether-type herbicide, competitively inhibited the purified enzyme (Ki = 10 nM). The mixed inhibition by acifluorfen-methyl previously reported for the membrane-bound protoporphyrinogen oxidase (Camadro, J.M., Matringe, M., Scalla, R., and Labbe, P. (1991) Biochem.

VACVase was a basic (pI 9.4) protein associated with mitochondria. It was monomeric and had a molecular mass of 29 kDa. Amino acid sequences of six VACVase peptides, including its NH2 terminus (13 amino acids) and accounting for approximately 20% of its complete sequence, were not found in the SwissProt protein data base. VACVase hydrolyzed other amino acid esters of acyclovir in addition to valaciclovir (kcat/Km = 58 mM-1 s-1), with a preference for the L-alanyl (kcat/Km = 226 mM-1 s-1) and L-methionyl (kcat/Km = 200 mM-1 s-1) esters. It did not hydrolyze other types of esters or numerous di- and tripeptides and aminoacyl-β-naphthylamides. Hydrolysis of valaciclovir by VACVase was not inhibited by amastatin, antipain, aprotinin, bestatin, chymostatin, E-64, EDTA, ebelactone A, ebelactone B, elastatinal, leupeptin, pepstatin, or phosphoramidon. It was neither inhibited nor activated by Ca2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+. Therefore, this enzyme is not a typical esterase or peptidase and, to our knowledge, it has not been described previously. Its physiological function is not known; however, it may play a significant role in the biotransformation of valaciclovir to acyclovir.

Valaciclovir (VACV, VALTREXTM)1( 1The abbreviations used are: VACVvalaciclovirACVacyclovirVACVasevalaciclovir hydrolaseE-64N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxiran-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]-agmatineLys-CAchromobacter proteasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. )(Fig. 1), the L-valyl ester prodrug of acyclovir (ACV, ZOVIRAX®), is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment and suppression of herpesvirus infections. Of the many potential ACV prodrugs that have been evaluated, VACV is the one that has enhanced the oral bioavailability of ACV while retaining the excellent safety profile of ACV (for reviews, see Refs. 1Beauchamp L.M. Krenitsky T.A. Drugs Future. 1993; 18: 619-628Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar and 2Crooks T.J. Murray A. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1994; 5: 31-37Google Scholar). The 3-5-fold higher ACV bioavailability attained with oral VACV (1000 to 2000 mg, four times daily) compared to oral ACV (800 mg, five times daily) (3Weller S. Blum M.R. Doucette M. Burnette T. Cederberg D.M. de Miranda P. Smiley M.L. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 54: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) points to the potential for more convenient dosing regimens and for improved efficacy against the less sensitive herpesviruses, particularly varicella-zoster virus and cytomegalovirus. Preliminary reports on clinical trials with VACV indicate that these benefits may be realized (Ref. 2Crooks T.J. Murray A. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1994; 5: 31-37Google Scholar and references therein). valaciclovir acyclovir valaciclovir hydrolase N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxiran-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]-agmatine Achromobacter protease polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. VACV is well absorbed and rapidly and extensively converted to ACV in humans(3Weller S. Blum M.R. Doucette M. Burnette T. Cederberg D.M. de Miranda P. Smiley M.L. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 54: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), monkeys(4de Miranda P. Burnette T.C. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1994; 22: 55-59PubMed Google Scholar), rats(5Burnette T.C. de Miranda P.

Sehmbhi, unpublished data. )In these species, the plasma levels of ACV provided by oral VACV are at least 10-fold higher and its half-lives at least 2-fold longer than those of the prodrug itself. Although the hydrolysis of VACV to ACV and L-valine (Fig. 1) can occur chemically or enzymatically, the latter is the primary mode in vivo(5Burnette T.C. de Miranda P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1994; 22: 60-64PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beauchamp L.M. Orr G.F. de Miranda P. Burnette T. Krenitsky T.A. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1992; 3: 157-164Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and presystemic metabolism contributes significantly to this biotransformation(4de Miranda P. Burnette T.C. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1994; 22: 55-59PubMed Google Scholar, 5Burnette T.C. de Miranda P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1994; 22: 60-64PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretically, any number of esterases and/or proteases could mediate the hydrolysis of this amino acid ester; however, we have found that a potentially novel enzyme may be primarily responsible for its conversion to ACV. The purification and characterization of this VACV-hydrolyzing enzyme, VACV hydrolase (VACVase), from rat liver are described herein. Preliminary reports of these studies appear elsewhere(7Burnette T.C. de Miranda P. Antiviral Res. 1993; 20: 115PubMed Google Scholar, 8de Miranda P. Burnette T.C. Smith C. Harrington J. Reardon J. Zimmerman T. Progr. Abstr. 34th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., Abstr. A70. 1994; Google Scholar). Esters of ACV were synthesized at the Wellcome Research Laboratories. Amino acid esters of ACV were prepared as hydrochloride salts(6Beauchamp L.M. Orr G.F. de Miranda P. Burnette T. Krenitsky T.A. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1992; 3: 157-164Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). PBE 118 and Pharmalyte 8-10.5 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was from Bio-Rad. The following enzymes were from Sigma: alanine aminopeptidase from bovine intestinal mucosa; cytosolic leucine aminopeptidase from porcine kidney (Type III-CP) (EC 3.4.11.1); microsomal leucine aminopeptidase from porcine kidney (Type IV-S) (EC 3.4.11.2); carboxypeptidase A from bovine pancreas (Type II) (EC 3.4.17.1); carboxypeptidase B from porcine pancreas (Type I) (EC 3.4.17.2); cathepsin B from bovine spleen (EC 3.4.22.1); cathepsin C from bovine spleen (EC 3.4.14.1); cathepsin D from bovine spleen (EC 3.4.23.5); cathepsin G from human leukocytes (EC 3.4.21.20); α-chymotrypsin from bovine pancreas (Type I-S) (EC 3.4.21.1); trypsin from bovine pancreas (Type III) (EC 3.4.21.4); elastase from porcine pancreas (Type IV) (EC 3.4.21.36) and from human leukocytes (EC 3.4.21.37); esterase from porcine liver (EC 3.1.1.1); and lipase from porcine pancreas (Type VI-S) (EC 3.1.1.3). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using Pierce's Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin standards or by amino acid analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli(10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). VACV at a final concentration of 400 μM was incubated with enzyme for 15 min at 25°C in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was stopped by adding cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (0.25 ml) to the reaction mixture (0.5 ml). The quenched reaction mixture was centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C), and an aliquot (20 μl) of the supernatant was applied to an Adsorbosphere C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 mm × 25 cm; Alltech Associates/Applied Science, Avondale, PA). The sample was eluted from the column isocratically with 8% acetonitrile in 100 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.5, containing 0.1% triethylamine at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 15 min or by a linear gradient generated with 2-4% acetonitrile in 100 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.5, containing 0.1% triethylamine (mobile phase A) and 80% acetonitrile (mobile phase B) over 20 min. The UV absorbance of the column effluent was monitored at 254 nm. The product concentration was calculated from the initial substrate concentration and the fractional conversion to product corrected for chemical hydrolysis. One unit of activity was defined as the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate/min. All steps were performed at 4°C, unless otherwise stated. All buffers contained 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Perfused livers (21 g) from male CD rats were homogenized in 5 volumes of 0.25 M sucrose. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged (25,000 × g, 10 min). The pellet was resuspended in 3 volumes of 0.25 M sucrose and frozen at −80°C. After the mixture was thawed at room temperature, it was adjusted to 0.5 M NaCl and 10 mM potassium phosphate by addition of 4 M NaCl and 1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, vortexed vigorously at 1-min intervals for 30 min, and then centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h). The supernatant was decanted and stored on ice. An equal volume of 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), containing 0.5 M NaCl was added to the pellet, and the mixture was again vortexed and centrifuged. The supernatants were combined, dialyzed overnight against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (Buffer B), and then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 33 cm) equilibrated with Buffer B. The sample was eluted with Buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions containing activity, fractions 5-23 (15 ml each), were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (50-90% saturation). The precipitate was dissolved in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 (Buffer C), and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The sample was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1.5 × 9.5 cm) equilibrated in Buffer C and was eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient from 10 to 250 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The active fractions, fractions 36-44 (3 ml each), were dialyzed overnight against 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.5 (Buffer D), and then applied in four aliquots to a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in Buffer D. Each aliquot was eluted with a 2.5-ml linear gradient from 0 to 45 mM KCl in Buffer D followed by a 7.5-ml linear gradient from 45 to 80 mM KCl in Buffer D at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected in tubes containing 40 μl of 1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The active fractions, fractions 6 and 7 from each run, were combined and dialyzed overnight against 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 M NaCl (Buffer E). After the sample was concentrated to 200 μl using a Centricon-10 filter (Amicon Corporation, Danvers, MA), it was applied to a Superose-12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in Buffer E and was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The active fractions, fractions 66-69 (0.2 ml each), were combined, dialyzed against Buffer C, and stored at 4°C. Rat liver VACVase was purified through the anion-exchange step as described above. The recovered activity was applied to a PBE 118 chromatofocusing column (1 × 14 cm) equilibrated with 25 mM triethylamine-HCl, pH 11.0, and was eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with Pharmalyte pH 8-10.5 that had been diluted 1:45 and adjusted to pH 7.9 with HCl. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and assayed for activity and pH. The molecular mass of rat liver VACVase was determined by gel filtration chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and laser desorption mass spectrometry. Gel filtration chromatography of purified VACVase was performed on a Superose-12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, containing 0.2 M NaCl and calibrated with blue dextran, bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). SDS-PAGE was performed on a 12.5% acrylamide gel (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7), and a densitometric trace of the stained proteins was obtained using a CAMAG TLC Scanner II (Camag Scientific, Inc., Wilmington, NC). Laser desorption mass spectrometry was performed using a Finnigan Lasermat matrix-assisted time-of-flight, laser desorption mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) calibrated with carbonic anhydrase. Amino acid analysis of purified rat liver VACVase was performed on a System 6300 Amino Acid Analyzer (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Amino acid sequencing was done using a Model 477A Sequencer with an online Model 120A PTH Amino Acid Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). NH2-terminal sequencing was performed on proteins transferred from SDS-PAGE gels to modified polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following a published method(11Mozdzanowski J. Speicher D. Villafranca J. Current Research in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, New York1990: 87-93Crossref Google Scholar). To obtain peptides for internal sequencing, purified VACVase (1.8 μg of protein) was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, reduced, and alkylated following the procedure of Stone et al.(12Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Williams N.D. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Hugli T. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, New York1989: 377-391Crossref Google Scholar), and then digested with a 1:25 (w/w) ratio of Achromobacter protease (Lys-C) (Wako, Richmond, VA) at 37°C for 24 h. The VACVase digest was applied to a Vydac narrowbore C18 column (2.1 mm × 25 cm; The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) and was eluted by a linear gradient generated with 0.064% trifluoroacetic acid (mobile phase A) and 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (mobile phase B) over 105 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Peaks detected at 210 and 280 nm were collected. Peptide sequence data were analyzed using Applied Biosystems Model 610A sequencing software, and all sequences were searched against the SwissProt protein sequence data base (release 28.0) using Genetics Computer Group's sequence analysis software (University of Wisconsin, Madison)(13Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). Esters (400 μM final concentration) were tested as potential substrates of rat liver VACVase using the standard hydrolase assay, unless otherwise stated. Kinetic parameters were calculated from initial velocity data at substrate concentrations ranging from one-fourth to at least four times its Km (8-11 concentrations per substrate). Initial velocities were calculated from the linear time course for product formation at 25°C (four time points per concentration). The Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to the data by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. VACVase was tested for peptidase activity with Ala-Leu, Leu-Gly, Leu-Gly-Gly, Met-Ala, Met-Ala-Ser, Met-Leu, Met-Met, Met-Phe, Val-Leu, Val-Met, Val-Phe, Val-Trp, and Val-Tyr using an assay method described by Frick(14Frick L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 77B: 533-540Google Scholar). It was also tested for arylamidase activity with DL-alanyl-, L-leucyl-, DL-methionyl-, and L-valyl-β-naphthylamide using an assay method described by Freitas et al.(15Freitas Jr., J.O. Termignoni C. Borges D.R. Sampaio C.A.M. Prado J.L. Guimaraes J.A. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Alanine aminopeptidase and leucine aminopeptidases (cytosolic and microsomal) were used as positive controls in both assays. Individual tissue homogenates were filtered through cheesecloth, freeze-thawed, and then assayed for VACVase activity. For selected tissues, pooled homogenates were taken through the ammonium sulfate precipitation step of the purification method essentially as described with the following modifications: (i) buffers did not contain protease inhibitors; (ii) the 25,000 × g centrifugation step was omitted; (iii) the DEAE-Sephacel step was performed with Buffer B containing 0.4 M NaCl; and (iv) ammonium sulfate precipitation was done at 0-95% saturation. The precipitates were dissolved in Buffer B, dialyzed overnight against Buffer B, and then filtered (Millex-GV 0.22-μm filter, Millipore Corp.). Each sample was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in Buffer B and was eluted with 3 ml of Buffer B followed by a 20-ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in Buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The UV absorbance of the column effluent was monitored at 280 nm, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. VACVase activity was present in all rat liver subcellular fractions, but it was enriched in the plasma membrane, nuclear, and mitochondrial fractions (Table I). The enrichment in VACVase activity paralleled that of cytochrome c oxidase, a marker enzyme for mitochondria(17Madden E.A. Storrie B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and not alkaline phosphatase, a marker enzyme for plasma membranes(18Mircheff A.K. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 28: 309-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), suggesting that VACVase was associated with mitochondria. Crude mitochondrial fractions (i.e. 25,000 × g homogenate pellets) typically contained 95% of the activity present in whole liver homogenates. This activity was completely solubilized by extraction with NaCl and was purified 1530-fold by conventional column chromatography (Table II). The enzyme obtained by this purification method,~ 0.1 mg of protein from 21 g of tissue, was greater than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The levels of VACVase activity detected in commercially available enzymes from various tissue sources (see listing under “Chemicals”) were all markedly lower than that of the highly purified rat liver VACVase (27.6 units/mg) (Table II), and all but one (0.4 units/mg for human leukocyte elastase) were lower than that of the crude mitochondrial fraction (0.018 units/mg).Table I:Subcellular distribution of VACVase in rat liver Open table in a new tab Table II:Purification of rat liver VACVase Open table in a new tab VACVase was a basic, monomeric protein of low molecular mass. On a chromatofocusing column, VACVase activity eluted in the pH range of 9.53 to 9.37. The calculated isoelectric point for VACVase was 9.45 ± 0.05. Its molecular mass determined by gel filtration chromatography (24.3 kDa) was similar to that determined by SDS-PAGE (29.7 kDa) (Fig. 2, lane 6), indicating that this enzyme was monomeric. The molecular mass of VACVase determined by laser desorption mass spectrometry was 29.08 ± 0.02 kDa (n = 4). Sequences accounting for 57 of the estimated 255 amino acid residues in VACVase were obtained (amino acid composition data not shown). The NH2-terminal sequence of VACVase was Ala-Val-Pro-Val-Ala-Lys-Ala-Lys-Val-Asn-Gly-Ile-His; however, this was not the only sequence detected, indicating that the NH2 terminus of the protein was heterogeneous. A second, less prominent sequence differed from the above in that it lacked the first residue (Ala). The sequences of five peptides from a Lys-C digest of VACVase and their approximate initial yields were: (i) Asp-Ala-Val-Asp-Leu-Met-Lys, 6 pmol; (ii) X-Pro-Arg-Leu-His-Leu-Met-Pro-Glu, 4 pmol; (iii) Asn-Val-Asp-Gly-Ile-Asn-Gln-(Phe)-Lys, 13 pmol; (iv) Ala-Arg-Lys-Pro-Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Tyr-Gly-(His)-X-Tyr, 5 pmol; and (v) X-Val-Ile-Trp-X-Ala-Asn-Ala-Tyr-Val, 3 pmol; where residues in parentheses indicate tentative assignments and an X indicates that no assignment could be made. No match to any of the six sequences was found in the SwissProt protein data base. Hydrolysis of VACV by VACVase at 25°C was optimal at pH 7.5 and increased linearly with increasing amounts of enzyme up to 85% conversion to ACV. At a constant enzyme concentration, hydrolysis of VACV was linear up to 20 min at both 25°C and 37°C. The rates of VACV hydrolysis by VACVase at these temperatures were similar (e.g. 2.4 and 3.2 nmol/min, respectively, at one enzyme concentration tested), whereas the rate of chemical hydrolysis of VACV increased significantly from 0.06 nmol/min at 25°C to 0.18 nmol/min at 37°C. In general, chemical hydrolysis of an amino acid ester of ACV was 3-4-fold faster at 37°C than at 25°C, and the order of decreasing chemical stability at either temperature was L-isoleucyl > L-valyl = D-valyl > L-methionyl = L-leucyl > L-alanyl ester (data not shown). Therefore, the standard hydrolase assay was conducted at 25°C with 15-min incubations in pH 7.5 buffer to maximize enzymatic activity and to minimize chemical hydrolysis of the ester substrate. All ACV esters with naturally occurring amino acids that were examined were substrates of VACVase. These substrates, in order of decreasing specific activity in the standard hydrolase assay, were the L-methionyl > L-leucyl > L-alanyl > L-valyl > L-isoleucyl > D-valyl esters (Table III). The L-alanyl and L-methionyl esters were the most efficient substrates, with kcat/Kmvalues of 226 and 200 mM-1 s-1, respectively, and the D-valyl ester was the least efficient substrate, with an estimated kcat/Km of 0.8 mM-1 s-1 (Table III). The 2-aminovaleryl ester of ACV was also a substrate of VACVase (specific activity of 63 units/mg), whereas the valeryl, 2,3-dimethylbutyryl, and N-formyl-L-valyl esters were not (specific activities less than 0.02 units/mg). No hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate or p-nitrophenyl N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-L-alaninate by VACVase was detected using a published assay method(19Visser L. Blout E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, none of the di- or tripeptides or aminoacyl-β-naphthylamides tested were detectable substrates of this enzyme. Met-Ala-Ser was not a substrate of VACVase even under the assay conditions described by Ben-Bassat et al.(20Ben-Bassat A. Bauer K. Chang S. Myambo K. Boosman A. Chang S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 751-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table III:Hydrolysis of ACV amino acid esters by rat liver VACVase Open table in a new tab ACV (1 mM), L-valine (5 mM), L-methionine (5 mM), and the majority of protease inhibitors screened (i.e. amastatin, 1 mM; antipain, 1 mM; aprotinin, 50 μg/ml; bestatin, 0.5 mM; chymostatin, 1 mM; E-64, 1 mM; EDTA, 5 mM; ebelactone A, 1 mM; ebelactone B, 1 mM; elastatinal, 1 mM; leupeptin, 50 μg/ml; pepstatin, 50 μg/ml; and phosphoramidon, 1 mM) did not inhibit the hydrolysis of VACV by rat liver VACVase when preincubated with the enzyme for 5 min at 25°C. Pefabloc SC (0.2 mM) had a slight effect on activity (35% inhibition with 50 μM VACV), and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (30, 3, and 0.6 μM) had a fairly significant effect (89, 43, and 11% inhibition, respectively, with 400 μM VACV). 2-Mercaptoethanol (1 mM) reversed the inhibition by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate but had no effect on VACVase activity itself. The divalent cations tested (i.e. CaCl2, CoCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, and ZnCl2, each at 1 mM) neither inhibited nor activated VACVase. VACVase activity was detected in all rat tissues that were examined, but it was most abundant in liver (Table IV). The activity in rat liver (2.43 units/g tissue) was nearly 50-fold higher than that in rat intestinal mucosa (0.05 units/g tissue). Human liver was also rich in this enzymatic activity (Table IV). Anion-exchange chromatography of whole tissue extracts indicated that VACVase, not retained at pH 8.0, was the predominant VACV-hydrolyzing enzyme in rat and human liver (accounting for 99 and 97% of the recovered activity, respectively) and rat kidney (92%) and that it was also present in rat intestinal mucosa (34%) (profiles not shown). In each case, the remainder of the recovered activity eluted at 0.1 to 0.2 M NaCl.Table IV:VACVase activity in various tissues Open table in a new tab The effectiveness of VACV as an oral ACV prodrug has been demonstrated in many species, but we have only just begun to understand the mechanisms of its absorption and conversion to ACV. The improved gastrointestinal absorption of VACV over that of ACV may be attributable to a different mode of uptake, i.e. facilitated transport of VACV (6Beauchamp L.M. Orr G.F. de Miranda P. Burnette T. Krenitsky T.A. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1992; 3: 157-164Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 21Smith C. Klein A. Zimmerman T. Progr. Abstr. 33rd Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., Abstr. 1705. 1993; Google Scholar) versus passive diffusion of ACV (21Smith C. Klein A. Zimmerman T. Progr. Abstr. 33rd Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., Abstr. 1705. 1993; Google Scholar, 22Meadows K.C. Dressman J.B. Pharmacol. Res. 1990; 7: 299-303Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A stereoselective transporter of amino acid esters of ACV was indicated by the structure-bioavailability relationship for these prodrugs in rats(6Beauchamp L.M. Orr G.F. de Miranda P. Burnette T. Krenitsky T.A. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1992; 3: 157-164Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and transporter-mediated uptake of VACV has been demonstrated in cynomolgus monkey intestinal brush border membrane vesicles(21Smith C. Klein A. Zimmerman T. Progr. Abstr. 33rd Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., Abstr. 1705. 1993; Google Scholar). Since this transporter also recognized dipeptides(21Smith C. Klein A. Zimmerman T. Progr. Abstr. 33rd Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., Abstr. 1705. 1993; Google Scholar), its recognition of VACV as a dipeptide analogue could explain the enhanced rate of uptake of VACV compared to ACV in these vesicles and in vivo. VACV does resemble a dipeptide, specifically Val-Trp, and this resemblance was thought to be a key to elucidating the mechanism of its biotransformation as well. Absorption of most dipeptides is mainly the result of one or both of the following processes: (i) mucosal uptake followed by intracellular hydrolysis of the peptide, and/or (ii) intraluminal hydrolysis of the peptide followed by uptake of the free amino acids (for reviews, see Refs. 23Adibi S.A. Kim Y.S. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1981: 1073-1095Google Scholar and 24Wiedhaup K. Breimer D.D. Speiser P. Topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences. Elsevier, Amsterdam1981: 307-423Google Scholar). Both imply that metabolism mediated by intestinal mucosal peptidases is essentially complete, with only free amino acids reaching the portal circulation. In contrast, VACV appears to be relatively resistant to presystemic metabolism in the intestine. In recent studies with VACV in rats, only about 50% of the absorbed dose was converted to ACV prior to appearing in the portal circulation.2 Yet, in rats, as well as in monkeys and humans, the systemic exposure to VACV is minimal (<5% of the absorbed dose) if at all(3Weller S.

Then by inference, significant presystemic metabolism of VACV must also occur in the liver. All rat tissues tested possessed enzymatic activity capable of hydrolyzing VACV in vitro, but liver was the richest source of this activity, especially compared to intestine. Two VACV-hydrolyzing activities were present in these tissues: one which was not retained on an anion-exchange matrix at pH 8.0 and one which was retained and eluted with a salt gradient. The nonretained hydrolase activity was the predominant species in rat liver, accounting for 99% of the total liver activity. Further purification of this activity yielded a single VACV-hydrolyzing enzyme, VACVase. Partial sequencing of purified rat liver VACVase did not reveal the enzyme's identity. Amino acid sequences of six VACVase peptides, including its NH2 terminus (13 amino acids) and accounting for approximately 20% of its complete sequence, were not found in the protein data base, indicating that this enzyme has not been sequenced previously. Moreover, there was no strong sequence similarity between the six VACVase peptides and any one enzyme or family of enzymes, including peptidases, in the data base. However, this apparent lack of homology could simply indicate that the VACVase peptides obtained were not from a highly conserved region(s) of the protein. Although VACVase's relationship to known hydrolases could not be conclusively determined from the sequence information obtained, the relative inefficiency with which numerous commercially available hydrolases converted VACV to ACV hinted at the uniqueness of VACVase and its particular esterase activity. The structure-activity relationship for rat liver VACVase with various esters suggested that this enzyme was not a typical esterase and that it might be an aminopeptidase, based on its apparent specificity for hydrolysis of an ester linkage to an amino acid with a free α-amino group. Its preferential hydrolysis of L-methionyl ACV prompted us to investigate methionine aminopeptidases. VACVase was analogous to a methionine-preferring, broad-specificity aminopeptidase from rat liver (15Freitas Jr., J.O. Termignoni C. Borges D.R. Sampaio C.A.M. Prado J.L. Guimaraes J.A. Int. J.

Biochem. 1991; 102: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) in its association with mitochondria, its behavior on an anion-exchange matrix, its inhibition by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate but not bestatin, and its inability to hydrolyze Met-Ala-Ser, a common substrate of methionine-specific aminopeptidases(20Ben-Bassat A. Bauer K. Chang S. Myambo K. Boosman A. Chang S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 751-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kendall R.L. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20667-20673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, VACVase demonstrated neither peptidase nor arylamidase activity with a variety of substrates, including other methionine derivatives. In addition, its esterase activity was not inhibited by protease inhibitors other than p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, nor was it dependent on the presence of a metal ion. Therefore, VACVase did not appear to be a typical peptidase. This enzyme appeared to function primarily, if not exclusively, as an amino acid ester hydrolase. In that respect, its similarity to rabbit reticulocyte aminoacyl-AMP deacylase (27Gross M. Crow P. White J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2080-2086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is intriguing and warrants further study. The VACV-hydrolyzing activity in human liver as profiled by anion-exchange chromatography was essentially identical to that in rat liver, strongly suggesting that VACVase is the predominant VACV-hydrolyzing enzyme in human liver as well. Both toxicological and clinical trial data have shown that the conversion of VACV to ACV is not dose limiting. In clinical trials in normal volunteers, the ratio of the VACV to ACV peak plasma concentration was consistent (0.04) across the dose range (250-2000 mg, four times daily)(3Weller S. Blum M.R. Doucette M. Burnette T. Cederberg D.M. de Miranda P. Smiley M.L. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 54: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Similar pharmacokinetics were observed in volunteers with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease, who had normal liver and renal function but were receiving multiple concomitant medications(28Jacobson M.A. Gallant J. Wang L.H. Coakley D. Weller S. Gary D. Squires L. Smiley M.L. Blum M.R. Feinberg J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1534-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Clinical trials with VACV in other special populations, including individuals with hepatic impairment, are underway. In summary, studies have shown that the enhanced ACV bioavailability provided by VACV can be attributed to improved gastrointestinal absorption of the prodrug via a stereoselective transporter followed by its rapid and efficient conversion to ACV primarily as a result of presystemic metabolism. The studies presented herein indicate that a potentially novel enzyme, which we have referred to as VACVase, may play a significant role in this biotransformation. VACVase has been tentatively classified as an amino acid ester hydrolase based on its known properties; however, further characterization of this enzyme is needed before a more appropriate designation can be made.

https://openalex.org/W1582902635,"Abstract We have demonstrated that caldesmon does not alter the affinity of weak binding actomyosin complexes when it inhibits actin-tropomyosin activation at physiological ratios (1 per 14 actins), and we proposed that it acts upon the strong binding complexes in the same way that troponin-tropomyosin does. We therefore compared the effect of caldesmon, caldesmon fragments, and troponin upon the interaction of the strongly bound complexes S-1.ADP, S-1.adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP.PNP), and N-ethylmaleimide-treated myosin subfragment-1 (NEM-S-1) with actin-tropomyosin. In 0.17 M ionic strength buffer [14C]iodoacetamide-labeled S1.ADP bound to actin-smooth muscle tropomyosin with no evidence of cooperativity; Kd = 0.8 +/- 0.3 microM (n = 5). Inhibitory concentrations of sheep aorta caldesmon or rabbit skeletal muscle troponin made the binding highly cooperative. At low levels of saturation the apparent Kd was 10-40 microM with 10 microM caldesmon and 8-20 microM with 6 microM troponin; at > 50% saturation the binding was indistinguishable from actin-tropomyosin alone. A similar result was obtained for the binding of [14C]iodoacetamide-labeled S-1.AMP.PNP to actin-smooth muscle tropomyosin at 0.03 M ionic strength (Kd = 0.47 +/- 0.05 microM). Binding was slightly cooperative and became highly cooperative in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of troponin, caldesmon, and the human caldesmon fragments H7 (amino acids 622-767) and H9 (amino acids 726-793). We conclude that caldesmon and troponin both act as allosteric effectors of the equilibrium of actin-tropomyosin. 0.1 NEM-S-1/actin potentiated actin-smooth muscle tropomyosin activation of myosin MgATPase 7-fold at 0.03 M ionic strength. Caldesmon inhibited the ATPase in the presence and absence of 0.5 microM NEM-S-1. NEM-S-1 reactivated actin-tropomyosin, which had been inhibited by troponin, caldesmon, H7, or H9. This is compatible with opposing effects of NEM-S-1 and caldesmon or troponin upon the actin-tropomyosin on/off equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1486001184,"The NF-kappa B transcription factors display a high degree of sequence conservation in a domain initially described in the rel oncogene. Two family members, NF-kappa B1 and NF-kappa B2, have distinct DNA binding properties and functionally distinct effects on different enhancers. NF-kappa B1, for example, binds to the kappa B site from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with approximately 15-fold higher affinity than NF-kappa B2. In this study, we have defined regions within the Rel domain which determine DNA binding specificity and interaction with other proteins. We find that the COOH-terminal putative Rel dimerization domain of NF-kappa B1 is required for preferential binding to the HIV kappa B site. In contrast, preferential stimulation of the HIV enhancer by NF-kappa B2 with RelA(p65) is determined by both the NH2- and COOH-terminal Rel domains of NF-kappa B2. These two regions of NF-kappa B2 also mediate preferential synergy with Bcl3. These data suggest that a specific subdomain of the Rel conserved region has evolved to control the fine specificity of DNA binding, and two distinct subregions within the Rel domain determine the specificity of interaction with other transcription factors. These specific Rel-conserved domains therefore determine the specificity of NF-kappa B interactions and contribute to selective gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W1676692995,"Chromobindin A is a multisubunit complex ATPase that binds to chromaffin granule membranes in a calcium-dependent manner and requires ATP for release from the membrane (Martin, W. H., and Creutz, C. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2803-2810). Here we report that the seven previously characterized subunits of chromobindin A cross react with antisera specific to subunits of CCT, the chaperonin containing TCP-1 (Kubota, H., Hynes, G., Carne, A., Ashworth, A., and Willison, K. (1994) Curr. Biol. 4, 89-99). The chromobindin A subunits previously called chromobindins 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19 cross-react specifically with subunits beta, delta, theta, alpha, zeta, xi, and gamma, respectively, of CCT. Additional similarities in subunit molecular weights, isoelectric points, and the morphologies of the two protein complexes as determined by electron microscopy support identification of chromobindin A as an adrenal medullary form of CCT. The chromobindin A/CCT complex was found to bind at least 7-fold more efficiently to affinity columns of chromaffin granule membranes than of adrenal medullary cytosol proteins, suggesting a specific interaction occurs between the complex and membrane components. The results indicate that the previously described characteristics of chromobindin A are likely to be relevant to the functions of CCT and suggest that the adrenal medullary form of CCT may play a role in the activities of secretory vesicle membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1662599635,"Hyaluronan is the most abundant glycosaminoglycan of the extracellular matrix and is a critical substrate for cellular attachment and locomotion. Little is known about the class of enzymes, termed hyaluronidases, that are responsible for hyaluronan catabolism in mammals. We have determined a partial amino acid sequence from a purified preparation of porcine liver hyaluronidase and have used this information as the basis for cloning complementary DNA that encodes the corresponding protein. When expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system, the protein exhibited hyaluronidase activity in a substrate-gel assay. The deduced sequence of this mammalian hyaluronidase is that of a 459-amino-acid polypeptide bearing four potential N-glycosylation sites as well as a copy of a proposed hyaluronan binding motif. Remarkably, amino acid sequence comparisons and immunologic cross-reactivities strongly suggest that the cloned protein is identical to hemopexin, an abundant, heme-binding serum protein. Although hemopexin has not previously been reported to possess any enzymatic activity, it includes a conserved domain found in collagenases, stromelysins, and other enzymes that metabolize the extracellular matrix. We conclude that hemopexin is the predominant hyaluronidase expressed in mammalian liver."
https://openalex.org/W190578628,"The mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) in lower eucaryots and mammals is a matrix enzyme, whereas MPP in plants constitutes an integral part of the bc1 complex of the respiratory chain. The isolated spinach leaf bc1 complex catalyzes cleavage of the precursor of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia F1 beta subunit of the ATP synthase, resulting in a production of mature protein and a presequence that consists of 54 amino acids. A synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal part of the presequence, containing 17 amino acids with a helical structural element, p-F1 beta(38-54), was an efficient inhibitor of the processing, whereas a peptide derived from the N-terminal part of the presequence, p-F1 beta(1-18), was much less effective. ATIII, a helical peptide derived from antithrombin III, was not recognized by MPP. Synthetic peptides corresponding to 4, 6, and 11 amino acids of the C terminus of the presequence, p-F1 beta(51-54), p-F1 beta(49-54), and p-F1 beta(44-54) were almost completely inert. Competition studies show that MPP recognizes the C-terminal domain of the presequence rather than the N-terminal domain. Furthermore, the alpha-helical element of the C-terminal domain is shown to be required for the recognition event."

https://openalex.org/W1517598565,"Proacrosin, the zymogen form of the serine protease acrosin, is located within the acrosomal vesicle of mammalian spermatozoa and has been suggested to be involved in the fertilization process. In mouse and rat, expression of the proacrosin gene starts in pachytene spermatocytes and continues through the early stages of spermiogenesis. We have shown recently that 2.3 kilobase pairs of the 5'-flanking region of the rat proacrosin gene is sufficient to direct chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression in a germ cell-specific and developmental stage-specific manner in the mouse. Additional transgenic lines have been generated which include two deletions in the 5'-flanking region and a tyrosinase minigene as marker for gene expression. Transgenic mice bearing these two truncated fragments showed different patterns of reporter gene expression. Transgenic lines (BM, B3, B2) harboring the 397-base pair (bp) fragment (from 45 to 442 bp upstream of ATG) showed no chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in either testis or other tissues, but analysis via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed low levels of reporter gene transcription in testis. Transgenic line TC bearing a longer fragment of 877 bp (from 45 to 922 bp upstream of ATG) showed a reporter gene expression and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme activity which was identical to that found in mice harboring the 2.3-kilobase pair 5'-flanking region. The analysis of the CAT gene expression during testicular development showed diploid transcription and haploid translation. It can be concluded that all sequences required for a basic level of testis-specific transcription of transgene are present within the 397-bp fragment, and other DNA sequences located outside of the 397-bp fragment but present within the 877-bp fragment can function as enhancer elements. Two fragments within the 877-bp region were identified by gel retardation assays as binding exclusively to nuclear factor(s) from testis protein extracts. In both fragments we identified sequence elements which are present in the promoter region of the germ cell-specific genes for histone H2B and protamine 1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1512554562,"The genes encoding the two different subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) from the methylotrophic bacterium W3A1 have been identified, cloned, and sequenced. A 0.8-kilobase pair DNA fragment was generated for use as a molecular probe by the amplification of genomic sequences using the polymerase chain reaction and a primer pair with degenerate sequences derived from the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences determined for the ETF subunits purified from W3A1. The screening of a partial genomic minilibrary containing size-selected BamHI-SalI fragments using this probe identified a 2.2-kilobase pair insert containing the complete coding sequences for both W3A1 ETF subunits. The genes are arranged in tandem in the genomic DNA with only 2 bases between the TAG translation termination codon of the small subunit and the ATG translation initiation codon of the large subunit. The deduced amino acid sequences of each of the W3A1 ETF subunits exhibit only approximately 30% identity with the corresponding subunits of the ETF from human, rat, and Paracoccus denitrificans, which as a group are greater than 50% identical. Thus, the ETF from W3A1 may exhibit some unique structural features that, like other differences in some of its physical and functional properties, may distinguish this ETF from others in this family. A highly homologous region near the COOH terminus of the large subunit in all the ETF proteins was found to contain a sequence that matches in several ways the ADP-binding motif of flavoproteins and other dinucleotide-binding proteins, suggesting that the large subunit forms a portion of the FAD (or AMP) binding site in these proteins. Under control of the tac promoter, the cloned ETF subunit genes were co-expressed in Escherichia coli producing the heterodimeric holoprotein with physical, spectral, and electron-accepting properties essentially identical to the ETF isolated from W3A1. The recombinant ETF serves as the electron acceptor for W3A1 trimethylamine dehydrogenase in vitro, accumulating as the air-stable anionic semiquinone in the presence of excess trimethylamine. Fully reduced ETF could not be obtained even after prolonged enzymatic reduction."
https://openalex.org/W154393339,"Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) is a heterodimer that contains a single equivalent of FAD and accepts electrons from nine flavoprotein dehydrogenases in the mitochondrial matrix. Human ETF was expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression vector previously employed to express Paracoccus denitrificans ETF (Bedzyk, L. A., Escudero, K. W., Gill, R. E., Griffin, K. J., and Frerman, F. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 20211-20217). cDNAs encoding the beta and alpha subunits of the human protein were inserted into the vector, mimicking the arrangement of the P. denitrificans genes in which coding sequences are joined by overlapping termination and initiation codons. A human ETF containing 30% P. denitrificans sequence at the amino terminus of the beta subunit was also expressed and purified. This chimeric ETF has 64% sequence identity with the human sequence in the substituted region. Kinetic constants of medium chain and short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases for the chimeric ETFs were slightly changed from those of human ETF; but, there are marked differences in the kinetic constants of sarcosine dehydrogenase and electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase with the two ETFs. Absorption spectra of the three redox states of human, chimeric, and P. denitrificans ETF flavins are identical. However, the flavin circular dichroism spectra of the three ETFs are characteristic for each species. The spectrum of the chimeric ETF has both human and P. denitrificans ETF features. The amplitude of the 436 nm band is identical to that of the of the human ETF flavin, but the amplitude of the 375 nm band is identical to that of the P. denitrificans ETF flavin. Thus, flavin in the chimeric ETF appears to be exposed to dipoles in the protein framework provided by human and bacterial sequences. These spectral data indicate that the flavin is located in the vicinity of the amino-terminal region of the beta subunit. The kinetic data suggest that the amino-terminal region of the beta subunit comprises part of the docking site for some primary dehydrogenases and electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1489790636,"The human thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) undergoes proteolytic cleavage closely upstream to amino acid 317. Between residues 261 and 313 are three clusters of positively charged amino acids, arginines (Arg) and lysines (Lys), which are potential subtilisin-related proprotein convertase sites. We used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to perform conservative amino acid substitutions within these regions (Arg or Lys to glutamine, Gln). Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with mutant receptor cDNA TSHR-CS1 (Gln261) and TSHR-CS3 (Gln312, Gln313) bound radiolabeled TSH with an affinity similar to the wild-type TSHR. Mutant cDNA TSHR-CS2 (Gln290, Gln291) and TSHR-CS4 (Gln261, Gln290, Gln291, Gln312, Gln313) did not express a protein on the cell surface capable of specific TSH binding. After covalent cross-linkage of radiolabeled TSH to TSHR-CS1 and TSHR-CS3, the mutant receptors dissociated into two subunits under reducing conditions. The most prominent cluster of basic amino acids in the TSHR extracellular region (residues 287-293) was studied in a second series of mutations designed to eliminate the classical proprotein convertase sites in this region and yet be compatible with TSHR function. All three mutant receptors, TSHR-CS5 (Gln290), TSHR-CS6 (Gln291), and TSHR-CS7 (Gln291, Gln293) bound TSH with an affinity similar to that of wild type, and none of these amino acid substitutions prevented proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domains of the TSHR. Thus, cleavage of the TSHR extracellular domain does not involve a classical subtilisin-related proprotein convertase cleavage site, raising the possibility that TSHR cleavage occurs after processing and trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane."

To investigate further the function of the RK motif, we have expressed two additional mutant insulin receptors: a single mutant, in which the second basic residue in the RK motif (Lys1153) was substituted (RA mutant); and a double mutant, in which both the Arg and the Lys residues were replaced with noncharged amino acids (QA mutant). As compared with the transfected wild-type receptors (WT), both the single and the double mutant receptors were normally synthetized and transported to the plasma membrane and bound insulin normally. Whereas the double mutant receptor exhibited preserved insulin-dependent autophosphorylation, kinase activity, and 2-deoxyglucose uptake, all of these functions were grossly impaired in the two single mutant receptors. Two-dimensional analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides from receptor β-subunits revealed that decreased autophosphorylation of the single mutant receptors mainly involved regulatory Tyr1150,1151 and carboxyl-terminal Tyr1316,1322. At variance with the insulin-stimulated, insulin-independent tyrosine kinase activity toward poly(Glu-Tyr) 4:1 was increased 3-fold in both the double and the single mutants.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).2( 2The numbering of amino acids in this paper corresponds to the sequence of the receptor of Ullrich et al. (16Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.-C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). This numbering is 12 lower than that of Ebina et al. (17Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graft L. Clauser E. Ou J.-H.

Rosen O.M. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16839-16844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that there are other relevant phosphorylation sites in the receptor. As is the case for PKC, no phosphorylation site involved in PKA regulation of IR function has been identified yet. The region of the IR involved in the recognition of these Ser/Thr kinases is unknown as well. Thus, although PKA and PKC are important regulators of IR signaling, the molecular mechanisms allowing their interaction with the receptor need to be elucidated. We have previously reported a family of patients with a clinically common form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus associated with a point mutation in the IR gene leading to Arg1152→ Gln substitution in the receptor regulatory domain(18Cocozza S. Porcellini A. Riccardi G. Monticelli A. Condorelli G.L. Ferrara A.M. Pianese L. Miele C. Capaldo B. Beguinot F. Varrone S. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 521-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Petruzziello A. Formisano P. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Riccardi G. Ferrara A.M. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 409-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation affects a two-basic amino acid motif (RK motif) next to the IR key autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1146, Tyr1150, Tyr1151) and constitutively activates IR kinase and signaling(20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in loss of insulin sensitivity for metabolic effects as well as altered intracellular receptor traffic both in the patient fibroblasts and in cells overexpressing the Arg → Gln mutant receptor(19Petruzziello A.

Caruso M. Palumbo G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16242-16246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that the RK motif is highly conserved in the IR family of tyrosine kinases, suggesting an important role in IR function(20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address further the role of the RK motif in IR function, we have now created two additional mutant IRs: a single mutant, in which the second basic residue in the RK motif (Lys1153) was substituted; and a double mutant, in which both Arg and Lys residues were replaced. In the present work we show that substitution of the basic amino acids of the RK motif with noncharged residues critically impairs IR phosphorylation by both PKA and PKC and increases their basal (insulin-independent) activities. Preparation of plasmid DNA, agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, bacterial transformation, and DNA sequencing were performed by standard methods (22Davis L.A. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier/North-Holland, New York1986Google Scholar). Enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim (Kvistgard, Denmark) or Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology A/S (Hillerod, Denmark). All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer. All radiochemicals as well as monoclonal Ig2 phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Amersham (Milano, Italy). mAb3 IR antibody was obtained from Oncogene Science (Manhasset, NY). Polyclonal B9 IR antibody was a generous gift of Dr. C. R. Kahn (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston). PKA catalytic subunit was from Sigma and purified PKC from Promega. The two 17-amino acid peptides encoding the human IR sequence surrounding the RK motif were kindly provided by Dr. E. Appella (NCI, NIH). The WT peptide sequence was MTRDIYETDYYRKGGKG-OH. The QK peptide sequence was MTRDIYETDYYQKGGKG-OH. Media and serum for tissue culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. The QK single mutant IR has been described previously(20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To replace Lys1153 with Ala (single mutant RA) and both Arg1152 and Lys1153 with Gln and Ala, respectively (double mutant QA), the hIR cDNA fragment BamHI-SalI(1926-5200), derived from pSP65-hIR was subcloned in M13mp19 as described previously(20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded template was prepared and point mutations obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the following primers 5′-GAT TAC TAC CGG GCA GGG GGC AAG G-3′ (RA mutant) and 5′-GAT TAC TAC CAG GCA GGG GGC AAG G-3′ (QA mutant). Mutagenesis was performed according to Taylor et al.(23Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and confirmed by M13 dideoxysequencing(24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52761) Google Scholar). The HincII fragment(3187-3871) encoding either the single Lys1153→ Ala (A1153) or the double Arg1152→ Gln/Lys1153→ Ala (Q1152A1153) mutations was cloned back in the pSP65-hIR. The two mutants hIR-A1153 and hIRQ1152A1153 were cloned in the SacII-XhoI site of the pCO11 vector by linker insertion(25Helin K. Velu T. Martin P. Vass W.C. Allevato G. Lowy D.R. andBeguinot L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 825-832PubMed Google Scholar). The final constructs were resequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations. NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (26Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) as described previously(27Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Pastan I. Lowy D.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used at the effective dose of 0.3 mg/ml. Individual G418-resistant clones were isolated and screened by 125I-insulin binding. These assays were performed as described previously (20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol, 50 μCi/ml) for 16 h in 4 ml of methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine. The cells were then solubilized in 0.5 ml of S buffer (20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then centrifuged at 100,000 X g for 20 min. IRs were precipitated from the supernatants using mAb3 IR antibodies and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. Partially purified receptor preparations were obtained by applying Triton X-100 solubilized cells on 1-ml WGA-Sepharose columns. Bound glycoproteins were then eluted by 0.3 MN-acetylglucosamine. Insulin binding activity in the WGA eluate was determined by incubating 40 μl of WGA eluate with 1 ml of binding buffer (20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 45,000 cpm/ml 125I-insulin (100 Ci/g) for 16 h at 4°C. Insulin binding activity was quantitated by the addition of ice-cold 25% polyethylene glycol 6000 using 0.3% human γ-globulin as a carrier. Cell surface insulin binding assays were performed on confluent monolayers of cells. Cells were incubated in 3 ml of binding buffer (15,000 cpm/ml) for 3 h at 15°C in the presence of 0-1 μg/ml unlabeled insulin. Unbound radioactivity was eliminated rapidly by repeated washes with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysates was quantitated in a γ-counter. Binding data were analyzed using the LIGAND program for curve fitting and parameter estimation (29Munson L. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Aliquots of WGA-purified receptors (20 fmol of insulin binding activity) were incubated in the absence or the presence of 1 μM insulin for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [32P]ATP in the presence of 3 mM manganese acetate, 1 mM CTP, and 10 μM ATP. After 20 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 800 μl of ice-cold stopping solution (20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IRs immunoprecipitated using agarose-coupled phosphotyrosine antibodies. Immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. Phosphorylation of exogenous substrates was carried out as described above except that the synthetic peptide poly(Glu-Tyr) 4:1 was present at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml, and 3 mM magnesium acetate was substituted for manganese acetate. After 20 min at 22°C, reactions were stopped by spotting 40-μl aliquots onto Whatman 3MM paper. The paper was washed extensively in a 10% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate solution and dried; the incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. A correction was made for nonspecific absorption of 32P to the filter paper by subtracting the radioactivity bound to the filter at zero time. The analysis was performed as described by Tavaré and Denton(30Tavaré J.M. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled IR β-subunits were isolated from the gel by electroelution and digested with 10 μg of 1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin/ml in 100 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 for 16 h at 30°C. The 32P-labeled phosphopeptides were separated on cellulose TLC plates, first by electrophoresis at 400 V for 2 h at pH 3.5 (pyridine/acetic acid/water, 1:10:189, v/v), then by ascending chromatography (pyridine/acetic acid/butanol/water, 10:3:15:12, v/v), and finally detected by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat preflashed film cassettes with intensifying screens at −70°C. 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake was measured as described previously(20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with incubation buffer (20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the same buffer in the absence or the presence of insulin. Uptake of 2-DG was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of incubation buffer containing 2-[14C]DG (final concentration, 0.2 mM). After incubating for 10 min at room temperature, cells were washed rapidly with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl and lysed with 1 N NaOH. 2-DG uptake was then determined by liquid scintillation counting. Aliquots of the solubilized cells were kept for protein determination. Cytochalasin B (50 μM) was used to estimate carrier-independent uptake. PKC preparations were obtained from solubilized plasma membranes of NIH-3T3 cells as reported previously(31Pignata S. Maggini L. Zarrilli R. Rea A. Acquaviva A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 967-973PubMed Google Scholar). 50 μg of solubilized membrane proteins was incubated with heat-inactivated WGA-purified IRs (20 fmol of insulin binding activity) in the absence or the presence of 1.1 mM CaCl2, 11.4 μM phosphatidylserine, and 0.7 μM diolein in a reaction mixture (final volume 140 μl) containing 1 mM EGTA, 80 mM MgCl2, 24 mM MnCl2, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 50 μM [γ 32P]ATP (0.5 μCi/nmol). The phosphorylation reaction was prolonged for 20 min at 22°C and then interrupted by the addition of 90 μl of a solution containing 100 mM NaF, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM ATP (termination solution). Receptors were immunoprecipitated using either the Ab3 monoclonal or the B9 polyclonal receptor antibodies. Immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. Using both lysine-rich histones (IIIS) and WGA-purified IR as substrates, there was no difference in the activity of PKC preparations from the untransfected cells and from those expressing the three mutant IRs. In some of the experiments, highly purified PKC preparations from rat brain were used. In these experiments, 20 fmol of WGA-purified receptors was phosphorylated by 0.05 unit of PKC in the presence or the absence of 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4.5 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 1 μM diolein in a reaction mixture containing 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 3 mM MnCl2, 13 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 5 μM [γ 32P]ATP (0.5 mCi/nmol). Subsequent conduction of the phosphorylation reaction and receptor identification were performed as described above. PKA phosphorylation reactions were performed by incubating 20 fmol of IRs with PKA in a final volume of 100 μl of buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.02% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μM [γ 32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) and prolonged for 20 min at 22°C. Reaction mixtures were then immunoprecipitated with mAb3 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Confluent cells were equilibrated with [32P]orthophosphate as described(32Condorelli G. Formisano P. Miele C. Beguinot F. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After 8 h, the cells were exposed to 1 μM TPA for 45 min. The reaction was stopped with phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C containing 10 mM pyrophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 4 mM EDTA, and 1 mM Na3VO4. The labeled cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 containing 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (12 units/ml), 10 mM pyrophosphate, 10 M NaF, 4 mM EDTA, and 1 mM Na3VO4 for 10 min. Solubilized cells were immunoprecipitated with receptor mAb3 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To investigate the functional properties of the RK motif, two hIR mutants have been generated in the present study: a single mutant, in which Lys1153 was replaced by Ala (RA mutant); and a double mutant, in which both Arg1152 and Lys1153 were replaced by Gln and Ala, respectively (QA mutant) (Fig. 1). The previously reported single mutant (18Cocozza S. Porcellini A. Riccardi G. Monticelli A. Condorelli G.L. Ferrara A.M. Pianese L. Miele C. Capaldo B. Beguinot F. Varrone S. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 521-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which Arg1152 was replaced by Gln (QK mutant)3( 3The hIR mutant termed QK in the present paper corresponds to that designated Q1152 in our previous publication (20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). )and WT have also been analyzed. RA and QA mutant cDNAs were stably transfected in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Clonal cell lines were screened for expression of 125I-insulin binding and several cell clones isolated. Insulin sensitivity of these cells increases linearly with IR number up to 2 X 104 receptors/cell, whereas linearity disappears with higher receptor expression(20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, four mutant clones expressing 1.2 and 2.4 X 104 RA mutant receptors/cell (RA1, RA2) and 1.0 and 1.9 X 104 QA mutant receptors/cell were studied in detail. Based on Scatchard analysis(33Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-675Crossref Scopus (17814) Google Scholar), all of these clones exhibited dissociation constants (KD) for insulin between 0.62 and 0.72 nM (Fig. 1). This is similar to the KD values of the previously described WT and QK clones4( 4The cell clones expressing WT and QK hIR, and designated WT2 and QK2 in the present paper, were termed WT2 and M2 in our previous publication (20Formisano P. Sohn K.-J. Miele C. Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). )and to that of the endogenous IR measured in untransfected NIH-3T3 cells. Thus, all transfected cell clones analyzed in this work exhibited normal insulin binding affinities in addition to comparable receptor levels. To ensure that IR mutants were properly processed and transported to the cell surface, extracts were prepared from cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled IRs were then immunopreciptated with anti-IR mAb3. In all of the cell lines expressing the RA and QA receptor mutants, as well as in the QK2 and WT2 lines, these antibodies immunoprecipitated two proteins migrating at Mr 130,0"
https://openalex.org/W2006977954,"Many activator proteins generate their positive control of transcription through interactions with the COOH-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase α subunit. We have examined the participation of this α-domain in transcriptional enhancement and suppression at bacteriophage T4 late promoters. Enhancement is generated by the T4 gene 45 protein, which is the DNA-tracking processivity factor of viral DNA replication; suppression of unenhanced transcription is generated by the RNA polymerase-binding co-activator T4 gene 33 protein. Enhanced and unenhanced transcription by RNA polymerase reconstituted with intact and truncated α subunits and by RNA polymerase containing ADP-ribosylated α has been compared; the internal structures of transcription complexes formed with these RNA polymerases have also been analyzed by footprinting and photocross-linking. Comparison of these structural and functional analyses suggests that enhancement of T4 late transcription by gp45 is not compatible with any significant role of the COOH-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase core α subunit in transcriptional initiation. Suppression of unenhanced T4 late transcription by the gene 33 protein also does not require the COOH-terminal domain of α.

Suppression of unenhanced T4 late transcription by the gene 33 protein also does not require the COOH-terminal domain of α. It has only recently been recognized that the α subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase plays two distinctive roles in promoter utilization; α is the target of interaction of many transcription-activating gene regulatory proteins, and it also confers a sequence-specific DNA-binding capacity on the RNA polymerase core enzyme. Both of these properties of α reside in a separately folding domain comprising its 80 COOH-terminal amino acids. The COOH-terminal domain is connected to the rest of α by a relatively unstructured, proteolysis-prone, and perhaps flexible linker segment. Interactions with the RNA polymerase β and β′ subunits and the principal interactions between two α subunits reside in the larger NH2-terminal domain, although the COOH-terminal domain also has some tendency to self-associate (Igarashi and Ishihama, 1991Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar; Ross et al., 1993Ross W. Gosink K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.

Biol. 1994; 242: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The preferred DNA interactions of the COOH-terminal domain involve A/T-rich sequences (UP elements) that are located at the upstream ends of certain promoters (Ross et al., 1993Ross W. Gosink K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). For example, the interaction with the UP element of the ribosomal RNA transcription unit rrnB P1 promoter contributes an approximately 20-fold increase of promoter strength (Rao et al., 1994Rao L. Ross W. Appleman J.A. Gaal T. Leirmo S. Schlax P. Record M.T. Gourse R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1421-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The interaction of α with diverse transcription-activating DNA-binding proteins involves diverse parts of its COOH-terminal domain, as though establishing an additional attachment point to DNA via protein-protein interaction were itself the primary determinant of transcriptional activation. All these interactions are abrogated when the COOH-terminal domain of α is removed, as has been demonstrated in an extensive series of experiments, primarily by Ishihama and collaborators (Igarashi and Ishihama, 1991Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (for reviews with references, see Ishihama, 1992Ishihama A. Mol.

Soon after phage T4 infection, the COOH-terminal domain of α is modified by ADP-ribosylation of Arg-265, by two phage T4-encoded enzymes, the Alt and Mod proteins, the latter packaged in the T4 virion and injected along with the T4 genome at infection (for reviews of the biology of phage T4, see Karam(1994) and Mathews et al.(1983)). It has long been thought that ADP-ribosylation is involved in the shut-off of host cell transcription (e.g. Mailhammer et al., 1975Mailhammer R. Yang H.L. Reiness G. Zubay G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4828-4932Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Direct evidence that the utilization of promoters with UP elements (Rao et al., 1994Rao L. Ross W. Appleman J.A. Gaal T. Leirmo S.

Ross, H. Tang, D. Fenyö, B. T. Chait, R. L. Gourse, R. H. Ebright, and A. Goldfarb, manuscript in preparation. )1 A second class of transcriptional activators interact with other targets in the central transcription apparatus. For example, the phage λ cI protein interacts with the σ70 subunit (Li et al., 1994Li M. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. Science. 1994; 263: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and the NtrC protein probably interacts with σ54 (Wong et al., 1994Wong C. Tintut Y. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), while the CRP protein can interact with either the COOH-terminal domain of σ70 or the COOH-terminal domain of α, depending on the location of its DNA-binding site (Kumar et al., 1994Kumar A.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the point of view of promoter utilization, phage T4 development can be divided into three phases. Early promoters are transcribed by RNA polymerase σ70 holoenzyme (E.σ70)( 2The abbreviations used are: ERNA polymerase corebpbase pair(s)BSAbovine serum albuminATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). )2 and characteristically have A/T-rich UP-like elements (Wilkens and Rüger, 1994Wilkens K. Rüger W. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 132-141Google Scholar). Middle promoters have a σ70-recognized consensus sequence centered 10 bp upstream of the transcriptional start, but none further upstream (Stitt and Hinton, 1994Stitt B. Hinton D. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 142-160Google Scholar). These promoters require the action of two additional T4-encoded proteins: the MotA protein, which binds at bp −30, and the AsiA protein, which binds to the RNA polymerase core (E) and/or σ70 (Stevens, 1977Stevens A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 475: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; Ouhammouch et al., 1994Ouhammouch M. Orsini G. Brody E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3956-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Ouhammouch et al., 1995Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phage T4 late promoters consist of a single promoter element TATAAATA centered 10 bp upstream of the transcriptional start, which is recognized by the T4 gp55 σ-family protein, but require transcriptional activation. The mechanism of this activation generates a coupling to concurrent replication through the action of three replication proteins: the sliding clamp of the T4 DNA polymerase, gp45, and its DNA-loading factor, the gp44·gp62 complex. Transcriptional activation requires loading of gp45 onto DNA at enhancer-like distal sites by the gp44·gp62 assembly factor in an ATP-requiring process, and subsequent tracking of gp45 from its entry site to the promoter. Somewhere along that path, gp45 encounters RNA polymerase and eventually becomes stably associated with it at the upstream end of the enhanced promoter complex (Herendeen et al., 1992Herendeen D.R. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1992; 256: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; Tinker et al., 1994aTinker R.L. Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by gp45 also requires a co-activator protein, the T4-encoded, RNA polymerase-bound gp33. gp33 suppresses unenhanced transcription (that is, basal transcription by the gp55-containing holoenzyme, E.gp55) and thus reinforces the replication protein dependence of transcription initiation at T4 late promoters (Herendeen et al., 1990Herendeen D.R. Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1990; 248: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase core base pair(s) bovine serum albumin adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). The experiments that are described below analyze the participation of the COOH-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit in T4 late transcription. We compare enhanced and unenhanced transcription by enzymes reconstituted with truncated and intact α and by RNA polymerase containing ADP-ribosylated α, and also examine the internal structures of transcription complexes formed with these RNA polymerases by footprinting and photocross-linking. We show that neither transcriptional enhancement nor suppression of basal transcription by gp33 requires the COOH-terminal domain of α. We suggest that transcriptional enhancement by gp45 leaves no significant role for the COOH-terminal domain of α in the initiation of T4 late transcription. The purification of gp55, gp33, gp45, gp44·gp62, E. coli RNA polymerase core enzyme, and RNA polymerase core from E. coli infected with T4 gene 33 amber phage has been described (Herendeen et al., 1990Herendeen D.R.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7703-7707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The enzyme from T4-infected cells also contains the T4-encoded RNA polymerase core-binding RpbA subunit (Williams et al., 1987Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12365-12371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of RNA polymerase core enzyme with intact α and with α truncated at amino acids 256 and 235 was carried out as described (Borukhov and Goldfarb, 1993Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar; Tang et al., 1995Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using overproduced wild type β subunit (Severinov et al., 1993Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14820-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α subunits for reconstitution of RNA polymerase either had His6 affinity tags at their NH2 termini or were untagged. RNA polymerases with His-tagged α were purified from cells most generously provided by H. Tang and R. H. Ebright, as described (Tang et al., 1995Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with an additional step of chromatography on a MonoQ column. RNA polymerases with untagged α were purified as described (Borukhov and Goldfarb, 1993Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). RNA polymerases for the experiments presented in Figs. 1, 4, and 5 were reconstituted with untagged α; enzymes reconstituted with His-tagged α were used in the experiments shown in Fig. 2 and 3. T4 gene 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (gp32; Boehringer Mannheim), shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) were purchased. The construction and purification of plasmids pDH2 and pDH310, and of photocross-linking probes, has been described (Herendeen et al., 1989Herendeen D.R. Kassavetis G.A. Barry J. Alberts B.M. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1989; 245: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; Tinker et al., 1994aTinker R.L. Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was nicked by gpII endonuclease as described (Herendeen et al., 1989Herendeen D.R. Kassavetis G.A. Barry J. Alberts B.M. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1989; 245: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The photoactively tagged DNA consists of circular single-stranded DNA onto which a complementary strand has been synthesized covering the 322-bp T4 late transcription unit and extending both upstream and downstream of that transcription unit. Each photoactive probe is referred to by a number or a pair of numbers specifying the location(s) of the photoactive nucleotides (5-[N′-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]dUMP) in the nontranscribed strand of the T4 late transcription unit, with +1 designating the transcriptional start site. Single-round transcription experiments were used to measure the relative number for open promoter complexes capable of initiating RNA synthesis on constructed transcription units (Herendeen et al., 1989Herendeen D.R. Kassavetis G.A. Barry J. Alberts B.M. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1989; 245: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In plasmid pDH310, the production of a 420-nucleotide transcript initiating at a T4 late promoter is enhanced when the DNA is nicked by the filamentous phage gpII endonuclease at a single site 207 bp upstream of, and in the nontranscribed strand of, the conjugate transcription unit. In photoactively tagged DNA constructed on pDH2, the T4 late transcription unit that is subject to enhancement yields a 322-nucleotide transcript. For the experiments shown in Fig. 1, 100 fmol of nicked pDH310 DNA, 1 pmol of the specified RNA polymerase, 5 pmol of gp55 and, where appropriate, 4 pmol of gp33, 3.6 pmol of gp45 (trimer), and 3.3 pmol of gp44·gp62 complex (taken to contain gp44 and gp62 in a 4:1 mol ratio) were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a 20-μl volume of reaction medium A containing 33 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 300 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). A single round of transcription was initiated by adding 5 μl of reaction medium with ATP, GTP, CTP, and [α-32P]UTP to final concentrations of 1 mM, 1 mM, 100 μM, and 100 μM (4000 cpm/pmol), respectively, and rifampicin to 25 μg/ml. After 10 min, RNA was prepared for electrophoretic analysis on 5% polyacrylamide gels as described (Herendeen et al., 1989Herendeen D.R. Kassavetis G.A. Barry J. Alberts B.M. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1989; 245: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and quantified on a PhosphorImager. A 32P-labeled DNA fragment was added to the stop mix to serve as a recovery marker during RNA purification. Transcription complexes for the experiments shown in Fig. 2 were assembled at 37°C on 100 fmol of nicked pDH310 in 20 μl of reaction buffer B containing 33 mM Tris acetate, pH 8, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.8% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.25 mM dATP, and potassium acetate at the indicated concentration. The following quantities of transcription proteins were used: 500 fmol of reconstituted intact or truncated (α-235) RNA polymerase or ADP-ribosylated RNA polymerase from E. coli infected with T4 gene 33 amber phage (α-ADPR), 1.2 pmol of gp55, 1.2 pmol of gp33, 1.8 pmol of gp45 trimer, and 3.3 pmol of gp44·gp62 complex. After preincubating all components for 15 min, a single round of transcription was initiated, and all samples were adjusted to 200 mM potassium acetate, while adding ATP, UTP, and GTP to 400 μM each, [α-32P]CTP (5000 cpm/pmol) to 50 μM, heparin to 200 μg/ml, and 0.3 units/μl of RNasin (Promega), bringing the total volume to 40 μl. After 15 min at 37°C, reactions were stopped by a 10-fold dilution into 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 4 mM Na3EDTA, pH 8, 66 μg/ml proteinase K. RNA was purified and analyzed as indicated and referenced above. For transcription assays using photoactive probes, proteins were assembled on 8 fmol of photoactive DNA probe for 15 min at 37°C in 13 μl of reaction buffer B (specified in the preceding paragraph) containing 250 mM potassium acetate (unless otherwise indicated) and the following proteins, as appropriate: 1 pmol of gp55, 1 pmol of gp33, 1.8 pmol of gp45 trimer, 3.3 pmol of gp44·gp62 complex, 23 pmol of gp32, and 200 fmol of E. coli RNA polymerase core, or 400 fmol of ADP-ribosylated RNA polymerase core (isolated from T4 gene 33-double amber phage-infected E. coli), or 800 fmol of reconstituted intact or truncated (α-235 or α-256) RNA polymerase core. Poly(dAT·dAT) was then added to 52 μg/ml, bringing the volume to 15 μl, and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min at 37°C. Transcription was initiated by adding ATP, UTP, and GTP to 400 μM each, [α-32P]CTP (30,000 cpm/pmol) to 25 μM, and RNasin to 0.3 units/μl. Poly(dAT·dAT), which deviates from the T4 late promoter −10 sequence in only one nonessential position (Kassavetis et al., 1986Kassavetis G.A. Zentner P.G. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14256-14265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and serves as a potent specific competitor DNA template, was used to limit transcription to a single round. After 15 min of incubation, transcription was stopped and RNA was purified and subjected to gel electrophoresis as indicated above. RNA polymerase (1.5 pmol) and gp55 (6 pmol) were combined with 6 pmol of gp33, 7.2 pmol of gp45 trimer, and 13.2 pmol of gp44·gp62 complex (for enhanced transcription complexes), or used without additions (unenhanced) in a 15-μl volume of reaction buffer containing 33 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (Mr 3300), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 150 μg/ml BSA, 160 mM potassium acetate (lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7) or 260 mM potassium acetate (lanes 1, 2, and 5). Five μl of a probe mix containing 2 fmol of 5′ end-labeled DNA probe, 30 pmol of gp32, and 10 nmol of dATP in the respective reaction buffer were then added, and mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 45 min. Five μl of the same buffer containing 1.25 μg of poly(dAT·dAT) and 10 nmol of ATPγS were then added for 10 min, followed by 5 μl of the same buffer containing 5 = 10-3 units of DNase I and 25 nmol of CaCl2 and incubation for 30 s. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes of a stop solution composed of 10 mM Na3EDTA, 0.4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 μg/ml proteinase K, and 250 μg/ml yeast RNA, and samples were incubated for an additional 15 min at 37°C. Reaction products were purified and resolved by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels as described (Maniatis et al., 1982Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), then analyzed by autoradiography and quantified on a PhosphorImager. Two radiolabeled probes were used in footprinting experiments: the double-stranded BamHI-PstI fragment of pDH310 (Herendeen et al., 1989Herendeen D.R. Kassavetis G.A. Barry J. Alberts B.M. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1989; 245: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which is not compatible with activation of transcription by the T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins, and a single-stranded BamHI-PstI fragment, 5′ end-labeled at the BamHI site and annealed to a complementary single-stranded M13 DNA derivative of plasmid pDH310. The single-strand/duplex junctions of the latter probe serve as loading sites for the DNA polymerase accessory proteins. Proteins were assembled on the photoactive probe for 15 min at 37°C, as described above (see “Single-round Transcription with Photoactive Probes” for transcription protocol). Shrimp alkaline phosphatase and poly(dAT·dAT) (unless otherwise indicated), were added to 0.4 units and 60 μg/ml, respectively. After an additional 15 min at 37°C, samples were irradiated at 254 nm for 4 min and processed by digestion with DNase I and S1 nuclease, as described (Tinker et al., 1994bTinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5330-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cross-linked protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gels (unless otherwise indicated), that were silver-stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography, using intensifying screens or PhosphorImager plates. Eight hundred fmol of RNA polymerase reconstituted with intact or truncated α (α-235 or α-256), or 20 pmol of intact or truncated α (α-235) subunits alone, respectively, was mixed with 8 fmol of photoactive DNA probe and incubated either at 37°C in 15 μl of reaction buffer B (see “Single-round Transcription of Nicked pDH310” for transcription assays; Fig. 2) containing 66 mM potassium acetate, or at 25°C in 15 μl of buffer containing 30 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin (Ross et al., 1993Ross W. Gosink K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) as indicated. After 15 min of incubation, samples were irradiated and processed as described in the preceding paragraph. For the indicated experiments, the radioactivity in transcripts and in cross-linked gp45 was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (software from Scanalytics) and values were normalized to the recovery marker or gp32 cross-linking signal, respectively, in the same sample. We first examined the ability of the DNA polymerase accessory proteins gp45, gp44, and gp62 to activate transcriptional initiation at a T4 late promoter by E. coli RNA polymerase reconstituted with wild type α subunits and with α truncated at amino acids 256 and 235. Single-round transcription experiments, which measure the relative number of productive open promoter complexes, showed clearly that all of these RNA polymerases are capable of being activated in a reaction medium (see “Materials and Methods”) containing 300 mM potassium acetate (Fig. 1, compare shaded and diagonally hatched bars). Moreover, the quantitative degree of enhancement was consistently greater for RNA polymerase containing truncated α than for the wild type native or wild type reconstituted enzymes (Fig. 1 and see below). The requirements for transcriptional enhancement of α-truncated and normal RNA polymerases were observed to be identical: gp45, gp44·gp62 complex, dATP, a DNA loading site for gp45, and RNA polymerase bearing gp55 and gp33. It has previously been shown that gp33 suppresses unenhanced transcription at T4 late promoters, (Herendeen et al., 1990Herendeen D.R. Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1990; 248: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The α-truncated RNA polymerases share the same property (Fig. 1, compare solid and shaded bars). The effects of ionic strength on transcriptional activation and suppression have been examined more extensively (Fig. 2). For these experiments, we compared RNA polymerase reconstituted with intact α and with α truncated at amino acid 235 (α-235) and T4-modified native RNA polymerase containing α ADP-ribosylated at amino acid 265 (α-ADPR) (and also containing the T4-encoded RpbA subunit; see “Materials and Methods”). Under conditions of transcriptional enhancement, with RNA polymerase limiting, the three enzymes yielded equal numbers of open promoter complexes in the presence of 200 mM potassium acetate, and more significantly, the same electrolyte concentration dependence of transcriptional activity out to 400 mM potassium acetate (Fig. 2a). At these enhancement-equalized concentrations of RNA polymerase, the absolute levels of unenhanced transcription varied greatly (Fig. 2b). Particularly noteworthy was the large effect of α truncation on activity in unenhanced transcription at this T4 late promoter, and the large effect of α modification on the electrolyte concentration dependence of unenhanced transcription. The sensitivity of ADP-ribosylated RNA polymerase to higher electrolyte concentrations, conditions that mimic the cellular milieu (Cayley et al., 1991Cayley S. Lewis B.A. Guttman H.J. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 281-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar; Epstein, 1986Epstein W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 73Crossref Google Scholar), would enforce the dependence of late transcription on transcriptional enhancement (Herendeen et al., 1990Herendeen D.R. Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1990; 248: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The principal outcome of the experiment, however, was the demonstration that the diversity of these three RNA polymerases disappears under conditions of transcriptional enhancement, which appear to suppress contributions of the COOH-terminal domain of α entirely. Unenhanced transcription by each of these three enzymes was diminished by gp33 over the entire ionic strength range of analysis (Fig. 2, c-e); a progressively greater inhibition of transcription by gp33 with increasing electrolyte concentration was evident in the case of the intact-α enzyme (Fig. 2c). We have noted that the diminution of enhanced transcription at 300 and 400 mM KOAc (Fig. 2a) differs markedly from the comparable levels of enhanced transcription between 300 and 400 mM KOAc documented for α-ADPR RNA polymerase by Herendeen et al.(1990). A part of this discrepancy is likely to stem from the 2-4-fold higher concentrations of RNA polymerase, gp45 and gp44·gp62 complex, and 2-fold longer incubation times for open complex formation in the latter work. In the current study, limiting concentrations of RNA polymerase, suboptimal concentrations of transcription proteins, and shorter binding times were used to accentuate the effect of elevated electrolyte concentrations on the rate of open complex formation. The DNase I footprints of T4 late promoter complexes formed by intact-α, truncated-α, and α-ADPR RNA polymerases are compared in Fig. 3. We noted in particular that no differences could be discerned at the α-bearing upstream ends of these enhanced promoter complexes (lanes 6-8). In contrast, the unenhanced complexes of intact-α, α-ADPR, and truncated-α RNA polymerases showed subtle changes in their respective upstream protection patterns. A hypersensitive site at position −34 appeared in complexes formed with α-ADPR and α-truncated polymerase but was absent from complexes formed with intact-α polymerase (compare lane 3 with lanes 4 and 5). Intact-α RNA polymerase partially protected the bp −33 to −49 region, but the α-ADPR and α-235 polymerases showed no protection (compare lane 3 with lanes 4 and 5). Only footprints of the non-transcribed strand are presented, but unenhanced footprints of the transcribed strand showed similar pattern"
https://openalex.org/W1508651273,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) attenuates the stimulatory effects of cAMP on proliferation and iodide uptake in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells. This study examines the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Cytosol proteins separated by anion exchange chromatography showed increased [3H]cAMP binding activity as well as increased kinase activity in the fractions containing PKA type II in 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nM)-treated cells compared to the control cells. Western blot analysis of 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells revealed a 4-fold increase in the cytosolic amount of the PKA regulatory subunit RII beta, whereas no changes were detected in the regulatory subunits RI alpha and RII alpha or the catalytic (C) subunit. Northern blot analyses showed a similar increase in RII beta mRNA in cells treated for 12 h with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nM), and RII beta mRNA increased further to 10-fold above control cell level after 96 h of incubation. Iodide uptake was synergistically stimulated with both PKAI- and PKAII-directed pairs of cAMP analogs. The PKAI synergism was, however, inhibited by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of the cells, whereas the PKAII synergism was unaffected. In conclusion, 1,25-(OH)2D3 attenuates both PKAI formation and PKAI-stimulated iodide uptake in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells by increasing the level of RII beta without altering the other PKA subunit levels."
https://openalex.org/W1535520908,"The effect of glucose deprivation on the uptake of leucine has been examined in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from rat aortae. Equimolar substitution of sucrose or fructose for glucose in the culture medium enhanced the uptake of leucine in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effect was first detectable after 12 h and reached the maximum, 2-fold, after 48 h with an apparent half-maximal effect at 1 mM glucose and could be reversed after 48 h of glucose refeeding. The enhanced leucine uptake was completely inhibited by 2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid, a specific substrate for System L, but not by alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric acid or lysine. Kinetic analyses indicated that this stimulation was mediated via a homogenous system with a 1.7-fold increase in the Vmax without any change in the Km (0.15 mM). Prolonged treatments with cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) or actinomycin D (10 micrograms/ml) blocked this glucose deprivation effect and its reversal. However, cycloheximide also very rapidly stimulated leucine uptake, reaching the maximum, 2.5-fold over the basal at 1 h. This effect occurred at concentrations that matched its inhibition on protein synthesis (half-maximal at 0.1 micrograms/ml) and could be reproduced with puromycin as well as actinomycin D. The stimulatory effect of cycloheximide was also accompanied by an increase in the Vmax but not in the Km, being sensitive to 2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid inhibition only, and appeared to occur in an additive manner to that of glucose deprivation. Although the uptake of leucine was stimulated by glucose deprivation and brief exposure to cycloheximide, these treatments had no effect on the efflux of the substrate. These results are all consistent with the System L amino acids transport activity in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells being under the control of at least two non-hormonal regulatory mechanisms, one that is likely to involve a labile repressor molecule and the other involving de novo protein synthesis as a result of chronic glucose deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1662328963,"Cysteine 518 of the molecular chaperonin cpn60 (groEL) has been replaced with serine (C518S) by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutant chaperonin protein is still functional and it can: (a) arrest the spontaneous folding of rhodanese in the absence of GroES and ATP, (b) assist refolding of the enzyme rhodanese in the presence of GroES and ATP/Mg2+, and (c) permit the urea-induced release and refolding of rhodanese from its complex with cpn60. ATP/Mg2+, alone, could discharge active rhodanese from cpn60 complexes formed with either wild type or C518S. In contrast with wild type cpn60, C518S has: (a) reduced stability of its quaternary structure, (b) reduced ability to reassemble tetradecamers after dissociation by urea; (c) reduced ATPase activity; and (d) more easily exposed hydrophobic surfaces. The data suggest that replacement of Cys-518 with Ser in cpn60 destabilizes its oligomeric structure, but there is no significant effect on cpn60 function or the stability of the monomers formed in urea."

R. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 7174-7178). We have selected HL-60 cells resistant to nitroprusside-induced differentiation as assessed by acquisition of the OKM-1 antigen, reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium, and morphologic maturation. The variant cells were also resistant to differentiation induced by sodium nitrite and two cGMP analogs but still differentiated in response to other inducing agents such as dimethyl sulfoxide and cAMP analogs and showed the same changes in c-myc and c-fos expression in response to the latter drugs as occurred in parental cells. We studied the early steps of the NO/cGMP signal transduction pathway in the variant cells and found that basal and nitroprusside-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity was similar in parental and variant cell extracts and that nitroprusside increased the intracellular cGMP concentration to the same extent in parental and variant cells. As part of these studies we found that HL-60 cells expressed only alpha 2 and beta 2 guanylate cyclase mRNA; the abundance of these two mRNA species was similar in parental and variant cells. Neither nitroprusside nor 8-bromo-cGMP changed the intracellular calcium concentration in parental or variant cells. The data suggest that the defect in the variant cells is after guanylate cyclase activation in the NO/cGMP transduction pathway and that the cGMP and cAMP transduction pathways operate independently in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2049603320,"The gene encoding endothiapepsin (EAP), an extracellular aspartic proteinase from the filamentous ascomycete Cryphonectria parasitica, was expressed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Efficient secretion of an active and correctly processed enzyme was achieved when expressing the entire cDNA encoding prepro-EAP under the control of the galactose-inducible GRAP1 yeast promoter. Since three independent, site-directed mutations of EAP, including the substitution of an aspartyl catalytic residue, resulted in the intracellular accumulation of zymogen forms, we assumed that the EAP propeptide was autocatalytically processed. As a prerequisite to further improve the specificity of EAP, we therefore attempted to bypass this self-processing step in three different ways: 1) introduction of a Kex2-like recognition site between the pro and the mature part, 2) deletion of the prosequence (pre-EAP), and 3) co-expression in trans of the pre-EAP with its preprosequence. No improvement in the secretion of mutant enzymes was obtained in any of these experiments. As an alternative, we finally replaced the EAP processing site by the chymosin cleavage sequence of κ-casein. Such a modification remained efficient in directing the secretion of active EAP only when a putative α-helix structural motif was conserved at the C terminus of the pro region.

Mammalian and fungal aspartic proteinases constitute a well studied class of enzymes that share the same catalytic apparatus, namely Asp32 and Asp215 in the pepsin sequence (1Szecsi P.B. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1992; 52 (Suppl. 210–): 5-22Crossref Google Scholar). They also have strong similarities in their three-dimensional structures and display extensive peptide sequence homologies. However, subtle differences in the arrangement of some crucial residues, especially of their active site region, are correlated with drastic differences in their catalytic properties. For instance, a few aspartic proteinases, such as calf chymosin, are characterized by high selectivity to cleave κ-casein at Phe105-Met106, and this high specificity forms the basis of their extensive use in cheese making(2Pitts J.E. Dhanaraj V. Dealwis C.G. Mantafounis D. Nugent P. Orprayoon P. Cooper J.B. Newman M. Blundell T.L. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1992; 52 (Suppl. 210 –): 39-50Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Endothiapepsin (EAP),( 1The abbreviations used are: EAPendothiapepsinPCRpolymerase chain reaction. )1 naturally secreted by the filamentous ascomycete fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, is one of the fungal aspartic proteinases produced on a commercial scale as a substitute for chymosin. In addition to its milk clotting property, EAP exhibits a relatively high general proteolytic activity as compared to chymosin, which severely limits the usefulness of this fungal enzyme as a milk clotting agent. Since the fungal EAP-encoding gene has recently been cloned and sequenced(3Razanamparany V. Jara P. Legoux R. Delmas P. Msayek F. Kaghad M. Loison G. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 4Chöi G.H. Pawlyk D.M. Rae B. Shapira R. Nuss D.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it was therefore of interest to evaluate the possibility of constructing molecular variants by mutagenizing the corresponding EAP cDNA sequence. endothiapepsin polymerase chain reaction. Despite the availability of a C. parasitica mutant deficient in the production of EAP(3Razanamparany V. Jara P. Legoux R. Delmas P. Msayek F. Kaghad M. Loison G. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae instead of C. parasitica as a host for this kind of study presents several advantages. 1) yeast grows faster; 2) transformation of yeast cells yield genetically pure colonies, whereas transformation of C. parasitica protoplasts generally yields heterokaryons, which give rise to homokaryons only after a time-consuming sporulation step; 3) a wide variety of yeast transformation vectors, either integrative or autonomously replicating, can easily be recovered from transformed cells. Few fungal aspartic proteinases have been expressed in S. cerevisiae(5Hiramatsu R. Aikawa J. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16862-16866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Horiuchi H. Ashikari T. Amachi T. Yoshizumi H. Takagi M. Yano K. Agric. Biol.

Indeed, the removal of their propeptide can be achieved by an autocatalytic process or by the activity of endogenous yeast proteases or by a combination of both. Thus, if the cleavage of the propeptide is only autocatalytic, modification of the substrate specificity of such a proteinase might severely affect its processing mechanism. As the maturation of EAP is actually not known, we have designed several EAP expression vectors to gain more insight into the mechanism of secretion of this proteinase. This study is a prerequisite for beginning a protein engineering program to modify the substrate specificity of EAP. S. cerevisiae strains c13-ABYS-86 (MATa, ura3-Δ35, leu2-3, 112, his3, pra1-1, prb1-1, prc1-1, cps1-1) (8Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowski J. Escher C. Wolf D.H.

Masson (INSA, Toulouse, France), were used as hosts for the expression of EAP native or mutants. C. parasitica SEBR 103 (Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganisms no. I.997) was used as the source of mRNA for an EAP cDNA cloning experiment and was grown as described previously(3Razanamparany V. Jara P. Legoux R. Delmas P. Msayek F. Kaghad M. Loison G. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain DH5α (9Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8142) Google Scholar) was used for plasmid propagation and was grown in LB medium(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was carried out by electroporation (11Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The medium for selection of the transformants was as follows: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 18.2% sorbitol, 0.5% casamino acids, 0.3% glucose, 3% galactose, 2% bacto-agar. Yeast cells were cultivated aerobically at 30°C. EAP secretion was examined on shake flask cultures as follows. Recombinant yeast cells were first grown in selective YNBD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids) for 20 h. Cells were then harvested and resuspended into the same volume of YNBGG medium. The composition of this induction medium differs from that of YNBD by the carbon and energy source: 3% galactose and 3% glycerol instead of glucose. Cells were then grown for approximately 48 h. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and VentR® DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Life Technologies, Inc. Reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase were obtained from Stratagene and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was from Promega. Oligonucleotides used for PCR experiments were synthesized on a Biosearch 8750 automated DNA synthesizer (Millipore, Saint Quentin-Yvelines, France) and are listed in Table I. PCR was performed with an Hybaid thermal reactor from Cera-Labo (Aubervilliers, France). DNA sequencing was done on double-stranded DNA by the method of Sanger et al.(12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52465) Google Scholar).Table I:Construction of various EAP expression plasmid Open table in a new tab Standard molecular procedures were followed(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding for the EAP precursor was cloned by reverse transcriptase PCR amplification from C. parasitica EAP-encoding mRNAs. The oligonucleotides A1 and A2, used as PCR primers after the reverse transcriptase step, were designed from the published eapA genomic sequence(3Razanamparany V. Jara P. Legoux R. Delmas P. Msayek F. Kaghad M. Loison G. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA fragment from this PCR was digested with NdeI and HindIII and was then cloned into pBR322 to yield plasmid pEMR572. All the expression plasmids for yeast used throughout this study are pEMR473 derivatives. The structure of the vector has already been detailed elsewhere(13Leplatois P. Le Douarin B. Loison G. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In summary, pEMR473 is a shuttle E. coli-S. cerevisiae vector, which retains the ampicillin resistance gene and the origin of replication of pBR322 and also contains elements as follows: 1) a fragment of the yeast 2-μm circle required for autonomous replication and partition in yeast cells; 2) two selectable markers for yeast, namely the defective leu2-d and wild-type URA3 genes; 3) an expression cassette consisting of the galactose-regulated artificial GRAP1 promoter fused to the urate oxidase-encoding cDNA and the PGK terminator. Substituting the sequence that encodes urate oxidase with that of the pEMR572 insert or of various EAP mutants yielded the plasmids used throughout this study, as summarized in Fig. 1 and Table I. The DNA sequence of every in vitro mutated eapA fragment was verified prior to the reconstruction of the precursor-encoding gene by replacement of the wild-type sequence using appropriate restriction sites. The in vitro directed mutation Asp35 → Gly was generated by PCR as described in Table I and II. Other EAP cDNA site-directed mutageneses, including substitutions (p73E6 and p73E8), insertions (p73E9, p73E11, p73E12, p73E25), and deletion of the prosequence (p73E29 and p73E30) were performed according to the already described inverse PCR method (14Imai Y. Matsushima T. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) using different primers as described in Table I:, Table II:. The replacement of the wild-type EAP cleavage site by that of case2 (p73E26), and the construction of the cassette consisting of the entire eapA preprosequence containing a stop codon immediately at the end of the prosequence were obtained by PCR (p73E39 and p73E40).Table II:Primer sequences Open table in a new tab Yeast colonies grown on regeneration medium for 3 days were overlaid by a molten skim milk buffer (2.5% skim milk, 75 mM Tris-malate, pH 6.2, 5 mM CaCl2, 1% purified agar). After incubation at 37°C for 3 h, hydrolysis halos were revealed by the addition of 0.5 M CaCl2. Culture supernatants or cell-free crude extracts, prepared by vortexing yeast cells in the presence of glass beads, were assayed for milk clotting activity according the procedure of Lamsa and Bloebaum(16Lamsa M. Bloebaum P. J. Ind. Microb. 1990; 5: 229-238Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli(17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar), and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C Extra (Amersham Corp.) using a Novex Blot module (Novex, San Diego, CA). EAP or related forms were immunologically detected with rabbit anti-EAP antibodies (France Biochem, Meudon, France) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Secondary antibodies were stained by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chromogenic substrates. For N-terminal determination or endoglycosidase H treatment, proteins from yeast supernatant were concentrated 30-35-fold by centrifugation using Centriprep-10 unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA). For sequencing, the concentrated proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a PVDF-Problot (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) membrane. The immunoreactive band was cut, and proteins were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems model 476A automated sequencer. Two EAP secretion cassettes were constructed (Fig. 1A). They differed from each other by their preprosequence that either corresponded to the prepropeptide of the S. cerevisiae α-factor fused to the first 69 amino acids of the EAP prosequence or to the authentic EAP preprosequence. Each expression cassette was put under the control of the galactose-inducible GRAP1 promoter and the PGK terminator in the multicopy plasmid pEMR730 to give plasmids p73E3 and p73E4, respectively. As shown in Table III, p73E3- and p73E4-transformed cells of c13-ABYS-86 secreted active enzyme into the medium. Production was higher with p73E4, as determined by a larger halo area produced on a skim milk plate (Fig. 2). Extracellular proteins accumulated in galactose-induced cultures of each transformed strain were analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies raised against EAP. In both cases, only one band was revealed, this signal corresponding to a 38-kDa protein, which is the expected size for mature EAP. The intensity of this signal was significantly higher with p73E4 than with p73E3 (Fig. 3). Proteins from crude cell extracts of each type of transformant were analyzed. Multiple bands corresponding to species heavier than mature EAP were detected in both cases, indicating an important accumulation of unprocessed and glycosylated forms, which were especially abundant in p73E3-transformed cells (Fig. 3). The amounts of extracellular EAP obtained in shake flask experiments, estimated after the results of Western blot analysis and milk clotting assays, were about 2 and 0.2 mg/liter with p73E4 and p73E3, respectively. Since the proteinase produced with p73E4 was secreted at a higher level and displayed the same N terminus as that of the fungal EAP (data not shown), this expression cassette was kept for further studies.Table III:Yeast plasmids used and halo formation by transformant of S. cerevisiae strain c13-ABYS-86 Open table in a new tab Figure 3:Comparison of two EAP expression cassettes in S. cerevisiae.

Pitts J.E. Nugent P. Mantafounis D. Lawler S.E. Blundell T.L. Uusitalo J. Pentilla M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 265SCrossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki J. Hamu A. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The first one, called EAP(hyb161-169), differed from the native EAP cDNA by the replacement of a putative surface loop sequence with the similar region of chymosin, and the second one, called EAP(Leu224→ Lys), by a single-residue change at a position close to the catalytically essential Asp222 residue (Asp215 in pepsin numbering). These mutations were separately introduced into p73E4 to yield plasmids p73E6 and p73E8, respectively. No halo was detected with p73E6- and p73E8-transformed cells grown on skim milk plates (Table III). Moreover, Western blot analysis of culture supernatants and cell extracts revealed an accumulation of cross-reacting material located specifically inside the cells; no such material was detected in the culture medium. Thus, EAP secretion was impaired in both mutants. The secretion defect linked to structural modifications could result from an incorrect folding of the precursor, thus preventing progression through the secretion pathway, from the absence of activity impeding a putative self-processing process required to progress through the pathway, or both. To test whether an inactive enzyme could be secreted, we constructed an EAP variant in which the catalytically essential Asp35 residue (similar to Asp32 in pepsin) was replaced by Gly. The resulting expression plasmid, namely p73E19, was used to transform c13-ABYS-86, a strain deficient in vacuolar proteinases, and in FF18237, a normal proteolytic strain. Both transformants accumulated intracellular EAP-related material, but these proteins appeared to be much more degraded with FF18237 than with c13-ABYS-86 (data not shown). However, no EAP forms were secreted by any strains. Taken together, these results suggested that only mature forms could be secreted and that maturation was achieved by a self-processing mechanism. If this hypothesis was correct, one should expect that inactive forms would never be secreted. Three methods were tested for obtaining the secretion of the EAP in the absence of a self-processing mechanism. The first one consisted in the insertion of a Kex2-like recognition site between the pro and the mature region of the EAP sequence (Fig. 1B). This cleavage site was introduced into three EAP sequences: namely EAP(Leu224→ Lys), EAP(hyb-161-169)), and wild-type EAP cDNA, to get plasmids p73E9, p73E11, and p73E12, respectively. C13-ABYS-86 cells transformed by these plasmids were analyzed. A halo of hydrolysis was detected on skim milk plates only with p73E12-transformed cells; the area of this halo was nevertheless much reduced as compared to that obtained with p73E4 (I). Furthermore, p73E12 supernatant exhibited an immunoreactive EAP band but of weaker intensity than that obtained with p73E4 (data not shown). No signal was detected in the supernatants of p73E9- and p73E11-transformed cells, and the same pattern of multiple reactive bands was observed in the corresponding cell-free crude extracts as already observed with p73E6 and p73E8 (data not shown). Thus, the addition of a Kex2 cleavage site was not efficient in completing the secretion of the variants. Two new variants of the p73E4 expression cassette were designed that were devoid of any prosequence (Fig. 1C). Since the exact length of the EAP putative signal sequence was not known and, according to computer analyses, could correspond to the first 20 or 22 codons of the eapA gene, each putative peptide signal-encoding sequence was fused directly in frame with the mature part-encoding region to yield plasmid p73E29 (shorter form, pre1-EAP) and plasmid p73E30 (longer form, pre2-EAP), respectively. The corresponding S. cerevisiae strain c13-ABYS-86 transformants secreted no active EAP since neither halo formation nor extracellular protease activity was detected on skim milk plates and enzyme assays, respectively (I). Furthermore, as shown by Western blot analysis, transformants producing pre-EAP accumulated EAP material at high level intracellularly, but none could be detected in the culture medium (data not shown). Since a very strong band corresponding to the size of the mature EAP was clearly observed in both extracts, we checked whether EAP activity could be recovered from concentrated crude cell extracts. No milk coagulating activity was detected (data not shown). These observations suggested that the complete deletion of the prosequence blocked EAP secretion and resulted into the intracellular accumulation of inactive forms. As it is well established that prodomains may contribute to the correct folding of precursor and are thus required for efficient intracellular transit, we investigated whether the inefficient secretion of the pro-defective EAP constructs could be corrected in trans by the pro region. To facilitate the simultaneous expression of the propeptide with pre1-EAP or with pre2-EAP, the respective coding sequences were put under the control of the same promoter (GRAP1) and terminator (PGK) and introduced into the same multicopy plasmid, resulting in expression vectors p73E39 and p73E40, respectively (Table I:, Table II:). Yeast cells, transformed by each of these plasmids, remained unable to secrete any form of EAP and exhibited the same intracellular profile in Western blots as observed for the p73E29 and p73E39 transformants (data not shown). This result indicated that transcomplementation was not effective in rescuing the secretion defect linked to the deletion of the prosequence. Improving EAP specificity toward the Phe105-Met106 cleavage of the casein κ-chain might be obtained by mutagenesis. However, we had foreseen that such modified enzymes might no longer be able to recognize and cleave their own processing site unless the site was changed accordingly. Thus, the authentic maturation site of the EAP precursor in the p73E4 plasmid was replaced by a sequence similar to that of the cleavage site of casein κ-chain (Fig. 1B). The first corresponding construct, namely prepro-case1-EAP, was cloned into an expression plasmid to give p73E25. When assayed on skim milk plates, p73E25-transformed cells did not form any halo (Table III); surprisingly, secreted weak amounts of immunoreactive proteins whose sizes corresponded to the mature and zymogen forms, respectively, were detected (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the corresponding crude extracts exhibited an intense immunoreactive band of the EAP mature size among additional bands. The culture medium was concentrated 35-fold, then analyzed by milk clotting assay and immunoblotting. This concentrated sample displayed a proteolytic activity similar to that of p73E4 supernatant (data not shown) and revealed three major bands in addition to a smear of high molecular weight material corresponding to overglycosylated precursor, as indicated by treatment with endoglycosidase H (data not shown). One of the major proteins co-migrated with mature EAP and could account for the observed proteolytic activity. The two others were of higher molecular weight and likely corresponded to core-glycosylated proforms. These results confirmed the presence in small amounts of both the mature enzyme and of glycosylated precursor forms in p73E25 supernatant and revealed the existence of a bottleneck in the secretion and the maturation of procase1-EAP. To check whether these effects could be due to structural modifications in the vicinity of the processing site, we analyzed this region by the computer-assisted procedure of Chou and Fasman(20Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-147PubMed Google Scholar). A highly probable α-helix structure, corresponding to the sequence Gly-Leu-Ala-Glu-Arg, was detected close to the C terminus. Interestingly, this motif was lacking in the preprocase1-EAP. To test whether this putative α-helical secondary structure might play a role in the progression through the secretory pathway, the corresponding Gly-Leu-Ala-Glu-Arg motif was reinserted after the Ser-6 residue in p73E25 to yield preprocase2-EAP in plasmid p73E26. Such a modification of the processing site induced full restoration of the EAP secretion level, as shown by the halo size (I) and by the activity assay performed on the culture medium of p73E26-transformed cells. Moreover, as already observed with p73E4, no zymogen form was detected in this supernatant (Fig. 4). It is worth noting that the N terminus of the case2-EAP was nevertheless different from that of the authentic enzyme; the cleavage of the proform occurred between the Ser-Phe bond instead of the Phe-Met bond as in the authentic prepro-EAP. Since many eukaryotic proteinases have been secreted efficiently in S. cerevisiae, we have designed a convenient EAP expression system for yeast as a prerequisite for initiating a protein engineering program. The entire cDNA encoding prepro-EAP was introduced into S. cerevisiae, and the results showed that: 1) the C. parasitica EAP prepro region was functional in yeast and more efficient in directing EAP secretion than the yeast α factor prepro region, and 2) the yeast EAP was secreted and correctly processed as a mature and biologically active form identical to the authentic fungal enzyme(3Razanamparany V.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have already suggested that the maturation of EAP is carried out by an autocatalytic process. This hypothesis is greatly supported by our results since we could never obtain the maturation of inactive mutant enzymes. It should be noted that we have obtained similar results when expressing the same mutants in C. parasitica (data not shown). In this respect, EAP would not be different from other aspartic proteinases including those of fungal origin(21van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Aikawa J. Hiramatsu R. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Dunn B.M.

Boileau G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 3: 283-286Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, mutations resulting in the inactivation of EAP provoke the intracellular accumulation of the proform, which suggests that the deletion of the proregion is required for the progression of this enzyme through the secretory pathway. Since the addition of a Kex2 cleavage site between the pro and mature parts of inactive EAP mutants does not enhance the secretion of mature forms, it is probable that proforms cannot reach the medium cisternae of the Golgi apparatus where the KEX2 gene product is located. The ability of the native EAP to cleave this Kex2-like recognition site (p73E12) can be explained by the similarity between native and Kex2 sequences (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, we presumed that the propeptide is normally clipped off autocatalytically at an early step of the secretion pathway, likely in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or later in the cis-cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. Without the cleavage event, the enzyme cannot be secreted. This situation is quite different from that of Mucor pusillus rennin (MPR). The secretion of an inactive variant of MPR, very similar to one of our EAP variants (MPR(Asp38→ Gly) to be compared with our EAP(Asp35→ Gly)) was reported in S. cerevisiae. This inactive enzyme could be secreted either as a proform or even as a mature MPR when PEP4+ strains of yeast were used as hosts(22Aikawa J. Hiramatsu R. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Dunn B.M. Structures and Function of the Aspartic Proteinases: Genetics, Structure, and Mechanisms. Plenum Press, New York1991: 233-242Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding EAP variant cannot be secreted. Considering the essential chaperonin-like role played by the propeptide in the secretion of several proteinases(24Winther J.R. Sörensen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9330-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Fabre E. Tharaud C. Gaillardin C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7006-7012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the failure to secrete prodeleted EAP was not surprising; the resulting enzyme was accumulated intracellularly as an inactive and presumably unfolded form (29Helenius A. Marquardt T. Braakman I. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), but, in contrast to results obtained with other proteinases (25Fabre E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9556-9561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the coexpression in vivo of the pro-deleted EAP and of its preprosequence could rescue neither secretion nor activity of the enzyme. The correct folding and secretion of EAP is probably dependent on a covalent link between the propeptide and the mature protein. Assuming the requirement of a covalently linked prosequence, we undertook the engineering of a chimeric maturation site, according to the required peptide target to be cleaved into the κ-casein. The difference in the secretion level of case1-EAP (p73E25) and case2-EAP (p73E26) confirms the importance of the propeptide C-terminal region, which was outlined in the case of yeast carboxypeptidase Y(28Ramos C. Winther J.R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7006-7012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); prediction of the EAP secondary structure in this region revealed the conformation of two putative α-helices, already described as a common feature of the propeptides for which chaperone-like function has been suggested(24Winther J.R. Sörensen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9330-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, a putative Asn-linked glycosylation site, located upstream from this helical structure, might become more accessible in the prepro-case1-EAP than in the authentic precursor and cause overglycosylation that subsequently disturbs both the maturation process and the progression through the secretory pathway. However, the correctly expressed plasmid p73E26, containing the prepro-case2-EAP cassette, might be a convenient tool for extended mutagenesis of eapA to restrict its substrate specificity.

Nuclear run-on analyses using COS-1 cells cotransfected with p21 cDNA and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter indicated that p21 inhibits transcription initiation by targeting a region in the RSV LTR promoter between positions -108 and -85 upstream of the cap site. Insertion of this 24-base pair sequence in place of one of the 72-base pair enhancers in the SV40 early promoter rendered it sensitive to p21 repression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a synthetic oligomer corresponding to the 24-base pair LTR promoter element revealed that p21 altered the pattern of protein.DNA complex formation apparently without binding DNA directly. Complex formation assayed by UV cross-linking and DNA affinity chromatography indicated further that a cellular factor which can interact with this element was decreased in cells transfected with p21 expression plasmid. The results indicate that p21 repression of RSV LTR is mediated by a cis-acting element and may occur by alteration of protein complexes formed on this promoter element."
