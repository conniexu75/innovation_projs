We found that p21ras was singly S-nitrosylated and localized this modification to a fragment of p21ras containing Cys118. A mutant form of p21ras, in which Cys118 was changed to a serine residue and termed p21rasC118S, was not S-nitrosylated. NO-related species stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on wild-type p21ras, resulting in an active form, but not on p21rasC118S. Furthermore, in contrast to parental Jurkat T cells, NO-related species did not stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in cells transfected with p21rasC118S. These data indicate that Cys118 is a critical site of redox regulation of p21ras, and S-nitrosylation of this residue triggers guanine nucleotide exchange and downstream signaling.

It is well known that signal transduction pathways initiated by extracellular ligands are dependent on protein-protein interactions for propagation and amplification of their signal. Many of these interactions lead to phosphorylation events. For example, receptor-tyrosine kinases require a series of protein interactions utilizing SH2 and SH3 domains of adaptor proteins to generate an activated form of p21ras, a critical signaling enzyme (1Bokoch G.M.

Among the many recently discovered functions of NO, a role in signaling has surfaced (9Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Although soluble guanylyl cyclase is an important target of NO in mediating some of its physiologic functions such as the regulation of blood pressure (10Nathan C.

We have identified p21ras as a critical target of NO and other redox modulators (17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 18Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell-Burk S. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Here, we sought an understanding of the structural basis of the NO-p21ras interaction in the hope of gaining insight into how redox signaling is achieved. p21ras(1-166) was expressed and purified as described previously (20Campbell-Burk S.L. Carpenter J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). p21rasC118S(1-166) was expressed and purified similarly. Codon 118 of truncated (codons 1-166) Ha-ras cDNA was mutated from TGT (cysteine) to TCT (serine) using the polymerase chain reaction. The generated cDNA fragment was then sequenced (Sequenase) and cloned into the pATras bacterial expression vector. To generate full-length p21rasC118S an NcoI/BamHI fragment (encoding residues 111-166 of the ras(1-166) mutant) was exchanged for a 0.8-kilobase fragment encoding residues 111-189 plus 3′-noncoding region and the coding junction sequenced. A BglII/BamHI fragment encoding full-length Ras(C118S) was then subcloned into the BamHI site of the pCDNA3 mammalian expression plasmid and orientation confirmed by BstXI digestion. One small crystal of CNBr (Fluka) was added to 100 pmol of p21ras in 20 μl of 0.1 N HCl in a 0.5-ml polypropylene tube. Digestion was carried out at room temperature for 10 min prior to analysis by ESI-MS. After 10 min, samples were directly electrosprayed into a Finnigan-MAT TSQ-700 triple quadrupole instrument for analysis of S-nitrosylation exactly as we described previously (21Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17185-17188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NO solutions were prepared as we described previously (17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution, pH 8.0, in a rubber-stoppered tube was sparged for 15 min with N2 and then 15 min with NO gas (Matheson Gas, East Rutherford, NJ). This resulted in a saturated solution of NO (1.25 mM). This solution also contained higher oxides of NO which were not quantified. GDP-preloaded p21ras or p21rasC118S was analyzed for guanine nucleotide exchange activity as we described previously (17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Basal rates of hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP were 24.6 ± 6 fmol of PO4− released/min/mg for the wild-type enzyme and 18.4 ± 5 fmol/min/mg for p21rasC118S. The human T cell line Jurkat was grown in RPMI 1640 containing 2%L-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection cells were washed in serum-free medium and resuspended to 1-5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free medium. Liposomes (50 μl of Lipofectin, Life Technologies, Inc.) were mixed with a solution of 10 μg of p21rasC118S plasmid in 150 μl of sterile water. This was then added to 1 ml of culture and placed into culture flasks. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2, the cells were supplemented with 3 ml of selection medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2%L-glutamine, and 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.)). After another 24 h, cells were resuspended and maintained in the selection medium. Mock transfected cells did not receive any DNA. After 3-4 weeks in selection medium, transfected cells were analyzed for p21ras levels via Western blotting. MAP kinase activity was measured in an in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate, as we described previously (18Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved cells (24 h, 5 × 106) were treated for 30 min at 37°C, pelleted, and then resuspended in 300 μl of RIPA buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mM NaVO3, 2 mM NaPPi, 20% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Samples were vortexed, left on ice for 15 min, and then microcentrifuged for 2 min. Protein A-Sepharose prebound to anti-ERK1 or ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to supernatants (5 μg/sample). After 1 h at 4°C, samples were washed twice with RIPA buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mMβ-glcerophosphate, 25 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM NaVO3). After the final wash, samples were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer, and 1 μg of myelin basic protein was added along with 22 μl of 10 μCi/nmol [γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min at 30°C, 4 μl of 6 × Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol was added, and samples were boiled for 2 min. Samples were run on 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and were analyzed via a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Our earlier studies correlated a single S-nitrosylation event on full-length p21ras with enhanced guanine nucleotide exchange (17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In the present in vitro studies, p21ras lacking the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids is used. This form of p21ras is commonly used for in vitro studies and possesses biochemical activity identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (22John J. Schlichting I. Schiltz E. Rosch P. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13086-13092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the exact site of S-nitrosylation, we took advantage of the fact that cleavage of p21ras at Met residues with CNBr yields three major fragments each containing a single Cys residue (Fig. 1). We monitored each of the Cys residues for S-nitrosylation by subjecting p21ras to CNBr digestion followed by analysis using ESI-MS. In this ESI-MS assay, the molecular mass of samples treated with NO is compared with that of untreated samples. An increase in mass of 29 ± 1 Da (the mass of NO, 30 Da, minus the mass of the substituted proton) and its lability to increased energy input are indicative of S-nitrosylation (21Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17185-17188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As seen in Table I, CNBr digestion of p21ras yielded a fragment with a molecular mass of 6,223 ± 2 Da, corresponding to Fragment 3 (Fig. 1). Upon treatment of p21ras with NO and subsequent cleavage with CNBr, Fragment 3 had a new mass clearly indicative of S-nitrosylation (Table I); that is, the mass of Fragment 3 from NO-treated p21ras was equal to that of the unmodified Fragment 3 (6,223 Da) plus that of NO (30 Da). This fragment contains Cys118, and thus this Cys residue is the likely target of NO. It is possible that Fragments 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) were not observed because of inter- and intramolecular hydrophobic interactions that precluded their solubilization.Table I.ESI-MS analysis of various p21ras preparationsAnalyteMolecular massDifferenceaDifference refers to the mass difference between the untreated and NO-treated preparations within each group.DaDaCNBr-cleaved p21ras6,223 ± 2CNBr-cleaved p21ras+ NO6,253 ± 230p21ras18,852 ± 2p21ras+ NO18,882 ± 230p21ras (C118S)18,836 ± 2p21ras (C118S) NO18,836 ± 20a Difference refers to the mass difference between the untreated and NO-treated preparations within each group. Open table in a new tab To confirm that Cys118 was indeed the site of S-nitrosylation, we generated a form of p21ras identical to the wild-type enzyme, except that Cys118 was modified to a Ser residue (referred to as p21rasC118S). This modification only changes the sulfur atom of Cys118 to oxygen, thus reducing the mass of the enzyme by 16 Da to 18,836 Da. We treated wild-type p21ras with NO under conditions in which we achieved approximately 50% S-nitrosylation. Analysis by ESI-MS revealed the parent enzyme (mass = 18,852 Da) and a singly S-nitrosylated derivative (mass = 18,882 Da, Table I). Treatment of p21rasC118S with NO under identical conditions resulted in no S-nitrosylated product but only the parent enzyme (Table I). These data identify Cys118 as the molecular target of NO on p21ras. Having established that Cys118 is the site of interaction of NO on p21ras, we examined whether this S-nitrosylation was responsible for NO-induced p21ras activation and subsequent downstream signaling events. We have found previously that NO and other free radicals induce guanine nucleotide exchange on p21ras in cells and in vitro (17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 18Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell-Burk S. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether NO could induce nucleotide exchange on GDP-preloaded p21rasC118S in vitro Direct measurement of exchange relies on a filter binding assay to which our p21ras(1-166) protein does not bind quantitatively (22John J. Schlichting I. Schiltz E. Rosch P. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13086-13092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mistou M.Y. Jacquet E. Poullet P. Rensland H. Gideon P. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, to measure exchange, GDP-preloaded p21ras is treated with NO in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP, and hydrolyzed 32Pi is quantified. We have previously shown this to be a measure of exchange in our system (17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, NO potently stimulated [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis of GDP-preloaded wild-type p21ras (open circles). In contrast, NO had almost no effect on the exchange rate of p21rasC118S (Fig. 2, closed circles). The basal rates of hydrolysis for the two enzymes were similar (24.6 ± 6 fmol of PO4− released/min/mg for the wild-type enzyme and 18.4 ± 5 fmol/min/mg for p21rasC118S). A clear biphasic curve of activation and subsequent inhibition by higher concentrations of NO was seen. We and others have previously seen this type of biphasic behavior of NO in many systems (15Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 24Sheffler L.A. Wink D.A. Melillo G. Cox G.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory component may be due to nonspecific noxious effects of high concentrations of NO and its higher oxides or due to quenching (25Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hanset B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These data indicate that interaction of NO with Cys118 is required for NO-induced guanine nucleotide exchange on p21ras. Since NO and other redox modulators can stimulate several biochemical events downstream of p21ras, such as nuclear factor κB translocation and MAP kinase activity (15Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 26Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we examined whether Cys118 on p21ras is a target for NO in cells. Using Jurkat T cells mock transfected or stably transfected with an expression plasmid encoding a full-length version of p21rasC118S (i.e. residues 1-189), we examined the ability of NO to activate MAP kinase activity. Immunoprecipitation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 from wild-type cells treated with NO-generating compounds S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine or sodium nitroprusside resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of the ERK substrate (Fig. 3A, open bars). In contrast, Jurkat T cells stably expressing p21rasC118S(1-189) did not respond to NO in this in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3A, hatched bars). These transfected cells expressed 7-10-fold more p21ras than the wild-type cells as determined by Western blotting with anti-p21ras antibody, Y13-259 (Fig. 3B). This antibody cannot distinguish between wild-type and p21rasC118S, suggesting that although endogenous p21ras was not specifically inhibited, ectopic expression of high levels of mutant p21ras apparently prevented its signaling. This dominant negative activity of p21rasC118S toward NO action may be due to its high level of expression. The pool of effectors available for wild-type p21ras to interact with may be reduced greatly by overexpression of p21rasC118S, perhaps due to their sequestration. Another possibility is that MAP kinase activity is suppressed in the mutant cells. To test this, we treated parental and transfected cells with phorbol myristate acetate (100 ng/ml) and the calcium ionophore A23187 (500 ng/ml) for 5 min. We found that these agents, which bypass p21ras in activating MAP kinase, stimulated MAP kinase activity in both cell types (i.e. 221 ± 8 versus 261 ± 9% of control, parental versus transfected). Thus, NO donors did not stimulate MAP kinase activity in p21rasC118S-transfected cells although these cell harbored a functional MAP kinase system. These data indicate that Cys118 is indeed the target of NO on p21ras responsible for triggering downstream signal transduction. Redox regulation of signaling pathways currently presents several conceptual riddles. These include identifying the source of regulatory redox species, maintaining specificity, and identifying the redox target. Our earlier work demonstrated a functional requirement for p21ras in NO signaling (17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Here, we have focused on identifying the molecular target of NO on p21ras. We have identified Cys118 as the critical site of S-nitrosylation. The crystal structure of p21ras is well defined (27Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 28Scherer A. John J. Linke R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and modeling studies show that Cys118 is the most surface accessible of the three Cys residues in our p21ras preparation. Using the program X-PLOR (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) the solvent accessible surface of p21ras complexed to GDP (coordinates obtained from the NMR solution structure) was calculated using a 1.4 Å radius probe. Whereas the solvent accessibility of Cys51 and Cys80 side chains were similar and fairly shielded from the solvent, Cys118 was solvent exposed. The buried nature of residues Cys80 and Cys51 provides a structural basis of why a single S-nitrosylation occurs on p21ras upon exposure to NO. A mechanistic understanding of how S-nitrosylated Cys118 leads to enhanced guanine nucleotide exchange will likely be provided by solving its x-ray crystal structure. However, some insight is gained from considering what is currently known about p21ras structure and function. Cys118 is located within a highly conserved region (NKXD) of the ras superfamily and indeed all GTP-binding protein sequences. This NKXD motif, in which Cys118 is the variable X residue in p21ras, interacts directly with the guanine nucleotide ring of GTP and GDP and with other nucleotide-binding loops of the protein (29Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Independent mutation of residue 116, 117, or 119 leads to an increased dissociation rate of bound nucleotide, resulting in an increased rate of nucleotide exchange (30Der C.J. Pan B.T. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3291-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although our p21rasC118S mutant had basal rates of guanine nucleotide exchange similar to those of the wild-type protein, it is possible that S-nitrosylation results in an alteration in protein-GDP contact, resulting in nucleotide exchange. The presence of a redox-active residue in such a critical domain suggests that its conservation may reveal enzymes and transductional systems that may be similarly regulated. In the ras superfamily, Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras, rap1A, rap1B, rab1, and rab3 contain a Cys residue in this conserved region. In contrast, ral, tc21, R-ras, rap2, and rho gene products do not. Within the ras subfamily, this Cys residue is conserved from slime mold to man. Such conservation suggests that this molecular redox trigger is an important mechanism by which cells respond to reactive free radicals. It is likely that this molecular switch is regulated by cellular antioxidant levels. We have shown previously that reducing cellular glutathione levels renders the p21ras signaling pathway dramatically more sensitive to redox activation (18Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). According to this model, as glutathione is oxidized, the Cys switch on p21ras becomes available for modification, and a preprogrammed signaling cascade is initiated. Glutathione or other low molecular weight thiols likely play an important role in S-nitrosylation of p21ras. NO, under anaerobic conditions, cannot participate in S-nitrosylation. NO must be converted to a redox active form such as nitrosonium ion (NO+; Ref. 9Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). This occurs rapidly in the presence of metals or thiols, and thus S-nitrosoglutathione may be a crucial reservoir of redox active NO. Such a redox-triggered signaling pathway may also provide a mechanistic understanding of some recent observations identifying a requirement for reactive free radicals in mediating platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. In those studies (4Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), PDGF stimulated H2O2 production in vascular smooth muscle cells. When H2O2 production was blocked, PDGF-induced enhancement of MAP kinase activity, chemotaxis, and DNA synthesis was prevented. Many of these PDGF-dependent events require p21ras, and thus the redox-sensitive target, Cys118, is likely to be involved in this reactive free radical-dependent signaling cascade. Modification of Cys by redox modulators other than NO, such as hydroxyl radical or heavy metals, would necessitate a Cys modification that is chemically different from the S-nitrosylation described herein. However, the structural alterations may ultimately be the same."
https://openalex.org/W1996962669,"It has previously been shown that maximal activation of Raf-1 is produced by synergistic signals from oncogenic Ras and activated tyrosine kinases. This synergy arises because Ras-GTP translocates Raf-1 to the plasma membrane where it becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues 340 and 341 by membrane-bound tyrosine kinases (Marais, R., Light, Y., Paterson, H. F., and Marshall, C. J. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 3136-3145). We have examined whether the other two members of the Raf family, A-Raf and B-Raf, are regulated in a similar way to Raf-1. A-Raf behaves like Raf-1, being weakly activated by oncogenic Ras more strongly activated by oncogenic Src, and these signals synergize to give maximal activation. B-Raf by contrast is strongly activated by oncogenic Ras alone and is not activated by oncogenic Src. These results show that maximal activation of B-Raf merely requires signals that generate Ras-GTP, whereas activation of Raf-1 and A-Raf requires Ras-GTP together with signals that lead to their tyrosine phosphorylation. B-Raf may therefore be the primary target of oncogenic Ras.

Biochemical studies in vertebrate cells together with genetic analysis in Caenorhabiditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have defined a conserved signal transduction pathway consisting of receptor tyrosine kinases, p21ras, Raf serine/threonine protein kinases, Mek 1The abbreviations used are:Mekmitogen-activated protein kinase kinaseERKRas/extracellular signal-related kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMBPmyelin basic proteinwtwild typeGSTglutathione S-transferase. (ERK activator or MAPKK) dual specificity kinases, and ERK (MAPK) serine/threonine protein kinases. One important target of this signal transduction pathway is the phosphorylation of transcription factors of the Elk and Ets families by ERKs (2Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Signaling through this pathway can mediate differentiation, proliferation, or oncogenic transformation, depending on cellular context (3Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). While the overall organization of the pathway in all cell types appears to be similar, there may be important differences in detail that could contribute to the specificity, magnitude, or duration of signal output. For example, while C. elegans and D. melanogaster appear to have only one Ras homologue (4Dickson B. Hafen E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), mammalian cells contain Ha-, N-, and Ki-Ras, as well as TC21 and R-Ras (5Graham S.M. Cox A.D. Drivas G. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P.

Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), all of which are potentially capable of interacting with Raf protein kinases. Furthermore, C. elegans and D. melanogaster appear to have only one Raf kinase (lin45 and DRaf, respectively), whereas mammalian cells contain 3 Raf genes encoding Raf-1 (otherwise known as c-Raf) A-Raf, and B-Raf (8Rapp U.R. Cleveland J.L. Bonner T.I. Storm S.M. Curran T.R. Skalka A. The Oncogene Handbook. Elsevier Science Ltd., London1988Google Scholar, 9Sithanandam G. Kolch W. Duh F.M. Rapp U. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1775-1780PubMed Google Scholar). To add further complexity, B-Raf has been shown to exist in multiple spliced forms (10Barnier J.V. Papin C. Eychene A. Lecoq O. Calothy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Eychene A. Dusanter-Fourt I. Barnier J.V. Papin C. Charon M. Gisselbrecht S. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1159-1165PubMed Google Scholar). A notable difference between B-Raf and Raf-1 is the absence of two tyrosine phosphorylation sites (equivalent to Tyr-340 and −341 in Raf-1) that are involved in the Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1 by tyrosine kinases (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 12Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The presence of aspartic acid residues at the equivalent positions in B-Raf suggests that its regulation may differ from Raf-1. Tyrosines equivalent to 340/341 of Raf-1 are also absent in DRaf and lin45, and, as in B-Raf, at least one of these residues is an acidic amino acid. mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase Ras/extracellular signal-related kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase myelin basic protein wild type glutathione S-transferase. Most work on the regulation of Raf protein kinases in vertebrate cells has studied Raf-1 (13Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) suggesting a need to determine whether A-Raf and B-Raf are similarly regulated. In cardiac myocytes, phorbol ester or endothelin treatment activates Raf-1 and A-Raf, but fibroblast growth factor only activates Raf-1 (14Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). B-Raf is preferentially activated in NIH3T3 cells following serum treatment (15Reuter C.W.M. Catling A.D. Jelinek T. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7644-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and in PC12 cells following nerve growth factor treatment (16Jaiswal R.K. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Landreth G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that there may be differential regulation of different members of the Raf family. Both biochemical studies and genetic analysis show that Ras proteins play a central role in the activation of Raf protein kinases. We and others have argued that Ras-GTP recruits Raf-1 to the plasma membrane for activation by membrane-mediated events that include phosphorylation by membrane-bound tyrosine kinases (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 18Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 19Jelinek T. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is not known how A-Raf and B-Raf respond to such signals. Previous work has shown that when expressed in mammalian or insect cells Raf-1 is activated by expression with oncogenic Ras or an oncogenic tyrosine kinase, but that the strongest activation is seen when co-expressed with both oncogenic Ras and an oncogenic tyrosine kinase (20Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have therefore used mammalian cell expression to compare the activation of Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf by oncogenic Ras, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase (SrcY527F), or the combination of oncogenic Ras and SrcY527F. The cDNAs for the Myc-tagged human Raf-1, SrcY527F, and oncogenic Ras (Ha-Ras Gly-12 → Arg) were cloned into the vector pEFPlink.2 and have been described previously (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for A-Raf and B-Raf were also cloned into pEFplink.2 incorporating a N-terminal Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) recognized by the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (21Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following a protocol previously described for NIH3T3 cells (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The cells were allowed to recover for 40 h, serum-starved for 24 h, and harvested. The cells were extracted and the Raf proteins were quantitated as described previously for NIH3T3 cells (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The activity of each Raf protein was assessed following the procedures of Alessi et al. (22Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Asworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Raf proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4°C from ∼3-50 μg of cell extracts (dependent on Raf construct and the efficiency of transfection) with ∼20 μg of 9E10 monoclonal antibody immobilized on Protein G-Sepharose. The beads were subjected to 1 × 500 μl wash with wash buffer (30 mM Tris·HCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mM NaF, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, pH 7.5) containing 1.0 M KCl, 1 × 500 μl wash with wash buffer containing 0.1 M KCl, and 1 × 500 μl wash with wash buffer. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of reactivation buffer (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) containing 6.5 μg/ml GST-Mek1 or GST-Mek2 and 100 μg/ml GST-ERK2. The beads were incubated at 30°C for 5-30 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of reactivation buffer lacking MgCl2 and ATP, but containing 20 mM EDTA. The supernatants were collected and the activity of the GST-ERK2 in 10 μl of supernatant was determined using MBP as a substrate, as described previously (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). These were performed as described previously (18Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In order to study the activation of the Raf proteins, we constructed plasmids to express Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf, each with a N-terminal Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody tag (21Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The version of B-Raf used corresponds to the protein with a calculated molecular mass of 84.4 kDa that lacks the neuronal specific exon 10 (10Barnier J.V. Papin C. Eychene A. Lecoq O. Calothy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The use of the same epitope tag permits us to analyze the expressed Raf proteins and to follow specifically mutant versions of the proteins. All three Raf proteins have been shown to interact with Ras-GTP in either yeast two-hybrid systems (23Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) or in vitro using immobilized Ras-GTP (24Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that the interaction of Raf-1 with Ras-GTP leads to translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane which is a key step in Raf-1 activation (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 18Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). We tested whether the interaction of other members of the Raf family with Ras-GTP could translocate them to the plasma membrane. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were microinjected with expression vectors for the Myc-tagged Raf constructs in the absence or presence of expression vectors for oncogenic Ras. The cells were stained for the recombinant Raf proteins using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody or for the Ras protein using a mixture of the monoclonal antibodies Y13-238 and Y13-259. All three Raf proteins were found to be located in the cytoplasm when expressed alone, but when co-expressed with oncogenic Ras all were found translocated to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). The results we observed with B-Raf are in contrast to those obtained by Jelinek et al. (19Jelinek T. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) who, using biochemical fractionation techniques, failed to observe B-Raf associated with the particulate fraction of Ras transformed cells. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear but may reflect a greater sensitivity of the immunocytochemical methods we have used. The translocation to the plasma membrane of all Raf proteins is dependent on Ras being in the active GTP-bound state, since co-injection of Raf expression vectors with an N17Ras expression vector did not lead to membrane translocation (data not shown). The replacement of Ser-17 by Asn (N17Ras) has been shown to generate a form of Ras that is mainly in the GDP-bound state and cannot undergo the conformational switch on binding GTP (25Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). We next examined whether A-Raf and B-Raf are activated by oncogenic Ras and oncogenic Src. Plasmids expressing each Raf protein were transfected into COS7 cells alone or together with oncogenic Ras, SrcY527F, or with both oncogenes together. We have previously demonstrated that when Raf-1 is expressed in NIH3T3 cells together with oncogenic Ras and SrcY527F, it becomes phosphorylated, and consequently its mobility in SDS gels is reduced (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In COS cells, Raf-1 migrates as a protein with a mass of ∼70,000 (Fig. 2A, closed arrow), and this mobility is little affected by the presence of oncogenic Ras (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). In the presence of SrcY527F, a small portion of Raf-1 undergoes a reduction in mobility (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). By comparison, in the presence of both oncogenic Ras and SrcY527F, a greater proportion of Raf-1 undergoes a larger mobility shift than in the presence of SrcY527F alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). It has been shown previously that the mobility shift characteristic of Raf-1 that results from activation of ERK kinases does not directly reflect the activation status of Raf-1 (27Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 28Alessi D.R. Cueda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). A-Raf is also subject to a Ras- and Src-induced mobility shift, although to a lesser degree than seen for Raf-1. In this gel system, A-Raf migrates with a mass of ∼68,000 (Fig. 2A, open arrow) and undergoes a weak substoichiometric mobility shift in the presence of oncogenic Ras, SrcY527F, or in the presence of both oncogenes together (Fig. 2A, lanes 5- 8). B-Raf migrates as a protein with a mass of 93 kDa on this gel system (Fig. 2A, lane 9, open arrowhead) although its calculated mass including the Myc tag (1,510) is 86 kDa. In the presence of oncogenic Ras alone, B-Raf undergoes a large, stoichiometric shift in mobility, with an apparent increase in mass of ∼10,000 (Fig. 2A, lane 10, closed arrowhead). In the presence of SrcY527F, there is a minor shift in B-Raf mobility, and, in the presence of both oncogenes, the degree of shift is similar to that seen with oncogenic Ras alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 9-12). In these experiments, the plasmid ratios have been optimized to give similar amounts of Raf protein in each sample. However, there is some variability in the accumulation of Raf protein as a consequence of transfection variability and the actions of the oncogenes on the expression of Raf proteins. Therefore, in order to ensure equivalence in the subsequent kinase assays, the amount of Raf in each sample was determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis, using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody and iodinated protein A in conjunction with a PhosphorImager (data not shown). The samples were then mixed with appropriate extracts from cells transfected with oncogenic Ras, SrcY527F, or both oncogenes (but in the absence of Raf) to give samples with the same amount of cellular proteins and the same amount of exogenous Raf protein, but differing in which Raf isotype of they contain. We next examined the activation of the Raf kinases. Equivalent amounts of each kinase were immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody and subjected to a cascade kinase assay in which the Raf proteins were used to phosphorylate and activate recombinant GST-Mek1 which in turn was used to phosphorylate and activate recombinant GST-Erk2, both of which were produced in bacteria (22Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Asworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Raf-1 is weakly activated by oncogenic Ras and more strongly activated by SrcY527F, but both oncogenes synergize to give maximal Raf-1 activity (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that like Raf-1, A-Raf requires synergistic interactions from both oncogenic Raf and SrcY527F for maximal activation. B-Raf is clearly different from the other two Raf proteins. It is highly activated by oncogenic Ras and is not activated by Src, and there is no synergy between Ras and Src. To determine whether the activation of B-Raf by oncogenic Ras requires plasma membrane localization, we tested the ability of the HrasV12S186 double mutant to activate B-Raf. This double mutant is “locked” in the GTP-bound active state by the Gly-12 → Val mutation, but because Cys-186 is mutated to a serine it cannot be farnesylated and localized at the membrane (29Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). HRasV12S186 failed to activate B-Raf or any other of the Raf proteins (data not shown). Overall the response of A-Raf to oncogenic Ras or Src and the synergy between Ras and Src for activation is similar to Raf-1. However, it is clear that the level of A-Raf activity obtained under maximal activation conditions is only ∼20% of that for the same amount of Raf-1 and even less compared to an equivalent amount of B-Raf (Fig. 2B). We considered a possible explanation for this difference to be that A-Raf was unable to phosphorylate and activate GST-Mek1 as efficiently as Raf-1 and B-Raf. We therefore examined whether A-Raf was able to activate GST-Mek2 and how this compared to the abilities of Raf-1 and B-Raf to do likewise. We find that there is no difference in the ability of any of the Raf kinases to phosphorylate and activate either GST-Mek (Fig. 2C). Importantly, the activity of A-Raf from cells transfected together with oncogenic Ras and SrcY527F is also only ∼20% that seen with Raf-1 under these conditions. We conclude that with at least two substrates the activity of A-Raf is considerably lower than Raf-1 under comparable conditions. These data differ from the recent data of Wu et al. (30Wu X. Noh S.J. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) who have shown that A-Raf is a better activator of GST-Mek1 than of GST-Mek2 and we are unable to explain the differences between their data and ours. When equivalent amounts of each Raf protein are compared, it is clear that not only is B-Raf maximally activated by oncogenic Ras alone, but that it also has a much higher basal activity than Raf-1 or A-Raf. Fig. 2B shows that the basal activity of B-Raf when expressed in serum-starved cells is 15-20 times that of Raf-1 expressed under the same conditions. Since B-Raf is highly responsive to Ras-GTP, we considered it possible that the high basal activity of B-Raf was a consequence of its interaction with the low level of Ras-GTP that exists even in serum-starved cells. Depending on cell type and method of analysis, the basal level of Ras-GTP in unstimulated cells is between 0.5 and 10% (31Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 32Satoh T. Endo M. Nakafuku M. Akiyama T. Yamamoto T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7926-7929Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Using radioactive methods we routinely see about 5% Ras-GTP in serum-starved COS cells (data not shown). To determine whether the basal kinase activity of B-Raf depends on interaction with Ras-GTP, we constructed an Arg-187 → LeuB-Raf (R187LB-Raf) mutant. This mutation mimics the Arg-89 → Leu mutation of Raf-1 which cripples the interaction of the Ras binding domain and Ras-GTP (33Nassar N. Horn G. Herrman C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 34Hou X.S. Chou T.B. Melnick M.B. Perrimon N. Cell. 1995; 81: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and prevents B-Raf from being recruited to the plasma membrane when microinjected with oncogenic Ras (data not shown). We therefore determined the basal level of kinase activity of R187LB-Raf and found it to be indistinguishable from the activity of wt B-Raf (R187LB-Raf activity = 88%± 12% that of wt B-Raf). Thus the basal kinase activity of B-Raf is not a consequence of activation through interaction with basal Ras-GTP. The similarity to Raf-1 in the pattern of response of A-Raf to oncogenic Src or Ras suggested that Ras-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation is required for activation of A-Raf. In A-Raf amino acids 301/302, which are equivalent to Tyr-340/341 of Raf-1, are also tyrosines suggesting that these amino acids play a role in the activation of A-Raf. We substituted Tyr-301 and −302 in A-Raf with aspartic acid residues (A-RafDD) or phenylalanine residues (A-RafFF) and compared the activation of these mutants by oncogenic Ras or Src. Fig. 3A shows that substitution of Tyr-301 and −302 in A-Raf with phenylalanine eliminates the ability of A-Raf to be activated by SrcY527F, either with or without oncogenic Ras. Substitution with aspartic acid generates a protein that has an elevated basal level of activity of about 2.5 times that of wt A-Raf (p ≤ 0.01). A-RafDD is strongly activated by oncogenic Ras and is not activated by SrcY527F, and there is no synergy by these oncogenes in activating A-RafDD. These results essentially parallel those we previously obtained with Raf-1 although, unlike Raf-1, the levels of activation of A-RafDD are lower than is seen with wt A-Raf together with oncogenic Ras and SrcY527F (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). These data reinforce the conclusion that the regulation of A-Raf parallels that of Raf-1 and that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a key role in regulating the activity of these two Raf proteins by oncogenes. Amino acids 447 and 448 in B-Raf, equivalent to Tyr-340/341 in Raf-1, are aspartic acid residues. We have previously shown that substituting Tyr-340/341 in Raf-1 with aspartic acid residues generates (Raf-1DD) a kinase which like B-Raf is very responsive to oncogenic Ras and has a high basal activity (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Asp-447/448 are responsible for the Ras responsiveness and high basal activity of B-Raf. Substitution of aspartic acid residues 447 and 448 in B-Raf with phenylalanine markedly reduces B-Raf basal kinase activity (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 9) and reduced its responsiveness to oncogenic Ras to ∼30% of wild type levels. This is in contrast to what is seen with Raf-1Y340F/Y341F (Raf-1FF) and A-RafFF which cannot be activated by oncogenes (Ref. 1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar and Fig. 3A). We next examined how substitution of tyrosines at positions 447/448 in B-Raf (B-RafYY) affected activation by oncogenes. The basal kinase activity of B-RafYY is similar to wild type B-Raf, but surprisingly, B-RafYY still responds strongly to oncogenic Ras and is not significantly activated by SrcY527F (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, there is no synergy between oncogenic Ras and SrcY527F in activating B-RafYY (Fig. 3B). This observation suggests that while aspartic acid residues at 447 and 448 control B-Raf basal kinase activity additional factors control the response to Ras-GTP. The proposal that additional factors to the residues at 447/448 in B-Raf control Ras responsiveness is reinforced by the observation that whereas Raf-1FF is unresponsive to oncogenic Ras (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), B-RafFF retains ∼30% of the response of wild type B-Raf to oncogenic Ras (Fig. 3B). We have compared the abilities of oncogenic Ras or the activated tyrosine kinase, Y527FSrc, to activate Raf-1, A-Raf, or B-Raf. B-Raf is shown to be maximally activated by oncogenic Ras unlike Raf-1 or A-Raf. In contrast, oncogenic Src is a better activator than Ras of Raf-1 and A-Raf and does not appear to activate B-Raf. Activation of Raf-1 and A-Raf by Src requires tyrosine phosphorylation at residues 340 and 341 in Raf-1 and 301 and 302 in A-Raf. However, as we have demonstrated previously, activation of Raf-1 by tyrosine phosphorylation at amino acids 340/341 is a Ras-dependent event as p21ras-GTP is required to bring Raf-1 to the plasma membrane for tyrosine phosphorylation (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This requirement for the Ras-Raf-1 interaction for tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 results in the synergy between Ras and Src in Raf-1 activation. We propose that a similar mechanism results in the synergy between Ras and Src for the activation of A-Raf. B-Raf lacks the tyrosines equivalent to 340/341 in Raf-1 and thus cannot be regulated in the same way. At the positions equivalent to Tyr-340/341 in Raf-1, B-Raf has aspartic acid residues (amino acids 447/448), and these acidic amino acids control at least in part responsiveness to oncogenic Ras. Substitution of Asp-447/448 in B-Raf with phenylalanine markedly reduces the activation by Ras, and substitution of Tyr-340/341 with aspartic acid in Raf-1 or Tyr-301/302 in A-Raf increases responsiveness to Ras. However, since B-RafFF is still more responsive to Ras than Raf-1 or Raf-1FF, additional differences from Raf-1 must also control the response of B-Raf to oncogenic Ras. The nature of the amino acids at these sites also seems to affect the basal rate of kinase activity; B-Raf and Raf-1DD have a 10-20-fold greater basal kinase activity than Raf-1, and B-RafFF has a very much reduced basal rate compared to wild type B-Raf. The kinase activity of A-RafDD is also elevated relative to wild type A-Raf. Since C. elegans lin45 and D. melanogaster DRaf have either aspartic acid or glutamic acid at the positions equivalent to Tyr-340/341 in Raf-1 (35Mark G.E. MacIntyre R.J. Digan M.E. Ambrosio L. Perrimon N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2134-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Han M. Golden A. Han Y. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the regulation of these Raf proteins is likely to resemble B-Raf rather than Raf-1 or A-Raf. Thus for these Raf protein kinases the signal from the receptor tyrosine kinase to activate Ras may be the only signal needed to activate the MAPK cascade, whereas receptor tyrosine kinase activation of Raf-1 and A-Raf may require Ras activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf. Surprisingly the levels of activity of A-Raf in these experiments never reached those achieved by activation of Raf-1 or B-Raf. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Careful titration of input DNA together with equalization of protein in the samples, using the same epitope tag for each Raf family member, ensured that the same amount of each Raf protein was assayed. Low levels of A-Raf Mek kinase activity have also been reported by McMahon and collaborators (37Pritchard C.A. Samuels M.L. Bosch E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6430-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) who compared oncogenic versions of the three Raf proteins and found that A-Raf had the least ability to activate Mek in vitro The lower level of A-Raf activity relative to Raf-1 was reflected in the proportion of protein with a retarded electrophoretic ability in co-transfection with the activators. The slower migrating forms of A-Raf constituted less than 30% of total A-Raf, whereas at least 50% of the Raf-1 co-transfected with oncogenic Ras and Src had a retarded mobility. Interestingly co-transfection of B-Raf with oncogenic Ras resulted in most of the B-Raf having a retarded electrophoretic ability; co-transfection of B-Raf with activated Src had a much smaller effect. Another observation we have made suggests that there may be some differences in the activation of Raf-1 compared to A-Raf. While increasing the input of Raf-1 expression vector in the transfections had little effect on the activation of Raf-1, increasing the input of A-Raf DNA eventually resulted in A-Raf no longer becoming activated, suggesting that A-Raf activation required some limiting cellular component. These results point to important differences in the regulation of different Raf family members. Since B-Raf exists in multiple isoforms (10Barnier J.V. Papin C. Eychene A. Lecoq O. Calothy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Eychene A. Dusanter-Fourt I. Barnier J.V. Papin C. Charon M. Gisselbrecht S. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1159-1165PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that some of the other isoforms of B-Raf may be regulated differently from the isoform studied here. Oncogenic Ras maximally activates B-Raf, unlike Raf-1 and A-Raf suggesting that B-Raf rather than Raf-1 or A-Raf may be the primary target of oncogenic Ras in cell transformation. Such a hypothesis would be consistent with observations from Takai and collaborators (38Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11723-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) who have shown that a purified complex of B-Raf and 14-3-3 can be directly activated by recombinant Ras in vitro Jelinek et al. (19Jelinek T. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) failed to find increased B-Raf activity in Ras transformed cells; however, our own results with Ras transformed cells show that both Raf-1 and B-Raf are activated. 2M. Rosario and C. J. Marshall, unpublished data. Our data (1Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and that of Jelinek et al. (19Jelinek T. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) show that activation of Raf-1 by oncogenic Ras requires tyrosine phosphorylation. This tyrosine kinase activity may arise from the basal levels of tyrosine kinase activity in cells or could result from the stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity by autocrine growth factors which are known to be elaborated by Ras transformed cells (39Ciardiello F. Valverius E.M. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. Kim N. Bassin R.H. Salomon D.D. J. Cell Biochem. 1990; 42: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, cells containing oncogenic Ras could activate B-Raf by direct interaction with Ras-GTP and Raf-1 and A-Raf through Ras-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation.

Compositionally related membrane domains, which lack the invaginated morphology of caveolae as well as the membrane protein caveolin, have also been identified and biochemically separated from caveolae (10Schnitzer J.E.

These membrane domains, like caveolae, are resistant to solubilization in nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100, are enriched in sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, and are associated with palmitoyl-anchored signaling molecules including Src family tyrosine kinases (10Schnitzer J.E.

The molecular mechanism by which aggregation of FcεRI initiates its phosphorylation by Lyn is incompletely understood. Selective binding of Lyn directly to unphosphorylated FcεRI β (22Jouvin M.H.

The involvement of detergent-resistant membrane domains in FcεRI signaling was recently suggested by the observation that aggregation of FcεRI on RBL cells significantly increased the amount of active Lyn associated with these structures (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy studies showed that aggregation of FcεRI at the surface of intact cells co-redistributes ganglioside-enriched membrane patches that are related to the isolated membrane domains (29Pierini L.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Thomas J.L. Holowka D. Baird B. Webb W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The aggregation-dependent association of FcεRI with these less fluid regions of the membrane (30Thomas J.L. Holowka D. Baird B. Webb W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) is also consistent with decreased lateral and rotational mobility of aggregated FcεRI (reviewed in Ref. 32Holowka D. Baird B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present study, we establish conditions for preserving the interaction of aggregated FcεRI with these membrane domains following cell lysis, and we demonstrate the importance of this interaction to the initial step in signaling, the tyrosine phosphorylation of FcεRI.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn order to determine if the interaction of FcεRI with membrane domains is involved in the activation of this immunoreceptor, we developed conditions that preserve this association during the isolation of these complexes by equilibrium sucrose density ultracentrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1A, limiting amounts of Triton X-100 used for cell lysis preserve the association of aggregated FcεRI (•, ▪) with the detergent-resistant membrane domains which migrate as low density vesicles (fractions 3-7). In 29 separate experiments, 54 ± 7% of biotin-IgE FcεRI complexes aggregated with streptavidin associate with the membrane domains (•). Significant but lesser amounts of antigen-aggregated receptors associate (▪; 11 ± 1%, n = 6), most likely reduced by the partial reversal of IgE-antigen binding during the overnight ultracentrifugation. In contrast, monomeric FcεRI (○) is nearly absent from the membrane domains (3 ± 1%, n = 26) and found almost entirely in the 40% sucrose fractions containing solubilized proteins (fractions 10-16). The association of FcεRI with isolated membrane domains depends on its aggregation at the cell surface, as less than 5% association is seen for FcεRI aggregated after cell lysis or for FcεRI aggregated with antigen on cells and then dissociated with monovalent hapten after lysis.2 The interaction between aggregated FcεRI and the membrane domains is very sensitive to the detergent:cell lipid ratio during solubilization and ultracentrifugation, as indicated by its disruption when concentrations of Triton X-100 greater than 0.05% are used (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This sensitivity is similar to that observed by Pribluda et al. (23Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) for FcεRI coupling to Lyn in cell lysates, and it contrasts with cytoskeleton-mediated detergent insolubility of aggregated FcεRI (33Robertson D. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4565-4572PubMed Google Scholar, 34Seagrave J. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Physiol. 1990; 144: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Apgar J.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3814-3822PubMed Google Scholar), which is not disrupted by high Triton X-100 concentrations.Although this reduction in Triton X-100 used for cell lysis dramatically increases the amount of aggregated FcεRI that remains associated with detergent-resistant membrane domains, these domains are otherwise very similar to those isolated after lysis in high Triton X-100 (≥0.2%). When directly compared, domains from low and high detergent lysis conditions contain the same fraction of cellular Lyn, and neither has detectable amounts of Src.2 In addition, both preparations contain a similar spectrum of tyrosine kinase substrates as revealed in in vitro tyrosine kinase assays (Ref. 15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and as described below), and both contain similar amounts of cellular protein (<2% of the total).2 By these criteria, the domains obtained using 0.05% Triton X-100 for cell lysis appear to be identical to other membrane domains previously described that do not contain caveolin (10Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 13Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol.

Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the aggregation-dependent association of FcεRI with membrane domains shows selectivity among transmembrane cell surface receptors, as FcεRI but not Type I interleukin-1 receptors, both expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells, associate with membrane domains following aggregation. 3K. A. Field, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, manuscript in preparation. Association of FcεRI with membrane domains does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor subunits. As shown in Fig. 1B, RBL cells permeabilized with Streptolysin O in the presence of excess EDTA to inhibit kinase activity show a similar amount of aggregation-dependent association of FcεRI with domains as intact cells (Fig. 1A). As previously shown with broken cells (36Pribluda V.S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 11446-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FcεRI β and other substrates is prevented by EDTA in these permeabilized cells.2The presence of Lyn and aggregated FcεRI within the same subregions of the plasma membrane suggests that domain-associated Lyn could be responsible for the initial phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. FcεRI associates with membrane domains very rapidly at 37°C (○, Fig. 2A) and is more than 50% complete within 30 s, whereas substantially less than 50% of the maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of FcεRI β occurs during this time (•, Fig. 2A). The amount of β tyrosine phosphorylation declines after 2 min at 37°C, and domain-associated receptor also decreases between 5 and 30 min in parallel with its internalization.2 At 4°C, the association of FcεRI with domains occurs more slowly (○, Fig. 2B), but is clearly more rapid than the β tyrosine phosphorylation during the first 5 min (•, Fig. 2B). FcεRI internalization and downstream signaling such as Ca2+ mobilization and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis do not occur at 4°C (37WoldeMussie E. Maeyama K. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1674-1680PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that they are not required for domain association. These results demonstrate that association of FcεRI with membrane domains on cells is an early, aggregation-dependent event that is sufficiently rapid to mediate receptor tyrosine phosphorylation.Evidence for FcεRI tyrosine phosphorylation occurring within membrane domains of intact cells is shown in Fig. 3. Stimulation of biotin-IgE-sensitized RBL cells with streptavidin dramatically increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins. When lysates of these cells are analyzed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, most of the proteins with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation are found with the solubilized proteins at 40% sucrose (fractions 11-16), as expected (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Associated with the membrane domains (fractions 3-8) after stimulation are tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of approximately 90, 53/56, 45, 34, and 25-30 kDa. The 53/56-kDa doublet was identified as Lyn by reprobing the blot with rabbit anti-Lyn (UBI).2 Significantly, the 45-, 34-, and 25-30-kDa bands appear only with stimulation and are markedly enriched in membrane domains relative to the other fractions. The domain-associated proteins of 34 and 25-30 kDa correspond to phosphorylated β and γ2 FcεRI subunits, respectively, as identified by immunoprecipitating FcεRI from the sucrose gradient fractions (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3 clearly shows that the tyrosine-phosphorylated β and γ subunits are almost entirely associated with membrane domains. The majority of other tyrosine kinase substrates phosphorylated as the result of FcεRI aggregation are located in the solubilized protein fractions, presumably because they are cytosolic or associated with membranes that are solubilized in 0.05% Triton X-100. Syk, the ZAP-70-related tyrosine kinase responsible for phosphorylating the majority of substrates downstream of FcεRI (19Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Oliver J.M. Burg D.L. Wilson B.S. McLaughlin J.L. Geahlen R.L J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16902-16908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is also found exclusively in these soluble fractions,2 as expected because activated Syk is localized primarily in the cytosol after receptor stimulation (40Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L.

Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 Thus, following FcεRI aggregation on cells, Lyn phosphorylates the β and γ subunits of domain-associated receptors. This apparently leads to a transient association and the activation of Syk, followed by Syk-mediated phosphorylation of downstream substrates, most of which are not stably associated with membrane domains.Fig. 3Tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells of domain-associated FcεRI.

RBL cells either unstimulated or stimulated with 10 nM streptavidin for 2 min at 37°C were lysed with 0.05% Triton X-100 and analyzed as for Fig. 1. Sucrose fractions containing 1 mM Na3VO4 were pooled as indicated and electrophoresed and analyzed with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Apparent molecular masses are indicated on the left in kDa. In this experiment, 43% of the 125I-IgE-FcεRI was present in fractions 5-8 after stimulation. B, tyrosine phosphorylation of domain-associated FcεRI. IgE-FcεRI was immunoprecipitated in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100 from the indicated sucrose fractions from the streptavidin-stimulated (+) or unstimulated (−) gradients shown in A The relative amount of FcεRI in each lane is (left to right) 0.10, 1.00, 0.33, and 0.46 as determined by the associated 125I-IgE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Additional support for the involvement of these domains in initiating FcεRI activation comes from in vitro tyrosine kinase assays performed on sucrose fractions, followed by immunoprecipitation of FcεRI in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100 (which releases FcεRI from membrane domains). Fig. 4A shows that aggregated FcεRI associated with membrane domains isolated after cell lysis in 0.05% Triton X-100 (MD+) are efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated in vitro, whereas receptors in the sucrose fractions containing solubilized proteins (40+ and 40−) are not phosphorylated, and membrane domains from unstimulated cells (MD−) also show no phosphorylated FcεRI. Streptavidin-aggregated FcεRI from cells lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 migrate at a high density (50-70% sucrose) in these gradients (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). When in vitro tyrosine kinase assays are performed on these high density sucrose fractions (HD+), a relatively small amount of β subunit phosphorylation is seen. This fraction does contain a small amount of Lyn that may be responsible for the phosphorylation detected,2 but it is not known whether this represents Lyn directly associated with FcεRI, Lyn contaminating this fraction from the 40% sucrose fraction, or fragments of membrane domains which remain receptor-associated in 0.2% Triton X-100. Consistent with the last possibility, the in vitro phosphorylation in the HD+ fraction shows a Triton X-100 sensitivity similar to that of the MD+ fraction (see below).Fig. 4In vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of FcεRI associated with membrane domains. A, preferential phosphorylation of FcεRI associated with membrane domains from stimulated cells. Kinase assays were performed on fractions from sucrose gradients without Na3VO4 containing either detergent-resistant membrane domains (MD), the 40% sucrose fraction (40), or immune complexes in high density sucrose (HD), from either unstimulated RBL cells (−) or cells stimulated with 10 nM streptavidin for 5 min at 37°C (+). FcεRI was then immunoprecipitated and subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting as in Fig. 3B The relative amount of 125I-IgE loaded in each lane is (left to right) 0.04, 1.00, 0.76, 0.34, and 0.42. Experiments where ATP and Mg2+ were omitted from the kinase assay, or where cells without IgE were used, showed no detectable phosphorylation of β and γ under these conditions.2 B, detergent sensitivity of in vitro FcεRI phosphorylation. Membrane domains isolated as in Fig. 1 from streptavidin-stimulated cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of Triton X-100 prior to performing kinase assays on the sucrose fractions. The samples were then boiled with SDS, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine. C, extraction of FcεRI from membrane domains with Triton X-100. Membrane domain fractions isolated from streptavidin-stimulated cells as for B were treated with no Triton X-100 (○), with 0.01% Triton X-100 (•), or with 0.05% Triton X-100 (▪), readjusted to 40% sucrose, and ultracentrifuged overnight within a sucrose gradient (right axis) as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When in vitro tyrosine kinase assays are performed on membrane domains, stimulated FcεRI phosphorylation is highly sensitive to the concentration of Triton X-100 present. As shown in Fig. 4B, addition of submicellar (0.01%) Triton X-100 to the membrane domains causes a slight enhancement of FcεRI β and γ tyrosine phosphorylation, but higher Triton X-100 concentrations dramatically reduce this phosphorylation. The association of Lyn with membrane domains, as well as its activity toward the exogenous substrate, enolase, is not significantly affected by Triton X-100,2 and neither is phosphorylation of Lyn itself or the 45-kDa substrate (Fig. 4B). The exquisite sensitivity of FcεRI in vitro phosphorylation to Triton X-100 indicates that lipid-mediated association of these receptors with the membrane domains is required for this activation step. Fig. 4C supports this conclusion, demonstrating that treatment of isolated membrane domains with 0.05% Triton X-100 (▪) dissociates the aggregated receptors from these membrane domains as indicated by reanalysis on a second sucrose gradient. Treatment of the same domains with 0.01% Triton X-100 (•) does not dissociate the receptor, although it does cause a slight change in the distribution of the receptor within the gradient relative to untreated membrane domains (○). Thus, FcεRI associated with membrane domains is functionally coupled to Lyn, and this association is easily disrupted by detergent.The involvement of membrane domains in this early step of FcεRI activation provides a new model in which the initial phosphorylation of the β and γ subunits by Lyn is mediated by lipid-protein interactions. Although previous results have explained how the phosphorylation of FcεRI β and γ and subsequent events proceed after the association of active Lyn with a receptor cluster (23Pribluda V.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16902-16908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the structural basis for the initial interaction between Lyn and FcεRI in the activation process has remained poorly defined. Several studies that detected association of Lyn with unstimulated FcεRI utilized methods that could stabilize the association of these receptors with membrane domains, including chemical cross-linking (18Yamashita T. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or low detergent:cell lipid ratios (23Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We find that unstimulated receptors do not co-isolate with the Lyn-containing domains to a large extent (Fig. 1), although weak and/or transient interactions could occur on intact cells. The size and stability of the domains on the surface of intact, unstimulated cells are unknown. These domains are likely to be small and dynamic in composition, but appear to coalesce together with aggregated FcεRI (29Pierini L.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Thomas J.L. Holowka D. Baird B. Webb W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, localization of Lyn within membrane domains could serve to sequester this kinase away from FcεRI prior to receptor aggregation and, in turn, provide a pool of active or readily stimulated Lyn for aggregated FcεRI that stably associate with the domains. Support for this aspect of the model comes from our observation that isolated membrane domains contain abundant tyrosine kinase activity even in the absence of FcεRI activation (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), as well as from other studies on Src family members that associate with detergent-resistant membrane domains. These other investigations have found that Fyn, Lck, and Fgr associated with isolated membrane domains show higher specific activity in vitro than soluble forms of these kinases (42Schuh S.M. Lublin D.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9Google Scholar, 43Yan S.R. Fumagalli L. Berton G. FEBS Letters. 1996; 380: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), possibly because of the capability for kinases concentrated within domains to trans-autophosphorylate readily. 4S. M. Schuh and D. L. Lublin, personal communication. Our results demonstrate that aggregation of FcεRI causes its rapid and efficient association with specialized domains in the plasma membrane that are enriched in the tyrosine kinase, Lyn. FcεRI associated with membrane domains are rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in intact cells, and this phosphorylation is also observed in vitro preferentially for receptors associated with membrane domains. The interaction of FcεRI with these specialized membrane domains does not depend on the β subunit,3 and thus can account for the initiation of receptor signaling independent of specific protein-protein interactions between the β subunit and Lyn (24Alber G.

In addition, this receptor-membrane domain association may facilitate coupling to processes such as Ca2+ mobilization, lipid metabolism, and exocytic vesicle fusion.

We have studied the secretion and the stress response in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that overexpress either wild-type immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP) or a BiP deletion molecule (residues 175-201) that can bind peptides and ATP but is defective in ATP hydrolysis and concomitant peptide release. Overexpressed wild-type BiP was localized to the ER and unique vesicles within the nucleus, whereas overexpressed ATPase-defective BiP was localized to the ER and cytoplasmic vesicles but was absent from the nucleus. Compared with wild-type CHO cells, overexpression of ATPase-defective BiP prevented secretion of factor VIII, a coagulation factor that extensively binds BiP in the lumen of the ER. Under these conditions factor VIII was stably associated with the ATPase-defective BiP. In contrast, the secretion of monocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, a protein that is not detected in association with BiP, was not affected by overexpression of ATPase-defective BiP. These results show that BiP function is not required for secretion of some proteins and suggest that some proteins do not interact with BiP upon transport through the ER.The presence of unfolded protein in the ER induces transcription of BiP and also elicits a general inhibition of protein synthesis. Overexpression of wild-type BiP prevented the stress-mediated transcriptional induction of BiP in response to either calcium ionophore A23187 treatment or tunicamycin treatment. In contrast, overexpression of ATPase-defective BiP did not prevent the stress induction of BiP, showing that the ATPase activity is required to inhibit transcriptional induction. Overexpression of wild-type BiP, but not ATPase-defective BiP, increased survival of cells treated with A23187. The increased survival mediated by overexpressed wild-type BiP correlated with reduced translation inhibition in response to the stress condition. These results indicate that overexpressed BiP alleviated the stress in the ER to prevent BiP transcriptional induction and permit continued translation of cellular mRNAs.

The endoplasmic reticulum is the site where folding occurs for newly synthesized proteins that are destined for the cell surface. In addition, it is the principal cellular storage site for calcium. Calcium homeostasis is required for proper polypeptide folding and secretion of selective proteins (1Sambrook J.F.

S. A. 1990; 87: 7429-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas lowering ER calcium levels causes the release of T cell receptor subunits from BiP in vivo, presumably by inappropriately activating ATP hydrolysis (13Suzuki C.K. Bonifacino J.S. Lin A.Y. Davis M.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These results, together with the recent demonstration of ATP in the ER (14Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Biologicals. 1994; 22: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and an ER ATP transport system (15Clairmont C.A. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have provided evidence that the ATPase activity of BiP is important for its in vivo function. However, conditions that are optimal for in vitro ATP hydrolysis do not exist in the ER. In fact, ATP hydrolysis assayed in vitro is almost completely inhibited at pH 7.5 or with millimolar calcium concentrations (9Kassenbrock C.K. Kelly R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This has led investigators to propose that either co-stimulatory molecules exist, similar to those found in bacteria (16Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 17Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J.

BiP presumably forms a similar ATP-binding structure because mutation of BiP residues corresponding to those in hsc70 that are implicated in nucleotide interactions (20Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) block the in vivo folding of substrate proteins, providing the first direct evidence for the involvement of BiP in protein folding and demonstrate the requirement for ATPase activity of BiP in this function. Factor VIII is a complex plasma glycoprotein that is deficient in the X chromosome-linked bleeding disorder, hemophilia A. Although there are no known established cell lines that express factor VIII, the pathway for factor VIII secretion was elucidated from expression of the factor VIII cDNA in transfected mammalian cell lines (25Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1992; 43: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In these systems, factor VIII was inefficiently secreted as a consequence of interaction with BiP. Studies using sense and antisense BiP RNA expression vectors to elevate or reduce levels of BiP demonstrated that increased levels of BiP inhibited factor VIII secretion (26Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), while reduced levels of BiP improved factor VIII secretion (14Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Biologicals. 1994; 22: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Dorner A.J. Krane M.G. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4063-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The specific activity of factor VIII secreted from cells with reduced BiP levels was not detectably altered, indicating that factor VIII could fold into a biologically active form in cells with reduced BiP and suggesting that BiP interaction was not required for functional factor VIII secretion. Factor VIII release from BiP and transport out of the ER required high levels of intracellular ATP (12Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7429-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Biologicals. 1994; 22: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the homologous coagulation protein, factor V, as well as unrelated proteins such as monocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) or von Willebrand factor, did not detectably associate with BiP, and their secretion was not inhibited by lowering cellular ATP levels (12Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7429-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that factor VIII displays a greater ATP requirement for dissociation from BiP and secretion compared to von Willebrand factor, factor V, and M-CSF. Expression of BiP, as well as other members of the GRP gene family, is induced by the presence of unfolded proteins or unassembled protein subunits within the ER (29Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 30Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

A serine-threonine protein kinase was identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is required for the transcriptional induction of the GRPs although the mechanism of kinase activation and the identity of its substrates are unknown (32Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 33Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Since transcription of the GRP gene family is induced upon stress conditions that result in the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER, it is thought that members of this gene family may provide a protective mechanism to accomodate the presence of unfolded proteins. Transfection of cells with BiP antisense mRNA expression constructs or with multiple copies of the BiP glucose-regulated transcriptional element suppressed the induction of BiP without altering basal BiP levels. These cells also showed increased sensitivity to ionophore (34Li L.-J. Li X. Ferrario A. Rucker N. Liu E.S. Wong S. Gomer C.J. Lee A.S. J. Cell.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 6001-6005PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional induction of the GRPs in response to ER stress can also be blocked by overexpression of BiP (26Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It is not known in this case if BiP protein alleviates the stress directly or interferes with the transcriptional induction of the GRP family. In this study, we show that overexpression of BiP prevents induction of GRP transcription and protects cells from ER stress, suggesting that BiP directly alleviates the ER stress. In addition, the ATPase activity of BiP was required for both of these activities. Furthermore, we studied the secretion of factor VIII and M-CSF in cells that overexpress the ATPase-defective BiP. The results show that M-CSF is not inhibited by the presence of ATPase-defective BiP and provide evidence for a BiP-ATPase independent polypeptide folding pathway for selective proteins. The 1ADel BiP deletes 27 amino acids from Tyr175-Glu201 from the 1A domain of the ATP binding cleft. The mutant cDNA PstI (21Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) fragment was excised from pTZ and inserted into the PstI site of the mammalian expression vector pED (39Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) to derive pAD1. The wild-type BiP expression vector pEMCGRP78 was described previously (26Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 40Jang S.K. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1651-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These vectors were electroporated into DHFR-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Transformants were selected for growth in the absence of nucleosides and the gene copy number subsequently amplified by selection for growth in increasing concentrations of methotrexate (41Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 185: 537-566Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Independently isolated clonal lines were derived that express wild-type BiP (C.1 in 0.1 μM MTX and Cl.10 in 1 μM MTX) and 1ADel BiP (AD-1-B in 0.1 μM MTX). Clonal cell lines were propagated in complete α medium lacking nucleosides and containing 10% fetal bovine serum with penicillin and streptomycin. DHFR-deficient CHO DUKX-B11 cells were propagated in the same medium containing thymidine, deoxyadenosine, and adeosine. The derivation of the M-CSF (42Wong G.G. Temple P.A. Leary A.C.

Blood. 1992; 79: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expression vectors were previously described. Cells were plated at 200 or 2000/well into 6-well tissue culture plates in complete medium. After 24 h, cells were treated for 6 h with increasing concentrations of A23187. Cells were fed complete medium and incubated for 10-14 days. Colonies were counted after staining with crystal violet. The numbers represent the average from three independent plates and differ by less than 10%. For morphological examination, exponentially growing cells were treated with 5 μM A23187 in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 4 h and were then analyzed by phase contrast microscopy and photographed using an Olympus BX60 microscope. Exponentially growing cells were treated with A23187 in complete medium for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were rinsed with methionine- and cysteine-free medium and then pulse-labeled in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (DuPont NEN) for 15 min in the presence of A23187. Cells were rinsed and harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (44Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Radioactive isotope incorporation was measured after trichloroacetic acid precipitation (44Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined (45Bradford N. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Control DHFR-deficient CHO cells and AD1-B cells were transfected with pEMC-M-CSF or pMT2-LA VIII by the diethylaminoethyl dextran procedure for 4 h. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were fed with 5 ml/10-cm plate of fresh medium containing 5 mM sodium butyrate. After 18 h, some plates were treated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were then rinsed with methionine-deficient minimal essential medium and pulse-labeled for 30 min with 100 μCi/ml [35S]-methionine (Amersham Corp.). The chase was performed by rinsing and feeding the cells with complete medium for 6 h for M-CSF and for 9 h for factor VIII. Conditioned medium was harvested, and cell extracts were prepared by lysis in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (30Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20602-20607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitable counts and corresponding volumes of labeled culture supernatants were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies directed against factor VIII coupled to Sepharose (F-8) (43Pittman D.D. Millenson M. Marquette K. Bauer K. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or against M-CSF (HM7/4.4.10) with rabbit anti-mouse and protein A-Sepharose as an immunoadsorbant. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography with En/HANCE (DuPont NEN). For Western blot analysis, equal amounts (20 μg) of cell extracts were electrophoresed on a reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was reacted with polyclonal anti-rat BiP (Stressgen Biotech Corp. Victoria, BC, Canada) and developed with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody followed by development with chloronapthol. Where indicated, CHO cells were treated with tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) for 12 h prior to preparation of cell extract. Cells were plated onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing sterile coverslips. After 48 h (before the cells reached confluency), the coverslips were removed, and the cells were fixed in 5% acetic acid, 95% ethanol. Cells were stained with polyclonal anti-BiP antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Neshanic Station, NJ) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Southern Biotechnology Assoc., Birmingham, AL) as described (46Hendershot L.M. Wei J.-Y. Gaut J.R. Lawson B. Freiden P.J. Murti K.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma) was used to identify the Golgi compartment. Fluoresence was analyzed using dual excitation filters so that both colors (fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanates) were viewed simultaneously. Fluorescence micrographs were taken with an Olympus fluorescence microscope equipped with a PM-30 automatic photomicrographic system. Cells growing in microtiter polystyrene plates were fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and post-fixed for 2 h in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide. They were then dehydrated to absolute ethanol. In order to keep the cells as intact and undisturbed as possible, the cells were gently infiltrated with 1:3, 1:1, and then 3:1 parts of ethanol to 2-hydroxypropylmethacrylate (HPMA) each step for 4 h, resulting in final infiltration with pure HPMA. Then the cells were gently infiltrated with the same ratios of HPMA:Epon epoxy resin. The cells were finally infiltrated with pure Epon and polymerized in a 50°C oven for 48 h. Ultrathin sections were double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips CM-100 transmission electron microscope. Logarithmically growing cells were fed α medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml tunicamycin or 7 μM A23187 (both from Sigma) for 6 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Inc.), and equal amounts of RNA were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 7.4% formaldehyde and 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. The RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with double-stranded random primed DNA fragments in 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 150 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium citrate) at 42°C. The DNA fragments used for hybridization were hamster BiP (1.6-kbp PstI-EcoRI fragment from p3C5 (47Ting J. Wooden S.K. Kriz R. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. Gene. 1987; 55: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), chicken β-actin (1.6-kbp fragment from pA1 (48Cleveland D.W. Lopata M.A. MacDonald R.J. Cowan N.J. Rutter W.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1980; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar)), or hamster GRP94 (1-kbp BamHI-EcoRV fragment from p4A3 (2Lee A.S. Delegeane A.M. Baker V. Chow P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 597-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Band intensities were measured by PhosphorImager scanning using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). Deletion of residues 175-201 (1ADel) within hamster BiP destroyed the ATPase activity and prevented release of bound peptides (21Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the requirement of wild-type and ATPase-defective BiP on protein secretion and the stress response, CHO cell lines were derived that stably overexpress either wild-type hamster BiP or the 1ADel BiP (Fig. 1). Analysis of two independently isolated cell lines, C.1 and Cl.10, by Western immunoblotting detected a significant increase in BiP protein levels (approximately 5- and 10- fold, respectively) in cells transfected and selected for expression of wild-type hamster BiP (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4) compared with the original CHO cells (Fig. 1, lane 2). This level of BiP was similar to that observed after treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 1, lane 1). AD-1 cells expressed significant amounts of ATPase mutant BiP that migrated with an approximately 3 kDa lower apparent molecular mass, as expected from the 27-amino acid deletion (Fig. 1; lane 5). Expression of 1ADel BiP also increased expression of the endogenous CHO cell BiP. The localization of the overexpressed BiP was monitored by immunofluorescence with anti-BiP antibody using fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The Golgi compartment was stained with rhodamine-labeled wheat germ agglutinin and appeared normal in all cell lines studied (Fig. 2A-C). Control CHO cells demonstrated the presence of BiP within a reticular structure, the ER (Fig. 2A). overexpressed wild-type BiP was localized to the ER although at a much greater intensity (Fig. 2B) compared with control CHO cells. In addition, some of the overexpressed wild-type BiP was also detected as punctate spots within the nucleus. The 1ADel BiP mutant was also detected in a reticular network but was not detected in the nucleus. Additionally, the BiP mutant was localized to membrane-enclosed vesicles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C), similar to those previously noted for ATPase-defective BiP point mutants expressed transiently in COS-1 cells (46Hendershot L.M. Wei J.-Y. Gaut J.R. Lawson B. Freiden P.J. Murti K.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the nuclear localization of wild-type BiP correlated with the appearance of new membrane-bound vesicles, which were likely the site of the overexpressed nuclear BiP (Fig. 2E). In contrast, the 1ADel BiP overexpression correlated with cytoplasmic vesicles and the absence of nuclear vesicles (Fig. 2F, arrows). The effect of wild-type and mutant BiP overexpression on the induction of GRP transcription was studied by treating cells with A23187, a calcium ionophore, or tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to a BiP probe. The amount of RNA transferred to nitrocellulose was corrected for by hybridization to an actin probe. BiP mRNA was induced 14- and 19-fold in control CHO cells upon treatment with A23187 and tunicamycin, respectively (Fig. 3, lanes 1-3), and overexpression of wild-type BiP reduced the stress induction to 1.3- and 1.8-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, lanes 4-6) similar to previous results (26Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ATPase-defective BiP increased the constitutive endogenous BiP mRNA level by 2-fold (Fig. 3, lane 7); however, upon A23187 or tunicamycin treatment, the mRNA level was further increased by 4.3- and 7-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 9). These results indicate that elevated levels of a functional BiP with ATPase activity are required to inhibit the stress induction of BiP transcription. The effect of wild-type and mutant BiP overexpression on cell survival upon calcium depletion from the ER after treatment with ionophore A23187 was measured using a colony formation assay. Treatment of control CHO cells with 5 μM A23187 reduced colony formation to approximately 30% of that observed in untreated cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, the two cell lines that overexpress wild-type BiP were resistant to 10 μM A23187 treatment in this assay (Fig. 4; data not shown). Cells that expres"

Therefore, toxins that have unrelated structures but similar functions possess conserved key functional residues, organized in an identical topology, suggesting a convergent functional evolution for these small proteins. Functional properties of proteins are frequently associated with a small number of important residues. For example, enzyme activities depend on a few residues that are essential for catalysis. Also, protein-protein recognition processes have been predicted (1Novotny J. Bruccoleri R.E. Saul F.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4735-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and recently demonstrated (2Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar) to be energetically driven by a small proportion of the residues forming the contacting areas in protein-protein complexes, as identified by x-ray studies (3de Vos A.M.

Among the proteins whose major functions require protein-protein interactions are animal toxins, which bind to various molecular targets, such as receptors or ion channels, using a small number of binding residues (5Pillet L.

Freeman and Co., New York1988: 227Google Scholar), toxins with different architectures are capable of exerting similar functions (10Ménez A. Bontems F. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Toma F. Proc. R. Soc. Edinburgh. 1992; 99B: 83-103Google Scholar). However, in contrast to enzymes, the molecular basis associated with the conservation of the function in structurally unrelated toxins remains unknown. In this paper, we show that two families of animal toxins with different folding patterns but a comparable capacity to bind to potassium channels include similar functional diads, composed of a critical lysine and an aromatic amino acid separated from each other by 6.6 ± 1.0 Å.

Garcia I. Martinez J.R. Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Marshall D.L. Engström A. Hellman U. Karlsson E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, chemical synthesis attempts, based on these data, systematically failed. The proposed amino acid sequence was therefore questioned, re-examined, and ultimately corrected. 2J. Cotton, M. Crest, F. Bouet, N. Alessandri, M. Gola, M. Forest, E. Karlsson, O. Castaneda, A. L. Harvey, C. Vita, and A. Ménez, submitted for publication. The revised amino acid sequence of BgK from Bunodosoma granulifera is: VCRDWFKETACRHAKSLGNCRTSQKYRANCAKTCELC. BgK and each alanine-substituted analog were synthesized by solid phase synthesis using an Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer, starting from 0.1 mmol of Rink-resin (4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenylhydroxymethylphenoxy resin; 0.48 mmol/g). A 10-fold excess (1 mmol) of Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acid was used and coupled in N-methylpyrrolidone in the presence of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole. The following side chain protections were used: t-butyl ether for Ser and Thr; t-butyl ester for Glu and Asp; trityl for Cys, His, Asn, and Gln; 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchromane-6-sulfonyl for Arg; and t-butoxycarbonyl for Lys and Trp. The peptide was simultaneously cleaved from the resin and deprotected by treatment (500 mg of resin/50 ml) with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% H2O, 5% triisopropylsilane for 1.5 h at room temperature. The resin was filtered, and the solution was precipitated with methyl-t-butylether, washed three times with ether, dissolved in 20% acetic acid, and lyophilized.

The crude peptides (0.1 mg/ml) were oxidized in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 5 × 10−3M reduced and 5 × 10−4M oxidized glutathione. Oxidation was complete after 1 h at room temperature. The solution was then acidified to pH 3.0 with acetic acid and directly applied to a Vydac C18 column (25 × 1 cm) for purification. The peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fractions containing the oxidized peptides were analyzed by analytical HPLC. The adequately oxidized components were identified by mass spectrometry. The yields in purified and oxidized toxins ranged from 20 to 40%. Disulfide assignments were achieved by peptide mapping using the Lys-C endoprotease (1:20 by mass) in 20 mM Tricine buffer, containing 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6, for 7 h at 35°C. Digests were submitted to reverse phase-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm), and the resulting fragments were collected, lyophilized, and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The mass of the fragments unambiguously indicated that the pairings were Cys2-Cys37, Cys11-Cys30, and Cys20-Cys34. Amino acid analyses were performed on an Applied Biosystems model 130A automatic analyzer, equipped with an on-line model 420A derivatizer, and mass analysis on a Nermag R10-10 mass spectrometer, coupled to an Analitica of Branford electrospray source. Amino acid compositions and mass analyses agreed with the expected theoretical values. Peptide concentrations were determined by monitoring absorbances at 280 mm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 8100, calculated on the basis of the known amino acid content (11Aneiros A. Garcia I. Martinez J.R. Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Marshall D.L. Engström A. Hellman U. Karlsson E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For analogs where Trp or Tyr were deleted, the peptide concentrations were determined on the basis of quantitative amino acid analyses. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a Jobin-Yvon CD6 dichrograph, driven by an IBM PC operating with a CD6 data acquisition and manipulation program. Spectra in the range 180-250 nm were run at 20°C in 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with a 0.1 cm quartz cell and a protein concentration of 1.5-2.0 × 10−5M. Synthetic BgK (9.8 mg) was dissolved in 440 μl of solvent, leading to a final concentration of 4.9 mM. Solvents were either a mixture of 400 μl of water and 40 μl of D2O, or 440 μl of D2O. pH was fixed at 3.7, and chemical shifts were measured relative to TSP-d4. All NMR experiments were performed at 600 MHz (AMX600 Brüker spectrometer) at 20 and 30°C, in order to resolve assignment ambiguities. At each temperature and in each solvent, a DQF-COSY spectrum (12Rance M. Sorensen O. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), a nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy spectrum (300 ms mixing time) (13Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar), and a total correlation spectroscopy spectrum (14Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar, 15Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) were recorded. Quadrature detection was performed using the States method (16States D.J. Haberkorn R.H. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 48: 286-293Google Scholar) in the indirect dimension and using simultaneous mode acquisition in the directly detected dimension. The water signal was suppressed by low power irradiation at all times except during t1 and t2. The spectra were recorded with 128 (t1) × 1024 (t2) (96 × 1024 in D2O) and with a sweep width of 7812 Hz (6578 Hz in D2O). The 3JNH-Hα (respectively 3JHα-Hβ) coupling constants were measured from the high resolution DQF-COSY in H2O (respectively D2O). All data were transformed using FELIX software (17Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. FELIX software. Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). Prior to Fourier transformation, spectra were weighted with a 18° shifted sine bell (90° for the spectra to be integrated) and were zero-filled in the t1 dimension to yield 1000 × 1000 matrices after reduction (1000 × 4000 for the DQF-COSY). Each NOE was integrated with FELIX, using a 2.48 Å distance between the δ and the ϵ protons of Tyr26 for calibration. A range of ±25% of the distance value was used to define the upper and the lower bounds of the restraints. Structures were obtained by molecular modeling using successively DIANA (18Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) for preliminary structure calculation and X-PLOR for simulated annealing (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar, 20Brünger A.T. Kuriyan K. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). After having solved assignment ambiguities with the help of DIANA, 50 structures were calculated using this software, and the 30 structures with a target function below 10 were further refined by simulated annealing in X-PLOR 3.1 (with files parallhdg.pro and topallhdg.pro). The 15 structures with the lowest energy were kept for analysis. Within these 15 structures, all but three distance violations are no larger than 0.3 Å and all dihedral restraints violations are lower than 5°. Competition experiments were made on rat brain synaptosomes using 125I-labeled α-dendrotoxin, as described previously (21Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). BgK was isolated from B. granulifera (11Aneiros A. Garcia I. Martinez J.R. Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Marshall D.L. Engström A. Hellman U. Karlsson E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and its amino acid sequence (see Fig. 1) has been recently corrected.2 BgK, like a number of scorpion toxins such as charybdotoxin, (i) binds to potassium channels, (ii) contains 37 residues, and (iii) possesses 6 half-cystines. However, our attempts to align the amino acid sequences of BgK and scorpion toxins have failed, suggesting that BgK adopts a structure that differs from the well-known α/β fold of scorpion toxins (22Bontems F. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Ménez A. Toma F. Science. 1991; 254: 1521-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to elucidate its structure by NMR and molecular modeling. Three unique amino acids having specific spin systems were used as starting points for sequential assignments. These are Trp5, His13, and Gly18. The unique tyrosine (Tyr26) was also used to assign the C-terminal part of the amino acid sequence of BgK. As no proline was present in the protein, these four starting points as well as the existence of all but one sequential NH-NH connectivities allowed us to achieve the complete assignment of the amino acid sequence of BgK (Table I).Table IProton chemical shifts of BgKResidueChemical shift (ppm)NHHαHβHγOthersVal13.782.180.99Cys29.004.923.07, 2.82Arg38.464.521.581.31, 0.53δH: 2.59, 2.49Asp48.734.843.28, 2.68Trp58.684.943.47, 3.34ɛH: 7.76, ηH: 7.22, ζH: 7.49, 7.14Phe67.845.233.44, 3.341.33δH: 7.20, CɛH2: 6.93Lys78.564.272.10, 1.871.71, 1.65δH: 1.79, ɛH: 3.07Glu88.904.072.24, 2.132.43Thr98.423.914.161.30Ala106.924.381.67Cys118.594.833.05, 2.90Arg129.223.891.981.64δH: 3.24, 3.18His138.024.473.41, 3.46δH: 7.39, ɛH: 8.71Ala148.143.750.90Lys158.564.162.04, 1.661.49, 1.37δH: 1.66, ɛH: 3.07Ser168.004.294.02Leu177.154.361.521.43δH: 0.76, 0.62Gly187.714.41, 4.01Asn197.804.742.69, 2.25Cys208.694.353.12, 3.02Arg217.594.352.01, 1.951.68, 1.57δH: 3.26Thr227.384.434.411.20Ser237.664.964.41, 4.12Gln249.314.002.122.49Lys258.223.981.85, 1.421.27, 0.74δH: 1.62, ɛH: 2.82Tyr267.884.042.69δH: 7.40, ɛH: 6.92Arg278.423.771.76, 1.691.93, 1.92δH: 3.10, 2.83Ala287.614.201.37Asn297.134.841.45, 1.29Cys308.055.543.44, 3.24Ala319.383.831.46Lys327.314.101.69, 1.241.57δH: 1.64, ɛH: 2.94Thr3310.613.884.001.06Cys348.954.673.20, 2.88Glu358.074.152.36, 2.29Leu368.864.521.74, 1.651.48δH: 0.95, 0.84Cys377.764.403.39, 2.99 Open table in a new tab A total of 767 distance restraints deriving from NOEs (316 intra-residual correlations, 172 sequential, 155 short range ( i − j ≤ 4), 124 long range ( i − j > 4) and 12 dihedral restraints (7 from φ angles, 5 from χ1 angles) deriving from coupling constants was used. This large set of constraints (21 restraints by residue) yielded a well defined structure, as reflected by the mean r.m.s.d. value of its backbone, which was as low as 0.8 ± 0.2 Å between two structures. The calculated structures were consistent with both experimental data and the standard covalent geometry. The structures had no distance violations larger than 0.32 Å, and only three distance violations were larger than 0.3 Å. All dihedral restraint violations were lower than 5°. The covalent geometry was respected, as revealed by the low r.m.s.d. values of the bond length (0.003 Å) and the valence angles (1.52°). The existence of two helices, running from residues 9 to 16 and residues 24 to 31, was clearly indicated by the presence of numerous short-range NOEs between hα(i) and hn(i + 3) protons and between hα(i) and hβ(i + 3) protons (Fig. 1). No other regular secondary structure emerged from these data. Fig. 2a shows the 15 best structures of BgK, which result from transformation of NMR data and molecular modeling. The two helical stretches are well defined with r.m.s.d. values of 0.4 ± 0.1 Å and 0.5 ± 0.2 Å for the position 9-16 and 24-31 stretches, respectively. Though to a lesser extent, the other parts of the toxin structures were also relatively well defined. Panels b and c of Fig. 2 show, respectively, the overall fold of BgK and the spatial organization of its secondary elements. The N- and C-terminal regions are maintained in spatial proximity by the disulfide 2-37, whereas the third disulfide 20-34 brings the loops 16-24 and 31-37 inside the center of the molecule, providing the toxin with a globular shape. The 11-30 disulfide, which links the two helices, adopts a unique conformation, which is almost left-handed (23Richardson J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 267-330Google Scholar). It is centrally located in the structure, consistently with a tight organization of a local hydrophobic core. The other disulfide bonds adopt either two conformations (disulfide 20-34) or no prevailing conformation (disulfide 2-33). To identify functional residues of BgK, we submitted the toxin to an alanine-scanning experiment, producing all single point variants by chemical synthesis, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Competition experiments were performed between the variants and radiolabeled α-dendrotoxin on membrane from rat brain synaptosomes. Twenty-five variants have been synthesized and investigated regarding their effects on dendrotoxin binding. Fig. 3 shows five inhibition curves obtained with native BgK and four variants, which display a substantially lower competition activity, as compared with native BgK. Except for the variant T33A, all inhibition curves are parallel to that observed with the native toxin. Similar parallel inhibition curves were obtained for other variants, except K25A, for which no inhibition was observed even in the presence of 3 × 10−7M protein. In the presence of the variant F6A, a 10% increase in binding of labeled dendrotoxin was observed. Although we are not able to explain this observation, as yet, one should recall that different subtypes of potassium channels are present in brain and are composed of heterooligomeric mixtures of different protein subunits. Experiments with subtype-specific antibodies reveal that most of the channels in the brain contain Kv1.2 (∼80%) or Kv1.1 (∼50%) subunits (24Scott V.E.S. Muniz Z.M. Sewing S. Lichtinghagen R. Parcej D.N. Pongs O. Dolly J.O Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). α-Dendrotoxin blocks Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels with almost equal affinity (IC50 values ∼ 20 nM), and has greater than 10 times less affinity for other cloned channels (25Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in view of such complexity, the present competition data have to be considered with caution. From curves similar to those shown in Fig. 3, we deduced IC50 values for all variants. These values are compiled in Table II. The correlation coefficient for fitting the data points was calculated from the Hill equation, y = Rmax/[1 + (X/IC50)P]. As can be seen from Table II, a value close to 1 was obtained in all cases. Moreover, preliminary competition experiments performed with cloned Kv1.2 channels and a number of the variants exhibiting a lower inhibitory capacity, as compared to native BgK, nicely paralleled those reported in Table II. 3A. Lecoq, J. Cotton, M. Dauplais, C. L. C. de Medeiros, E. G. Rowan, A. L. Harvey, and A. Ménez, unpublished data. Therefore, we anticipate that data obtained with brain synaptosomes mostly reflect the functional importance of residues implicated in the capacity of BgK to bind to Kv1.2 potassium channels. Nevertheless, in order not to overinterpret our data, we considered only the relative inhibitory capacity of the variants, without any attempt to deduce their binding affinities.Table IIEffect of introduction of an alanine residue at 25 individual positions of BgK on the ability of the toxin to inhibit binding of 125I-labeled α-dendrotoxin to membranes from rat brain synaptosomesAffinity variations of refolded alanine mutantsIC50Correlation coefficientMutant/WTnMWT3.6 (±0.6)0.991V1A1.6 (±0.1)0.990.4R3A7.7 (±0.9)0.992.1W5A2.6 (±0.4)0.990.7F6A167 (±48)0.9046K7A5.7 (±0.6)0.991.6E8A1.5 (±0.1)0.990.4T9A1.6 (±0.3)0.990.4R12A3.6 (±0.3)0.990.9H13A20 (±3)0.995.6K15A5.5 (±1.4)0.991.5S16A2.8 (±0.3)0.990.8L17A2.3 (±0.2)0.990.6N19A6.3 (±1)0.991.8R21A4.6 (±1)0.991.3T22A2.5 (±0.5)0.990.7S23A30 (±6.9)0.968.3Q24A1.5 (±0.3)0.990.4K25A>300>80Y26A100 (±33)0.9528R27A5.1 (±1.8)0.981.4N29A4.2 (±0.8)0.991.2K32A5.5 (±0.5)0.991.5T33A70 (±9.2)0.9919E35A3.0 (±0.3)0.990.8L36A6.4 (±0.8)0.991.8 Open table in a new tab Competition experiments, shown in Table II, revealed that mutation of lysine 25 into alanine is associated with the largest affinity decrease. This mutation, however, caused no significant change in the secondary structure of the toxin, as inferred from the circular dichroism spectra of the variant which is quite similar to the spectrum of the native toxin (Fig. 4). We conclude, therefore, that the low competition ability of this mutant is not due to distortions in the toxin structure but to the absence of the lysine side chain and possibly to the loss of its positive charge. Upon mutations of three other residues, Phe6, Tyr26, and Thr33, BgK was a less potent inhibitor, since its competition capacity decreased by factors of 46, 38, and 19, respectively. However, while the circular dichroism spectra of the first two variants were indistinguishable from that of the native toxin, the spectrum of the T33A variant showed some distortions (data not shown), which could not be readily interpreted but which might reflect some structural perturbations. Additionally, the inhibition curve with the T33A variant (see Fig. 3) was not quite parallel to those observed with the native BgK or other variants. In addition, synthesis of this variant was particularly difficult to achieve, leading to a relatively low yield of recovery. Therefore, all these observations suggest that introduction of an alanine at position 33 may be associated with structural perturbations, which might account for the substantial decrease in inhibitory activity of BgK. As a result, one cannot safely propose that the side chain of residue 33 is implicated in the binding of the toxin to the BgK target. Therefore, in the absence of further data, only the side chains of Lys25, Phe6, and Tyr26 are concluded to be involved in the functional site of BgK. Mutations at two positions, Ser23 and His13, also induced approximately 8- and 6-fold decrease in competition capacity. Although relatively low, these values might also reflect involvement of these residues in the binding site of BgK. Mutations at the other positions either had no effect on the affinity of BgK or caused changes in inhibitory capacity that are lower than 3-fold. These side chains are not considered, therefore, as actors in the recognition capacity of BgK for dendrotoxin-sensitive binding sites. In summary, alanine-scanning-based experiments indicated that three, and perhaps five, residues of BgK belong to the surface by which the toxin interacts with the channels. Potassium channels constitute a major target for various toxins produced by venomous animals from distinct phyla, including cnidaria (26Doumenc D. Guillaume H. Goyffon M. Heurthault J. La Fonction Venimeuse. Masson, Paris1995: 27-40Google Scholar), arthropods (10Ménez A. Bontems F. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Toma F. Proc. R. Soc. Edinburgh. 1992; 99B: 83-103Google Scholar), and reptiles (27Harvey A.H. Anderson A.J. International Encyclopedia of Pharmacology & Therapeutics: Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, Oxford1991: 131-164Google Scholar). Thus, a number of toxins, found in venoms of (i) sea anemones such as BgK (11Aneiros A. Garcia I. Martinez J.R. Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Marshall D.L. Engström A. Hellman U. Karlsson E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or ShK (28Castañeda O. Sotolongo V. Amor A.M. Stöcklin R.

Nature. 1982; 296: 90-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and (iii) snakes like dendrotoxin (27Harvey A.H. Anderson A.J. International Encyclopedia of Pharmacology & Therapeutics: Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, Oxford1991: 131-164Google Scholar), bind to dendrotoxin-sensitive K+ channels (31Harvey A.L. Marshall D.L. De-Allie F.A. Strong P.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Rowan E.G. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear as to whether these proteins share any structural or chemical elements that could account for their common capacity to recognize similar channels. In this paper, we first provided evidence that BgK from the sea anemone B. granulifera is structurally unrelated to scorpion toxins, although these two groups of toxins share a similar number of residues, the same number of disulfides, and comparable functional properties. The present structural analysis revealed that the fold adopted by BgK contains two nearly perpendicular stretches of helices, with no additional canonical secondary structures (Fig. 2). The globular architecture of the toxin is stabilized by the three disulfides, one of them linking the two helices. This structure is similar to that of ShK, as indicated by a paper that was published during the review of our manuscript (33Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ShK, from the Stichodactyla helianthus sea anemone, is a 35-residue toxin that also binds to potassium channels (28Castañeda O. Sotolongo V. Amor A.M. Stöcklin R. Anderson A.J. Harvey A.L. Engström A. Wernstedt C. Karlsson E. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As in BgK, the structure of ShK includes two helices running from residues 14-19 and 21-24. However, these two stretches are not located at identical corresponding positions in both toxins. In fact, the absence of four consecutive residues in the amino acid sequence of ShK, as compared to BgK (residues 12-15 using BgK numbering), leads to a different organization of the N-terminal part of the toxin. More precisely, the N-terminal part of BgK is successively composed of an extended strand (1Novotny J. Bruccoleri R.E. Saul F.A.

Its function was investigated by overexpressing dominant negative or constitutively active mutants in BHK-21 cells. The effects of such overexpression on the internalization and/or degradation of different endocytic markers and on the morphology of the late endosomal compartment were analyzed. We observed a marked inhibition of the degradation of 125I-low density lipoproteins in cells transfected with the Rab7 dominant negative mutants while the rate of internalization was not affected. Moreover in these cells there was an accumulation of many small vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, overexpression of the activating mutants led to the appearance of atypically large endocytic structures and caused a dramatic change in the distribution of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Our data indicate that the Rab7 protein in mammalian cells is present on a late endosomal compartment much larger than the compartment labeled by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor.

Our data indicate that the Rab7 protein in mammalian cells is present on a late endosomal compartment much larger than the compartment labeled by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Rab7 also appears to play a fundamental role in controlling late endocytic membrane traffic. Rab proteins are small GTPases localized at the cytoplasmic face of specific subcellular compartments in the endocytic and exocytic pathways. Several studies, using in vitro or in vivo assays, demonstrated a key role for these proteins in the regulation of intracellular vesicles trafficking (1Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 2Simons K. Zerial M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 789-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although the specific function of Rab proteins is not yet understood, the currently accepted model postulates that Rab proteins are required to assemble or proofread the general docking/fusion machinery (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). The Rab7 protein has been previously localized to the late endosomal compartment in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells (4Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Work from two different laboratories has demonstrated that Ypt7, the yeast Rab7 counterpart, is involved in transport to vacuoles and that expression of dominant negative mutants results in fragmentation of the vacuolar compartment (5Wichmann H. Hengst L. Gallwitz D. Cell. 1992; 71: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Schimmoller A. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 823-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover it has been demonstrated that Ypt7 is required for vacuole fusion on both membrane partners (7Haas A. Scheglmann D. Lazar T. Gallwitz D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5258-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Recently the function of Rab7 has been investigated in mammalian cells (8Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J.

Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the mutant protein is in part associated with lysosomal membranes. The authors conclude that Rab7 cycles to lysosomes and suggest that it plays a role in a vesicular traffic step involving lysosomes (9Méresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand Wandinger-Ness and co-workers (8Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), transiently expressing the Rab7 wt and two dominant negative mutants, demonstrated a role of the Rab7 protein in regulating early to late endosomes transport. The expression of the two mutant proteins (Rab7T22N and Rab7N125I) resulted in accumulation of the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein in the early endosomes and in a reduced cleavage of SV5 HN, a paramixovirus envelope protein (8Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). It has already been shown that a Rab protein can be present on more than a single cellular compartment and can control more than one transport step (10Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pind S. Khosravi-Far R.

In this study we have performed a detailed analysis of the Rab7 localization and function by transiently overexpressing several mutants in the BHK-21 cell line. We then investigated the changes induced by these proteins on the morphology of the late endosomal compartment and on the uptake and/or degradation of different endocytic markers, two of which (transferrin and LDL) are physiological ligands. Our results indicate that the Rab7 protein plays an important role in the organization of the late endosomal compartment and that its localization is not restricted to the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) positive compartment. Plasmids Rab5, Rab5N133I, and the human transferrin receptor have been previously described (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

SP6 or T7 outer primers were used in all the amplifications. cDNAs encoding Rab5 and Rab7 wt and mutant proteins were cloned under the control of the T7 promoter in the pGEM1 or pGEM1-myc vectors (14Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Killisch I. Lütcke A. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1249-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bearing a c-myc epitope (15Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). The constructs were completely sequenced to exclude the presence of Taq polymerase mistakes. All tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. BHK-21 cells were grown in Glasgow minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin and grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. BHK-21 cells were infected with the vT7 recombinant vaccinia virus and transfected as described (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The transfection reagent was either DOTAP obtained by Boehringer Mannheim or made by sonicating dioleoyl-L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine and dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium bromide as described (16Rose J.K. Buonocore L. Whitt M.A. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 520-525PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected for 4-6 h and then processed for immunofluorescence or biochemical assays. The 9E10 anti-myc monoclonal and the CI-MPR polyclonal antibodies were kind gifts from Dr. S. Fuller and Dr. B. Hofflack, respectively. The anti-Rab7 antibody was prepared as described (4Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Anti-LY antibodies were bought from Molecular Probes. Cells grown on 11-mm round glass coverslips were permeabilized and fixed as described previously (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies fluorescein isothiocyanate- or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit were from Sigma or Amersham. Cells were viewed with the EMBL confocal microscope. Cells were lysed in standard SDS sample buffer and extracts were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For immunoblotting, separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The filter was then blocked in 5% milk in PBS for 40 min at room temperature. Then primary mouse monoclonal 9E10 anti-myc antibody was added at the appropriate dilution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The filters were washed, incubated with a secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and the bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham). For GTP overlay, after electrophoresis the gel was treated, transferred to nitrocellulose filter, and incubated with [α-32P]GTP as described (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Human transferrin (Sigma) was labeled to a specific activity of 107 cpm/mg using IODO-GEN (17Podbilewicz B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). BHK-21 cells were transfected with the human transferrin receptor plasmid alone or together with the different plasmids encoding Rab7 wt and mutant proteins and treated as described (18Bucci C. Lütcke A. Steele-Mortimer O. Chiariello M. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Bruni C.B. Simons K. Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The amount of transferrin endocytosed, recycled, and membrane bound was measured by γ-radiation counting. BHK-21 cells were transfected for 4 h with the plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant Rab7 proteins and then allowed to internalize horseradish peroxidase (5 mg/ml) in serum-free Glasgow minimal essential medium for times ranging from 1 to 60 min. Cells were then transferred on ice, washed extensively with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and lysed in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.2% Triton X-100. The horseradish peroxidase content in the postnuclear supernatant was estimated using o-dianisidine (20Marsh M. Schmid S. Kern H. Harms E. Male P. Mellman I. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The total amount of protein was determined by colorimetric methods (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Lucifer Yellow was diluted in Hank's balanced salt solution at a concentration of 5-10 mg/ml. Cells grown on 11-mm round glass coverslip were allowed to internalize Lucifer Yellow for 5-10 min at 37°C. The cells were then washed extensively with Hanks' balanced salt solution and reincubated at 37°C for various times in serum-deficient medium. After two washes with Hanks' balanced salt solution and one wash with PBS the cells were permeabilized, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence. Human low density lipoprotein (LDL) (1.019 < d <1.063 g/ml) was obtained by preparative ultracentrifugation (22Havel R.S. Eder H.A. Bragdon S.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar) from serum of normolipidemic subjects to which 0.1% sodium azide, 1 mM EDTA disodium salt, and 0.17 TIU/ml of aprotinin were added, in order to prevent degradation of apoprotein. The h-LDL was then concentrated and further purified by double ultracentrifugation at density 1.063 g/ml. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LDS) was prepared from the same serum samples used for LDL preparation by ultracentrifugation at density of 1.210 g/ml. h-LDL and LDS were then extensively dialyzed for 24 h at 4°C against 0.15 M NaCl, 0.24 mM disodium EDTA (pH 7.4). The protein content of LDL, determined as described (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ranged between 8 and 10 mg/ml. LDL was labeled with 125I as described (24Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 262: 212-221Crossref Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The specific activity of 125I-LDL ranged between 200 and 400 cpm/ng of protein; more than 98%125I radioactivity was precipitable by trichloroacetic acid and less than 3% was extractable in chloroform-methanol. Radioiodinated LDL was always used within 2 weeks from preparation. Cells were incubated for 24 h in medium complemented with human LDS before transfection. Transfected cells were allowed to internalize 125I-LDL that was added to the medium at a concentration of 20 μg/ml for 5 h and the amount of 125I-LDL surface bound, internalized, and degraded was estimated as described (25Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1975; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, to determine the amount of 125I-LDL degraded, the medium was collected, treated with trichloroacetic acid, extracted with chloroform and hydrogen peroxide to remove free iodine, and an aliquot of the aqueous phase was counted. This acid-soluble material is represented mainly by [125I]iodotyrosine, the product of LDL degradation. To determine 125I-LDL binding and internalization, after incubation with 125I-LDL, cells were washed 6 times with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, once with PBS, and then treated with 3 mg/ml Pronase in serum-free medium containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3) for 1 h at 0°C. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min. The radioactivity present in the Pronase-medium (125I-LDL surface bound), cell-associated (125I-LDL internalized), and the acid-soluble material from the incubation medium (125I-LDL degraded) was detected with a γ-counter. Using polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis (13Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) we introduced point mutations in the GTP binding or hydrolysis domain of the Rab7 cDNA to obtain dominant negative or constitutively active mutants. Similarly to homologous mutations in ras, the mutant Rab7T22N should have a reduced affinity for GTP while the Rab7N125I should have a reduced guanine nucleotide binding. Analogous Rab5 mutant proteins (Rab5S34N and Rab5N133I) behaved as dominant negative mutants in both in vitro and in vivo assays (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 19Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 26Li G. Barbieri M.A. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Rab7I41M and Rab7Q67L mutants are predicted to have an impaired intrinsic (Rab7Q67L) or GAP-mediated (Rab7I41M) GTP hydrolysis and should preferentially be in the GTP-bound form. The Rab7ΔC mutant has the last three amino acids deleted. This mutant lacks the cysteines required for membrane association and remains cytosolic (data not shown). We expressed all the constructs in BHK-21 cells using the vaccinia recombinant VT7 infection/transfection system (28Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a Western blot (A) and a GTP-binding blot (B) of BHK-21 cells infected with the vT7 virus and transfected with the wt or mutant Rab7 myc-tagged plasmids. As a control we used cells that were infected with the vT7 virus but nontransfected. Western blot analysis was performed with a monoclonal anti-myc antibody. The myc-tagged Rab7 wt and mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1A) and more than 15-fold over the endogenous levels (data not shown). This high expression was reached because of the presence of a perfect Kozak consensus sequence in front of the myc epitope (14Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Killisch I. Lütcke A. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1249-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the Rab7 wt and the Rab7I41M, Rab7Q67L, and Rab7ΔC mutant proteins bind efficiently GTP whereas the Rab7T22N or Rab7N125I proteins do not bind the nucleotide (Fig. 1B). The Rab7 protein was previously localized to the late endosomes in BHK-21, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and NRK cells (4Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). We analyzed by double immunofluorescence the effect of the overexpression of the Rab7 wt and mutant proteins on the late endosomal compartment in BHK-21 cells. We used the monoclonal anti-myc antibody to detect the myc-tagged overexpressed proteins and a polyclonal anti-CI-MPR antibody to identify the late endosomal compartment. The CI-MPR is localized to early endosomes, late endosomes, and trans-Golgi network but the bulk of the protein is in the late endosomal compartment (29Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the myc-tagged Rab7 wt protein results in the staining of a vesicular compartment mainly confined to the perinuclear area (Fig. 2E), similar to the localization of the endogenous protein (4Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, there was only partial co-localization between the myc-tagged Rab7 wt protein and the CI-MPR in BHK-21 cells (Fig. 2, A and E). The two proteins were in the same perinuclear area but the wt Rab7 staining was more widely distributed in the cell compared to the CI-MPR staining. This would suggest that the CI-MPR is present only in restricted regions of the late endosomal compartment or that Rab7 is not confined to late endosomes. Expression of the two dominant negative mutants, Rab7T22N (Fig. 2F) or Rab7N125I (Fig. 2G), in BHK-21 cells resulted in the labeling of small vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm and also present under the plasma membrane. In contrast, the expression of the two activating mutants, Rab7I41M (data not shown) or Rab7Q67L (Fig. 2, H, M, and N), led to the formation of larger vesicles again not restricted to the perinuclear area. The distribution of the CI-MPR also changed dramatically upon overexpression of Rab7Q67L. Normally, the CI-MPR staining was mainly restricted to perinuclear structures such as in cells transfected with Rab7 wt, Rab7T22N, and Rab7N125I (Fig. 2, A-C). When the Rab7Q67L was expressed the CI-MPR staining was no longer confined to these perinuclear structures (Fig. 2D). Other cells transfected with Rab7Q67L are shown in Fig. 2, I, J, M, and N Arrows indicate nontransfected cells in which the distribution of the CI-MPR was unaffected. Expression of the Rab7ΔC mutant resulted in a cytosolic localization of this protein and had no effect on the distribution of the CI-MPR (data not shown). Lucifer Yellow is a fluid phase endocytic marker that labels early endosomes in the first 5-10 min of internalization and, after longer incubation times, late endosomes and lysosomes. We investigated whether this marker was able to stain the Rab7 compartment. Cells transfected with the different constructs were first allowed to internalize Lucifer Yellow for 5 min to primarily label the early endosomal compartment. After extensive washing the cells were reincubated at 37°C for various times to allow accumulation of the marker in late endosomes and lysosomes. 5 min of internalization were sufficient to detect the Lucifer Yellow marker in small vesicles scattered throughout the cell. No co-localization with the Rab7 wt protein, that was mainly restricted to the perinuclear area (Fig. 2, K and O) or with any other Rab7 mutant protein (data not shown), was observed. After 30 min of chase Lucifer Yellow was mainly present in the perinuclear region and found to co-localize with the Rab7 wt protein (Fig. 2, L and P). A similar co-localization was found when the different Rab7 mutant proteins were expressed (data not shown). To analyze the effect of the overexpression of the Rab7 mutant proteins on the first steps of endocytosis we measured the internalization of transferrin and horseradish peroxidase. Transferrin binds iron at the cell surface, is clustered into coated pits, and is internalized by coated vesicles. It is then transported to the early endosomes where it looses the iron and is recycled back to the membrane together with its receptor. Overexpression of Rab5 doubles the rate of internalization of transferrin whereas expression of the dominant negative mutant Rab5N133I inhibits endocytosis of this marker, as described previously (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 18Bucci C. Lütcke A. Steele-Mortimer O. Chiariello M. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Bruni C.B. Simons K. Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). As expected the initial rate of internalization of 125I-transferrin was altered in cells expressing Rab5 or Rab5N133I but no significant change was detectable upon overexpression of Rab7 wt or any of the Rab7 mutants. After 5 min there was a 70% increase in the amount of internalized transferrin in cells overexpressing the wt Rab5 protein and a 30% decrease in cells expressing the Rab5N133I mutant protein (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of all the Rab7 constructs also did not affect the recycling of 125I-transferrin to the plasma membrane (data not shown). Horseradish peroxidase is currently used as a marker of fluid phase endocytosis. Overexpression of Rab5 and Rab5N133I mutant changes the amount of horseradish peroxidase internalized in the cells (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rab5 wt doubles the amount of horseradish peroxidase accumulated in the cells after 60 min of internalization, while the expression of the Rab5N133I mutant causes a 30% decrease (Fig. 3B). No significant changes were detected after overexpression of the Rab7 wt or mutant proteins at this (Fig. 3B) and at earlier or later time points (data not shown). To study the effect of Rab7 on the endocytic pathway we examined the internalization and degradation of 125I-LDL in BHK-21 cells overexpressing the Rab7 wt and mutant proteins. LDL binds a specific receptor on the surface of cultured fibroblast with high affinity. LDL is internalized and degraded, so that its cholesterol component is made available for cellular membrane synthesis while the receptor is recycled to the plasma membrane. Only a very small amount of LDL is recycled to the plasma membrane. Before transfection, BHK-21 cells were incubated for 24 h in medium complemented with human LDS. After transfection the cells were allowed to internalize 125I-LDL added to the medium at a concentration of 20 μg/ml for 5 h and the amount of 125I-LDL surface bound, internalized, and degraded was estimated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 4 shows a typical experiment of 125I-LDL internalization (Fig. 4A) and degradation (Fig. 4B). The accumulation of 125I-LDL in BHK-21 cells showed a 50% increase in cells overexpressing Rab5 (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the contention that the Rab5 protein is able to accelerate the kinetics of endocytosis (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). An increase of approximately 50% in the intracellular accumulation of 125I-LDL was also observed in cells expressing Rab7T22N and Rab7N125I, compared to control cells (Fig. 4A). However, this effect was accompanied by a strong inhibition (more than 60%) of the degradation of LDL (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of 125I-LDL degradation was also observed in cells transfected with the Rab5N133I mutant protein but in this case the amount of 125I-LDL internalized was approximately 30% less than in control cells (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with previous findings that dominant negative mutants of Rab5 inhibit endocytosis (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 18Bucci C. Lütcke A. Steele-Mortimer O. Chiariello M. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Bruni C.B. Simons K. Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). No effect on 125I-LDL intracellular accumulation or degradation was detected upon overexpression of the Rab7ΔC mutant compared to control cells. This is consistent with the hypothesis that this mutant is not post-translationally modified, is not able to attach to the membrane, and therefore is not functional. To demonstrate that Rab7 did not interfere with the first steps of endocytosis we measured the initial internalization rate of 125I-LDL in cells expressing the Rab7 and Rab5 wt and mutant proteins (data not shown). After transfection cells were allowed to bind 125I-LDL for 2 h at 4°C and the excess of unbound ligand was removed by washing. In all transfected cells the number of surface 125I-LDL-binding sites was similar and 90% of 125I-LDL was specifically bound. To measure the rate of uptake the cells were then shifted at 37°C for different periods of time ranging from 30 s to 60 min and the fraction of internalized 125I-LDL was determined. After 5 min control cells had internalized 70% of prebound 125I-LDL while cells expressing the dominant negative mutants of Rab5 had internalized only 40%. Conversely, the internalization rate of 125I-LDL was accelerated in cells expressing the Rab5 wt protein since in these cells about 70% of the prebound 125I-LDL was internalized within 2.5 min. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that Rab5 regulates the kinetics of receptor-mediated endocytosis (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 19Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). No effect was detected on the initial internalization rate upon overexpression of Rab7 wt or any mutant protein (data not shown). These data demonstrate that Rab5 and Rab7 have distinct roles in regulating the endocytic pathway. While Rab5 controls the early steps and is able to modify the kinetics of endocytosis, Rab7 does not influence the initial steps of the pathway but has a fundamental role in regulating transport to late endocytic compartments. In this paper we have studied the role of Rab7 in the endocytic pathway. We transiently expressed in BHK-21 cells several mutants of the protein with impaired ability to bind or hydrolyze GTP and we monitored their effect on the morphology of the late endosomal compartment and on the internalization and/or degradation of different endocytic markers. We demonstrated that Rab7 plays an important role in late steps of endocytosis since the expression of the two dominant negative mutant proteins causes a marked inhibition of the degradation of 125I-LDL while the initial internalization rate remains unchanged. Moreover, no effect of the expression of any Rab7 mutant protein was detected in the internalization and/or recycling of transferrin or horseradish peroxidase. These findings show that Rab7 does not function in the early endocytic pathway and does not influence the kinetics of internalization. The early steps of endocytosis are instead regulated by the Rab5 proteins (18Bucci C. Lütcke A. Steele-Mortimer O. Chiariello M. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Bruni C.B. Simons K. Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Rab7 therefore functions in a later step compared to Rab5 and influences the late endosome organization. Consistent with this conclusion, expression of different mutants impaired in their ability to bind or hydrolyze GTP causes big changes in the morphology of the compartment as judged by the immunofluorescence distribution of CI-MPR and the Rab7 mutant proteins. The Rab7 protein has been previously localized to late endosomes in NRK cells by co-localization with the CI-MPR by electron microscopy studies (4Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, the protein seems to be present mainly in a CI-MPR negative compartment in BHK-21 cells. This compartment is labeled in 30 min by Lucifer Yellow, a fluid phase marker of the endocytic pathway, suggesting that the CI-MPR labels only restricted areas of the late endosomal compartment (Fig. 2). Remarkably, we also noticed a drastic change in the distribution of the CI-MPR upon expression of the Rab7Q67L constitutively active mutant. These data disagree with a previous report in which the distribution of the CI-MPR in a stable cell line expressing the Rab7Q67L did not show any detectable change (9Méresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The organization of the endosomal compartment seems to be quite different between BHK-21 cells, used in this study, and the inducible HeLa cell lines used by Chavrier and colleagues (9Méresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have transiently expressed the Rab7Q67L mutant also in HeLa cells and could detect a similar effect even if less pronounced (data not shown). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that in our experiments the use of the vT7 infection/transfection expression system causes a higher level of expression of the mutant protein (more than 15-fold over the endogenous) in a very short time (4 h). In the stable cell lines used by Chavrier and colleagues (9Méresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lower levels of expression (4-5-fold over the endogenous) were achieved after a very long time (3 days of induction). During this time cells may have adapted to the presence of the Rab7Q67L protein and might have been able to overcome the redistribution of the CI-MPR. The expression of the constitutively active Rab7Q67L protein causes the formation of large endocytic structures while expression of the two dominant negative mutants (Rab7T22N and Rab7N125I) gives a very fine and punctate staining. These effects resemble those produced by Rab5 on early endosomes. Expression of the Rab5Q79L activating mutant induces the formation of giant early endosomes while expression of the Rab5N133I mutant causes accumulation of small vesicles and tubules at the periphery of the cell (11Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 19Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 26Li G. Barbieri M.A. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the effect of Rab5 is due to its ability to control fusion at the level of early endosomes one could imagine the same to be true for Rab7 at the level of late endosomes. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that 125I-LDL degradation is inhibited in cells expressing the Rab7T22N and Rab7N125I mutant proteins. In these cells a delayed delivery to the late endocytic compartment due to inhibition of fusion would prevent efficient degradation of 125I-LDL and would allow its accumulation in the cells (Fig. 4). Our data do not discriminate whether the Rab7 protein controls early to late endosomes or late endosomes to lysosomes transport or both. The development of in vitro assays to study these two different steps will be required to solve this issue. However, our results indicate that the Rab7 protein plays a fundamental role in the endocytic pathway at the level of late endosomes, probably controlling fusion. This is demonstrated by the morphological changes of the compartment upon overexpression of the Rab7 wt and mutant proteins and by the strong effect on LDL degradation upon expression of the dominant negative mutants. Further characterization of this late endosomal compartment by morphological and biochemical assays together with the identification of interacting components of Rab7 will be required to pinpoint the site of action of this protein and gain complete understanding of its role in the late endocytic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2149483446,"We have cloned a novel member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of proteins from a human liver cDNA library. The isolated cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 508 amino acids, which has been tentatively called MMP-19. This protein exhibits the domain structure characteristic of previously described MMPs, including a signal sequence, a prodomain with the cysteine residue essential for maintaining the latency of these enzymes, an activation locus with the zinc-binding site, and a COOH-terminal fragment with sequence similarity to hemopexin. However, it lacks a series of structural features distinctive of the diverse MMP subclasses, including the Asp, Tyr, and Gly residues located close to the zinc-binding site in collagenases, the fibronectin-like domain of gelatinases, the transmembrane domain of membrane-type (MT) MMPs, and the furin-activation sequence common to stromelysin-3 and MT-MMPs. In addition, the 9-residue insertion rich in hydrophobic amino acids present at the hinge region in stromelysins is replaced in MMP-19 by a longer insertion very rich in acidic residues. On the basis of these structural characteristics, we propose that MMP-19 does not belong to any of the previously defined MMP-subclasses and may represent the first member of a new MMP subfamily. Chromosomal location of the MMP-19 gene revealed that it maps to chromosome 12q14, which is also a unique location for any MMPs mapped to date. The cDNA encoding a full-length MMP-19 was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and after purification and refolding, the recombinant protein was able to degrade synthetic substrates for MMPs. MMP-19 proteolytic activity was abolished by TIMP-2 and EDTA, thus providing additional evidence that the isolated cDNA codes for an authentic MMP. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNAs isolated from a variety of human tissues revealed that MMP-19 is mainly expressed in placenta, lung, pancreas, ovary, spleen, and intestine, suggesting that it may play a specialized role in these tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1982669384,"Endotoxic shock is a life-threatening consequence of severe Gram-negative infection characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation and severe hypotension. The production of nitric oxide (NO), through the inducible NO synthase pathway, has been implicated as a major contributor in this process. We now demonstrate that heme oxygenase (HO), an enzyme that generates carbon monoxide (CO) in the course of heme metabolism, may also be involved in the hemodynamic compromise of endotoxic shock. Inducible HO (HO-1) mRNA levels are dramatically increased in aortic tissue from rats receiving endotoxin, and this increase in vascular HO-1 message is associated with an 8.9-fold increase in HO enzyme activity in vivo Immunocytochemical staining localizes an increase in HO-1 protein within smooth muscle cells of both large (aorta) and small (arterioles) blood vessels. Furthermore, zinc protoporphyrin IX, an inhibitor of HO activity, abrogates endotoxin-induced hypotension in rats. Studies performed in rat vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro show that the induction of HO-1 mRNA is regulated at the level of gene transcription, and this induction is independent of NO production. Taken together, these studies suggest that the up-regulation of HO-1, and the subsequent production of CO, contributes to the reduction in vascular tone during endotoxic shock.

Lancet. 1991; 338: 732-736Abstract PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). One of the most important cytokines in the cascade of events leading to LPS-induced hypotension is interleukin (IL)-1β (1Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 3Epstein F.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that IL-1β stimulates the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and increases the production of NO in vascular smooth muscle cells (4Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M.

NO is a labile, free radical gas that acts as a potent vasodilator (5Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 6Palmer R.M.J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1993; 2: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The importance of NO in the pathogenesis of endotoxic shock has been emphasized by recent studies demonstrating that mice carrying a disrupted inducible NOS gene have an attenuated hypotensive-response to LPS (7MacMicking J.D.

HO is the enzyme that generates carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin (subsequently reduced to bilirubin) in the course of heme metabolism (9Schacter B.A. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 349-369PubMed Google Scholar). CO is a gas molecule that shares some of the properties of NO, inasmuch as CO binds to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP (10Marks G.S. Brien J.F. Nakatsu K. McLaughlin B.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 185-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Two distinct forms of heme oxygenase have been identified (9Schacter B.A. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 349-369PubMed Google Scholar): HO-1 (an inducible isozyme) and HO-2 (a non-inducible isozyme). Morita and colleagues (11Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that HO-1 is induced by hypoxia in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro, and that its product, CO, promotes the accumulation of cGMP in this cell type. The investigators also showed that smooth muscle cell-derived CO inhibits the production of endothelium-derived vasoactive agents (such as endothelin-1 and platelet-derived growth factor-B) under hypoxic conditions (12Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study by Raju and Maines (13Raju V.S. Maines M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1814-1822PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that expression of HO-1 in the cardiovascular system is up-regulated in vivo using a model of acute renal ischemia and reperfusion. The authors speculated that increased HO-1 expression, and the ensuing CO production, may promote vasodilation as a defense response to renal ischemia/reperfusion. These previous studies (both in vitro and in vivo) suggest a physiologic role for CO in vascular biology. We designed the present study to further understand the role of CO in endotoxic shock by 1) analyzing the regulation of vascular HO-1 in vivo, 2) administering zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of HO activity, to rats made hypotensive by LPS, and 3) investigating the mechanism of HO-1 induction in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro Salmonella typhosa LPS (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.9% saline and stored at −20°C. Recombinant human IL-1β (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA) was stored at −80°C until use. ZnPP (Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT) was dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH, then immediately prior to administration this solution was neutralized with 0.1 N HCl as described (14Maines M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 673: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because ZnPP has effects unrelated to HO inhibition when exposed to light (15Zygmunt P.M. Högestätt E.D. Grundemar L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1994; 152: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we protected the ZnPP from light during its preparation and use. Both the L-arginine analogue Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and S-methylisothiourea sulfate (SMT; Sigma) were dissolved in sterile water and stored at −20°C until their use. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Gunther et al. (16Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) (Sigma). RASMC were passaged every 4-7 days, and experiments were performed on cells 6-8 passages from primary culture. After the cells had grown to confluence, they were placed in 2% fetal calf serum 12 h before the experiments. Total RNA was obtained from rat aortas and cultured smooth muscle cells by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifuged through cesium chloride (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized at 68°C for 2 h with 32P-labeled rat HO-1 or HO-2 probes (11Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The hybridized filters were then washed in 30 mM sodium chloride, 3 mM sodium citrate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution at 55°C and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film at −80°C for 4-12 h or stored on phosphor screens for 2-4 h. To correct for differences in RNA loading, the filters were washed in a 50% formamide solution at 80°C and rehybridized with an 18 or 28 S ribosomal RNA probe. Images were displayed, and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). RASMC were either not stimulated (vehicle) or stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. The cells were subsequently lysed, and nuclei were isolated as described (4Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z.

Invest. 1990; 86: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Nuclear suspension (200 μl) was incubated with 0.5 mM each of CTP, ATP, and GTP and with 250 μCi of 32P-labeled UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) (Du Pont NEN). The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and resuspended at equal counts/min/ml in hybridization buffer (9.7 × 106 cpm/ml). Denatured probes (1 μg) dot-blotted on nitrocellulose filters were hybridized at 40°C for 4 days in the presence of formamide. cDNA for HO-1, HO-2, and β-actin genes were used as probes. Aortas were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) treated with vehicle or LPS (4 mg/kg intravenously), the adventitia was stripped, and the tissue was homogenized with Polytron™ in homogenization buffer (30 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.15 M NaCl) containing Complete™ protease inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant fraction was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing Complete™ protease inhibitor. HO enzyme activity was measured by bilirubin generation as described (19Maines M.D. Ibrahim N.G. Kappas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5900-5903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Balla G.

The liver microsomal supernatant fraction from the control animal served as the source of biliverdin reductase. A reaction mixture (0.5 ml) containing 33 μM hemin, rat liver microsomal supernatant fraction (0.3 mg), NADPH generating system, and aortic microsomal protein was incubated at 37°C for 10 min in the dark. The reaction mixture without NADPH generating system served as a blank. The reactions were stopped by placement on ice, and subsequently scanned with a spectrophotometer (Beckman, Columbia, MD). The amount of bilirubin formed was determined as the difference in optical density units between 462 and 530 nm (extinction coefficient, 40 nm−1 cm−1 for bilirubin). HO enzyme activity was expressed as nanomoles (nmol) of bilirubin formed/mg of protein/h. The protein concentration was determined by a dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) treated with LPS or vehicle were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The aortas were removed, post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C, and then soaked in 30% sucrose for 2 days at 4°C. The specimens were cut at a thickness of 5 μm. Immunocytochemical procedure was performed as described (21Lee W.-S. Smith M.S. Hoffman G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5163-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 22Kanai Y. Stelzner M.G. Lee W.-S. Wells R.G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263Google Scholar). To reduce nonspecific binding, the sections were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against purified rat liver HO-1 (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC, Canada) was applied for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4°C at a dilution of 1:1000-1200. Sections were rinsed twice with high salt phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 M NaCl) and once with regular phosphate-buffered saline (5 min for each wash) and then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. They were then rinsed with phosphate buffered saline and incubated with avidin-biotin complex (ABC elite kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the tissue sections were treated with diaminobenzidine in phosphate buffered saline-H2O2 for 1-3 min using the peroxidase substrate kit DAB (Vector) and then transferred into phosphate buffered saline solution to stop the reaction. The presence of HO-1 was indicated by the development of a brown color within the cytoplasm. Counterstaining was performed with 0.5% methyl green. To determine the amount of NO produced by RASMC, we measured a stable product of NO oxidation, NO2− (nitrite), by a standard method (4Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M.

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red for the experiments assessing nitrite concentrations. The nitrite samples were normalized according to protein concentration of the cultured cells (nmol/mg protein). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 175-200 g received an intraperitoneal injection of thiobutabarbital sodium (100 mg/kg), which kept them anesthetized throughout the experiment. The trachea was cannulated with a tubing adapter. Then the right carotid artery was cannulated with PE-50 tubing to measure arterial pressure (24Haas J.A. Khraibi A.A. Perrella M.A. Knox F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264Crossref Google Scholar, 25Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.-M. Lee W.-S. Shieh S. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Lowenstein C.J. Long N.C. Haber E. Shore S. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using MacLab monitoring equipment from ADInstruments, Inc. (Milford, MA). Saline (0.9%) was used as a control for LPS and ZnPP. The LPS group received LPS (4 mg/kg intra-arterially) and saline vehicle in place of ZnPP. The LPS+ZnPP groups received LPS (4 mg/kg intra-arterially) followed by ZnPP (10 μmol/kg or 1 μmol/kg intraperitoneally). The ZnPP group received ZnPP (10 μmol/kg intraperitoneally) and saline vehicle in place of LPS. After an initial 25% decrease in mean arterial pressure (corresponding to time point 0) in the rats receiving LPS (LPS group and LPS+ZnPP groups), ZnPP (or saline vehicle) was administered and mean arterial pressure was monitored over the next 90 min. Preliminary experiments revealed that all rats responded to LPS with time; however, if a rat's mean arterial pressure did not decrease within 2 h, it was excluded from the study. Thus, only the rats most sensitive to LPS were used and it was not necessary to prolong their time under anesthesia. Comparisons between the vehicle and LPS-treated groups for HO enzyme activity were made using unpaired t tests (two-tailed). Comparisons of hemodynamic data between groups were made by factorial analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test, or unpaired t tests. Statistical significance was accepted for a p value < 0.05. To determine if LPS regulates vascular HO-1 in an animal model of endotoxic shock, we injected rats with vehicle or S. typhosa LPS (4 mg/kg intravenously). HO-1 mRNA levels were markedly increased in aortic tissue after 9 h of LPS stimulation compared with tissue from rats receiving vehicle (Fig. 1A). We have demonstrated previously that this dose of LPS produces hypotension in rats (25Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.-M. Lee W.-S. Shieh S. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Lowenstein C.J. Long N.C. Haber E. Shore S. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the 9-h time point was chosen after performing an in vivo time-course experiment to assess maximal HO-1 mRNA induction. Moreover, LPS induced HO-1 message as early as 2 h after stimulation, and LPS did not increase HO-2 mRNA levels (data not shown). We next assessed whether the increase in HO-1 mRNA levels corresponded to an increase in HO enzyme activity. Rats were given vehicle or LPS (4 mg/kg intravenously), and the aortas were harvested 9 h later (adventitia of the vessels was stripped prior to analysis). LPS promoted an 8.9-fold increase (p < 0.05) in HO enzyme activity (Fig. 1B). In fact, the level of HO enzyme activity in the aortic tissue from rats receiving LPS (36.3 ± 2.4 nmol/mg of protein/h) was comparable to the level of HO activity in the liver of control rats (40 ± 2.1 nmol/mg of protein/h, p = 0.34). The activity of HO is typically highest in organs rich in reticuloendothelial cells (i.e. liver, spleen, and bone marrow) (9Schacter B.A. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 349-369PubMed Google Scholar, 10Marks G.S. Brien J.F. Nakatsu K. McLaughlin B.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 185-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate the significant amount of inducible HO enzyme activity generated in vascular tissue after LPS stimulation. Preliminary experiments were also performed to determine a dose of ZnPP that would suppress, but not abolish, vascular HO activity in vivo When ZnPP was administered at a dose of 10 μmol/kg (intraperitoneally) 1 h after LPS, the level of vascular HO enzyme activity (6.1 nmol/mg of protein/h) was very similar to that of control rats (Fig. 1B). Thus, ZnPP doses of 10 and 1 μmol/kg were used in subsequent hemodynamic experiments. To localize the cell type within the vessel responsible for the increase in HO enzyme activity, immunocytochemical staining was performed using a rabbit anti-HO-1 antibody. Staining for HO-1 protein was increased in the smooth muscle cells of aortas from rats receiving LPS (Fig. 2B) compared with rats receiving vehicle (Fig. 2A). Moreover, immunocytochemical staining demonstrated an LPS-induced increase in HO-1 expression in the smooth muscle cells of arterioles (Fig. 2, E and F compared with C and D), smaller vessels that contribute to the regulation of vascular tone. Staining for HO-1 was also increased in the endothelium of aortas and arterioles after LPS stimulation. These data demonstrate an increase in vascular HO-1 mRNA and protein levels after LPS administration in vivo and, more importantly, an increase in HO enzyme activity. To provide evidence that HO contributes to the reduction in arterial pressure associated with endotoxemia, we gave ZnPP to rats made hypotensive by LPS. S. typhosa LPS given at a dose of 4 mg/kg intra-arterially produced profound and reproducible hypotension in male Sprague-Dawley rats (LPS group, Fig. 3). We then gave the same dose of LPS to another group of rats, followed by ZnPP (10 or 1 μmol/kg intraperitoneally) after an initial 25% decrease in mean arterial pressure (LPS+ZnPP groups, Fig. 3). By the time the arterial pressure had decreased by 25%, HO-1 mRNA levels had increased by 4-fold (Fig. 3, inset). ZnPP given at a dose of 10 μmol/kg after the onset of LPS-induced shock abolished the hypotension and produced a significantly higher mean arterial pressure than the LPS group after 30, 60, and 90 min (p < 0.05). ZnPP administered at a dose of 1 μmol/kg arrested the LPS-induced hypotension, but the response was significantly less than in the higher dose (10 μmol/kg) LPS+ZnPP group after 30 and 60 min (p < 0.05). ZnPP did not significantly increase mean arterial pressure when given at the dose of 10 μmol/kg intraperitoneally to rats not receiving LPS (ZnPP group, Fig. 3). The lack of an increase in arterial pressure again suggests this dose of ZnPP (10 μmol/kg) did not completely inhibit HO enzyme activity. Mean arterial pressure was not altered in control rats receiving vehicles in the place of LPS and ZnPP (data not shown). To further understand the molecular mechanisms regulating vascular HO-1, we investigated the induction of HO-1 mRNA by IL-1β in cultured RASMC. Northern blot analyses were performed with total RNA from RASMC exposed to either vehicle or IL-1β. The blots were then hybridized to HO-1 and HO-2 cDNA probes. A representative Northern blot of a time-course experiment of HO-1 stimulation by IL-1β (10 ng/ml, dose promoting maximal induction) is presented in Fig. 4A In contrast to the more rapid in vivo induction (within 2 h), IL-1β did not increase HO-1 mRNA until 4 h after stimulation in vitro, and peak induction occurred after 24 h. The time course of HO-1 mRNA stimulation by IL-1β, including additional samples extending the stimulation to 48 h, is graphically illustrated in Fig. 4B Twenty-four hours after the administration of IL-1β, HO-1 mRNA increased by 5.8-fold compared to vehicle. The induction of HO-1 mRNA by IL-1β decreased to 2.8-fold after 48 h. The message for HO-2, in contrast to HO-1, varied minimally after treatment with IL-1β (Fig. 4C). To determine the mechanism by which IL-1β increases HO-1 mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells, we performed experiments to assess the transcriptional rate and mRNA stability of HO-1. Nuclear run-on experiments showed a 5-fold increase in the rate of HO-1 gene transcription after 24 h of IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 5A). Stability of HO-1 message experiments, as determined by measuring mRNA levels in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, demonstrated a mRNA half-life of 1.3 h after exposure to vehicle (Fig. 5B). The half-life of HO-1 mRNA was not prolonged by IL-1β. These experiments demonstrate the increase in HO-1 mRNA levels by IL-1β stimulation is the result of an increase in HO-1 gene transcription. IL-1β did not alter the transcriptional rate (Fig. 5A) or the half-life (data not shown) of HO-2 mRNA. Investigators have recently suggested that NO itself can induce HO-1 in vitro (26Durante W. Kroll M.H. Christodoulides N. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. FASEB J. 1996; 10Google Scholar). Thus, to determine if an increase in NO production contributed to the induction of HO-1 mRNA, RASMC were treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence or absence of L-NAME (10−3M). L-NAME did not inhibit IL-1β-induced HO-1 mRNA induction (Fig. 6A). This study was also performed using a more specific inhibitor of inducible NOS (27Szabo C. Southan G.J. Thiemermann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12472-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), SMT. SMT (10−4M) also had no effect on the induction of HO-1 mRNA by IL-1β (Fig. 6A). To make sure that NO production was inhibited by L-NAME and SMT, we measured a stable product of NO oxidation, NO2− (nitrite) (23Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannebaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar), in these experiments. The doses of L-NAME (10−3M) and SMT (10−4M) were chosen after performing dose-response experiments to select the minimum dose of each agent necessary to inhibit the accumulation of nitrite in the culture media (data not shown). Both L-NAME and SMT significantly inhibited the accumulation of nitrite (Fig. 6B); however, they had no effect on the induction of HO-1 mRNA levels. These studies demonstrate that the induction of HO-1 message by IL-1β occurs through a NO-independent pathway. CO, a gas formed endogenously from heme metabolism, shares many of the chemical and biological properties of NO (10Marks G.S. Brien J.F. Nakatsu K. McLaughlin B.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 185-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The physiologic importance of NO and the enzymes that foster the production of NO (NOS) have been studied in detail (5Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar–8Wei X.-Q. Charles I.G. Smith A. Ure J. Feng G.-j. Huang F.-p. Xu D. Muller W. Moncada S. Leiw F.Y.

Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar); however, much less is known about the physiologic function of CO and the heme degradative enzymes HO-1 and HO-2. A recent study (29Zakhary R. Gaine S.P. Dinerman J.L. Ruat M. Flavahan N.A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) showed prominent immunocytochemical staining for HO-2 in the vascular endothelium under basal conditions. HO-2 staining was also present in adventitial nerves of blood vessels and in neurons in the autonomic ganglia. The location of the staining for HO-2 was comparable with constitutive isoforms of NOS, and inhibitors of HO enzyme activity were able to partially attenuate endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This study implied complementary and possibly related roles for HO-2 and constitutive isoforms of NOS (29Zakhary R. Gaine S.P. Dinerman J.L. Ruat M. Flavahan N.A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Studies have also demonstrated that CO can be produced by arteries in vivo (30Grundemar L. Johansson M.-B. Ekelund M. Högestätt E.D. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1995; 153: 203-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Cook M.N. Nakatsu K. Marks G.S. McLaughlin B.E. Vreman H.J. Stevenson D.K. Brien J.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and higher doses of HO inhibitors (such as ZnPP, 45 μmol/kg) induce an increase in arterial pressure in rats (32Johnson R.A. Lavesa M. Askari B. Abraham N.G. Nasjletti A. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 166-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together these studies suggest CO, generated by HO-2, may contribute to the regulation of vascular tone under basal conditions. However, the role of the inducible isoform of HO, HO-1, in vascular biology and pathophysiology is less clear. To gain more insight into the potential role of CO in the regulation of vascular tone during endotoxic shock (a cytokine-driven disease process; Refs. 1Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar and 3Epstein F.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), we analyzed the regulation of HO-1 in vascular tissue in vivo A dramatic increase in HO-1 mRNA occurred in aortic tissue from rats receiving LPS compared with rats receiving vehicle (Fig. 1A), and this increase in message was associated with an 8.9-fold increase in HO enzyme activity (Fig. 1B). HO-2 mRNA was not increased by LPS. The increase in HO-1 protein was present in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of both large (aorta, Fig. 2B) and small (arterioles, Fig. 2, E and F) blood vessels. The marked increase in HO enzyme activity by LPS (to a level of activity comparable with that of the liver) would suggest that HO-1-generated CO may contribute to the reduction in vascular tone during endotoxic shock. To clarify the role of HO-1 induction in endotoxic shock, we administered ZnPP to rats that were made hypotensive by LPS. We used ZnPP instead of other metalloporphyrins to inhibit HO activity because ZnPP has been shown to be selective for HO over other microsomal enzymes (14Maines M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 673: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Moreover, ZnPP in concentrations less than 50 μmol has no inhibitory effect on NOS activity, and at a dose of 10 μmol it has no effect on soluble guanylyl cyclase activity in vascular endothelial cells (29Zakhary R. Gaine S.P. Dinerman J.L. Ruat M. Flavahan N.A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In our experiments, ZnPP given in a dose of 10 μmol/kg abrogated the LPS-induced hypotension and it produced a significantly higher mean arterial pressure in the LPS+ZnPP group (10 μmol/kg) compared with the LPS alone group (Fig. 3). ZnPP at a dose of 1 μmol/kg prevented a further decrease in arterial pressure in rats receiving LPS, and this response was less dramatic than in the LPS-stimulated rats receiving 10 μmol/kg ZnPP. These data support the importance of HO-1, and subsequently CO, in the hemodynamic compromise of endotoxic shock. Although our data support a detrimental role for vascular HO-1 in endotoxic shock, a recent study proposed that further induction of HO-1 by hemoglobin may protect against the oxidative damage of endotoxemia (33Otterbein L. Sylvester S.L. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) by generating bilirubin (which has antioxidant properties; Ref. 34Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1042-1046Crossref Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). These investigators demonstrated that the administration of HO inhibitors at doses that decrease HO enzyme activity below basal levels (SnPP and ZnPP, 50 μmol/kg) made rats more susceptible to LPS-induced death (33Otterbein L. Sylvester S.L. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the available inhibitors of HO activity do not discriminate between HO-1 and HO-2. Thus, if HO-2 is an important regulator of basal vascular homeostasis (29Zakhary R. Gaine S.P. Dinerman J.L. Ruat M. Flavahan N.A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and an important neurotransmitter (35Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), we would speculate that inhibition of both HO-1 and HO-2 activity (similar to inhibition of both the constitutive and inducible pathways of NOS; Ref. 36Nava E. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. The Lancet. 1991; 338: 1555-1557Abstract PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) would be harmful during endotoxic shock. Because of this hypothesis, we chose to administer lower doses of ZnPP (10 and 1 μmol/kg) in rats after the onset of endotoxin-induced shock to prevent complete inhibition of HO enzyme activity. ZnPP given at the lower doses curtailed the LPS-induced hypotension (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the beneficial hemodynamic response to ZnPP in rats receiving LPS reflects an inhibition of inducible HO activity. Recent preliminary reports suggest that NO itself can induce HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in cell culture (26Durante W. Kroll M.H. Christodoulides N. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. FASEB J. 1996; 10Google Scholar), and we have demonstrated previously that IL-1β stimulates an increase in NO production through the inducible NOS pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro (4Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to determine if the induction of HO-1 mRNA by IL-1β occurs indirectly through an increase in NO production, we stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells with IL-1β in the presence of two different NOS inhibitors. Neither L-NAME nor SMT (both of which inhibited the accumulation of NO) were able to impede the induction of HO-1 mRNA by IL-1β (Fig. 6). These data suggest the induction of HO-1 mRNA by IL-1β occurs through a NO-independent pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our study demonstrates that HO-1-derived enzyme activity can be up-regulated within vascular tissue by a pathophysiologic process, endotoxemia, in vivo In both large blood vessels (aorta) and small resistance vessels (arterioles), the increase in staining for HO-1 localized to vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The advent of specific HO-1 antagonists, or an HO-1 gene deletion animal, would allow us to gain more insight into the pathophysiologic role of HO-1 in endotoxic shock. However, the marked induction of HO-1 enzyme activity by LPS within vascular tissue, and the beneficial hemodynamic response to ZnPP in LPS-stimulated animals, would suggest that HO-1 (and subsequently CO) contributes to the reduction in vascular tone during endotoxic shock.

Initiation of the reaction in the absence of inhibitors resulted in explosive thrombin generation for factor VIIa·TF concentrations varying from 100 to 0.25 pM with the lag time or initiation phase of thrombin generation increasing from 0 to 180 s with decreasing factor VIIa·TF concentrations. During the propagation phase, prothrombin is quantitatively activated to 1.4 μMα-thrombin. At normal plasma concentration (2.5 nM) full-length recombinant TFPI prolonged the initiation phase of thrombin generation 2-fold, and the rate of thrombin generation in the propagation phase of the reaction was 25-50% that of the uninhibited reaction when the reaction was initiated with 1.25-20 pM factor VIIa·TF. Inhibition of the reaction by TFPI is associated with a delay in factor V activation. In the presence of TFPI no explosive thrombin generation was observed when factor VIII was omitted from reactions initiated by factor VIIa·TF concentrations ≤20 pM. This indicates that in the presence of TFPI the factor IXa·factor VIIIa pathway becomes essential at low factor VIIa·TF concentrations. In the reconstituted system, AT-III (3.4 μM) did not prolong the initiation phase of thrombin generation when the reaction was initiated with 1.25 pM factor VIIa·TF, nor did AT-III delay factor V activation. The rate of thrombin formation in the presence of AT-III was reduced to 30% that of the uninhibited reaction, and the α-thrombin formed was rapidly inhibited subsequent to its generation. The addition of HC-II alone at its physiological concentration (1.38 μM) to the procoagulant mixture did not alter the rate or extent of thrombin generation. Subsequently, the thrombin formed was slowly inhibited by HC-II. The slow inactivation of thrombin by HC-II does not contribute to thrombin inhibition in the presence of AT-III. In contrast, the combination of physiological levels of AT-III and TFPI inhibited explosive thrombin generation initiated by 1.25 pM factor VIIa·TF completely. The absence of prothrombin consumption indicated that the combination of TFPI and AT-III is able to prevent the formation of prothrombinase activity at low factor VIIa·TF concentrations. The data indicate that TFPI potentiates the action of AT-III by decreasing the rate of formation and thus the amount of catalyst formed in the reaction, enabling AT-III to effectively scavenge the limited traces of factor IXa and factor Xa formed in the presence of TFPI. The initiation of thrombin generation by increasing factor VIIa·TF concentrations in the presence of physiological concentrations of TFPI and AT-III showed dramatic changes in the maximal rates of thrombin generation over small changes in initiator concentration. These data demonstrate that significant thrombin generation becomes a “threshold-limited” event with regard to the initiating factor VIIa·TF concentration in the presence of TFPI and AT-III.

These data demonstrate that significant thrombin generation becomes a “threshold-limited” event with regard to the initiating factor VIIa·TF concentration in the presence of TFPI and AT-III. INTRODUCTIONThe extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation involves the activation of multiple coagulation factors leading to thrombin generation. The procoagulant reaction starts with the binding of activated factor VII (factor VIIa) to its cofactor, tissue factor (TF). 1The abbreviations used are:TFtissue factorTFPItissue factor pathway inhibitorAT-IIIantithrombin-IIIHC-IIheparin cofactor-IIFPR-ckD-phenylalanyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketoneTBSTris-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisF1fragment 1F2fragment 2IIaα-thrombin. TF is an integral membrane protein that is exposed as a result of vessel wall injury or cytokine activation of endothelial cells or peripheral blood monocytes. The membrane-bound factor VIIa·TF enzyme complex activates the zymogens factor X and factor IX by limited proteolysis (1Osterud B. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Factor IXa combines with factor VIIIa on the membrane surface to form a second complex that activates factor X. Once activated, factor Xa associates with factor Va on a membrane surface to form prothrombinase, which converts prothrombin into thrombin. (For reviews on blood coagulation and membrane-dependent reactions in blood coagulation see, respectively, Refs. 2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar and 3Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-227PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombin initially formed accelerates further thrombin generation by feedback activation of the procofactors factor V and factor VIII. Thrombin may also activate factor XI (4Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 5Naito K. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7353-7358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, in turn, activates more factor IX. Deficiencies in factors VII, X, IX, V, or VIII or prothrombin are associated with abnormal bleeding. Factor XI-deficient individuals rarely suffer from spontaneous bleeding; however, homozygotes may require replacement therapy during significant surgical challenge. Thrombin also activates platelets, which secrete their granule contents and aggregate upon activation. In addition, thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to generate the fibrin network and activates the protransglutaminase factor XIII. The fibrin-platelet aggregate, stabilized by factor XIIIa-catalyzed cross-links, forms the hemostatic plug, which maintains the integrity of the circulatory system following vessel wall perforation.In normal hemostasis, the procoagulant system is in balance with anticoagulant systems involved in the termination of the hemostatic reaction and the fibrinolytic system, which dissolves clots once they are formed. The anticoagulant systems consist of several stoichiometric protease inhibitors, the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), antithrombin-III (AT-III), and heparin cofactor-II (HC-II), and the dynamic protein C pathway, which involves thrombin, activated protein C, protein S, and thrombomodulin.TFPI is a reversible, active site-directed inhibitor of factor Xa, which regulates coagulation by inhibiting factor VIIa·TF in a factor Xa-dependent manner (for a review on TFPI see Ref. 6Rapaport S.I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The TFPI·factor Xa complex binds to the factor VIIa·TF complex, resulting in the formation of a TF·factor VIIa·TFPI·factor Xa quaternary complex (7Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although no human deficiencies have been reported, the in vivo relevance of TFPI is supported by experiments that showed the sensitization of rabbits to TF-triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation after immunodepletion of TFPI (8Sandset P.M. Warner-Cramer B.J. Rao L.V.M. Maki S.L. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).AT-III is a serine protease inhibitor whose importance in hemostasis is confirmed by the association of thrombosis with heterozygous AT-III deficiency (for reviews on AT-III see Refs. 9Blajchman M.N. Austin R.C. Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Sheffield W.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 2159-2171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). AT-III inhibits thrombin, factor Xa, factor IXa, factor VIIa, factor XIa, and factor XIIa in vitro by forming covalent complexes in which the active site of the protease is trapped. The action of AT-III is potentiated by heparinoids. The rate of inhibition by AT-III and the potentiation of the inhibition reaction by heparinoids varies for each target protease (10Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Factor Xa is protected from inactivation by AT-III when in a membrane-associated complex with factor Va (11Marciniack E. Br. J. Hematol. 1973; 24: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Rosenburg R.D. Rosenburg J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In contrast, factor VIIa inactivation by AT-III is only significant when the protease is bound to TF (13Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 767-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation of TF-bound factor VIIa by AT-III probably involves the opening of the active site of factor VIIa upon TF binding, allowing factor VIIa inactivation by the active site-directed AT-III. The low enzymatic activity of free factor VIIa provides a mechanism by which traces of factor VIIa may circulate in blood (14Morrissey J. Macik B.G. Neuenschwander P.F. Comp P.C. Blood. 1993; 81: 734-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).HC-II is a serine protease inhibitor circulating in blood plasma at a concentration of ∼1.2 μM (15Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Blood. 1985; 66: 769-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin is the only procoagulant reported to be inhibited by HC-II. The inhibition of thrombin by HC-II is potentiated by heparin and by dermatan sulfate (for a review on HC-II see Ref. 16Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A heterozygous deficiency of HC-II (activity levels < 60%) is found in approximately 1% of the healthy population and does not appear to be a risk factor for thrombosis. A homozygous deficient individual has not yet been identified (16Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).We have described reconstituted empirical (17Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mathematical (18Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23367-23373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) models for the tissue factor pathway to thrombin using purified coagulation factors and computer simulations based upon the known kinetic constants for the reactions thought to be essential in the procoagulant scheme. The reaction could be divided into two phases, an “initiation phase,” in which factor V and factor VIII were quantitatively cleaved and trivial amounts of factor Xa and factor IXa were produced, and a “propagation phase” in which prothrombin was quantitatively activated (17Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the concentration of initiator (factor VIIa·TF) was reduced, the initiation phase was prolonged while the rate of thrombin generation in the propagation phase varied by only 5-fold over a 1000-fold range of factor VIIa·TF concentration. The initiation phase was shortened when the reaction was initiated in the presence of factor Va while the propagation phase was dependent upon factor VIII and factor IX at factor VIIa·TF concentrations below 100 pM. The data obtained with the reconstituted empirical model using purified coagulation factors were reasonably approximated by the mathematical model. The data presented here extend the empirical tissue factor pathway to thrombin studies to include TFPI, AT-III, and HC-II.DISCUSSIONTFPI is a major inhibitor of thrombin generation, extending the “lag” time, or initiation phase, of thrombin generation and reducing the rate of thrombin generation during the propagation phase. The delay in the propagation phase of thrombin generation shows that TFPI exerts a relatively rapid inhibitory effect on the reaction, which is associated with delayed factor V activation. In the presence of TFPI as the only inhibitor, the factor IXa·factor VIIIa complex ultimately generates sufficient factor Xa, resulting in a bolus of prothrombinase activity independent of the initiator concentration. In the absence of the factor IXa·factor VIIIa pathway, TFPI reduces the maximally formed prothrombinase activity to 1% of that observed in the absence of the inhibitor at low (≤5 pM) factor VIIa·TF concentrations. Thus, the propagation phase of thrombin generation in the presence of TFPI is totally dependent upon factor IXa·factor VIIIa activity at low concentrations of factor VIIa·TF. These results provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that the failure of the hemostatic response upon injury in patients with hemophilia A or B is, in part, caused by the inactivation of low concentrations of factor VIIa·TF by TFPI (34Broze Jr., G.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Higuchi D.A. Girard J.J. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1988; 71: 335-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In flow studies using purified proteins Repke et al. (35Repke D. Gemmel C.H. Guha A. Turrito V.T. Broze G.J. Nemerson Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that in the presence of TFPI, ongoing factor Xa generation by factor VIIa·TF was only obtained in the presence of the factor IXa·factor VIIIa pathway.Several groups have reported the rate constants for the inhibition of factor Xa by full-length TFPI (36Huang Z.-F. Wun T.-C. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26950-26955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nordvang O. Bjorn S.E. Valintin S. Nielsen L.S. Wildgoose P. Beck T.C. Hedner U.

J. 1994; 297: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a recent study by Jesty et al. (39Jesty J. Wun T.C. Lorenz A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12686-12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reports the rate constants for the inhibition of the factor VIIa·TF complex by the preformed factor Xa·TFPI complex. The complexity of the procoagulant reactions (no steady state conditions established and enzyme occupation by multiple substrates) combined with the complexity of the inhibition reactions by TFPI makes it difficult to determine whether the observed inhibition of the reaction by TFPI can be explained by the reported kinetic constants. Significant (∼90%) inhibition of factor VIIa·TF activity by TFPI·factor Xa was observed by Jesty et al. (39Jesty J. Wun T.C. Lorenz A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12686-12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) after 60 s. This rapid effect of TFPI on factor VIIa·TF is in agreement with the rapid effect of TFPI on the initiation of the reaction in the reconstituted model.AT-III inhibits serine proteases by trapping the enzyme at an intermediate stage of proteolysis of the Arg393-Ser394 peptide bond (40Jornvall H. Fish W.W. Björk I. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Björk I. Danielsson A. Fenton II, J.W. Jornvall H.

Chem. 1982; 257: 2406-2411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Speculation based upon the relatively high (μM) physiological concentrations of AT-III compared with the trace amounts (2.5 nM) of TFPI in the circulation have suggested a potential role for AT-III as an inhibitor of factor VIIa·TF. However, no empirical comparisons on the relative potencies of TFPI and AT-III as inhibitors of factor VIIa·TF-dependent thrombin generation have been reported. The inhibitor AT-III displays a completely different profile of inhibition compared with TFPI. At 1.25 pM factor VIIa·TF, no increase in lag time is observed, while the rate of prothrombin consumption during the propagation phase was reduced by 50% in the presence of physiological concentrations of AT-III. These data demonstrate that full-length TFPI is the major inhibitor of factor VIIa·TF-initiated thrombin formation, while AT-III has no significant influence upon the initiation phase of the reaction, which is almost totally a function of the factor VIIa·TF concentration. The inhibition of factor VIIa bound to TF by AT-III (13Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 767-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is too slow to significantly inhibit the reaction during its early phase.In experiments initiated with 5 pM factor VIIa·TF, AT-III inhibited factor Xa generation by 50% during the initiation phase. This is consistent with a slight decrease in prothrombin consumption observed in the presence of AT-III. However, the reduced amounts of factor Xa and factor IXa generated by factor VIIa·TF when TFPI is present seem to become efficiently scavenged by AT-III, thus preventing explosive thrombin generation (Fig. 7, open diamonds).Factor Va has been reported to protect factor Xa from inactivation by AT-III (11Marciniack E. Br. J. Hematol. 1973; 24: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Rosenburg R.D. Rosenburg J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Factor V is cleaved by 2 min in the reaction and the picomolar amounts of factor Xa generated contemporaneously are saturated by this excess of factor Va and thus relatively protected against inactivation by AT-III. However, factor Xa inactivation can occur prior to factor V activation and/or prothrombinase complex formation. In this respect, the observed delay of factor V activation in the presence of TFPI may play an important role in the potentiation of the action of AT-III by TFPI (Fig. 7).In the absence of TFPI, protection of factor IXa by factor VIIIa against inactivation by AT-III is probably of less importance because of the relatively low concentration and the transient presence of active factor VIIIa due to its dissociation (26Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or proteolytic inactivation (29Vehar G.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 30Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8056-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Fay P.J.

Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33O'Brien D.P. Johnson D. Byfield P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to prothrombinase, the amount of factor VIIIa cofactor is probably the limiting factor for the formation of the factor IXa·factor VIIIa complex. In the presence of TFPI, however, the observed inhibitory effect of AT-III is probably also due to scavenging of the trace amounts of factor IXa generated. In this model the threshold for explosive thrombin generation in the presence of 2.5 nM TFPI and 3.4 μM AT-III is ∼20 pM factor VIIa·TF. The threshold level coincides with the minimal factor VIIa·TF concentration (20 pM) needed to generate considerable thrombin in the presence of TFPI and the absence of the factor IXa·VIIIa pathway (Fig. 4). This is an indication that AT-III prevents explosive thrombin generation by inhibiting the factor IXa·VIIIa pathway. This coincidence may, however, also be the result of a change in the reaction in the range of 10-20 pM from a reaction with no lag time to a reaction with a considerable lag time, which allows the effects of the additional factor Xa generation by factor IXa·factor VIIIa and the effects of the inhibitors to become more prominent. Overall, the effects of TFPI and AT-III acting in concert seem to result in a synergistic inhibition of thrombin generation at low concentrations of initiator, leading to a 70-fold higher inhibition than expected if their combined action would have been multiplicative. Although it seems that TFPI and AT-III act in synergy under these conditions, such claims of synergism must be made with caution without full knowledge of the mechanisms involved (43Berenbaum M.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 93-141PubMed Google Scholar). At present the complexity of the reaction does not allow a proof of true synergism between TFPI and AT-III.The major inhibitory effect of TFPI on factor VIIa·TF-initiated thrombin generation in the reconstituted model predicts that a TFPI deficiency would be a major risk factor for thrombosis. Titration of the effect of TFPI on thrombin generation revealed that TFPI exerts a significant inhibitory effect at 1 nM (Fig. 6). This TFPI concentration is approximately 50% of the normal plasma concentration, suggesting that an individual with a 50% TFPI level would derive a significant inhibitory benefit. Our data suggest, however, that a homozygous TFPI deficiency would result in massive thrombin formation, which may not be compatible with life. However this hypothesis does not take into account that the dependence on TFPI of inhibition of factor VIIa·TF-initiated thrombin generation might be less in the presence of the dynamic protein C pathway.Experiments with physiological concentrations of HC-II (1.38 μM) predict an insignificant role for this inhibitor as compared with AT-III. Thrombin generation proceeds in a similar fashion whether or not HC-II is present. Although a marginal effect of HC-II was observed on the activity of thrombin after the quantitative activation of prothrombin, no additional thrombin-inhibitory potential was observed when HC-II was combined with physiological concentrations of AT-III. This result supports the hypothesis that HC-II is not important as a coagulation inhibitor and is in agreement with the lack of a thrombotic tendency in individuals with reduced HC-II levels (16Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The combined effects of TFPI and AT-III prevent explosive thrombin generation by traces of factor VIIa·TF in the fully reconstituted system. The dramatic change in the rate of thrombin generation over a small change in the initiating factor VIIa·TF concentration (Fig. 13, Fig. 14) clearly demonstrates that significant thrombin generation becomes a threshold-limited event with regard to the initiating factor VIIa·TF concentration in the presence of TFPI and AT-III. The presence of traces of fibrinopeptide A, prothrombin F1·2, and thrombin·AT-III complexes in the plasma of normal individuals indicates that very low, but constant triggering of the coagulation cascade occurs in the unperturbed circulation. The present data suggest that the low level of basal activation of the coagulation system is largely controlled by the combined action of inhibitors like TFPI and AT-III, which prevent this apparent basal activity from turning into massive thrombin formation. INTRODUCTIONThe extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation involves the activation of multiple coagulation factors leading to thrombin generation. The procoagulant reaction starts with the binding of activated factor VII (factor VIIa) to its cofactor, tissue factor (TF). 1The abbreviations used are:TFtissue factorTFPItissue factor pathway inhibitorAT-IIIantithrombin-IIIHC-IIheparin cofactor-IIFPR-ckD-phenylalanyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketoneTBSTris-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisF1fragment 1F2fragment 2IIaα-thrombin. TF is an integral membrane protein that is exposed as a result of vessel wall injury or cytokine activation of endothelial cells or peripheral blood monocytes. The membrane-bound factor VIIa·TF enzyme complex activates the zymogens factor X and factor IX by limited proteolysis (1Osterud B. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Factor IXa combines with factor VIIIa on the membrane surface to form a second complex that activates factor X. Once activated, factor Xa associates with factor Va on a membrane surface to form prothrombinase, which converts prothrombin into thrombin. (For reviews on blood coagulation and membrane-dependent reactions in blood coagulation see, respectively, Refs. 2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar and 3Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-227PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombin initially formed accelerates further thrombin generation by feedback activation of the procofactors factor V and factor VIII. Thrombin may also activate factor XI (4Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 5Naito K. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7353-7358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, in turn, activates more factor IX. Deficiencies in factors VII, X, IX, V, or VIII or prothrombin are associated with abnormal bleeding. Factor XI-deficient individuals rarely suffer from spontaneous bleeding; however, homozygotes may require replacement therapy during significant surgical challenge. Thrombin also activates platelets, which secrete their granule contents and aggregate upon activation. In addition, thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to generate the fibrin network and activates the protransglutaminase factor XIII. The fibrin-platelet aggregate, stabilized by factor XIIIa-catalyzed cross-links, forms the hemostatic plug, which maintains the integrity of the circulatory system following vessel wall perforation.In normal hemostasis, the procoagulant system is in balance with anticoagulant systems involved in the termination of the hemostatic reaction and the fibrinolytic system, which dissolves clots once they are formed. The anticoagulant systems consist of several stoichiometric protease inhibitors, the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), antithrombin-III (AT-III), and heparin cofactor-II (HC-II), and the dynamic protein C pathway, which involves thrombin, activated protein C, protein S, and thrombomodulin.TFPI is a reversible, active site-directed inhibitor of factor Xa, which regulates coagulation by inhibiting factor VIIa·TF in a factor Xa-dependent manner (for a review on TFPI see Ref. 6Rapaport S.I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The TFPI·factor Xa complex binds to the factor VIIa·TF complex, resulting in the formation of a TF·factor VIIa·TFPI·factor Xa quaternary complex (7Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although no human deficiencies have been reported, the in vivo relevance of TFPI is supported by experiments that showed the sensitization of rabbits to TF-triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation after immunodepletion of TFPI (8Sandset P.M. Warner-Cramer B.J. Rao L.V.M. Maki S.L. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).AT-III is a serine protease inhibitor whose importance in hemostasis is confirmed by the association of thrombosis with heterozygous AT-III deficiency (for reviews on AT-III see Refs. 9Blajchman M.N. Austin R.C. Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Sheffield W.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 2159-2171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). AT-III inhibits thrombin, factor Xa, factor IXa, factor VIIa, factor XIa, and factor XIIa in vitro by forming covalent complexes in which the active site of the protease is trapped. The action of AT-III is potentiated by heparinoids. The rate of inhibition by AT-III and the potentiation of the inhibition reaction by heparinoids varies for each target protease (10Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Factor Xa is protected from inactivation by AT-III when in a membrane-associated complex with factor Va (11Marciniack E. Br. J. Hematol. 1973; 24: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Rosenburg R.D. Rosenburg J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In contrast, factor VIIa inactivation by AT-III is only significant when the protease is bound to TF (13Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 767-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation of TF-bound factor VIIa by AT-III probably involves the opening of the active site of factor VIIa upon TF binding, allowing factor VIIa inactivation by the active site-directed AT-III. The low enzymatic activity of free factor VIIa provides a mechanism by which traces of factor VIIa may circulate in blood (14Morrissey J. Macik B.G. Neuenschwander P.F. Comp P.C. Blood. 1993; 81: 734-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).HC-II is a serine protease inhibitor circulating in blood plasma at a concentration of ∼1.2 μM (15Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Blood. 1985; 66: 769-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin is the only procoagulant reported to be inhibited by HC-II. The inhibition of thrombin by HC-II is potentiated by heparin and by dermatan sulfate (for a review on HC-II see Ref. 16Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A heterozygous deficiency of HC-II (activity levels < 60%) is found in approximately 1% of the healthy population and does not appear to be a risk factor for thrombosis. A homozygous deficient individual has not yet been identified (16Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).We have described reconstituted empirical (17Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mathematical (18Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23367-23373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) models for the tissue factor pathway to thrombin using purified coagulation factors and computer simulations based upon the known kinetic constants for the reactions thought to be essential in the procoagulant scheme. The reaction could be divided into two phases, an “initiation phase,” in which factor V and factor VIII were quantitatively cleaved and trivial amounts of factor Xa and factor IXa were produced, and a “propagation phase” in which prothrombin was quantitatively activated (17Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the concentration of initiator (factor VIIa·TF) was reduced, the initiation phase was prolonged while the rate of thrombin generation in the propagation phase varied by only 5-fold over a 1000-fold range of factor VIIa·TF concentration. The initiation phase was shortened when the reaction was initiated in the presence of factor Va while the propagation phase was dependent upon factor VIII and factor IX at factor VIIa·TF concentrations below 100 pM. The data obtained with the reconstituted empirical model using purified coagulation factors were reasonably approximated by the mathematical model. The data presented here extend the empirical tissue factor pathway to thrombin studies to include TFPI, AT-III, and HC-II."

INTRODUCTIONThe metabolism of phosphoinositides has long been acknowledged to play a central role in the transduction of signals triggered by a variety of growth factors and hormones. Both the enzymes and their product phosphoinositides are present in virtually all eukaryotic organisms and tissues that have been studied. Over the past several years the complexity of phosphoinositide metabolism has become better appreciated. In the classically defined phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are:PtdInsphosphatidylinositolPI4KβPtdIns 4-kinase βkbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographybpbase pair(s)aaamino acid(s). turnover pathway, sequential phosphorylation of the 4 and 5 positions yields PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2, the latter of which acts as a substrate for phospholipase C producing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a stimulator of intracellular Ca2+ release (2Berridge M. Heslop J. Irvine R.F. Brown K.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and diacylglycerol, a stimulator of certain protein kinase C isoforms (3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar). More recently PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 have been shown to regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement through the association with a variety of actin binding proteins (4Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 5Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). PtdIns-4,5-P2 has also been shown to stimulate both phospholipase D (6Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Finally, all of these lipids are substrates of PtdIns 3-kinase, yielding an array of 3-phosphorylated products (9Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now clear that the synthesis of a variety of polyphosphoinositides from the starting substrate PtdIns is catalyzed by at least three types of PtdIns kinases (10Whitman M. Kaplan D. Roberts T. Cantley L. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).PtdIns 3-kinase (a type I enzyme) catalyzes the phosphorylation of PtdIns at the D3 position of the inositol ring. This enzyme was initially identified through its association with viral oncoproteins and a number of growth factor receptors (12Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). More recently several additional classes of PtdIns 3-kinases have been identified including a G protein-activated enzyme (13Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and VPS 34p, a protein involved in protein trafficking in yeast (14Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).PtdIns 4-kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of PtdIns at the D4 position of the inositol ring and have been divided into two types (II and III) based on their size and sensitivity to various compounds (11Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The type II enzymes were initially characterized as membrane-associated 55-kDa proteins whose lipid kinase activity is highly stimulated by detergent and inhibited by both adenosine and the monoclonal antibody 4C5G (11Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Endemann G.C. Graziani A. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The type III enzymes are membrane-associated proteins predicted to be >200 kDa in size that are less stimulated by detergent and are not inhibited by adenosine or 4C5G antibodies. The PtdIns 4-kinases are highly abundant and have been identified in a large number of membrane structures (reviewed Ref. 16Pike L. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Recently several PtdIns 4-kinases have been cloned and found to be homologous to PtdIns 3-kinases. They all contain both a lipid kinase unique domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to protein kinases. In yeast, the PIK1 gene encodes a 125-kDa protein that is indispensable for cell growth and plays a role in cytokinesis (17Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. Science. 1993; 262: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It contains the lipid kinase unique domain at its far N terminus and the catalytic domain in the characteristic C-terminal position. Although it is intermediate in size, its biochemical properties suggest that it is more similar to the type III enzyme (18Flanagan C.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium discoideum, a putative PtdIns 4-kinase has recently been cloned, whose domain structure is similar to PIK1, extending the identification of these proteins across several species (19Zhou K. Takegawa K. Emr S.D. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5645-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A second yeast gene, STT4, encodes a 200-kDa protein that is dispensable for growth in the presence of osmotic stabilizers and has been implicated in the protein kinase C pathway through its isolation in a screen for mutants sensitive to the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (20Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the first PtdIns 4-kinase from higher eukaryotes, PI4Kα, was cloned and shown to encode a 100-kDa protein with significant homology to STT4 and biochemical properties of a type II enzyme (21Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein, as well as STT4, contains adjacent lipid kinase unique and catalytic domains at its C terminus. An alternative splice of the PI4Kα gene that generates a 230-kDa protein has also been recently reported (22Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).These three types of PtdIns kinases all show homology to an ever expanding family of protein kinases whose substrates have not yet been identified. This family includes the TOR/FRAP proteins that are the cellular targets of the FK506-binding protein-rapamycin complex and are involved in cellular signaling and cell cycle control (23Brown E.J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although yeast TOR2 and mammalian FRAP/RAFT1 have associated PtdIns 4-kinase activities, these activities are probably not endogenous to the protein kinase catalytic site (27Zheng X.F.

Other members of this extended family include the ATM/MEC1/DNA-PK proteins that are involved in both cell cycle progression and checkpoint control and chromosomal maintenance and repair (28Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 29Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P.

Fornace A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). All these proteins share a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain found in both lipid and protein kinases.Within this conserved domain are specific amino acid stretches that distinguish the subfamily of PtdIns 4-kinases from PtdIns 3-kinases and the other family members. We have taken advantage of this subfamily specificity to design degenerate PCR primers for the use in cloning novel PtdIns 4-kinases. We have identified and cloned one such gene and analyzed the biochemical properties of the encoded protein, which we call PI4Kβ. Interestingly, PI4Kβ is wortmannin-sensitive and shows great similarity to a recently described wortmannin-inhibitable PtdIns 4-kinase that was partially purified from bovine adrenal cortex (1Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Nakanishi et al. (1Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) demonstrate that this enzyme is responsible for regulating the hormone-sensitive pools of inositol phospholipids. Recent studies in which the effects of 100 nM to 1 μM wortmannin have been used to implicate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and signal transduction must be reconsidered in view of the nearly ubiquitous expression of wortmannin-sensitive PI4Kβ.DISCUSSIONWe have identified and characterized PI4Kβ, a novel PtdIns 4-kinase that is widely expressed in a variety of tissues. The cDNA encodes an 801-aa protein that exhibits lipid kinase activity when expressed in E. coli Both the bacterially expressed and the endogenous proteins exhibit properties consistent with the characterization of PI4Kβ as a type III enzyme. Antibodies raised against PI4Kβ detect a ∼110-kDa protein in a number of cell types across several species. Interestingly, PI4Kβ is the first cloned PtdIns 4-kinase that is inhibitable by wortmannin, potentially implicating PI4Kβ in a variety of wortmannin-sensitive cellular pathways.Sequence analysis of PI4Kβ places it within the PtdIns 4-kinase family and more generally places it in the larger family of lipid/protein kinases. It contains a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to protein kinases as well as strong homology to the dual specificity kinases such as PtdIns 3-kinase. Within this conserved domain is lysine 549 which, based on homology to PtdIns 3-kinase, is the likely site of wortmannin reactivity (45Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesbroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). All members of this lipid/protein kinase family contain this conserved lysine, yet many, including PIK1 and PI4Kα, are not inhibited by micromolar concentrations of the drug, suggesting that additional residues within the active site confer wortmannin sensitivity.Members of this extended family have diverse cellular functions. For example, the yeast protein MEC1 and its Drosophila homologue MEI41 are checkpoint control genes which appear to monitor the state of the genome at the G1/S and G2/M transitions (28Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 46Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H.

Cell. 1995; 82: 815-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Another family member, DNA-PK, was originally identified as a DNA-dependent protein kinase (48Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar) but was subsequently shown to function in immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and DNA repair (29Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar).PI4Kβ has properties similar to the wortmannin-sensitive PtdIns 4-kinase described by Nakanishi et al. (1Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The partially purified enzyme was inhibited by wortmannin with an IC50 of ∼50 nM, not dissimilar to the 120-140 nM IC50 observed for PI4Kβ. The wortmannin-sensitive enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa, as judged by gel filtration, in agreement with the 110-kDa molecular mass observed for PI4Kβ. The reported enzymatic properties of this protein are also very similar to those of PI4Kβ. It is likely that we have cloned the PtdIns 4-kinase that regulates the formation of agonist-sensitive inositol phospholipids that are required for intracellular signaling in some cells.It should be noted that a PtdIns 4-kinase from the particulate fraction of Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been observed to be sensitive to the wortmannin analogue demethoxyviridin (49Woscholski R. Kodaki T. McKinnon M. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Curiously, this enzyme was not inhibited by wortmannin. Additionally, attempts to isolate a drug-sensitive PtdIns 4-kinase from rat brain particulate fractions were unsuccessful (49Woscholski R. Kodaki T. McKinnon M. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although we have detected PI4Kβ in rat brain, both our experiments and those of Nakanishi et al. (1Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) suggest that it is only loosely associated with the membrane. Furthermore, PI4Kβ is not the major PtdIns 4-kinase present in membrane fractions, and therefore lipid kinase assays on these crude fractions would not be expected to show wortmannin sensitivity.Taken together, these data suggest that we need to reevaluate the interpretation of experiments employing wortmannin as an inhibitor in biological assays. For example, recent experiments have demonstrated that wortmannin inhibits the proper targeting of the lysosomal enzyme procathepsin D in a variety of cell types (50Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 51Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The concentration of wortmannin used was as high as 1 μM with an estimated IC50 of ∼100 nM. Clearly, these elevated levels of wortmannin could be inhibiting PI4Kβ thereby implicating it in protein trafficking. Furthermore, both wortmannin and demethoxyviridin have been reported to inhibit phospholipase D, PtdIns-phospholipase C, and phospholipase A2 in vivo (41Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 52Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It is likely that this inhibition is a downstream effect of the inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase and possibly PI4Kβ in these cells, as little direct inhibition of these enzymes was observed in vitro at μM concentrations of wortmannin. The assumption that PtdIns 3-kinase is a critical mediator of all the myriad pathways inhibited by wortmannin is likely to be an oversimplification. INTRODUCTIONThe metabolism of phosphoinositides has long been acknowledged to play a central role in the transduction of signals triggered by a variety of growth factors and hormones. Both the enzymes and their product phosphoinositides are present in virtually all eukaryotic organisms and tissues that have been studied. Over the past several years the complexity of phosphoinositide metabolism has become better appreciated. In the classically defined phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are:PtdInsphosphatidylinositolPI4KβPtdIns 4-kinase βkbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographybpbase pair(s)aaamino acid(s). turnover pathway, sequential phosphorylation of the 4 and 5 positions yields PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2, the latter of which acts as a substrate for phospholipase C producing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a stimulator of intracellular Ca2+ release (2Berridge M. Heslop J. Irvine R.F. Brown K.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and diacylglycerol, a stimulator of certain protein kinase C isoforms (3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar). More recently PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 have been shown to regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement through the association with a variety of actin binding proteins (4Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 5Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). PtdIns-4,5-P2 has also been shown to stimulate both phospholipase D (6Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pertile P. Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5130-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and β-adrenergic receptor kinase (8Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Finally, all of these lipids are substrates of PtdIns 3-kinase, yielding an array of 3-phosphorylated products (9Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now clear that the synthesis of a variety of polyphosphoinositides from the starting substrate PtdIns is catalyzed by at least three types of PtdIns kinases (10Whitman M. Kaplan D. Roberts T. Cantley L. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).PtdIns 3-kinase (a type I enzyme) catalyzes the phosphorylation of PtdIns at the D3 position of the inositol ring. This enzyme was initially identified through its association with viral oncoproteins and a number of growth factor receptors (12Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). More recently several additional classes of PtdIns 3-kinases have been identified including a G protein-activated enzyme (13Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and VPS 34p, a protein involved in protein trafficking in yeast (14Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).PtdIns 4-kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of PtdIns at the D4 position of the inositol ring and have been divided into two types (II and III) based on their size and sensitivity to various compounds (11Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The type II enzymes were initially characterized as membrane-associated 55-kDa proteins whose lipid kinase activity is highly stimulated by detergent and inhibited by both adenosine and the monoclonal antibody 4C5G (11Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Endemann G.C. Graziani A. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The type III enzymes are membrane-associated proteins predicted to be >200 kDa in size that are less stimulated by detergent and are not inhibited by adenosine or 4C5G antibodies. The PtdIns 4-kinases are highly abundant and have been identified in a large number of membrane structures (reviewed Ref. 16Pike L. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Recently several PtdIns 4-kinases have been cloned and found to be homologous to PtdIns 3-kinases. They all contain both a lipid kinase unique domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to protein kinases. In yeast, the PIK1 gene encodes a 125-kDa protein that is indispensable for cell growth and plays a role in cytokinesis (17Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. Science. 1993; 262: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It contains the lipid kinase unique domain at its far N terminus and the catalytic domain in the characteristic C-terminal position. Although it is intermediate in size, its biochemical properties suggest that it is more similar to the type III enzyme (18Flanagan C.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium discoideum, a putative PtdIns 4-kinase has recently been cloned, whose domain structure is similar to PIK1, extending the identification of these proteins across several species (19Zhou K. Takegawa K. Emr S.D. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5645-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A second yeast gene, STT4, encodes a 200-kDa protein that is dispensable for growth in the presence of osmotic stabilizers and has been implicated in the protein kinase C pathway through its isolation in a screen for mutants sensitive to the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (20Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the first PtdIns 4-kinase from higher eukaryotes, PI4Kα, was cloned and shown to encode a 100-kDa protein with significant homology to STT4 and biochemical properties of a type II enzyme (21Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein, as well as STT4, contains adjacent lipid kinase unique and catalytic domains at its C terminus. An alternative splice of the PI4Kα gene that generates a 230-kDa protein has also been recently reported (22Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).These three types of PtdIns kinases all show homology to an ever expanding family of protein kinases whose substrates have not yet been identified. This family includes the TOR/FRAP proteins that are the cellular targets of the FK506-binding protein-rapamycin complex and are involved in cellular signaling and cell cycle control (23Brown E.J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although yeast TOR2 and mammalian FRAP/RAFT1 have associated PtdIns 4-kinase activities, these activities are probably not endogenous to the protein kinase catalytic site (27Zheng X.F. Fiorentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Other members of this extended family include the ATM/MEC1/DNA-PK proteins that are involved in both cell cycle progression and checkpoint control and chromosomal maintenance and repair (28Weinert T.A.

Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein, as well as STT4, contains adjacent lipid kinase unique and catalytic domains at its C terminus. An alternative splice of the PI4Kα gene that generates a 230-kDa protein has also been recently reported (22Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These three types of PtdIns kinases all show homology to an ever expanding family of protein kinases whose substrates have not yet been identified. This family includes the TOR/FRAP proteins that are the cellular targets of the FK506-binding protein-rapamycin complex and are involved in cellular signaling and cell cycle control (23Brown E.J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although yeast TOR2 and mammalian FRAP/RAFT1 have associated PtdIns 4-kinase activities, these activities are probably not endogenous to the protein kinase catalytic site (27Zheng X.F. Fiorentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Other members of this extended family include the ATM/MEC1/DNA-PK proteins that are involved in both cell cycle progression and checkpoint control and chromosomal maintenance and repair (28Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 29Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P.

Fornace A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). All these proteins share a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain found in both lipid and protein kinases. Within this conserved domain are specific amino acid stretches that distinguish the subfamily of PtdIns 4-kinases from PtdIns 3-kinases and the other family members. We have taken advantage of this subfamily specificity to design degenerate PCR primers for the use in cloning novel PtdIns 4-kinases. We have identified and cloned one such gene and analyzed the biochemical properties of the encoded protein, which we call PI4Kβ. Interestingly, PI4Kβ is wortmannin-sensitive and shows great similarity to a recently described wortmannin-inhibitable PtdIns 4-kinase that was partially purified from bovine adrenal cortex (1Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Nakanishi et al. (1Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) demonstrate that this enzyme is responsible for regulating the hormone-sensitive pools of inositol phospholipids. Recent studies in which the effects of 100 nM to 1 μM wortmannin have been used to implicate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and signal transduction must be reconsidered in view of the nearly ubiquitous expression of wortmannin-sensitive PI4Kβ. DISCUSSIONWe have identified and characterized PI4Kβ, a novel PtdIns 4-kinase that is widely expressed in a variety of tissues. The cDNA encodes an 801-aa protein that exhibits lipid kinase activity when expressed in E. coli Both the bacterially expressed and the endogenous proteins exhibit properties consistent with the characterization of PI4Kβ as a type III enzyme. Antibodies raised against PI4Kβ detect a ∼110-kDa protein in a number of cell types across several species. Interestingly, PI4Kβ is the first cloned PtdIns 4-kinase that is inhibitable by wortmannin, potentially implicating PI4Kβ in a variety of wortmannin-sensitive cellular pathways.Sequence analysis of PI4Kβ places it within the PtdIns 4-kinase family and more generally places it in the larger family of lipid/protein kinases. It contains a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to protein kinases as well as strong homology to the dual specificity kinases such as PtdIns 3-kinase. Within this conserved domain is lysine 549 which, based on homology to PtdIns 3-kinase, is the likely site of wortmannin reactivity (45Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesbroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). All members of this lipid/protein kinase family contain this conserved lysine, yet many, including PIK1 and PI4Kα, are not inhibited by micromolar concentrations of the drug, suggesting that additional residues within the active site confer wortmannin sensitivity.Members of this extended family have diverse cellular functions. For example, the yeast protein MEC1 and its Drosophila homologue MEI41 are checkpoint control genes which appear to monitor the state of the genome at the G1/S and G2/M transitions (28Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 46Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H.

Cell. 1995; 82: 815-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Another family member, DNA-PK, was originally identified as a DNA-dependent protein kinase (48Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar) but was subsequently shown to function in immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and DNA repair (29Hartley K.O.

Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar).PI4Kβ has properties similar to the wortmannin-sensitive PtdIns 4-kinase described by Nakanishi et al. (1Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The partially purified enzyme was inhibited by wortmannin with an IC50 of ∼50 nM, not dissimilar to the 120-140 nM IC50 observed for PI4Kβ. The wortmannin-sensitive enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa, as judged by gel filtration, in agreement with the 110-kDa molecular mass observed for PI4Kβ. The reported enzymatic properties of this protein are also very similar to those of PI4Kβ. It is likely that we have cloned the PtdIns 4-kinase that regulates the formation of agonist-sensitive inositol phospholipids that are required for intracellular signaling in some cells.It should be noted that a PtdIns 4-kinase from the particulate fraction of Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been observed to be sensitive to the wortmannin analogue demethoxyviridin (49Woscholski R. Kodaki T. McKinnon M. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Curiously, this enzyme was not inhibited by wortmannin. Additionally, attempts to isolate a drug-sensitive PtdIns 4-kinase from rat brain particulate fractions were unsuccessful (49Woscholski R. Kodaki T. McKinnon M. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although we have detected PI4Kβ in rat brain, both our experiments and those of Nakanishi et al. (1Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) suggest that it is only loosely associated with the membrane. Furthermore, PI4Kβ is not the major PtdIns 4-kinase present in membrane fractions, and therefore lipid kinase assays on these crude fractions would not be expected to show wortmannin sensitivity.Taken together, these data suggest that we need to reevaluate the interpretation of experiments employing wortmannin as an inhibitor in biological assays. For example, recent experiments have demonstrated that wortmannin inhibits the proper targeting of the lysosomal enzyme procathepsin D in a variety of cell types (50Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 51Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The concentration of wortmannin used was as high as 1 μM with an estimated IC50 of ∼100 nM. Clearly, these elevated levels of wortmannin could be inhibiting PI4Kβ thereby implicating it in protein trafficking. Furthermore, both wortmannin and demethoxyviridin have been reported to inhibit phospholipase D, PtdIns-phospholipase C, and phospholipase A2 in vivo (41Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 52Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It is likely that this inhibition is a downstream effect of the inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase and possibly PI4Kβ in these cells, as little direct inhibition of these enzymes was observed in vitro at μM concentrations of wortmannin. The assumption that PtdIns 3-kinase is a critical mediator of all the myriad pathways inhibited by wortmannin is likely to be an oversimplification.

https://openalex.org/W2093159000,"The process of nuclear protein transport requires the interaction of several different proteins, either directly or indirectly with nuclear localization or targeting sequences (NLS). Recently, a number of karyopherins alpha, or NLS-binding proteins, have been identified. We have found that the karyopherins hSRP1 and hSRP1alpha are differentially expressed in various leukocyte cell lines and could be induced in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. We show that the two karyopherins bind with varied specificities in a sequence specific manner to different NLSs and that the sequence specificity is modulated by other cytosolic proteins. There was a correlation between binding of karyopherins alpha to different NLSs and their ability to be imported into the nucleus. Taken together, these data provide evidence for multiple levels of control of the nuclear import process."
https://openalex.org/W2138568868,"Caveolin is a principal structural component of caveolae membranes in vivo Recently, a family of caveolin-related proteins has been identified; caveolin has been retermed caveolin-1. Caveolin family members share three characteristic properties: (i) detergent insolubility at low temperatures; (ii) self-oligomerization; and (iii) incorporation into low density Triton-insoluble fractions enriched in caveolae membranes. Here, we have used a deletion mutagenesis approach as a first step toward understanding which regions of caveolin-1 contribute to its unusual properties. Two caveolin-1 deletion mutants were created that lack either the C-terminal domain (Cav-1ΔC) or the N-terminal domain (Cav-1ΔN); these mutants were compared with the behavior of full-length caveolin-1 (Cav-1FL) expressed in parallel. Our results show that the N-terminal domain and membrane spanning segment are sufficient to form high molecular mass oligomers of caveolin-1. However, a complete caveolin-1 molecule is required for conveying detergent insolubility and incorporation into low density Triton-insoluble complexes. These data indicate that homo-oligomerization and an intact transmembrane are not sufficient to confer detergent insolubility, suggesting an unknown role for the C-terminal domain in this process. To better understand the role of the C-terminal domain, this region of caveolin-1 (residues 135-178) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli Purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase-C-Cav-1 was found to stably interact with full-length caveolin-1 but not with the two caveolin-1 deletion mutants. These results suggest that the C-terminal domain interacts with both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of an adjacent caveolin-1 homo-oligomer. This appears to be a specific homo-typic interaction, because the C-terminal domain of caveolin-1 failed to interact with full-length forms of caveolin-2 and caveolin-3. Homo-typic interaction of the C-terminal domain with an adjacent homo-oligomer could provide a mechanism for clustering caveolin-1 homo-oligomers while excluding other caveolin family members. This type of lateral segregation event could promote caveolae membrane formation and contribute to the detergent insolubility of caveolins-1, −2, and −3.

INTRODUCTIONCaveolae are vesicular organelles located near or attached to the plasma membrane (1Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem.

Caveolae are most abundant in endothelial cells, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts, although they are thought to exist in most cell types (reviewed in Refs. 3Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.

These results provide direct evidence that caveolin family members participate in caveolae formation.However, it remains unknown how caveolin-1 expression induces caveolae formation. This may be related to the self-assembly properties of caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 undergoes two stages of oligomerization. First, in the endoplasmic reticulum, caveolin-1 monomers assemble into discrete multivalent homo-oligomers, containing ∼14-16 monomers per oligomer (13Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E.

Subsequently, these individual caveolin-1 homo-oligomers (4-6 nm spherical particles) can interact with each other to form clusters of particles that are ∼25-50 nm in diameter (13Sargiacomo M.

INTRODUCTIONCaveolae are vesicular organelles located near or attached to the plasma membrane (1Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem.

Caveolae are most abundant in endothelial cells, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts, although they are thought to exist in most cell types (reviewed in Refs. 3Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.

https://openalex.org/W2162297869,"Given the central position of the focal adhesion complex, both physically in coupling integrins to the interstitium and biochemically in providing an upstream site for anabolic signal generation, we asked whether the recruitment of non-receptor tyrosine kinases to the cytoskeleton might be a mechanism whereby cellular loading could activate growth regulatory signals responsible for cardiac hypertrophy. Analysis revealed cytoskeletal association of c-Src, FAK, and β3-integrin, but no Fyn, in the pressure-overloaded right ventricle. This association was seen as early as 4 h after right ventricular pressure overloading, increased through 48 h, and reverted to normal in 1 week. Cytoskeletal binding of non-receptor tyrosine kinases was synchronous with tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal proteins, including c-Src. Examination of cytoskeleton-bound c-Src revealed that a significant portion of the tyrosine phosphorylation was not at the Tyr-527 site and therefore presumably was at the Tyr-416 site. Thus, these studies strongly suggest that non-receptor tyrosine kinases, in particular c-Src, may play a critical role in hypertrophic growth regulation by their association with cytoskeletal structures, possibly via load activation of integrin-mediated signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1487366060,"Cadherins are transmembrane receptors with an extracellular domain that participates in homophilic cell to cell adhesion and a cytoplasmic domain that associates with proteins called catenins. Cadherin-mediated adhesion as well as adhesion-independent functions for catenins play important roles in differentiation, development, and malignant transformation. Mechanisms that regulate steady-state catenin levels and cadherin-catenin complex stability are poorly understood, but activities of both the Wnt-1 proto-oncogene and tyrosine kinases are implicated. Here I define, at the biochemical level, distinct mechanisms that modulate steady-state catenin levels. Increased cadherin expression, providing more catenin binding sites, leads to selective stabilization of the cadherin-associated population of α- and β-catenin, but not p120cas. In contrast, expression of Wnt-1 leads primarily to increased stability of the uncomplexed pool of β-catenin without effect on p120cas. Significantly, the Wnt-1-induced stabilization of uncomplexed β-catenin is independent of cadherin expression. Transformation by v-Src does not disrupt the catenin-cadherin complex despite the phosphorylation of E-cadherin and β-catenin on tyrosine. In contrast to the effects of Wnt-1, v-Src does not modulate the uncomplexed population of β-catenin. p120cas is phosphorylated on tyrosine by v-Src, and this is accompanied by a significant decrease in the level of uncomplexed p120cas as well as a change in behavior of p120cas upon biochemical fractionation. Taken together these data suggest that p120cas and β-catenin are regulated independently."

We have isolated and characterized human genomic clones of the ADAR gene and cDNA clones encoding splice site variants of the ADAR protein. Southern blot and sequence analyses revealed that the gene spans about 30 kilobase pairs and consists of 15 exons. The codon phasing of the splice site junctions of exons 3, 5, and 7 that encode the three copies of the highly conserved RNA-binding R-motif (RI, RII, and RIII) was exactly conserved and identical to those R-motif exons of the interferon-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase. Alternative splice site variants of the 1226-amino acid ADAR-a protein, designated b and c, were identified that differed in exons 6 and 7.

https://openalex.org/W1967182443,"While previous studies revealed that matrix vesicles (MV) contain a nucleational core (NC) that converts to apatite when incubated with synthetic cartilage lymph, the initial mineral phase present in MV is not well characterized. This study explored the physicochemical nature of this Ca2+ and Pi-rich NC. MV, isolated from growth plate cartilage, were analyzed directly by solid-state 31P NMR, or incubated with hydrazine or NaOCl to remove organic constituents. Other samples of MV were subjected to sequential treatments with enzymes, salt solutions, and detergents to expose the NC. We examined the NC using transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive analysis with x-rays, and electron and x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, high performance thin-layer chromatographic analysis, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We found that most of the MV proteins and lipids could be removed without destroying the NC; however, NaOCl treatment annihilated its activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that annexin V, a phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent Ca2+-binding protein, was the major protein in the NC; high performance thin-layer chromatographic analysis revealed that the detergents removed the majority of the polar lipids, but left significant free cholesterol and fatty acids, and small but critical amounts of PS. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the NC was composed of clusters of ∼1.0 nm subunits, which energy-dispersive analysis with x-rays revealed contained Ca and Pi with a Ca/P ratio of 1.06 ± 0.01.

In previous work, we showed that it was possible to strip away nonessential components from the MV using various chemical and detergent extractions leaving a residual core that retained the ability to induce mineral formation (15Wu L.N.Y.

The activity of this detergent-stable nucleational core (NC) was inhibited by Zn2+ and was destroyed by treatment with pH 6 citrate buffer. This acid lability is similar to that of synthetic amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) (15Wu L.N.Y. Yoshimori T. Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Kirsch T. Ishikawa Y. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol.

Further, in our assay system, the calcification of both MV and ACP share the same pH-dependent kinetic profile when incubated in synthetic cartilage lymph (SCL) (17Valhmu W.B. Wu L.N.Y. Wuthier R.E. Bone Miner. 1990; 8: 195-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the NC of MV appears to contain ACP-like mineral; however, both FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopy failed to detect classical ACP in native MV (13Sauer G.R. Wuthier R.E. J.

Several other forms of calcium phosphate, i.e. dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (brushite) and octacalcium phosphate (OCP), have also been postulated to be precursors to hydroxyapatite (HAP) in vivo (18Eanes E.D. Butler W.T. The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues. Ebsco Media, Birmingham, AL1985: 213-220Google Scholar). By FT-IR and FT-Raman analyses (13Sauer G.R. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol.

Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the first crystalline mineral phase formed by MV incubated in metastable SCL was OCP-like in character. After 24 h it appears to be poorly crystalline HAP, similar to that present in bone (19Rey C. Shimizu M. Collins B. Glimcher M.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1990; 46: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20LeGeros R.Z. Prog. Cryst. Growth Charact. 1981; 4: 1-45Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lipids are present in the extracellular matrix at sites of calcification (21Irving J.T. Nature. 1958; 181: 704-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and some are associated with the mineral phase (22Wuthier R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 68-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Varying proportions of the predominant lipid associated with the mineral, PS, are complexed with Ca2+ and Pi (22Wuthier R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 68-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wuthier R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 409: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Boskey A.L. Posner A.S. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1976; 19: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These Ca2+-PS-Pi complexes (CPLX) are present in bone, cartilage, and other mineralized tissues (25Boskey A.L. Posner A.S. Lane J.M. Goldberg M.R. Cordella D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 199: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and are especially enriched in MV (26Wuthier R.E. Gore S.T. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1977; 24: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have shown that both CPLX and ACP, when incubated in synthetic lymphs, can lead to formation of HAP (18Eanes E.D. Butler W.T. The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues. Ebsco Media, Birmingham, AL1985: 213-220Google Scholar, 27Wuthier R.E. Anghileri L.J. Tuffet-Anghileri A.M. Calcium in Normal and Pathological Systems.

In these studies we sought to determine unequivocally whether CPLX and ACP are present in the NC of MV. Establishment of the physicochemical properties of the nucleational core (the first mineral phase) would provide an important clue to how MVs are formed and how they function as the primary nucleator in growth plate cartilage calcification. In this investigation we examined the physicochemical properties of the residual core material in MV remaining after sequential treatments with enzyme, buffered salt, and detergent solutions. We also used treatment with hydrazine or hypochlorite to remove organic matter. We assayed the kinetics of mineral phase formation after each treatment procedure to establish that nucleational activity had been retained. Focus was then placed on structural characterization of the residue (i.e. nucleational core, NC) using the following physicochemical methods: transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for structure, energy-dispersive analysis with x-rays (EDAX) and chemical analyses for elemental composition, electron and x-ray diffraction for crystallinity, and FT-IR and solid-state 31P NMR spectroscopy for chemical structure. High performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) was used to analyze lipids; SDS-PAGE was used to analyze proteins. Collagenase-released matrix vesicles (CRMV) were isolated from growth plate cartilage of 6-8-week-old broiler strain chickens as described previously (15Wu L.N.Y. Yoshimori T. Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Kirsch T. Ishikawa Y. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25084-25094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were digested with 0.1% trypsin (type III, Sigma) at 37°C for 20 min in synthetic cartilage lymph (SCL). SCL contained 2 mM Ca2+ and 1.42 mM Pi, in addition to 104.5 mM Na+, 133.5 mM Cl−, 63.5 mM sucrose, 16.5 mM TES, 12.70 mM K+, 5.55 mMD-glucose, 1.83 mM HCO3−, 0.57 mM Mg2+, and 0.57 mM SO42−. The trypsin solution was removed; tissue slices were rinsed twice with SCL, and then digested with collagenase (200 units/g of tissue, type IA, Sigma) at 37°C for 3-3.5 h. The partially digested tissue was vortexed, and the suspension was differentially centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min and at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The MV pellet was resuspended as a stock suspension of 5.0 mg of vesicle protein/ml of SCL containing 1.0 mM Ca2+ (one-half the normal level of Ca2+ in SCL) to prevent dissolution of labile Ca2+ and Pi present (9McLean F.M. Keller P.J. Genge B.R. Walters S.A. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10481-10488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also to minimize Ca2+ uptake by the vesicles during storage. Protein levels in the vesicles were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hyaluronidase-released matrix vesicles were isolated from the same tissues by incubating in SCL containing 0.25% hyaluronidase (Type IS, Sigma) at 37°C for 90 min, followed by incubation in SCL containing collagenase (500 units/g of tissue) at 37°C for 3 h (30Kirsch T. Ishikawa Y. Mwale F. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20103-20109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After vortexing, hyaluronidase-released matrix vesicles were isolated by differential centrifugation as before. The MV pellets were resuspended in SCL containing 1 mM Ca2+. CRMV were extracted sequentially with hyaluronidase, water, pure collagenase, high salt, and then with detergent, to expose the acid-labile NC (Fig. 1). While some of these procedures had been explored individually before to determine their effects on MV mineralization (15Wu L.N.Y. Yoshimori T. Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Kirsch T. Ishikawa Y. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25084-25094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in this study these procedures were used sequentially to fully strip away the non-essential components. The final pellet was resuspended in SCL containing 1.0 mM Ca2+. CRMV (1.0 mg of Lowry protein), and the sequentially treated residual cores, were decalcified with 1 M EDTA, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 25°C, dialyzed against deionized water overnight at 4°C with constant stirring, and then lyophilized. The demineralized residue was extracted sequentially with chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) (Extract 1) and chloroform-methanol-concentrated HCl (200:100:1, v/v/v) (Extract 2) as described previously (22Wuthier R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 68-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dried crude lipids from Extracts 1 and 2 were partitioned through a micro-Sephadex G-25 column to remove nonlipid contaminants (31Wuthier R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 558-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pure lipids were then analyzed by HPTLC on Whatman LHP-K silica gel plates as described previously (15Wu L.N.Y. Yoshimori T. Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Kirsch T. Ishikawa Y. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25084-25094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Banerjee P. Buse J.T. Dawson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mixtures containing 10 μg each of the various standard lipids were applied to separate lanes on the same plate as the lipid samples. A multiwell microplate mineralization assay based on light scattering (33Brecevic L. Furedi-Milhofer H. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1972; 10: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used for real-time measurement of mineral formation by MV, and their subfractions. Samples were prepared for mineralization assays as follows. Aliquots of the MV stock solution were diluted 100-fold to a final concentration of 50 μg of protein/ml of SCL containing 2.0 mM Ca2+; nucleational core pellets (Fig. 1, Pellet F) were resuspended SCL to a final concentration of 50 μg of protein/ml, based on the initial protein concentration (Fig. 1, Pellet A). For kinetic assays of mineral formation, 160-μl aliquots of the diluted vesicle or nucleational core suspensions were placed into 96-well half-area tissue culture clusters (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated at 37°C. An IEMS Reader MF instrument (Labsystems, Needham Heights, MA) was used to take absorbency readings at 340 nm at 15-min intervals. MV and their subfractions were digested in 0.1 N HCl at 25°C overnight. The digests were clarified by centrifugation using a Beckman Airfuge (22 p.s.i., 8 min) and then samples were removed for mineral ion analysis. Ca2+ was analyzed by the method of Baginsky et al. (34Baginsky E.S. Marie S.S. Clark W.L. Zak B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1973; 46: 46-54Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar); Pi was determined by the method of Ames (35Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). For total P analysis, a small volume of 70% HClO4 containing 0.01% ammonium molybdate (36Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) was added to the dry samples, which were digested at 140°C for 15 min or longer until the samples were completely clear. Then aliquots of the digestate were taken for Pi analysis as above. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze the protein composition of the various MV fractions. A 3.0% stacking gel and a 7.5-15% gradient resolving gel were used, following the method of Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For FT-IR analyses, lyophilized samples of the NC (∼1 mg) were incorporated into KBr (∼300 mg) and pressed into a pellet under vacuum at 12,000 psi pressure, and then examined over a range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 using a Perkin Elmer model 1600 series spectrometer (13Sauer G.R. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13718-13724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (Some samples were rapidly frozen in liquid N2 and not dried; they were examined at −196°C by solid-state NMR.) Solid-state 31P NMR spectra of the CRMV and the synthetic PS-Ca2+-Pi complex (33Brecevic L. Furedi-Milhofer H. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1972; 10: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were obtained using a Varian Unity+ spectrometer operating at 121.42 mHz for 31P. Pulse widths were 4.4 μs, and a contact time of 2.5 ms was used. Samples (10-20 mg) were packed into 7-mm Doty Scientific SiN3 rotors and spun at 2 kHz, stabilized to a precision of ±1 Hz. Chemical shifts were referenced to external H3PO4 at 0 ppm (38Concannon B. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Investigations of 1. Early Stages of Biomineralization, and 2. Rat Mammary Healthy and Tumorous Cells and Tissues. 1996; : 1-79Google Scholar). MV subfractions were lyophilized and samples (<1 mg) dispersed in 100% ethanol by sonication. One drop of the suspension was added to one drop of deionized H2O, and transferred to carbon-coated grids, blotted, and dried. The grids were viewed using an Hitachi H-8000 TEM at 200 keV accelerating voltage. Grids were not stained to increase contrast. For EDAX analyses the following parameters were used: accelerating voltage, 25 keV; angle of incidence beam, 90°; x-ray emergence angle, 41.8°; x-ray window incidence angle, 6.8°; counting time, 200 s. At least five representative areas were analyzed for elemental composition. Values were calculated in atomic percent normalized to 100 after eight iterations. Areas shown to be rich in Ca and P by EDAX analysis were analyzed by electron diffraction for the presence of crystalline mineral. Each MV subfraction was analyzed by x-ray diffraction for the presence of crystalline solids before and after incubation in SCL using a Phillips Norelco x-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation, a nickel filter, 40 kV and 20 mA, 1° receiving slit, and a scanning speed of 1/8° 2θ/min (39LeGeros R.Z. Lee D. Quirolgico G. Shirra W.P. Reich L. Scanning Electron Microsc. 1983; 114: 407-418Google Scholar). Lyophilized CRMV were treated with hydrazine monohydrate (Aldrich, 98%, 166 μl/mg of protein) at 60°C for 24 h (40Termine J.D. Eanes E.D. Greenfield D.J. Nylen M.U. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1973; 12: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The mixture was centrifuged using a Beckman Airfuge at 22 p.s.i. for 8 min and the insoluble residue washed twice with 100% ethanol. The residue was 1) dried under vacuum before FT-IR analysis, 2) dispersed in 100% ethanol for TEM analysis, or 3) dispersed in SCL containing 1 mM Ca2+ before measuring Ca2+ uptake. Vesicle samples containing 50 μg of protein were treated with a solution of either NaOCl, pH 12 (50 or 100 mM final concentration), or NaOH, pH 12 and 13 (10 or 100 mM final concentration) in a total volume of 20 μl of SCL at 23°C for 15 min. NaOCl treatment has been shown to remove organic matter (41Boyde A. Sela J. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1978; 26: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After treatments, the reaction mixtures were diluted to 1.0 ml with SCL and 160-μl aliquots were removed and used for mineral formation assays. The fractionation scheme for the sequential treatment of the CRMV to remove nonessential materials and reveal the functionally active NC is outlined in Fig. 1. Hyaluronidase and water treatments were used to remove proteoglycan-related link protein and hyaluronic acid-binding protein. Highly purified collagenase and 1 M NaCl in SCL were then used to remove residual collagen and its fragments. To remove further nonessential components, the vesicle remnants from the preceding steps were then incubated with detergent, either CHAPS or Triton X-100, to yield the NC. Fig. 2 shows the time course of mineral formation by the NC after CHAPS treatment. It is evident that mineralization of the NC was actually increased compared to the untreated CRMV. Lowry analysis indicated that only about one-third of the original protein remained in the NC after the CHAPS treatment. However, chemical analyses revealed that the Ca and Pi content of the MV was relatively unchanged; ∼98% of the Ca2+ and ∼86% of the Pi were recovered in the NC. Fig. 3 shows the SDS-PAGE pattern of MV proteins in fractions from the sequential treatments ending with CHAPS detergent, as depicted in Fig. 1. The protein profile of the NC (Pellet F) was much simpler than that of the original MV. Annexin V (∼33 kDa) was most abundant, but significant amounts of unidentified high (>300 kDa), and low (∼10 kDa) molecular mass proteins, as well as several lesser bands: annexin VI (∼66 kDa), annexin II (∼36 kDa), alkaline phosphatase (∼80 kDa), and three unidentified proteins of ∼50, 45, and 38 kDa were seen. Because of their tight association with the NC, it is possible that these proteins may regulate (influence) the rate of growth, shape, and size of crystals during the nucleational process. Prior to detergent extraction (four-step extracted CRMV), the residual pellet had a lipid profile similar to that of the original CRMV when analyzed by HPTLC (Fig. 4A). A variety of phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, PS, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin, as well as significant amounts of free cholesterol, fatty acids, and triacylglycerols were present. However, upon extraction with detergent (either CHAPS or Triton X-100), a large amount of lipid was removed. The lipid profile of the NC after Triton X-100 extraction (Fig. 4B) contained significant amounts of free cholesterol and fatty acids, and an unidentified nonpolar lipid migrating near to monoacylglycerols, as well as small amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine, PS, and phosphatidylcholine. A similar lipid profile was seen in the NC after CHAPS extraction, but the amount of residual phospholipid was further reduced. To more rigorously remove organic constituents, CRMV were treated with either hydrazine monohydrate (40Termine J.D. Eanes E.D. Greenfield D.J. Nylen M.U. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1973; 12: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), or with sodium hypochlorite (41Boyde A. Sela J. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1978; 26: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); sodium hydroxide treatment was used as a non-oxidizing, highly alkaline control (Fig. 5). It is important to note here that hydrazine treatment has been shown not to damage either ACP or HAP (40Termine J.D. Eanes E.D. Greenfield D.J. Nylen M.U. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1973; 12: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); hypochlorite treatment has been shown not to damage HAP crystals (41Boyde A. Sela J. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1978; 26: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A marked reduction in Ca2+ uptake was noted after hydrazine treatment, whereas after treatment with NaOCl, nearly all Ca2+ uptake ability of the CRMV was destroyed. In contrast, NaOH treatment had no effect (10 mM) or stimulated (100 mM) mineral formation. Chemical analysis of the hydrazine-treated vesicles revealed that essentially all of the Ca2+ and Pi were retained, but about 22% of the total P was removed, presumably from loss of phospholipids and phosphoproteins. Hydrazine removed ∼95% of the proteoglycan associated with the MV and ∼85% of the Lowry protein. Elemental composition of the hydrazine core by EDAX analysis revealed Ca and P in nearly equimolar levels (see below). X-ray diffraction was used to determine the crystallinity of the NC and to follow the pattern of mineral accumulation when the NC was incubated in SCL. At 0 h, with both the Triton X-100 and the CHAPS NC, a broad, diffuse diffraction spectrum unlike that of synthetic ACP was observed; it appeared to be derived primarily from organic material present in the NC (data not shown). After incubation in SCL for 1-3 h, small diffraction bands appeared in the region of 32° and 25.8° 2θ indicative of the formation of poorly crystalline apatite. After 16 h incubation, there were increased amounts of diffractive material (Fig. 6). The mineral phase may be a poorly crystalline carbonate hydroxyapatite, similar to that seen in other biological minerals (18Eanes E.D. Butler W.T. The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues. Ebsco Media, Birmingham, AL1985: 213-220Google Scholar, 20LeGeros R.Z. Prog. Cryst. Growth Charact. 1981; 4: 1-45Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The NCs were examined by TEM to reveal their ultrastructure. At 90,000 × magnification, the CHAPS-NC appeared to be composed of clusters of particles in aggregates ranging in size from ∼10 to 110 nm in diameter (Fig. 7A). At 450,000 × magnification, these aggregates appeared to be made of branched chains of particles 6.5-7.0 nm in diameter (arrows) in arm-like extensions from the main body of the aggregate (Fig. 7B). At 900,000 × magnification, these ∼7-nm particles appeared to be composed of clusters of individual subunits ∼1.0 nm in diameter (Fig. 7C, arrows). When the Triton X-100 NC was examined at 90,000 × magnification, aggregates ranging in diameter from ∼10 to 100 nm were again seen (Fig. 7D). At 360,000 × magnification, these aggregates appeared to be composed of small hollow spheres (∼7 nm outer, ∼3 nm inner diameter, arrows) (Fig. 7E). At 600,000 × magnification, these hollow spheres appear to be composed of subunits ∼1.0 nm in diameter (Fig. 7F). Thus, although there were differences in general appearance, the basic structures of both the CHAPS and the Triton X-100 cores were similar. The ∼1.0-nm dot-like subunits appear to be the smallest functional component of nucleational core of MV. Their size, and the overall Ca2+ and Pi composition of the NC (see below), indicate that they may be clusters of Ca2+ and Pi (HPO42−) ions stabilized by lipids (detergent) and proteins. Well defined clusters of the detergent-extracted NC were also analyzed by EDAX to determine their elemental composition. For the CHAPS-treated NC, the relative abundance in atomic percent of the major elements detected was: Ca, 51.4 ± 0.1%; P, 48.6 ± 0.1% (mean ± S.E.). This gave a Ca:P ratio of 1.058 ± 0.005. For the Triton X-100-treated NC, the atomic percentages were: Ca, 51.6 ± 0.1%; P, 48.4 ± 0.1%, giving a Ca:P ratio of 1.066 ± 0.004. EDAX"

INTRODUCTIONThe integrin family of adhesion molecules are involved in transducing biochemical signals into the cell, resulting in diverse biological events. Among these signals are tyrosine phosphorylations of specific proteins such as the focal adhesion kinase p125FAK (Fak) 1The abbreviations used are: FAKp125FAKCasp130CasHEF1human enhancer of filamentation 1SHsrc homologyBCRB cell antigen receptorRAFTKrelated adhesion focal tyrosine kinaseCblp120c-CBLRAMrabbit anti-mouse IgCBcytochalasin Banti-P-tyranti-phosphotyrosineIVKin vitro kinase assayPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (1Schwartz M. Shaller M. Ginsberg M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Integrin cytoplasmic domains are associated with actin-containing cytoskeleton components, and one concept of integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylations is that oligomerization of integrins reorganizes the cytoskeleton into a framework that supports interactions between components of the intracellular signaling machinery (2Shattil S. Ginsberg M. Brugge J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis is the observation that inhibitors of cytoskeletal assembly also inhibit integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylations (3Huang M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J. Ginsberg M. Shattil S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).B lymphocytes express several different integrins that are involved in cell localization within specific microenvironments (4Freedman A.S. Munro M.J. Rice G.E. Bevilacqua M.P. Morimoto C. McIntyre B.W. Rhynhart K. Pober J.S. Nadler L.M. Science. 1990; 249: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 5Koopman G. Parmentier H.K.

Ligation of integrins on pre-B and mature B cells appears to be involved in regulating cell survival (6Ryan D.H. Nuccle B.L. Abboud C.N. Liesveld J.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 477-484PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ryan D. Nuccie B. Abboud C. Winslow J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 8Ryan D.H. Nuccie B.L.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 3760-3767PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin ligation is important to understanding how integrin-mediated signaling regulates B cell function. We have previously reported the prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 105 to 130 kDa following β1 integrin cross-linking on human B cells (10Freedman A. Rhynhart K. Nojima Y. Svahn J. Eliseo L. Benjamin C. Morimoto C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1645-1652PubMed Google Scholar, 11Manié S. Astier A. Wang D. Phifer J. Chen J. Lazarovits A. Morimoto C. Freedman A. Blood. 1996; 87: 1855-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these substrates have been identified as Fak (11Manié S. Astier A. Wang D. Phifer J. Chen J. Lazarovits A. Morimoto C. Freedman A. Blood. 1996; 87: 1855-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and p120c-CBL (Cbl) (12Manié S. Sattler M. Astier A. Phifer J.S. Canty T. Morimoto C. Druker B. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Freedman A.S. Exp. Hematol. 1996; Google Scholar), the cellular homologue of the oncogene v-CBL.Following integrin ligation in fibroblasts, another tyrosine phosphorylated protein known as p130Cas (Cas) has been identified (13Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated homotypic adhesion in a B cell line also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas (16Petruzzelli L. Takami M. Herrera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cas (rk ssociated ubstrate) was originally described as a major tyrosine phosphorylated protein in v-crk- or v-src-transformed cells (17Kanner S. Reynolds A. Wang H.-C.R. Vines R. Parsons J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yakazi Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Cas is an SH3 domain containing molecule with 15 potential Crk-SH2-binding motifs and several potential binding motifs for SH3 domains, suggesting that it may act as a “docking molecule” in intracellular signal transduction. In fact, Cas forms stable complexes with the SH2 domains of v-crk family members and v-src (16Petruzzelli L. Takami M. Herrera R. J. Biol.

Recently, a Cas-related protein known as HEF1 (human enhancer of filamentation 1) 2During the time of revision of this manuscript, Minegishi, M., Tachibana, K., Sato, T., Iwata, S., Nojima, Y., and Morimoto, C. (1996) J. Exp. Med. 184, 1365, reported the cloning of Cas-L, which is identical to HEF1, and is tyrosine phosphorylated following β1 integrin ligation in T cells. has been isolated and characterized (24Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Analogous to Cas, HEF1 contains an SH3 domain and multiple Crk-SH2 binding motifs, associates with Fak and v-abl, and localizes to focal contacts. However, in contrast to Cas, HEF1 localizes to the cell nucleus, suggesting that Cas and HEF1 may have distinct functions in cell signaling.In the present report, we show a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and HEF1 induced by β1 integrin ligation on normal or transformed human B cells, with HEF1 being the predominant substrate. Ligation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of predominantly HEF1, and similar to integrins, BCR-mediated HEF1 phosphorylation was dependent upon an intact actin network. We further showed that Cas and HEF1 complexed in vivo with the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase RAFTK, the adapter protein CrkL, and Lyn kinase, indicating that both molecules may play an important role in B cell signaling.DISCUSSIONRegulation of B cell survival within specific microenvironments involves integrin engagement (6Ryan D.H. Nuccle B.L. Abboud C.N. Liesveld J.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 477-484PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ryan D. Nuccie B. Abboud C. Winslow J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 8Ryan D.H. Nuccie B.L. Abboud C.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3759-3764PubMed Google Scholar, 9Koopman G. Keehnen R. Lindhout E. Newman W. Shimuzu Y. Van Seventer G. De Groot C. Pals S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3760-3767PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that integrin-mediated signaling pathways in B cells regulates a cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation events (10Freedman A. Rhynhart K. Nojima Y. Svahn J. Eliseo L. Benjamin C. Morimoto C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1645-1652PubMed Google Scholar, 11Manié S. Astier A. Wang D. Phifer J. Chen J. Lazarovits A. Morimoto C. Freedman A. Blood. 1996; 87: 1855-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have determined that p130Cas and the Cas-like molecule p105HEF1 are expressed in B cells and that β1 integrin ligation or BCR engagement on human B cells promoted tyrosine phosphorylation principally of HEF1. Furthermore, HEF1 and Cas phosphorylation following both stimuli appeared to be closely linked with cytoskeletal organization, and we identified several signaling molecules, including p53/56Lyn kinase, RAFTK, and CrkL, associated both with Cas and HEF1.HEF1 was cloned from a HeLa cDNA library, which when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strongly enhanced pseudohyphal growth, suggesting a role for HEF1 in regulating cell signaling and morphology (24Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although HEF1 RNA was present in all tissues examined, the highest levels were in placenta, lung, and kidney. HEF1 is 64% similar to Cas at the amino acid level. Both proteins have multiple potential SH2 binding sites and a striking similarity in the SH3 domain and the C terminus. This raises the question as to why B cells express two very similar proteins. In tonsillar B cells as well as in B cell lines, both HEF1 and Cas were present with the exception of the pre-B cell line Nalm-6, which did not express Cas. β1 integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation was mainly detected in HEF1 but not in Cas, except in the more terminally differentiated B cell line ARH-77. Generally, the p105 rather than the p120 form of HEF1 was the predominant species seen and tyrosine phosphorylated. Similarly, HEF1 rather than Cas was phosphorylated following BCR ligation in tonsillar B cells, however Cas could be phosphorylated under BCR ligation in the surface IgG positive cell lines, ARH-77 and SB. 3S. N. Manie, A. Astier, and A. S. Freedman, unpublished data. Therefore, Cas appears to be phosphorylated only in more terminally differentiated cells, which suggests that Cas and HEF1 may have distinct functions depending on the differentiated state of the cell. Cellular localization studies provide further evidence for distinct functions of HEF1 and Cas and with Cas present at focal contacts, whereas HEF1 localizes to the cell periphery and the nucleus (24Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).Similar to Cbl (12Manié S. Sattler M. Astier A. Phifer J.S. Canty T. Morimoto C. Druker B. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Freedman A.S. Exp. Hematol. 1996; Google Scholar, 26Cory G. Lovering R. Hinshelwood S. MacCarthy-Morrogh L. Levinsky R. Kinnon C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), HEF1 is a common substrate in B cells for both integrin and antigen receptors. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1 and Cbl in fact differ in BCR-mediated signaling pathways. The kinetics of HEF1 phosphorylation was slower than that of Cbl. HEF1 phosphorylation was reduced by prior treatment of cells with cytochalasin B, whereas Cbl phosphorylation was not affected. These findings also suggest that BCR-mediated HEF1 phosphorylation correlated with actin filament reorganization. Interestingly, BCR ligation initiates microfilament assembly (31Melamed I. Downey G. Aktories K. Roifman C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1139-1146PubMed Google Scholar) and induces a redistribution of signaling molecules such as ras (32Graziadei L. Riabowol K. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1990; 347: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and neurofibromin (33Boyer M. Gutmann D. Collins F. Bar-Sagi D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 349-357PubMed Google Scholar), which is inhibited by cytochalasin. Hence, analogous to integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (2Shattil S. Ginsberg M. Brugge J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), some aspects of BCR-mediated signal transduction may require that a functional cytoskeleton serve as a framework that regulates the efficiency of interactions between signaling molecules and allows tyrosine phosphorylation of compartmentalized cellular proteins.The structure of Cas and HEF1 includes several SH2-binding motifs that are similar to the consensus binding motif for the Crk SH2 domain (34Songyang Z. Shoelson S. Chudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W. King F. Roberts T. Neel B. Birge R. Fajardo J. Chou M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). We showed here that both Cas and HEF1 bind to CrkL. Furthermore, all tyrosine phosphorylated Cas and HEF1 associate with CrkL, and this interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of CrkL. 4A. Astier, S. N. Manie, S. F. Law, T. Canty, N. Haghayeghi, B. J. Druker, R. Salgia, E. A. Golemis, and A. S. Freedman, submitted for publication. Since the CrkL SH3 domain has been reported to bind to two guanine nucleotide exchange factors, C3G and mSOS, Cas and HEF1 might provide potential important links of β1 integrin and BCR signaling to the ras and or Rap1 pathways (35Matsuda M. Hashimoto K. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 36ten Hoeve J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, by participating in a multimolecular complex formation, Cas and HEF1 may propagate downstream signals.The focal adhesion kinase Fak can associate with both Cas and HEF1 (22Polte T. Hanks S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 24Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These interactions are mediated by the highly homologous SH3 domains of Cas and HEF1, associating with the polyproline SH3 binding motif in Fak. We observed an in vivo association between the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase RAFTK with Cas and HEF1. The interaction of Cas and HEF1 with RAFTK is also likely to be mediated through the SH3 domains of Cas and HEF1, binding to the C-terminal polyproline motif of RAFTK that is identical to that present in Fak. Since RAFTK is expressed in certain B cell lines independently of Fak and is phosphorylated under integrin and BCR stimulation (29Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S. Groopman J. Druker B. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the associations of Cas and HEF1 with RAFTK may be important in these signaling pathways.In contrast to HEF1, Cas contains a C-terminal proline-rich region that is an Src-SH3 binding motif (25Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We have shown in an in vitro binding assay using a GST-fusion protein containing the C-terminal proline-rich region of Cas that p53/56Lyn, p59Fyn, and p59/62Hck, but not p55Blk or p56Lck, could bind to this motif. In addition, we demonstrated the presence of Cas in Lyn immunoprecipitates, whereas Cas was only weakly detected in Fyn immunoprecipitates and not in Hck immunoprecipitates. The anti-Fyn and anti-Lyn antibodies were raised against similar regions of the two molecules, allowing the comparison between them. The anti-Hck antibody was raised against a different region of the kinase, and we can not exclude the possibility that this antibody may have interfered with Cas binding. The interaction of Cas with Lyn in vivo likely occurred through the SH3 domain of Lyn because (i) a GST-fusion protein mutated in the C-terminal proline-rich region of Cas was unable to precipitate Lyn, and (ii) Cas phosphorylation following integrin or BCR ligation only minimally increased the presence of Cas in Lyn immunoprecipitates (not shown). HEF1 was also present in Lyn immunoprecipitates. However, HEF1 does not possess the src-SH3 binding motif that is present in Cas. Similar to Cas, HEF1 phosphorylation did not significantly increase its association with Lyn (not shown). Whether HEF1 can associate with Lyn through a non-canonical SH3 binding motif is under investigation. Alternatively, the C-terminal region of Cas may be capable of mediating heterodimerization with HEF1 (24Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and therefore, the Lyn immunoprecipitation may involve a ternary Lyn·Cas·HEF1 complex. Lyn kinase activity is stimulated following both BCR ligation (30Yamanashi Y. Kakiuchi T. Mizuguchi J. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Science. 1991; 251: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and as shown here following β1 integrin ligation, suggesting that Lyn may be a kinase for Cas/HEF1. In support of this is that Lyn kinase could phosphorylate Cas/HEF1 in vitro when mixed prior to the kinase assay. Whether Cas/HEF1-associated Lyn is activated and responsible for Cas/HEF1 phosphorylation during the process of integrin or BCR ligation remains to be determined. Cas/HEF1-associated Lyn may also be involved in the phosphorylation of other molecules recruited by Cas/HEF1.The cytoskeletal dependence for HEF1 phosphorylation following integrin or BCR engagement on normal tonsillar B cells raises the possibility that HEF1 could integrate signals from both receptors. In T cells, signals from integrin and T cell antigen receptor have synergistic effects on proliferation (37Schimizu Y. Seventer G. Horgan K. Shaw S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar, 38Matsuyama T. Yamada A. Kay J. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Exp.

Similarly, there is evidence for a functional cross-talk between integrins and BCR from studies of ligation of both receptors, where there appears to be modulation of normal B cell proliferation.3 Future studies will be directed toward understanding the function of HEF1 in integrin and BCR signaling pathways and gaining insight into the association of adhesion with antigen-induced activation of B cells. INTRODUCTIONThe integrin family of adhesion molecules are involved in transducing biochemical signals into the cell, resulting in diverse biological events. Among these signals are tyrosine phosphorylations of specific proteins such as the focal adhesion kinase p125FAK (Fak) 1The abbreviations used are: FAKp125FAKCasp130CasHEF1human enhancer of filamentation 1SHsrc homologyBCRB cell antigen receptorRAFTKrelated adhesion focal tyrosine kinaseCblp120c-CBLRAMrabbit anti-mouse IgCBcytochalasin Banti-P-tyranti-phosphotyrosineIVKin vitro kinase assayPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (1Schwartz M. Shaller M. Ginsberg M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Integrin cytoplasmic domains are associated with actin-containing cytoskeleton components, and one concept of integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylations is that oligomerization of integrins reorganizes the cytoskeleton into a framework that supports interactions between components of the intracellular signaling machinery (2Shattil S. Ginsberg M. Brugge J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis is the observation that inhibitors of cytoskeletal assembly also inhibit integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylations (3Huang M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J. Ginsberg M. Shattil S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).B lymphocytes express several different integrins that are involved in cell localization within specific microenvironments (4Freedman A.S. Munro M.J. Rice G.E. Bevilacqua M.P. Morimoto C. McIntyre B.W. Rhynhart K. Pober J.S. Nadler L.M. Science. 1990; 249: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 5Koopman G. Parmentier H.K.

Ligation of integrins on pre-B and mature B cells appears to be involved in regulating cell survival (6Ryan D.H. Nuccle B.L. Abboud C.N. Liesveld J.L. J.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 3760-3767PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin ligation is important to understanding how integrin-mediated signaling regulates B cell function. We have previously reported the prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 105 to 130 kDa following β1 integrin cross-linking on human B cells (10Freedman A. Rhynhart K. Nojima Y. Svahn J.

Blood. 1996; 87: 1855-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these substrates have been identified as Fak (11Manié S. Astier A. Wang D. Phifer J. Chen J. Lazarovits A. Morimoto C. Freedman A. Blood. 1996; 87: 1855-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and p120c-CBL (Cbl) (12Manié S. Sattler M. Astier A. Phifer J.S. Canty T. Morimoto C. Druker B. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Freedman A.S. Exp. Hematol. 1996; Google Scholar), the cellular homologue of the oncogene v-CBL.Following integrin ligation in fibroblasts, another tyrosine phosphorylated protein known as p130Cas (Cas) has been identified (13Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Herrera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cas (rk ssociated ubstrate) was originally described as a major tyrosine phosphorylated protein in v-crk- or v-src-transformed cells (17Kanner S. Reynolds A. Wang H.-C.R. Vines R. Parsons J.

Cas is an SH3 domain containing molecule with 15 potential Crk-SH2-binding motifs and several potential binding motifs for SH3 domains, suggesting that it may act as a “docking molecule” in intracellular signal transduction. In fact, Cas forms stable complexes with the SH2 domains of v-crk family members and v-src (16Petruzzelli L. Takami M. Herrera R. J. Biol.

Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Analogous to Cas, HEF1 contains an SH3 domain and multiple Crk-SH2 binding motifs, associates with Fak and v-abl, and localizes to focal contacts. However, in contrast to Cas, HEF1 localizes to the cell nucleus, suggesting that Cas and HEF1 may have distinct functions in cell signaling.In the present report, we show a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and HEF1 induced by β1 integrin ligation on normal or transformed human B cells, with HEF1 being the predominant substrate. Ligation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of predominantly HEF1, and similar to integrins, BCR-mediated HEF1 phosphorylation was dependent upon an intact actin network. We further showed that Cas and HEF1 complexed in vivo with the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase RAFTK, the adapter protein CrkL, and Lyn kinase, indicating that both molecules may play an important role in B cell signaling.

Rotary shadowed images of perlecan show it to contain three glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains extending from one end of its core protein. Domain I is at the N terminus of perlecan and contains three closely spaced Ser-Gly-Asp sequences that may serve in GAG attachment. We evaluated the serines in these three sequences for GAG attachment by preparing a cDNA construct encoding for the N-terminal half (domains I, II, and III) of perlecan and then a series of constructs containing deletions and mutations within domain I of the domain I/II/III construct, expressing these constructs in COS-7 cells, and then analyzing the recombinant product for GAG side chains and GAG type. The results showed that all three serine residues in the Ser-Gly-Asp sequences in domain I can accept both chondroitin and heparan sulfate side chains but that a cluster of acidic residues N-terminal to these sequences is the primary determinant responsible for targeting these sites for heparan sulfate. Furthermore, there are two elements that can enhance heparan sulfate synthesis at a targeted site: 1) the presence of a the SEA module in the C-terminal region of domain I and 2) the presence of multiple acceptors in close proximity. These results indicate that the proportion of heparan and chondroitin sulfate at any one site in domain I of perlecan is regulated by multiple factors."

Substitution of Asn295, produced identical changes in the receptor's pharmacological profile. Furthermore, the Ser111AT1A and Ser295AT1A mutants did not require the association of a G-protein for high affinity agonist binding. Finally, the Ser295AT1A mutant maintained higher basal generation of inositol trisphosphate than the wild type, indicating constitutive activation.

Drosophila single-minded (dSIM) is a positive master gene regulator of central nervous system midline formation. Two murine homologs of the dSIM gene have recently been isolated (18Fan C.-M.

In addition to their expression in the central nervous system, both proteins are also expressed in a variety of other tissues during development. The expression of SIM2 in adult mice appears to be restricted to muscle, kidney, and lung (19Ema M. Suzuki M. Morita M. Hirose K. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Kujii H. Hamada H.

The human homolog of SIM2 maps to the Down's syndrome critical region of chromosome 21 and has been implicated as a candidate gene responsible for the abnormal morphological features observed in Down's syndrome (20Dahmane N.

A DNA-binding site (central nervous system midline element (CME), 5′-(G/A)(T/A)ACGTG-3′), which resembles the XRE, was postulated for dSIM when putatively dimerized with another protein, based on sequence analysis of enhancers of genes involved in midline formation and subject to regulation by dSIM (23Wharton Jr., K.A. Franks R.G. Kasai Y. Crews S.T. Development. 1994; 120: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA target consensus (5′-GT(G/A)CGTG-3′) for the dSIM·ARNT heterodimer, slightly different from the CME, was identified by a binding site selection and amplification strategy (24Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the properties of the two murine SIM proteins, SIM1 and SIM2, in conjunction with mouse ARNT and AHR. We demonstrate that both SIM1 and SIM2 can heterodimerize via their helix-loop-helix·PAS regions with ARNT, but not with AHR, and that they do not form homodimers. Furthermore, SIM1 may have a dual role, both negatively affecting AHR·ARNT binding to the XRE and also acting in concert with ARNT as a novel DNA-binding heterodimer. The Gal4 activation domain vector pGAD425 and the LexA DNA binding domain vector pBTM117C were generous gifts from J. Colicelli (UCLA) (25Han L. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell.

PCR primers were synthesized on a ABI PCR-Mate model 391 (Applied Biosystems) or purchased from IDT (Coralville, IL). The yeast two-hybrid fusion constructs ARNTbHLHAB, ARNTbHLH, ARNTbHLHA, ARNTAB, and AHRΔC were generated by PCR using Amplitaq (Perkin-Elmer) with the corresponding ARNT and AHR cDNAs contained in pcDNA1/Neo (9Reisz-Porszasz S.

The SIM1 and SIM2 constructs SIM1ΔC, SIM1bHLH, SIM1bHLHA, SIM1AB, and SIM2ΔC were PCR-amplified with full-length SIM1 and SIM2 cDNAs as templates. The primer sequences are available upon request. The PCR products were cloned into pCR2 (Invitrogen), excised with SalI and NotI, and transferred into pGAD425 and pBTM117C. Full-length SIM1 was PCR-amplified using Ultma Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The addition of the β-globin 5′-untranslated region from pT7βHER, essentially as described previously for AHR (28Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), resulted in 3-4-fold higher levels of protein expression in the TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega). pcDNA3/SIM1ΔbH1 was generated in the same fashion. Strain L40C (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 can1 LYS::lexAopHIS3 URA3::lexAop-LacZ) was a generous gift of J. Colicelli. For two-hybrid interaction assays, cells were transformed with the combinations of the indicated plasmids by standard procedures (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) and were patched onto selective medium to ensure uptake of both plasmids. Single colonies were picked and grown individually in selective medium. To test for ligand dependent dimerization, aliquots were grown from the initial culture in the presence of 10−5Mβ-naphtoflavone in Me2SO, (final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO) or vehicle alone. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of modified Z-buffer (40 mM NaH2PO4, 60 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM KCl, pH 7.0). Fifty μl of 0.1% SDS and three drops of CHCl3 were added, and the mixtures were vortexed for 1 min. The chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (Sigma) was added at 4 mg/ml in 200 μl of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and incubated at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 1 M sodium carbonate. Cell debris was spun down, and the absorbance of the clear supernatant was measured at 420 nm (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Reaction conditions were linear with regard to both protein concentration and incubation time. The XRE oligonucleotide was synthesized and labeled as described previously (9Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Eight different double-stranded CMEs (23Wharton Jr., K.A. Franks R.G. Kasai Y. Crews S.T. Development. 1994; 120: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generated by annealing CME1-CME8 (5′-TCCGGCTCTTC(T/G)CACGT(A/T)(C/T)CTCCGAGCTCA-3′) with CME1′-CME4′ (5′-TGAGCTCGGAG(A/G)(A/T)ACGTG-3′). Oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dATP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), diluted 1:1 with H2O and purified on a Chromaspin-10 (Clontech) and a Centrex 0.45-μm nitrocellulose spin column (Schleicher & Schuell). Proteins were synthesized in the TNT T7 coupled systems with either rabbit reticulocyte or wheat germ lysate as translation agents (Promega). EMSA was performed as described previously using binding buffer A (25 mM HEPES, 200 mM KCl, 50 μg/ml poly(dI·dC)(dI·dC), 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) (9Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the KCl and the poly(dI·dC)(dI·dC) concentration of the binding buffer was lowered to 50 mM and 10 μg/ml, respectively (binding buffer B). Unlabeled, double-stranded CME2 (5′-TGAGCTCGGAGGAACGTGAGAAGAGCCGGA-3′ or the cAMP-response element (5′-GGATCCATGACGTCATGGATC-3′) was used as a competitor. In brief, equimolar amounts (unless otherwise stated) of in vitro synthesized proteins were incubated in the presence of 10−8M TCDD in Me2SO (final concentration of 1% Me2SO) or vehicle alone at room temperature for 90 min. Incubation was continued for a further 20 min after the addition of binding buffer and for a further 20 min after the addition of the radiolabeled XRE (15,000 or 100,000 cpm/reaction). The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (4.5% acrylamide) with 1 × HTE running buffer (200 mM HEPES, 100 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 30% MeOH, dried, and exposed to Biomax autoradiography film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitation of protein-DNA complexes was performed on an AMBIS radioanalytic system (Ambis). Proteins were synthesized in the TNT T7 coupled transcription/rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine as indicated. Coimmunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (9Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For the interactions with HSP90, equimolar amounts of in vitro synthesized proteins were diluted in HSP90 immunoprecipitation buffer and SIM1·HSP90 or AHR·HSP90 complexes precipitated with anti-HSP90 antibodies as described previously (10Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29270-29278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hepa-1c1c7 cells were cultured and maintained in nucleoside-free α-minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma). 5 × 105 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with the plasmids as indicated, according to the transfection method of Chen and Okayama (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), except that the CO2 concentration was maintained at 5% throughout the procedure. Plasmids for transfection were prepared by the Qiagen maxiprep procedure according to the supplier's protocol. 16-24 h after transfection, cells were subjected to a 15% glycerol shock for 1.5 min, washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and then refed media with or without 10 nM TCDD. 24-36 h later, cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysates were prepared by repeated freezing and thawing. Endogenous acetyltransferases were inactivated by incubating at 65°C for 10 min. Protein concentrations were measured according to the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad). CAT activities were determined and expressed as nmol of N-acetylchloramphenicol formed/30 min/mg of protein. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was probed with a random primed, [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA fragments of the C-terminal parts of SIM1 and SIM2 (starting at the codons corresponding to amino acid 392 of SIM1 and to amino acid 393 of SIM2, respectively). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing conditions were according to the manufacturer's protocol. The blot was exposed to Biomax autoradiography film (Kodak). This system for assessing protein-protein interactions takes advantage of the modular nature of eukaryotic transcription factors. One protein of interest is fused to a DNA binding domain, and the other is fused to a transcriptional transactivation domain. Dimerization of the two fusion proteins reconstitutes a functional transcription factor that can activate several reporter genes incorporated into the genome of the host cells. Previously, we demonstrated that full in vitro heterodimerization and XRE binding activity was retained by ARNT and AHR constructs lacking their C-terminal halves, indicating that the bHLH·PAS regions were sufficient for ligand-dependent heterodimerization (9Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29270-29278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Here we generated constructs such that the LexA DNA binding domain and the Gal4 transactivation domain were fused with the bHLH·PAS regions of the mouse proteins ARNT, AHR, SIM1, and SIM2 and with several mutant forms of ARNT and SIM1. A full-length mouse SIM1 mammalian expression plasmid and an N-terminal deletion construct (SIM1ΔbH1) were also generated (Fig. 1). The interactions among ARNTbHLHAB, AHRΔC, SIM1ΔC, and SIM2ΔC were quantitated by assaying β-galactosidase activity in the transformed yeast cells (the β-galactosidase gene in the host cells contains several LexA binding sites in its 5′-flanking sequence) (Table I). The cells were either untreated or treated with the AHR agonist BNF. Heterodimerization of ARNTbHLHAB with AHRΔC was ligand-dependent. BNF treatment resulted in a 40- or 60-fold increase in dimerization of these proteins (as measured by β-galactosidase reporter activity after subtracting the background values of the empty vector controls, and depending on the orientation of ARNTbHLHAB and AHRΔC constructs in the two hybrid vectors). Such a marked effect of ligand on AHR·ARNT dimerization has previously only been observed in mammalian cells expressing the endogenous AHR and ARNT proteins and not in yeast (31Fujisawa-Sehara A. Sogawa K. Hishi C. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 14: 1465-1477Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Carver L.A. Jackiw V. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

No ARNT homodimerization was observed with the bHLHAB construct. Similar results were obtained with an ARNT derivative HLHAB, identical to bHLHAB except for the absence of the basic region (data not shown). No evidence for homodimerization of AHRΔC or for it interacting with SIM1ΔC or SIM2ΔC was obtained. Finally, no homodimerization of either SIM1ΔC or SIM2ΔC and no heterodimerization of SIM1ΔC with SIM2ΔC was observed. Thus, in the two-hybrid system, AHR, SIM1, and SIM2 each interacted exclusively with ARNT, and each failed to form homodimers, as did ARNT. Similar results were obtained with each pair of proteins regardless of which protein was expressed as a fusion with the Gal4 transactivation domain and which was expressed as a fusion with the LexA DNA binding domain.Table I.Yeast two-hybrid interactions of mouse ARNT, AHR, SIM1, and SIM2pGAD425 derivativesBNFpBTM117C derivativesARNTbHLHABAHRΔCSIM1ΔCSIM2ΔCNo insertunitsARNTbHLHAB−0.25 ± 0.070.16 ± 0.248.5 ± 0.9aSignificantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).1.01 ± 0.13aSignificantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).0.27 ± 0.05+NDbND, not determined.1.48 ± 0.30aSignificantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).NDNDNDAHRΔC−0.25 ± 0.020.15 ± 0.040.09 ± 0.060.08 ± 0.040.16 ± 0.07+4.12 ± 0.70aSignificantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).0.25 ± 0.020.10 ± 0.050.08 ± 0.060.14 ± 0.10SIM1ΔC−7.20 ± 0.60aSignificantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).0.11 ± 0.060.06 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.030.06 ± 0.01+7.40 ± 0.70aSignificantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).0.10 ± 0.01NDNDNDSIM2ΔC−0.68 ± 0.14aSignificantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).0.16 ± 0.040.06 ± 0.030.11 ± 0.080.09 ± 0.05+0.58 ± 0.09aSignificantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).0.14 ± 0.03NDNDNDno insert−0.13 ± 0.040.08 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.01+0.14 ± 0.040.10 ± 0.05NDND0.05 ± 0.01a Significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from a corresponding assay using one empty vector (or from each of the two assays using one empty vector when both controls were performed).b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The contribution of the bHLH and the PAS region of SIM1 toward heterodimerization with ARNT-bHLHAB was also investigated (Table II). No interactions were observed between ARNTbHLHAB and SIM1 constructs containing only the bHLH, bHLHA, or AB regions. Identical results were obtained for SIM1ΔC with the equivalent ARNT constructs. These results indicate that the entire bHLH·PAS regions of SIM1 and ARNT are required for efficient heterodimerization in yeast.Table IIYeast two-hybrid interactions between mouse ARNT and mouse SIM1 domainspGAD425 derivativespBTM117C derivativesARNTbHLHABSIM1ΔCARNT bHLH0.04 ± 0.01SIM1 bHLH0.14 ± 0.02ARNT bHLHA0.03 ± 0.01SIM1 bHLHA0.14 ± 0.02ARNT AB0.03 ± 0.02SIM1 AB0.20 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab To confirm the observed interaction of ARNT with SIM1, the heterodimerization between ARNT and SIM1 was assessed using in vitro expressed proteins. The proteins were synthesized separately in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, either in the presence (SIM1) or absence (ARNT) of [35S]methionine. They were then incubated together, subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to ARNT, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). SIM1 was coimmunoprecipitated with ARNT, both in the presence or absence of TCDD. SIM1 was absent from the supernatant, indicating that the coimmunoprecipitation was quantitative (data not shown). A small amount of SIM1 was precipitated in an incubation mixture containing preimmune serum, which was comparable with the amount precipitated in the absence of ARNT protein. ARNT antibodies did not coprecipitate significant amounts of the SIM1ΔbH1 construct (data not shown). In a separate experiment, in vitro synthesized SIM1 failed to bind the AHR photoaffinity ligand 2-azido-3-[125I]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin under conditions in which binding to AHR is clearly discernible (Ref. 10Fukunaga B.N.

Thus SIM1·ARNT heterodimerization in reticulocyte lysate is constitutive and TCDD-independent and, as expected, requires helix 1 of SIM1. In the absence of ligand, cytosolic AHR is found in a complex with two molecules of HSP90 (12Chen H.-S. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27554-27558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When AHR is translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, it associates with HSP90 present in the lysate (10Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29270-29278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Whitelaw M.L. Göttlicher M. Gustafsson J.-A. Poellinger L.

When AHR and SIM1 were synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine and then treated with HSP90 antibodies, AHR and SIM1 were precipitated, whereas the corresponding control IgM did not precipitate the labeled proteins (Fig. 2B). Thus, like AHR, SIM1 complexes with HSP90. The CME has been proposed as the DNA binding site for dSIM putatively associated with another (ARNT-like) protein (23Wharton Jr., K.A. Franks R.G. Kasai Y.

https://openalex.org/W2002806282,"The genes encoding the proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) of a thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB-8 were cloned and sequenced. They constitute a cluster that is composed of 14 structural genes and contains no unidentified reading frames.

T. thermophilus NDH-1 contains at most nine putative iron-sulfur cluster binding sites, eight of which are commonly found in other organisms. The T. thermophilus NQO2 subunit was expressed in Escherichia coli The expressed subunit bears a single [2Fe-2S] cluster whose optical and EPR properties are very similar to those of N1a cluster in the P. denitrificans NQO2 subunit (Yano, T., Sled', V.D., Ohnishi, T., and Yagi, T. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 494-499). These results strongly suggest that the T. thermophilus NDH-1 is similar to other NDH-1 enzyme complexes in terms of subunit and cofactor composition. The T. thermophilus NQO2 subunit displayed much higher stability than the mesophilic equivalent and its iron-sulfur cluster remained intact even after incubation for 3 h at 65°C under anaerobic conditions. With the advantage of thermostability, the T. thermophilus NDH-1 provides a great model system to investigate the structure-function relationship of the NDH-1 enzyme complexes.

The T. thermophilus NQO2 subunit was expressed in Escherichia coli The expressed subunit bears a single [2Fe-2S] cluster whose optical and EPR properties are very similar to those of N1a cluster in the P. denitrificans NQO2 subunit (Yano, T., Sled', V.D., Ohnishi, T., and Yagi, T. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 494-499). These results strongly suggest that the T. thermophilus NDH-1 is similar to other NDH-1 enzyme complexes in terms of subunit and cofactor composition. The T. thermophilus NQO2 subunit displayed much higher stability than the mesophilic equivalent and its iron-sulfur cluster remained intact even after incubation for 3 h at 65°C under anaerobic conditions. With the advantage of thermostability, the T. thermophilus NDH-1 provides a great model system to investigate the structure-function relationship of the NDH-1 enzyme complexes."

Some of these stimuli activate the ERK subclass of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that target the TCF Sap-1a. We show that Sap-1a is also phosphorylated by the stress-activated JNK subclass of MAPKs leading to stimulation of both c-fos serum response element and E74-site-dependent transcription in RK13 cells. Several JNK-1 phosphorylation sites were mapped within Sap-1a, and mutation of these sites affected the transactivation mediated by Sap-1a and JNK-1. The impact of these phosphorylation sites varied at different promoters and was dependent on whether Sap-1a was stimulated by ERK-1 or JNK-1. Additionally, a comparison of Sap-1a with another TCF, Elk-1, revealed that these proteins behaved differently to stimulation by ERK-1 and JNK-1. Furthermore, activation of Sap-1a by JNK-1 was inhibited by the p38MAPK in RK13 cells, possibly by competition for a common upstream activator. Altogether, our data suggest that Sap-1a plays an important role in the nuclear response elicited by cellular stress.

In humans and cattle, an 18.5-kDa isoform of MBP predominates and exists as a multitude of charge isomers resulting from extensive and varied post-translational modifications. We have purified the least modified isomer (named C1) of the 18.5-kDa isoform of MBP from fresh bovine brain and imaged this protein as negatively stained single particles adsorbed to a lipid monolayer. Under these conditions, MBP/C1 presented diverse projections whose relative orientations were determined using an iterative quaternion-assisted angular reconstitution scheme. In different buffers, one with a low salt and the other with a high salt concentration, the conformation of the protein was slightly different. In low salt buffer, the three-dimensional reconstruction, solved to a resolution of 4 nm, had an overall “C” shape of outer radius 5.5 nm, inner radius 3 nm, overall circumference 15 nm, and height 4.7 nm. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the protein in high salt buffer, solved to a resolution of 2.8 nm, was essentially the same in terms of overall dimensions but had a somewhat more compact architecture.

Briefly, MBP contains (i) no cysteinyl residues, (ii) 12 lysyl and 19 arginyl residues giving it a highly basic character (pI ∼10.6), (iii) 11 prolyl residues (including a triproline repeat adjacent to human Thr98 and bovine Thr97), (iv) a mitogen-activated protein kinase site (35Erickson A.K.

MBP isolated from victims of multiple sclerosis has been shown to be considerably less cationic than that from normal, age-matched controls due to a decrease in the most cationic form (C1) and a consequent relative increase in the less cationic isomers, particularly C8 (43Wood D.D.

We focus here on the structure of C1 of the 18.5-kDa form of bovine MBP, and in this paper we shall consider “MBP/C1” as meaning this isoform and isomer. Myelin has been generally considered to be an inert structure, facilitating saltatory conduction of nerve impulses. Thus, the role of MBP has long been assigned to be simply the compaction at the cytoplasmic surface of oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells, which eventually becomes the major dense line (1Deber C.M.

However, all attempts to obtain three-dimensional crystals of MBP suitable for x-ray diffractometry (very many have been pursued over the past 2 decades) have failed (85Sdzik J. Kirschner D.A. Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this and the accompanying manuscript (86Ridsdale R.A. Beniac D.R. Tompkins T.A. Moscarello M.A. Harauz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we describe electron microscopical visualization and molecular modeling studies of MBP. Here, we exploited the well defined images of randomly oriented particles of bovine MBP formed on lipid monolayers formed on the air-water interface to obtain a structure to 2.8-nm resolution via “single particle electron crystallography” (87Frank J.

Bovine brain was obtained from 2-4-year-old cattle immediately after death (Ontario Agricultural College). All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4°C unless otherwise specified. The entire brain was immediately placed in approximately 1 liter of isotonic buffer (145 mM NaCl). The meninges and cortex were carefully removed, and blood was washed away from the remaining tissue with isotonic buffer. The gray matter was removed from the white matter gently using a spatula. This white matter was cut into small pieces approximately 3-5 cm in size and either frozen rapidly and stored at −70°C until use or used immediately as a source for bovine MBP/C1. The C1 component of myelin basic protein was isolated essentially as described previously (13Cheifetz S. Moscarello M.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1909-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 42Wood D.D. Moscarello M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a total of approximately 36 g of white matter was homogenized in 4 or 5 small portions in 284 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v) for 2 min using a probe sonicator (Pro250, DiaMed Corp., Mississauga, Ontario) at a setting of 4 or 5. This homogenate was stirred overnight at 4°C and then filtered through Whatman filter paper under gravity at room temperature in the fume hood. The residue remaining on the paper was washed with 130 ml of ice cold chloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v) followed by 172 ml of ice-cold acetone. The residue was then air-dried and was either frozen for up to 2 days at −20°C before use or immediately resuspended in 130 ml of 100 mM H2SO4, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was gently stirred overnight and centrifuged in a Beckman JA20 rotor at 6,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 52 ml of the same buffer and recentrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 min. The acid-soluble proteins in the pooled supernatants were precipitated by adding an equal volume of ice-cold absolute ethanol and leaving the mixture overnight at −20°C. The precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 1 h at −10°C. The precipitate was washed twice in 150 ml of 90% ethanol at −20°C and recovered by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min at −10°C. The final protein pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer 1 (80 mM glycine, 6 M urea, pH 9.5) and dialyzed overnight against 500 ml of buffer 1 at room temperature. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 9.5 with NaOH. An amount of 80-90 (A280) units of sample was loaded at a rate of 0.1 ml/min onto a Whatman CM52 column (35 × 1 cm) that had been preswollen and preequilibrated with buffer 1 at pH 10.5. Chromatography was performed at room temperature (∼18-20°C). After sample loading, the column was washed with 60 ml of buffer 1 at 12 ml/h for 5 h. Bound protein was eluted by 200 ml of buffer 2 (80 mM glycine, 2 M urea, pH 10.5) in a linear gradient of 0-200 mM NaCl at 12 ml/h. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm and collected in 3-ml fractions. Under these conditions, component C1 of MBP eluted last. The C1-containing fractions were dialyzed against either 1 liter of buffer G (80 mM glycine, pH 7.5, with NaOH, 0.75 mM NaN3) or buffer S (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, with NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.75 mM NaN3) at 4°C for 24 h and then dialyzed further against 1 liter of the same buffer for another 24 h. The protein concentration was estimated via a commercial colorimetric assay using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce) and diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 or 0.25 mg/ml. Aliquots of bovine MBP/C1 were either used immediately or frozen at −20°C until use. To confirm the identity of purified bovine MPB/C1 biochemically and immunologically, 12% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses were performed. In brief, protein samples from varied steps of the purification were separated by 12% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in duplicate. One of the gels was silver-stained (Fig. 1). Western blotting was performed on the other gel using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad catalog number 170-6412). The second gel was equilibrated in transfer buffer (10 mM CAPS, pH 11.0, with NaOH, 20% methanol) for 30 min, and electroblotted at 170 mA for 1 h in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II blotting apparatus onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The CAPS buffer improved the transfer of bovine MBP/C1 (pI ∼10.6) considerably compared with other buffers such as HEPES. The unbound sites in the nitrocellulose membrane were blocked using 3% gelatin. The membrane was then probed with rabbit anti-bovine MBP/C1 polyclonal IgG antibody, and the presence of bovine MBP/C1 was detected using the amplified alkaline phosphatase goat anti-rabbit immunoblot assay kit as directed by the manufacturer. Preparation for electron microscopy was performed using refinements of published protocols as follows. A 13-μl drop of MBP/C1 was incubated in a Teflon well, and a <1-μl droplet of dehydroabietylamine (89Aoyama K. Ogawa K. Kimura Y. Fujiyoshi Y. Ultramicroscopy. 1995; 57: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or lipid mixture (90Jap B.K. Zulauf M. Scheybani T. Hefti A. Baumeister W. Aebi U. Engel A.

Supramolecular Sci. 1994; 1: 111-116Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was touched to the surface, where it formed a monolayer. After some time in a humid environment, the lipid-protein layer on the surface was removed with a copper grid coated with fenestrated plastic (cellulose acetate butyrate), negatively stained with unbuffered (pH ∼4) uranyl formate (92Bremer A. Henn C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Aebi U. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 85-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and air-dried. A number of factors were varied in this process: protein concentration (2.5-0.25 mg/ml), substrate at air-water interface (dehydroabietylamine or mixtures of the following lipids: galactocerebroside, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and monosialoganglioside GM1), incubation temperature (20 or 32°C), incubation time (0.5, 1, 2, 6, 8, and 12 h), pH of the protein solution (10.5 or 7.5), buffer conditions (concentrations of HEPES-NaOH, glycine, NaCl, CaCl2), and subphase density (with or without 20% glycerol). MBP/C1 at 0.25 mg/ml at 32°C interacted best with a monolayer formed by a 4:1 (v/v) mixture of phosphatidylserine and monosialoganglioside GM1 and is the basis of the results presented here. Imaging was performed in a Philips EM400T at a magnification of × 60,000 using the low dose unit and with the sample kept at liquid nitrogen temperature (−185°C) in a Gatan cryoholder.

Studies showing that hypoxia-induced transcription of IL-6 in cultured endothelial cells was due to transcriptional activation by the NF-IL-6 motif in the promoter (Yan, S.-F., Tritto, I., Pinsky, D., Liao, H., Huang, J., Fuller, G., Brett, J., May, L., and Stern, D.

INTRODUCTIONOne of the fundamental cellular responses to environmental stress is redirection of biosynthetic mechanisms that promote adaptation and enhance survival. These mechanisms have been studied in detail following induction of heat shock and are now coming under intensive study in the setting of oxygen deprivation. Limitation of oxygen supply occurs in a range of situations, from environmental deficiency at high altitude to that resulting from diminished blood flow, or in solid tumors with growth that has outpaced the ability of neovasculature to sustain cellular activities. One of the best studied instances of gene expression modulated by hypoxia is induction of erythropoietin (1Wang G. Semenza G. J. Biol.

The DNA binding motif for this transcription factor is also present in the promoter of certain key glycolytic enzymes (4Semenza G. Roth P. Fang H.-M. Wang G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), both of which demonstrate enhanced expression in response to oxygen deprivation.In a previous study, we found that hypoxia stimulated expression of the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) by cultured endothelial cells (ECs), and that this was due to enhanced transcription driven by the nuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL-6) site in the IL-6 promoter (9Yan S.-F.

In the hypoxic cultured endothelium, activation NF-IL-6-C/EBPβ was observed, although there was no evidence for activation of C/EBPα or δ. Since NF-IL-6 binding elements are present in multiple genes with expression that might contribute importantly to the cellular response during oxygen deprivation (10Akira S. Ishiki H. Sguita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 8: 1897-1906Crossref Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), we made transgenic mice in which a 115- or 14-bp portion of the IL-6 promoter, encompassing the NF-IL-6 site, was fused to the lacZ gene as a reporter and to the basal thymidine kinase promoter. Our results indicate that transcriptional activation does occur at the NF-IL-6 site in vivo in hypoxia and ischemia, and that this is especially evident in vasculature of the lung and heart and in the kidney. In addition, nuclear extracts from the latter organs showed a prominent hypoxia-mediated increase in binding activity for an NF-IL-6 oligonucleotide probe. In contrast, hypoxic liver did not display enhanced transgene expression in vasculature or parenchyma, and there was no increase in NF-IL-6 binding activity. These results indicate the existence of tissue-specific mechanisms underlying activation of NF-IL-6, which can be modulated by the local microenvironment in response to oxygen deprivation.DISCUSSIONHypoxic stress accompanies a range of pathophysiologically relevant situations. Modulation of gene expression in response to oxygen deprivation is a basic component of adaptation to such an environmental perturbation (20Subjeck J. Thung-Tai S. Am. J.

We previously noted induction of IL-6 in cultured ECs subjected to hypoxia, which we speculated might have a protective role by suppressing the effect of potent proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor (9Yan S.-F.

Med. 1989; 225: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), elicited by hypoxemia and/or ischemia. IL-6 induction in hypoxic cultured ECs was driven by increased gene transcription mediated by the NF-IL-6 site in the promoter (9Yan S.-F. Tritto I. Pinsky D. Liao H. Huang J. Fuller G. Brett J. May L. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Mice subjected to hypoxia also demonstrated increased vascular expression of IL-6, corresponding with our observations in vitro These results led us to examine whether hypoxia would trigger NF-IL-6-mediated transcription in vivoTo address this issue, two types of transgenic mice were prepared: mice bearing a transgene spanning a 115- and 14-bp portion of the IL-6 promoter, in each case constituting the NF-IL-6 site. Expression of both transgenes was observed in lung vasculature, as expected from our previous results (9Yan S.-F. Tritto I. Pinsky D. Liao H. Huang J. Fuller G. Brett J. May L. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the β-galactosidase reporter was evident in the heart, in both cardiac myocytes and vasculature, and in the kidney, especially in proximal tubule cells. In contrast, the liver showed no significant hypoxia-mediated increase in transgene expression, either in hepatocytes or in the vasculature. These data suggested the existence of mechanisms for organ-specific regulation of hypoxia-inducible gene expression mediated by NF-IL-6, analogous to cell-specific expression of the erythropoietin gene in transgenic mice (although expression of the NF-IL-6 transgene follows a distinct pattern; Ref. 26Semenza G. Koury S. Nejfelt M. Gearhart J. Antonarakis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8725-8729Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this context, EMSA from hypoxic lung, heart, and kidney showed striking increases in nuclear binding activity for the NF-IL-6 oligonucleotide probe, whereas there was no increase in hypoxic liver. Pilot experiments with cultured hepG2 cells (data not shown) and our past studies on cultured ECs (9Yan S.-F. Tritto I. Pinsky D. Liao H. Huang J. Fuller G. Brett J. May L. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) confirmed these differences in the cellular response to oxygen deprivation. ECs exhibited a rapid and pronounced increase in NF-IL-6 binding activity in response to hypoxia, whereas this did not occur in hepG2 cells. These data contrast with the well known hypoxia-mediated activation of HIF-1 in hepG2 cells (8Ebert B. Firth J. Ratcliffe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and suggest the existence of distinct pathways leading to expression of transcription factor-DNA binding activity.Our findings provide a first step in understanding the contribution of NF-IL-6 motifs to the regulation of gene expression in hypoxia and ischemia. C/EBPβ-NF-IL-6-driven transcription was observed in vasculature of the heart, lung, and kidney and in cardiac myocytes. In contrast, no expression was observed in the liver, either in parenchymal cells or vasculature. This suggests the importance of local factors in the microenvironment in regulation of gene expression. Future work will be directed toward identification of such autocrine and paracrine factors produced by hypoxic and ischemic tissues.

In addition, nuclear extracts from the latter organs showed a prominent hypoxia-mediated increase in binding activity for an NF-IL-6 oligonucleotide probe. In contrast, hypoxic liver did not display enhanced transgene expression in vasculature or parenchyma, and there was no increase in NF-IL-6 binding activity. These results indicate the existence of tissue-specific mechanisms underlying activation of NF-IL-6, which can be modulated by the local microenvironment in response to oxygen deprivation."

INTRODUCTIONCells require optimal levels of the polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, for their growth and differentiation and are therefore equipped with many intricate mechanisms for the control of these levels (1Heby O.

Any cell that becomes polyamine-deficient is severely limited in its ability to grow and proliferate. There is also evidence suggesting that polyamines play a role in apoptotic cell death (3Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell.

Sutton K.G. Dolphin A.C. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 153-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Polyamines also regulate programmed translational frameshifting, which is essential for the expression of ODC antizyme, a protein involved in the regulation of polyamine levels both in yeast (9Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and in mammalian (10Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y.

Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Hölttä E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The fact that inhibition of the ODC activity counteracts malignant transformation suggests that the ODC gene is a proto-oncogene. In this context it also should be noted that the ODC gene is regulated by the Fos (12Wrighton C. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4657-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Myc (13Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that constitutive overproduction of ODC has been observed in many types of cancer cells, the ODC gene appears to be of central importance in the regulation of cell growth, with deregulation (15Pyronnet S. Vagner S. Bouisson M. Prats A.-C. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1742-1745PubMed Google Scholar) or mutation (16Tamori A. Nishiguchi S. Kuroki T. Koh N. Kobayashi K. Yano Y. Otani S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3500-3503PubMed Google Scholar) leading to malignant transformation.In an effort to elucidate the poorly understood role of polyamines in cell differentiation and development, we have focused our attention on F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells, which can be induced to differentiate in a controlled manner in culture, and which provide a model system for studying early events in mammalian development. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is a well-known inducer of F9 cell differentiation (17Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Less attention has been payed to the fact that F9 cells also differentiate into a parietal endoderm-like phenotype when inhibited in their ODC activity by treatment with the highly specific suicide inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (18Oredsson S.M. Billgren M. Heby O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schindler J. Kelly M. McCann P.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). That the differentiative effect is indeed due to polyamine depletion is shown by the fact that supplementation of putrescine (the product in the ODC-catalyzed reaction) within the first 2-4 days of DFMO treatment prevents the expression of the differentiated phenotype (18Oredsson S.M. Billgren M. Heby O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to the possibility that the polyamines themselves are important regulators of differentiation, there is another possible explanation for the DFMO-induced F9 teratocarcinoma stem cell differentiation. A state of putrescine and spermidine depletion implies that the cells have no acceptor molecules for the aminopropyl group that is normally transferred from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) in the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by spermidine synthase and spermine synthase (Fig. 1). Therefore, and because of feedback regulation of AdoMetDC by polyamines (1Heby O. Persson L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 153-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 20Persson L. Stjernborg L. Holm I. Heby O. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1992; 288: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Stjernborg L. Heby O. Mamont P. Persson L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), there may be a several thousandfold increase in the dcAdoMet content in DFMO-treated cells (23Mamont P.S. Danzin C. Wagner J. Siat M. Joder-Ohlenbusch A.-M. Claverie N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Pegg A.E. Pösö H. Shuttleworth K. Bennett R.A. Biochem.

In this context it should be emphasized that dcAdoMet does not act as a methyl group donor, but as a competitive inhibitor, in DNA methyltransferase (MTase)-catalyzed reactions (26Heby O. Persson L. Smith S.S. Zappia V. Pegg A.E. Progress in Polyamine Research. Plenum Press, New York1988: 291-299Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that dcAdoMet, at the high concentrations reached in DFMO-treated cells, competes with AdoMet, the methyl group donor in DNA methylation reactions, thus preventing the methylation of the daughter strands after DNA replication (Fig. 1). It has been suggested that demethylation of DNA may be at least partly responsible for the differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells, because the DNA of these cells becomes progressively demethylated during the course of differentiation induced by RA (27Bestor T.H. Hellewell S.B. Ingram V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Razin A. Webb C. Szyf M. Yisraeli J. Rosenthal A. Naveh-Many T. Sciaky-Gallili N. Cedar H.

Biol. 1984; 4: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is presently no obvious explanation for this RA-induced DNA hypomethylation.In the present study we establish that DFMO-mediated F9 cell differentiation is accompanied by demethylation of the DNA, and analyze the molecular mechanism involved. By preventing the accumulation of dcAdoMet by treatment with methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) or 5′-{[(Z)-4amino-2-butenyl]methylamino}-5′-deoxyadenosine (AbeAdo), potent inhibitors of AdoMetDC, we demonstrate that the accumulation of dcAdoMet is essential for DNA demethylation and differentiation to take place in polyamine-depleted F9 cells.DISCUSSIONInactivation of ODC, a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, by DFMO treatment, causes a permanent block in F9 cell proliferation and gradual changes in cell morphology and gene expression, resembling those occurring during the differentiation of inner cell mass to parietal endoderm (18Oredsson S.M. Billgren M. Heby O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar). The latter events take place in the early mouse embryo, generating the extraembryonic endoderm of the parietal yolk sac, which surrounds the developing mouse embryo (47Hogan B.L.M. Barlow D.P. Tilly R. Cancer Surv. 1983; 2: 115-140Google Scholar).In view of the fact that addition of polyamines has been shown to reverse or prevent antiproliferative and differentiative effects of DFMO, it has been concluded that these effects are due to polyamine depletion (18Oredsson S.M. Billgren M. Heby O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schindler J. Kelly M. McCann P.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the possibility remains that antiproliferative and differentiative effects of DFMO treatment are at least partly due to overproduction of dcAdoMet. This key metabolite accumulates to very high levels during the course of DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion, in F9 cells (the present study) as well as in other types of cells (23Mamont P.S. Danzin C. Wagner J. Siat M. Joder-Ohlenbusch A.-M. Claverie N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Pegg A.E. Pösö H. Shuttleworth K. Bennett R.A. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Oredsson S.M. Kanje M. Mamont P.S. Wagner J. Heby O. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 70: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The highest dcAdoMet levels recorded (1-1.5 nmol/106 cells), have been observed after removal of the selective pressure exerted by an AdoMetDC inhibitor from cells that overexpress AdoMetDC due to a 10-16-fold amplification of the AdoMetDC gene (55Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In cells other than these AdoMetDC overproducers, the accumulation of dcAdoMet is a direct consequence of the polyamine-deficient state, because putrescine and spermidine are the only acceptor molecules for the aminopropyl group of dcAdoMet, that is normally transferred in the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by spermidine synthase and spermine synthase, respectively.When putrescine and spermidine are added, they do not only replenish the cellular polyamine pools, but they also serve as acceptor molecules for dcAdoMet-derived aminopropyl groups in the synthesis of spermidine and spermine, thus reducing or eliminating the excess of dcAdoMet. Therefore, the fact that polyamines can prevent or reverse antiproliferative and differentiative effects caused by DFMO treatment does not prove that polyamines are involved in these processes.It is conceivable that dcAdoMet, when present at an abnormally high concentration, may compete with AdoMet in various methylation reactions, thus reducing, e.g. the degree of DNA methylation. In fact, when the concentration of dcAdoMet exceeded that of AdoMet by 5-fold in an in vitro assay, almost no DNA MTase activity remained (26Heby O. Persson L. Smith S.S. Zappia V. Pegg A.E. Progress in Polyamine Research. Plenum Press, New York1988: 291-299Google Scholar). We cannot entirely exclude the possibility that the accumulation of AdoHcy, a competitive inhibitor of virtually all transmethylases (44Cantoni G.L. Borchardt R.T. Creveling C.R. Ueland P.M. Biological Methylation and Drug Design. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1986: 227-238Crossref Google Scholar), including DNA MTase (45Kredich N.M. Hershfield M.S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1980; 18: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), could at least partly contribute to the inhibition of DNA methylation. However, the relatively modest change in the AdoHcy/AdoMet ratio (from approximately 0.08 to 0.43) makes this possibility very unlikely. Only AdoHcy/AdoMet ratios >1 appear to exert a significant inhibitory effect on the utilization of AdoMet for methylation (56Kramer D. Porter C.W. Borchardt R.T. Sufrin J.R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3838-3842PubMed Google Scholar).The view advanced above is consistent with the present finding, that DFMO-induced accumulation of dcAdoMet is paralleled by genome-wide DNA demethylation (occurring during the course of F9 cell differentiation). To test the possibility of interference with DNA methylation, using a more direct approach, the DFMO-induced excessive accumulation of dcAdoMet was prevented by simultaneous treatment with MGBG (43Williams-Ashman H.G. Schenone A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) or AbeAdo (31Danzin C. Marchal P. Casara P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), potent inhibitors of dcAdoMet formation. This treatment counteracted the demethylation of the genome and interfered with the differentiative processes induced by DFMO alone, thus lending support for our view that dcAdoMet accumulation is an important factor in these events. From this also follows that it is not the lack of polyamines per se that acts as a differentiative signal in DFMO-mediated F9 cell differentiation.These findings indicate that polyamine deficiency may induce terminal differentiation through an indirect, inhibitory effect on DNA methylation. The high level of dcAdoMet is likely to compete with AdoMet, the methyl group donor, at the active site of DNA MTase, thus reducing the methylating capacity of the enzyme. Consistent with a decreasing DNA methylating capacity, we also find that the amounts of DNA MTase mRNA and DNA MTase protein are gradually reduced during the course of DFMO-mediated F9 cell differentiation. The latter effects may be, at least partly, due to the fact that 1) the largest amounts of DNA MTase mRNA 2L. Frostesjö, J. O. Fredlund, S. M. Oredsson, and O. Heby, unpublished results. and protein (57Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.-U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) are found during the S phase of the cell cycle and that 2) the percentage of cells in the S phase decreases markedly during the course of F9 cell differentiation (18Oredsson S.M. Billgren M. Heby O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that there is still a relatively large amount of DNA MTase protein present in the F9 cells on day 3, although the percentage of S phase cells is low (18Oredsson S.M. Billgren M. Heby O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar), may be a consequence of a relatively slow turnover of the protein.The observed decrease in DNA methylation is likely to be an integral part of the corresponding differentiation process in vivo, because a similar decrease has been observed in the developing mouse embryo. Thus, there is a striking global undermethylation of the DNA in the extraembryonic lineages derived from the primitive endoderm as compared to the mouse embryo itself (28Razin A. Webb C. Szyf M. Yisraeli J. Rosenthal A. Naveh-Many T. Sciaky-Gallili N. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 48Sanford J.P. Chapman V.M.

Moreover, the fact that retroviral genomes are suppressed by DNA methylation when introduced into early embryos and F9 cells, but not when introduced into their differentiated counterparts (59Stewart C.L. Stuhlmann H. Jähner D. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4098-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), suggests that the DNA methylating capacity decreases during the corresponding differentiation process in vivo The genes which are directly responsible for parietal endoderm differentiation are still unidentified, but are likely to be found among those genes activated by demethylation.The experiments described in this study focus on a key metabolite, dcAdoMet, which normally acts as an aminopropyl group donor in polyamine biosynthesis, but which is shown to act as an inhibitor of DNA methylation and as an inducer of teratocarcinoma stem cell differentiation. The extremely low steady-state level of dcAdoMet observed under physiological conditions is maintained by a balance between the rate of synthesis (i.e. the AdoMetDC activity), which is feedback-regulated by the polyamines (20Persson L. Stjernborg L. Holm I. Heby O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Shantz L.M. Holm I. Jänne O.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the rate of utilization of the aminopropyl group for polyamine synthesis. This balance may be disrupted by AdoMetDC gene amplification (55Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis (this study), and may result in excessive dcAdoMet levels. In the case of teratocarcinomas, where the consequence of ODC inhibition is their differentiation into a cell type with no further proliferative capacity, our finding may have clinical utility in the development of a therapeutic approach to ovarian and testicular cancer. INTRODUCTIONCells require optimal levels of the polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, for their growth and differentiation and are therefore equipped with many intricate mechanisms for the control of these levels (1Heby O.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3500-3503PubMed Google Scholar) leading to malignant transformation.In an effort to elucidate the poorly understood role of polyamines in cell differentiation and development, we have focused our attention on F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells, which can be induced to differentiate in a controlled manner in culture, and which provide a model system for studying early events in mammalian development. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is a well-known inducer of F9 cell differentiation (17Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Less attention has been payed to the fact that F9 cells also differentiate into a parietal endoderm-like phenotype when inhibited in their ODC activity by treatment with the highly specific suicide inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (18Oredsson S.M. Billgren M. Heby O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schindler J. Kelly M. McCann P.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). That the differentiative effect is indeed due to polyamine depletion is shown by the fact that supplementation of putrescine (the product in the ODC-catalyzed reaction) within the first 2-4 days of DFMO treatment prevents the expression of the differentiated phenotype (18Oredsson S.M. Billgren M. Heby O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to the possibility that the polyamines themselves are important regulators of differentiation, there is another possible explanation for the DFMO-induced F9 teratocarcinoma stem cell differentiation. A state of putrescine and spermidine depletion implies that the cells have no acceptor molecules for the aminopropyl group that is normally transferred from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) in the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by spermidine synthase and spermine synthase (Fig. 1). Therefore, and because of feedback regulation of AdoMetDC by polyamines (1Heby O. Persson L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 153-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 20Persson L. Stjernborg L. Holm I. Heby O. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), there may be a several thousandfold increase in the dcAdoMet content in DFMO-treated cells (23Mamont P.S. Danzin C. Wagner J. Siat M. Joder-Ohlenbusch A.-M. Claverie N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Pegg A.E. Pösö H. Shuttleworth K. Bennett R.A. Biochem.

In this context it should be emphasized that dcAdoMet does not act as a methyl group donor, but as a competitive inhibitor, in DNA methyltransferase (MTase)-catalyzed reactions (26Heby O. Persson L. Smith S.S. Zappia V. Pegg A.E. Progress in Polyamine Research. Plenum Press, New York1988: 291-299Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2001150659,"The genomic organization and expression of the hsp70 genes of Leishmania infantum were examined. In the cluster there are at least six copies of the hsp70 genes arranged in a head-to-tail tandem of 3.8-kilobase repetition units. The hsp70 gene copy (gene 6) located at the 3′ end of the tandem has a 3′-untranslated region highly divergent in sequence relative to the 3′-untranslated region of the rest of hsp70 gene copies (genes 1-5). Nuclease S1 protection assays indicated that the steady-state level of the mRNAs derived from gene 6 is about 50-fold more abundant than the transcript level derived from genes 1-5. Nuclear run-on assays showed, however, that all hsp70 genes are transcribed at similar rates. Thus, it is likely that the differences in the steady-state levels of the transcripts from the hsp70 genes should be associated with variations in their processing or maturation rates. While the abundance of the mRNAs derived from hsp70 genes 1-5 is increased by heat shock, the hsp70 gene 6 mRNA level remains unaffected. Our data showed that ongoing protein synthesis is required for the maintenance of the heat inducement, depicting, thus, a post-transcriptional mechanism of positive regulation involving a labile protein factor that would be either induced or activated during heat shock."

Immunoblot analyses were performed with specific antibody against BCL-2, BCL-XS/L, BAX, JUNB, c-JUN, ICH-1L, c-FOS, RB, CDK-2, and p53. H-7 treatment did not significantly alter the level of these proteins with the exception of p53. H-7, but not staurosporine, caused a dramatic nuclear accumulation of p53. The kinetics of nuclear accumulation of p53 correlates well with the kinetics of induction of apoptosis. The effect of H-7 was further assessed in a group of human cell lines. Only cell lines harboring the wild-type p53 gene were responsive to the stimulatory effect of H-7 on nuclear accumulation of p53. Furthermore, cell lines carrying a mutated p53 gene were resistant to the cytotoxic effect of H-7. The ability of H-7 in mediating apoptosis in the SH-SY5Y line expressing a dominant negative mutant of p53 was significantly diminished.

It catalyzes the conversion of IMP to XMP at the purine metabolic branch point and provides sufficient guanine nucleotides for important cellular processes. The observations that the activity of IMPDH is tightly linked with both cellular proliferation and transformation (1Jackson R.C. Weber G.

The specific reversibility by exogenous guanine of the biologic effects of IMPDH inhibitors on cell division and differentiation is a unique feature of such compounds that differentiates them from other inducers of cellular differentiation. IMPDH inhibitors have also been demonstrated to have considerable efficacy as immunosuppressive agents (10Kokado Y. Ishibashi M. Jiang H. Takahara S. Sonoda T. Transplant.

Human IMPDH activity is composed of the activities of two separate but very closely related IMPDH isoenzymes, termed type I and type II, that are encoded by separate genes located on chromosomes 7 and 3, respectively (14Gu J.J.

The two IMPDH proteins are tetrameric and are indistinguishable in their catalytic activities, substrate affinities, and Ki values for known inhibitors (18Konno Y. Natsumeda Y. Nagai M. Yamaji Y.

Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The increased IMPDH activity observed in replicating or neoplastic cells is largely due to increased expression of the type II IMPDH mRNA, whereas expression of the type I mRNA has been thought to be relatively unchanged by cell proliferation or transformation (21Nagai M. Natsumeda Y. Konno Y. Hoffman R. Irino S. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3886-3890PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nagai M. Natsumeda Y. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 258-261PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, type II mRNA levels are sharply decreased in response to the induction of cell differentiation, whereas type I mRNA remains constitutively expressed (22Nagai M. Natsumeda Y. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 258-261PubMed Google Scholar). A survey of relative IMPDH mRNA levels in human tissues demonstrated significant differences in the pattern of distribution of the type I transcript, with relatively high levels in kidney, pancreas, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes as well as in fetal heart, brain, and kidney (23Senda M. Natsumeda Y. Life Sci. 1994; 54: 1917-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expression levels of the type II transcript, while generally higher than type I, were far less variable in different tissue types. These data support the concept that the two genes are regulated differently in resting, proliferating, and neoplastic cells and that these differences may have important consequences for cellular function. In view of the important role of IMPDH activity in the immune response, we have previously studied IMPDH type I and II expression during T lymphocyte activation and documented that IMPDH type I mRNA levels increase approximately 10-fold in response to a variety of stimuli. In addition, T cell activation results in the appearance of two distinct type I mRNA transcripts, the larger of which is not readily appreciated in Northern blots of RNA from other cell types (24Dayton J.S. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mitchell B.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 984-991PubMed Google Scholar). This heterogeneity in IMPDH type I expression has led us to characterize the IMPDH type I gene and compare it with the recently analyzed IMPDH type II gene (25Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the goal of elucidating possible mechanisms involved in the tissue-specific expression of the IMPDH type I gene. The cloning of the IMPDH type I gene was complicated by the presence in the human genome of multiple processed pseudogenes (26Dayton J.S. Mitchell B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To obtain IMPDH I genomic clones, a human leukocyte genomic library in the λ phage FIX II vector (provided by Dr. J. Lowe, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) was sequentially screened using oligonucleotides complimentary to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the type I cDNA (17Natsumeda Y. Ohno S. Kawasaki H. Konno Y. Weber G. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5292-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two positive clones were isolated from the approximately 1.8 × 106 plaques screened. Clone 1111a was obtained by sequential hybridization to three oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′-UTR of the cDNA (bp −85 to −108, −523 to −546 and −448 to −471, relative to the ATG). Clone 1711a was obtained using two oligonucleotides corresponding to the 3′-UTR (bp 1614-1637 and 2119-2142). The identity of each clone was confirmed by hybridization with the cDNA of the entire coding region. The probes were either end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) or labeled using a random primer labeling kit (Promega) with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) to a specific activity of 5-10 × 108 cpm/μg. Hybridizations were performed in a 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 5.8% NaCl solution at 60°C for 16-24 h, and the blots were washed twice with 1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, and once at 50-55°C for 30 min for oligonucleotide probes. Hybridization using the cDNA probe was performed at 65°C and with a final wash in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. Both clones were digested with the restriction endonuclease SacI and the resulting fragments subcloned into pGEM7Zf(+) vector. Mapping of the gene was performed using Southern blot and PCR analysis. The entire coding region and all exon-intron boundaries were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar) and Sequenase 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). For the promoter regions, both automated double-stranded sequencing and sequencing of single-stranded DNA were performed in regions with high GC content. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRI-reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). Total cellular RNA (15 or 20 μg) was electrophoresed on 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gels and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad). Prehybridizations were performed in 1% SDS, 0.1 M NaCl for 1 h at room temperature. Hybridizations were carried out in high efficiency hybridization solution containing 50% formamide (MRC) with 32P-labeled probe at 2-3 × 106 cpm/ml at 42°C for 24-48 h. Oligonucleotide probes were washed in 1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at 50°C for 30 min, the p190 probe was washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50-60°C for 30 min, and the p700 and 1.5-kb cDNA probes were washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated from buffy coats obtained from the American Red Cross (Charlotte, NC) using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) gradient centrifugation. Monocytes and macrophages were removed using the adherence method (28Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W.(eds) Current Protocols in Immunology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 7.1.3Google Scholar). Purified PBLs were incubated at a concentration of 1.5 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 250 ng/ml of ionomycin (Calbiochem). The extent of lymphocyte activation was monitored by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA at 24 and 48 h of activation. An oligonucleotide primer complimentary to bases 73-99 in exon 1 was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Probe (1 × 105 cpm) was mixed with 20 μg of total RNA from Jurkat and Raji cells or tRNA as a control and precipitated. Annealing was performed in 20 μl of 1 × avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcription buffer (Promega) and incubated sequentially at 75°C for 15 min and 60°C for 30 min and slowly cooled to 40°C. Extension was performed in the presence of 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), 1 mM dNTPs, and 10 units of RNasin (Promega) at 42°C for 90 min. The mixture was then digested with 20 μg/ml DNase-free RNase (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37°C for 20 min followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resulting products were resuspended in 5 μl of gel loading buffer, and 3 μl was analyzed on a denaturing 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed at −70°C for 2 days. A pGEM-320 construct, containing genomic DNA extending 280 bp upstream and 45 bp downstream of the ATG translation initiation site was used for RNase protection assays using the Ribonuclease Protection Assay kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The construct was digested with the restriction endonuclease BglI, generating a 1.6-kb fragment containing the SP6 promoter and 115 bp 5′ to the ATG initiation codon. This fragment was gel-purified and transcribed in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) to generate a [32P]CTP-labeled 235-bp antisense RNA probe. The labeled probe (5 × 105 cpm) was added to 30 μg of total RNA from Jurkat and Raji cells and 30 μg of tRNA, and ethanol-precipitated. Hybridizations were performed in 20 μl of hybridization buffer at 45°C for 20 h, and samples were digested with a RNase A and T mixture (1:100 dilution) at 37°C for 30 min and precipitated in the presence of 2 μg of tRNA. The pellets were resuspended in 5 μl of gel loading buffer, and 3 μl was analyzed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The P1 and the P2 promoter regions were obtained by PCR using the following primers: 32F (5′-TGTAATCCCAGCATTTTGGGA-3′) and 33R (5′-GCTCTGTCGCCCAGGCTGGAGT-3′) for the P1 region; 7F (5′-TTCTTTCCAGTCCCACCCGTGTAG-3′) and 18R (5′-TGGCGTTTCGGGAAGTTA-3′) for the P2 region (see Fig. 3). The amplified regions were cloned into the PCR™ II vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and subcloned into the HindIII site of the pCAT-Basic vector (pCATB) in 5′→ 3′ orientation upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Fragments of 0.4, 0.7, 1.4, and 2.7 kb 5′ to exon 1 were isolated by restriction enzyme digestions, as indicated in Fig. 6, gel-purified, and subcloned into the SalI site of pCATB. The pCATB/0.7 construct is designated as P3. The orientation of each construct was verified by direct sequencing.Fig. 6Delineation of P3 promoter activity in deletion constructs. Jurkat (A) and Raji (B) cells were transfected with CAT constructs containing regions 0.4, 0.7, 1.4, and 2.7 kb 5′ to the ATG, as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” CAT activity is expressed relative to the value obtained with the pCATB/0.7 construct, which has been set as 100. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Plasmid DNA used for transfection experiments was prepared using QIAGEN columns (Chatsworth, CA), and the DNA was quantitated by both spectrophotometry and ethidium bromide staining. To determine the transcriptional activity of the putative promoters, 20 μg of each construct was added to 107 exponentially growing Jurkat or Raji lymphoblasts in a total volume of 500 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Electroporations were performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 250 V and 960 microfarads. Cells were plated in 20 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin and cultured for 44-48 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2. A β-galactosidase plasmid under control of the β-actin promoter (pβAc-lacZ) (kindly provided by Lorraine Gudas, Cornell University) was used in each experiment to control for transfection efficiency. After harvesting, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in 150 μl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with three cycles of freeze-thawing. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were used for protein quantitation using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) and for assay of β-galactosidase activity by a modification of a published technique (29Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar) using chlorophenolred β-D-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) as a substrate. For CAT assays, aliquots of supernatant were heated at 60°C for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and 50 μl of supernatant were then incubated with 0.125 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham) and 25 μg of n-butyryl coenzyme A (Sigma) for 2-6 h, depending on the transfection efficiency of each experiment. Reactions were extracted with xylenes and counted in a Beckman scintillation counter (model LS 7800; Beckman, Irvine, CA). CAT activity was normalized for extract protein concentration and calculated as cpm/mg/min of assay. Two phage clones (1111a (14 kb) and 1711a (13 kb)) were isolated that overlap by 3.6 kb in the intragenic region and extend approximately 6.3 kb 5′ and 4.7 kb 3′ from the ends of the coding region. A physical map of the gene was established using a combination of restriction mapping, PCR, and sequence analysis of the two genomic clones (Fig. 1). The entire IMPDH type I gene is approximately 18 kb in length. According to the published cDNA sequence (17Natsumeda Y. Ohno S. Kawasaki H. Konno Y. Weber G. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5292-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 5′-UTR is composed of 600 bp, which we have designated as exons A-C in Fig. 1. Exon A′ is the region between exon A and an upstream transcription initiation site described below. The coding region of the gene contains 14 exons, the last of which includes 713 bp of 3′-UTR. All exon-intron boundaries contain the canonical splice donor (AG) and acceptor (GT) consensus sequences, with the exception of a GC splice acceptor site at exon 4. Within the coding region, 16 bases differ from the published cDNA sequence (17Natsumeda Y. Ohno S. Kawasaki H. Konno Y. Weber G. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5292-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Six of these base changes result in amino acid differences: bp 86 (A → G; aspartic acid → glycine); 327 (C → G; asparagine → lysine); 819 (C → G; phenylalanine → leucine); 820 (C → G; histidine → aspartic acid); 1255 (C → G; proline → alanine); and 1489 (C → G; proline → alanine). The type I gene is significantly larger than the 5.8-kb type II gene (25Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Table I, the exons of the coding region are identical in size and contain the same amino acids at each exon boundary with the exception of an isoleucine → valine substitution at the exon 5/6 boundary. The type I gene contains substantially larger introns, seven of which are over 1 kb in length, and has approximately 1.3 kb of 5′-UTR and 713 bp of 3′-UTR, as compared with 50 and 53 bp in the type II gene, respectively (16Collart F.R. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15769-15772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, nine ATG codons are present in the 5′-UTR of the type I gene.Table IComparison of exon and intron sizes for the IMPDH type I and II genesExonsA + A′BC1234567891011121314IMPDH type I∼1200446499491027520788200919614414514484735IMPDH type II14849102752078820091961441451448475IntronsABC12345678910111213IMPDH type I26588∼3200∼2000∼2300137278149∼1500∼1400236∼13009428893∼1200IMPDH type II445225107327657737799106583948089 Open table in a new tab Previous studies have demonstrated two IMPDH type I mRNA species of approximately 3 and 4 kb on Northern blot analysis of RNA from peripheral blood T lymphocytes (24Dayton J.S. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mitchell B.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 984-991PubMed Google Scholar). RNase protection assays suggested that the larger mRNA species of 4 kb contained additional 5′ or 3′ sequences, since the coding regions of both mRNA species were identical. In order to determine the composition of these mRNAs, Northern blot hybridization was performed on total cellular RNA isolated from resting or activated human PBLs using probes corresponding to different exons. Using a cDNA probe corresponding to the coding region (exons 1-14), the expression of both a 4- and a 2.5-kb RNA species, as accurately assessed using RNA markers, was markedly induced as a result of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin treatment of PBLs (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). When a 700-bp probe encompassing 500 bp in exon A′ and 200 bp in exon A (p700; Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4) and a 190-bp probe spanning the region from exon B to exon C (p190; Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6) were used as probes, only the 4-kb mRNA was observed, indicating that this mRNA species originates upstream of the 2.5-kb mRNA and contains a significantly longer 5′-UTR. In contrast, both mRNA species were readily detected by two oligonucleotides derived from exon 1 sequence (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). Northern blot analysis was also performed on total cellular RNA isolated from nine tumor or transformed cell lines: an erythroleukemia line, K562; a monocytic leukemia line, U937; three T cell leukemia cell lines, KT-1, MOLT-4, and Jurkat; three B lymphoblast cell lines, MGL-8, Nalm-6, and Raji; and a lung cancer cell line, H1437 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-9). Upon hybridization with the p190 probe, as shown in Fig. 2B, a third RNA species of approximately 2.7 kb was detected with relatively high abundance in U937, Jurkat, and H1437 cells but was absent in MGL-8 and Raji cells, as well as in PBLs. In order to confirm that this 2.7-kb band is not identical to the major 2.5-kb mRNA transcript, the blot was rehybridized with the 1.5-kb cDNA coding region probe. As shown in Fig. 2C, all of the cell lines demonstrated an abundant 2.5-kb transcript, with U937 and Raji cells having the highest level of expression after normalized for 28 S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 2D). These results clearly indicate the existence of three IMPDH type I RNA transcripts that differ at their 5′ termini. To study the elements involved in the regulation of IMPDH type I transcription, approximately 2.7 kb 5′ of exon C and 700 bp 5′ of exon 1 were sequenced. Three regions were identified as putative promoter regions based on sequence analysis; each contains a number of putative transcription factor binding sites, and we have designated them as P1, P2, and P3, respectively (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3A, the P1 region encompasses 245 bp, as defined by PCR primers 32F and 33R, is located immediately 5′ to exon A′, and includes five Sp1 and two AP2 sites, one serum response element site, one NFκB site that overlaps with a SIF consensus binding sequences, and one ELP site. There is no TATA box in this region, although a consensus sequence for transcription factor IID is present. Of interest is the fact that this sequence is 95% identical to the catarrhine-specific (CS) Alu repetitive sequence found widely throughout the genome (30Shen M.R. Batzer M.A. Deininger P.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 33: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), although the consensus Alu sequence does not function as a promoter in similar transfection experiments (data not shown). A highly AT-rich region of 52 bp, containing four AAAAT repeats plus stretches of A nucleotides separated by a single T or C is located 3′ to the P1 element. Primer extension analysis using RNA from both resting and activated PBLs demonstrated two possible transcription initiation sites downstream of the P1 promoter, as indicated in Fig. 3A Ribonuclease protection analysis detected a single band corresponding to the more 3′ initiation site, although the absence of a longer protected fragment could have resulted from nonspecific cleavage by RNase A of the A-rich sequence (data not shown). The P2 region (Fig. 3B), 595 bp in length, is located 118 bp 5′ to exon B, and contains 73% G + C residues, a number of Sp1 and AP2 binding sites, a PuF consensus binding site, and an Ets-1 consensus binding site. A putative transcription initiation site located 134 bp 5′ to exon B was determined by primer extension analysis using a primer located in exon C. The P3 region (Fig. 3C), 671 bp in length, is located immediately 5′ to exon 1 and also has a high G + C content of 73%. This region contains, in addition to a number of potential Sp1 and AP2 binding sites, three Egr-1 sites (two of them overlapping with Egr-2 sites), three PuF, two serum response elements, and a site for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), a cAMP-response element (CRE), and a CCAAT binding site. Primer extension was performed using total RNA isolated from Jurkat and Raji cell lines and an oligonucleotide corresponding to the exon 1 region. Two transcription initiation sites were identified 40 bp (major) and 24 bp (minor) 5′ to the ATG initiation codon (Fig. 4A), and these results were confirmed by a ribonuclease protection assay in which two corresponding protected fragments were detected using RNA from Jurkat and Raji cells but not with the tRNA control (Fig. 4B). The greater intensity of the primer-extended bands and RNase-protected bands in Raji cells is consistent with the higher levels of the 2.5-kb mRNA in this cell line (Fig. 2C). Functional studies of the P1, P2, and P3 regions were performed using transient transfection assays with CAT reporter gene constructs (Fig. 5). In both Jurkat and Raji cell lines, the activity of the P3 region is greater than that of the P1 and P2 regions. In the Jurkat T cells, constructs containing P1 or P2 result in an approximate 20-fold increase in CAT activity over the values obtained with the pCATB vector alone. In the Raji B cell line, in contrast, the P1 and P2 constructs resulted in a 1.2-6-fold increase in CAT activity, although P3 retained a level of promoter activity equivalent to that found in Jurkat cells. In order to define the P3 promoter region further, additional constructs containing variable regions 5′ to exon 1 were compared for their ability to promote transcription in Jurkat and Raji cells (Fig. 6). In Jurkat cells (Fig. 6A), the construct pCATB/0.7, containing a 671-bp ApaI-NotI fragment of P3, had the strongest promoter activity, while the activity of construct pCATB/2.7, containing additional 5′ sequences, is only about 15-20% that of the pCATB/0.7 construct. This profile differs markedly from that in Raji cells (Fig. 6B), where pCATB/2.7 has approximately 6-fold higher promoter activity than the pCATB/0.7 construct. These results strongly suggest that there are elements 5′ to the P3 region that may regulate transcription from this promoter in a cell type-specific fashion. Transcriptional activity from the P3 element (pCATB/0.7) was compared with that from the 461-bp promoter for the IMPDH type II gene (25Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CAT activity obtained with the type II promoter was 70-fold greater than that with the P3 promoter in both Jurkat and Raji cells (data not shown). This result is consistent with the observation that the expression of the type II IMPDH gene at the mRNA level is significantly higher than that of the type I gene in most tissues and cell lines tested (23Senda M. Natsumeda Y. Life Sci. 1994; 54: 19"

Our strategy involved overexpression of putative mitochondrial transporter genes, selected based on analysis of the yeast genome, followed by purification and functional reconstitution of the resulting protein products.

INTRODUCTIONInsect molting and metamorphosis are elicited by a class of steroid hormones, ecdysteroids, originating in the prothoracic gland (1Gilbert L.I. Combest W.L. Smith W.A. Meller V.H.

These glands are stimulated by a brain neuropeptide, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), 1The abbreviations used are: PTTHprothoracicotropic hormonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. that acts via a cascade that includes a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP, activation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and ultimate phosphorylation of S6, a protein of the ribosomal 40 S subunit (1Gilbert L.I.

Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Arch. Insect Biochem.

BioEssays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Temporal analysis of PTTH-stimulated S6 phosphorylation showed that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of S6 closely paralleled the increase and decrease in PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis (4Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the multiple phosphorylation of S6 was inhibited completely by rapamycin, an inhibitor of S6 phosphorylation (7Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 8Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R.

Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data indicate that S6 phosphorylation is required for both specific protein synthesis and ecdysteroidogenesis in PTTH-stimulated glands.Ribosomal protein S6 is the major substrate for several protein kinases in the eukaryotic ribosome, and it may have an important role in controlling cell growth and proliferation through the selective translation of particular classes of mRNA (6Stewart M.J. Thomas G. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although steroidogenic tissues such as the insect prothoracic glands do not respond to hormonal stimulation by cell proliferation, steroidogenesis in some mammalian tissues appears to require the rapid synthesis of relatively short-lived proteins (9Garren L.D. Ney R.L. Davis W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which in turn aid in the transit of cholesterol into the mitochondria for the synthesis of steroids (10Orme-Johnson N.R. Biochim.

These observations suggest that S6 phosphorylation resulting from PTTH stimulation may be critical in regulating the synthesis of these proteins that are required for ecdysteroid biosynthesis, and this has led us to investigate further the relationships between S6 phosphorylation and ecdysteroidogenesis.DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation of the S6 protein in the 40 S ribosomal subunit is a critical event in the initiation of cell growth and proliferation and is well conserved among eukaryotic organisms (6Stewart M.J. Thomas G. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA encoding the Manduca prothoracic gland S6 has been cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparisons between Manduca and other species, ranging from yeast to invertebrate to vertebrate, revealed that the key elements required for S6 function are well conserved (Fig. 2). All four copies of the 10-amino acid motif postulated to be a nuclear localization signal (26Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2891-2896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a consensus recognition sequence for the mitogen-activated p70s6k, and five phosphorylatable serines in the carboxyl-terminal region (30Ferrari S. Bandi H.R. Hofsteenge J. Bussian B.M. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22770-22775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are well conserved among eukaryotic species, whereas the yeast S6 has only two serines in that region. The number of basic and acidic residues is almost identical in all species compared, a biochemical characteristic of this very basic ribosomal protein. A striking observation is that both the number (3Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the position (12, 83, and 100) of the cysteine residues are identical in the S6 of the five species listed in Fig. 2. Phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 3) revealed that S6 phosphorylation is limited to seryl residues, a result consistent with that reported in mammalian systems (32Krieg J. Hofsteenge J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11473-11477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bandi H.R. Ferrari S. Krieg J. Meyer H.E. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4530-4533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wettenhall R.E.H. Morgan F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2084-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact positions of the five phosphoseryl residues of Manduca S6 have not yet been identified, but they are presumably located within the carboxyl-terminal 17 amino acids of S6 (32Krieg J. Hofsteenge J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11473-11477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bandi H.R. Ferrari S. Krieg J. Meyer H.E. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4530-4533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results, along with our previous data, demonstrate that PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis is associated with the increased phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 at seryl residues.However, the sequences differ significantly in the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule and typify a specific group of organisms, i.e. yeast versus invertebrates versus vertebrates. This region of S6 revealed 66.7 and 67.2% of the total amino acid substitutions in the primary structure of the deduced protein between Manduca and Drosophila and between Manduca and human, respectively. Although the amino acid sequence differences between Manduca and yeast are more evenly distributed, 56.2% of the substitutions are located within the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. In addition, Manduca S6 contains only six serine residues at the carboxyl terminus portion rather than the seven occurring in more evolutionarily advanced species such as the fruit fly, rat, and human S6, but there are four more serines than was found in the S6 of more primitive species, e.g. yeast.With the cloned S6 cDNA probe (Fig. 1) and specific S6 antibody (Fig. 4, Fig. 5) in hand, we investigated the possible correlation between S6 expression and ecdysteroid biosynthesis, the latter requiring specific protein synthesis (3Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Rybczynski R. Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The small increase in the larval hemolymph ecdysteroid titer at V3 is responsible for cellular reprogramming, whereas the major surge in the larval hemolymph ecdysteroid titer takes place at about stage V7 and is responsible for initiating the larval-pupal molt (38Bollenbacher W.E. Vedeckis W.V. Gilbert L.I. O'Connor J.D. Dev. Biol. 1975; 44: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The peak at P3 elicits pupal-adult development (36Warren J.T. Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 65-82Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, the latter two dramatic increases in the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer are responsible for the two metamorphic molts of this insect. Northern blot analysis revealed that transcriptional expression of S6 through larval and early pupal-adult development was not correlated with the ecdysteroid titer, i.e. the S6 mRNA signal was at its lowest level at stages V7-V8 and P3-P4 (Fig. 6). However, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the quantity of S6 gene product peaked at stages V6-V7 and P3-P4 in concert with the peaks in the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer (Fig. 7). The rapid decline in S6 mRNA (Fig. 6) accompanied the rapid increase in the level of S6 protein at the times that the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer peaked, suggesting that the increase in S6 results from increased translation, and that more ribosomal S6 protein is required at these stages, perhaps to facilitate the synthesis of specific proteins (enzymes?) required for ecdysteroidogenesis. Although direct evidence for a specific role of S6 in protein synthesis and ecdysteroidogenesis is not yet available for the Manduca prothoracic gland, in mammalian cells, following activation of the cells by mitogens, mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (including S6) and elongation factors are shifted from nonactive ribosomes to the active polysome fraction within 30 min and synthesis of specific proteins begins prior to the general increase in protein synthesis (39Nielsen P.J. Duncan R. McConkey E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Our previous in vitro studies showed that high levels of S6 phosphorylation are closely associated with increased rates of protein and ecdysteroid synthesis and that inhibition of S6 phosphorylation by rapamycin resulted in the inhibition of specific protein synthesis and subsequent ecdysteroid synthesis (3Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The present data (Fig. 8) revealed that the multiple phosphorylation of S6 occurred in vivo as well in concert with the increase in hemolymph ecdysteroidogenesis at all three critical periods of development, i.e. V3, V6, and P3, and therefore, with the release of endogenous PTTH. The data therefore indicate that the release of PTTH in vivo initiates S6 phosphorylation, which in turn elicits specific protein synthesis and subsequent ecdysteroidogenesis. Studies in other biological systems have also shown a correlation between a high level of S6 phosphorylation and an increase in protein synthesis, one of the earliest events required for cell growth and proliferation (6Stewart M.J. Thomas G. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). S6 phosphorylation is an event that is believed to facilitate the movement of inactive 80 S ribosomes into actively translating polysomes (39Nielsen P.J. Duncan R. McConkey E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), increase translational efficiency (40Burkhard S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14003-14008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), selectively translate protein (41Thomas G. Thomas G. Luther H. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5712-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and regulate a specific class of messages with a polypyrimidine tract at their 5′ cap site (42Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4367-4372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recent studies also suggest that S6 may play a role in the up-regulation of ribosome biogenesis (6Stewart M.J. Thomas G. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and in controlling tumor production in Drosophila (23Stewart M.J. Denell R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 1041-1047PubMed Google Scholar, 25Watson K.L. Konrad K.D. Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11302-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is possible that the increased levels of S6 protein expression that correlate with the peaks of hemolymph ecdysteroids may not only facilitate specific protein synthesis required for ecdysteroidogenesis but may also be involved in the feedback regulation of ecdysteroid synthesis. Thus, S6 not only participates in “housekeeping” roles but may be critically involved in the control of insect growth, molting, and metamorphosis. INTRODUCTIONInsect molting and metamorphosis are elicited by a class of steroid hormones, ecdysteroids, originating in the prothoracic gland (1Gilbert L.I. Combest W.L. Smith W.A. Meller V.H. Rountree D.B. BioEssays. 1988; 8: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Gilbert L.I. Rybczynski R. Tobe S.S. Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Metamorphosis. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 60-98Google Scholar). These glands are stimulated by a brain neuropeptide, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), 1The abbreviations used are: PTTHprothoracicotropic hormonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. that acts via a cascade that includes a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP, activation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and ultimate phosphorylation of S6, a protein of the ribosomal 40 S subunit (1Gilbert L.I. Combest W.L. Smith W.A. Meller V.H. Rountree D.B. BioEssays. 1988; 8: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Gilbert L.I. Rybczynski R. Tobe S.S. Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G.

Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Previous studies demonstrated that S6 in the prothoracic glands of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, was phosphorylated at up to five sites under PTTH stimulation (4Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 31: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a phenomenon typical of S6 phosphorylation in mammals (6Stewart M.J. Thomas G. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Temporal analysis of PTTH-stimulated S6 phosphorylation showed that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of S6 closely paralleled the increase and decrease in PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis (4Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the multiple phosphorylation of S6 was inhibited completely by rapamycin, an inhibitor of S6 phosphorylation (7Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 8Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), resulting in the inhibition of PTTH-stimulated specific protein synthesis and subsequent ecdysteroidogenesis (4Song Q. Gilbert L.I. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data indicate that S6 phosphorylation is required for both specific protein synthesis and ecdysteroidogenesis in PTTH-stimulated glands.Ribosomal protein S6 is the major substrate for several protein kinases in the eukaryotic ribosome, and it may have an important role in controlling cell growth and proliferation through the selective translation of particular classes of mRNA (6Stewart M.J. Thomas G. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although steroidogenic tissues such as the insect prothoracic glands do not respond to hormonal stimulation by cell proliferation, steroidogenesis in some mammalian tissues appears to require the rapid synthesis of relatively short-lived proteins (9Garren L.D. Ney R.L. Davis W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which in turn aid in the transit of cholesterol into the mitochondria for the synthesis of steroids (10Orme-Johnson N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 213-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Whitehouse B.J. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 134: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In insects, RNA and protein synthesis are required for the full response of the prothoracic glands to PTTH (12Smith W.A. Rountree D.B. Bollenbacher W.E. Gilbert L.I. Borkovec A. Gelman D.

These observations suggest that S6 phosphorylation resulting from PTTH stimulation may be critical in regulating the synthesis of these proteins that are required for ecdysteroid biosynthesis, and this has led us to investigate further the relationships between S6 phosphorylation and ecdysteroidogenesis."

Significant increase in the activity of JNK1 was observed within 30 min following IL-3 or GM-CSF stimulation at physiological concentrations. Dominant-negative Ras(S17N), which is conditionally expressed in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside in BaF3-N6 cells, prevented the IL-3 stimulation of JNK1, whereas anisomycin-induced JNK1 activation was unaffected. Furthermore, a deletion mutant of the common β subunit for IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors that consists of only the membrane-proximal region, including box 1 and box 2 motifs, was incapable of facilitating JNK1 activity as well as Ras activation. These results provide evidence that Ras is required for IL-3-stimulated JNK1 activation. We also examined if constitutively active Ras(G12V) alone could stimulate JNK1 activity by using the inducible expression system. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside induction of Ras(G12V) in the BaF3-V2 cell line caused no significant increase in JNK1 activity, which could be activated by IL-3 or anisomycin. On the contrary, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was fully activated following Ras(G12V) induction. Together with these results, it seems likely that the Ras protein is indispensable for the IL-3 stimulation of JNK1 although Ras activation by itself is insufficient for JNK1 activation.

Here gel mobility and antibody supershift assays were used to relate changes in the components of E2F DNA binding complexes in cell extracts to repression and induction of dhfr gene expression.

INTRODUCTIONThe G1 to S phase transition requires the periodic expression of several genes whose products are involved in nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA replication. Of these genes, one of the most extensively characterized is dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), 1The abbreviations used are: dhfrdihydrofolate reductasebpbase pairFBSfetal bovine serum. an enzyme essential for de novo synthesis of glycine, purines, and thymidylate. In mammalian cells, dhfr message levels are low during quiescence, increase throughout G1 and peak during late G1 or early S phase (1Farnham P.J. Schimke R.T. J. Biol.

Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 19-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This unique promoter arrangement is highly conserved among humans, hamsters, and mice. Approximately 90% of dhfr transcripts originate from the 3′ (or major) promoter while the remaining 10% are generated from the 5′ (or minor) promoter (8Masters J.N. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar–10Smith M.L. Mitchell P.J. Crouse G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6003-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The major promoter contains several elements involved in regulating transcription, including four consensus Sp1 binding sites, two structural control elements which may act as transcriptional repressors (11Pierce A.J.

Similarly, a single E2F site was shown to be sufficient to confer growth regulated promoter activity on a luciferase reporter gene in the absence of other regulatory elements (13Slansky J.E. Li Y.

Although the importance of the overlapping E2F binding sites in regulating dhfr transcription has been well documented, relatively little is known about which specific E2F protein complexes bind to these sites.E2F is a family of closely related heterodimeric transcription factors that is capable of forming a variety of DNA binding protein complexes that include important cell cycle regulators. High affinity DNA binding and efficient transcriptional activation by E2F requires heterodimerization of one E2F-like protein with one DP-like protein (15Helin K. Wu C.-L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A.

Characterization of E2F-1, −4, and −5 has revealed that the transactivation domains of these proteins are masked by pocket protein binding domains, suggesting that pRB family proteins inhibit E2F-dependent transactivation through direct protein-protein interactions (21Shan B.

A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). As cells pass through the G1 to S phase transition, pRB becomes phosphorylated and dissociates from E2F, thereby releasing “free” E2F that is capable of activating transcription (48Chellappan S.P.

Similarly, E2F-p130 complexes are prominent during G0 but disappear upon entry into the cell cycle (27Hijmans E.M. Voorhoeve P.M. Beijersbergen R.L. van't Veer L.J. Bernards R. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, E2F-p107 complexes are present throughout the cell cycle but contain different cyclin-Cdk partners. During the transition from G1 to S phase, cyclin E/Cdk2 bound to p107 is replaced by cyclin A/Cdk2 (33Cao L. Faha B. Dembski M. Tsai L.H. Harlow E. Dyson N.

Science. 1992; 255: 1144-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Previously we used a high resolution genomic footprinting technique to show that the nuclease protection patterns of each of the overlapping E2F sites at the dhfr gene promoter behave differently during the mid G1 to S phase transition (54Wells J. Held P. Illenye S. Heintz N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The nuclease protection pattern of the E2F site on the transcribed DNA strand remained invariant, whereas changes in the cleavage pattern across the E2F site on the nontranscribed strand correlated with induction of dhfr transcription. In the dhfr gene promoter the two overlapping and inverted E2F sites are not identical; one site has the sequence TTTCGCGC while the other site has the sequence TTTGGCGC. We refer to these sites as the CG and GG sites, respectively. Initial gel shift analysis with probes containing only one or the other of the two overlapping E2F sites showed that protein binding to each of the two sites was not equivalent (54Wells J. Held P. Illenye S. Heintz N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).To further our understanding of the relationship between E2F DNA binding activity and regulation of dhfr gene expression, we have used a panel of antibodies to identify the components of at least five distinct protein complexes that bind to the overlapping E2F sites. In the presence of both binding sites, E2F-2 preferentially bound to the GG site while E2F-4 was the predominant CG binding activity, suggesting that different E2F complexes recognize the individual binding sites in a sequence-specific manner. In synchronized cells entrance into S phase was preceded by the loss of an E2F-4·DP-1·p130 complex and accompanied by increases in the abundance of two free E2F complexes, one containing DP-1 and E2F-4 and the second containing DP-1 and an unidentified component. Our results support a model in which induction of dhfr gene expression in serum response experiments is the result of two separate processes, relief of p130-mediated repression and subsequent activation of transcription through free E2F.DISCUSSIONE2F DNA binding activity can be attributed to the collective activities of multiple heterodimeric complexes, each containing one E2F-like subunit and one DP-like subunit. E2F activity, in turn, is regulated through association with the pRB family of pocket proteins, by direct or indirect interactions with Cdk 2 and cyclins A and E, and by phosphorylation. In an effort to determine which E2F species may participate in the regulation of dhfr gene expression, we first used gel mobility shift and antibody supershift assays to identify the constituents of at least five distinct protein complexes which bind to the conserved overlapping E2F sites found in the dhfr promoters of hamsters, humans, and mice. Because polyclonal antibodies were added to extract prior to the addition of probe, and may react with portions of E2F complexes involved in DNA binding, we considered both disruption and supershifts of specific complexes as evidence that a complex harbored the antigen in question. Once the constituents of the hamster complexes were identified, we examined their DNA binding activity and documented changes in specific forms of E2F DNA binding activity to induction of dhfr message levels during the G1 to S phase transition.DNA Binding Preferences of Hamster E2F Complexes That Contain E2F-2 and E2F-4Almost all of the detectable dhfr E2F DNA binding activity in extracts from asynchronously growing CHOC 400 cells was attributable to complexes containing two E2F species, E2F-2 and E2F-4. All of the E2F DNA binding complexes in CHOC 400 cells contained DP-1 as the E2F heterodimeric partner. In context of the native flanking sequences of the dhfr promoter, complexes containing E2F-2·DP-1 preferentially bound to the GG site, whereas complexes containing E2F-4·DP-1 were the predominant CG site binding activity. The preference of complex E for the GG binding site was revealed by competition studies using the 2-site oligonucleotide as probe and the CG site as competitor or by examining binding to the mutant 2-site probe (Fig. 5). Under these binding conditions, only complex E bound to the E2F probe, and only antibodies to E2F-2 and DP-1 affected the mobility of the complex.While complexes containing E2F-2 displayed clear preference for the GG site, complexes containing E2F-4 appeared to bind either the CG or GG sites. When binding to a probe containing the single CG site was competed for by oligonucleotides containing only the GG site, no binding activity was observed. Moreover, in the absence of any competitors, the same spectrum of E2F complexes A-D bound to each of the single CG and GG site probes. However, E2F-4·DP-1 complexes were able to bind to the 2-site probe in the presence of the mutant 2-site oligonucleotide as competitor, conditions that abolish binding of complexes containing E2F-2. Therefore the CG and GG sites in the native dhfr promoter are not equivalent and most likely bind specific endogenous E2F·DP-1 complexes. Because the difference in binding site specificity was observed with complexes that each contained DP-1, the apparent specificity of these interactions is most likely contributed by the E2F subunits.Two Separate Processes May Be Required for Induction of dhfr Gene ExpressionIn serum starvation-stimulation experiments, distinct changes in E2F DNA binding complexes were detected in CHOC 400 cell extracts. After serum starvation, three complexes were detected, E2F-4·DP-1 (complex D), E2F-4·DP-1 in association with p130 (complex B), and E2F-4·DP-1 in association with p107 (complex A). Based upon previous genomic footprinting studies and the apparent preference of complexes containing E2F-2 for sequences containing GG nucleotides at positions 4 and 5 of the E2F binding site, we originally suggested that E2F-2 was constitutively bound to the GG binding site at the dhfr promoter and, in conjunction with Sp1, formed a basal transcription complex (54Wells J. Held P. Illenye S. Heintz N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore expected to observe a significant amount of DNA binding activity that contained E2F-2 in extracts from cells after synchronization by serum starvation and stimulation. However, complexes containing E2F-2 were essentially undetectable in extracts from serum-starved cells and in cell extracts for at least 24 h after serum stimulation. Thus, complexes containing E2F-2 do not appear to play a role in repression or activation of dhfr gene expression under serum starvation conditions. These observations suggest that regulation of dhfr gene expression in cycling cells may involve different forms of E2F than those that regulate expression after synchrony by serum starvation. By comparing the effect of different growth conditions on the spectrum of E2F DNA binding activities in CHOC 400 cell extracts and relating these differences to dhfr gene expression and the genomic footprint of the dhfr promoter, it may be possible to identify those complexes that repress and activate dhfr gene expression transcription under specific growth conditions.In serum-starved cells, the E2F-4·DP-1·p130 complex accumulated as message levels declined, suggesting a role for both E2F-4 and p130 in repression of dhfr transcription. Upon serum stimulation, flow cytometry showed that entry into the S phase occurred about 16-18 h after the addition of medium with 5% FBS. Maximum dhfr mRNA levels coincided with S phase entry. By 10-12 h after serum stimulation, p130 had disappeared from the E2F-4·DP-1·p130 complex, and two free E2F complexes began to accumulate, one of which was composed of E2F-4·DP-1, whereas the second complex contained DP-1 and an unidentified E2F. The 6-8-h lag phase between disappearance of p130 and the appearance of peak dhfr mRNA levels suggests that relief of p130-mediated repression alone is not sufficient for induction of dhfr gene expression.Rather, at least one subsequent event in addition to relief of p130-mediated repression appears to be required for induction of dhfr gene expression. This second activating event is not known but may be related to the marked increases in the DNA binding activity of free E2F complexes containing E2F-4 or the unidentified E2F. During the first 10 h after serum stimulation the abundance of free E2F-4·DP-1 did not change. Between 12 and 16 h after addition of medium with serum, the abundance of two complexes, E2F-4·DP-1 and complex E containing the unidentified E2F, increased dramatically (Fig. 11). Although dissociation of the E2F-4·DP-1·p130 complex during G1 likely contributed to the pool of free E2F-4·DP-1, this alone seems incapable of accounting for the observed increase in the binding activity of E2F-4·DP-1 complexes, as quantitation showed that the total amount of free E2F-4 was significantly greater than the combined amounts of E2F-4·DP-1·p130 and E2F-4·DP-1 complexes detected in early G1 (Fig. 11). Increased free E2F-4·DP-1 binding activity could result from increased protein synthesis, decreased protein turnover, modification of previously or newly synthesized protein, or increased availability of DP heterodimeric partner proteins. Since Northern blot analysis showed that E2F-4 mRNA changed less than 2-fold during the G1 to S phase transition (data not shown), increased E2F-4·DP-1 binding activity is not likely to be solely the result of increased E2F-4 transcription.Similarly, complex E was essentially undetectable until 10 h after addition of complete medium and steadily increased until the 24-h time point. In contrast to E2F-4, the increased DNA binding activity of complex E cannot be due to the dissociation of other complexes, as no other DNA binding complexes containing this unidentified E2F were detected before mid-G1. Using several different approaches, we were unable to identify the E2F constituent of complex E that increased during induction of dhfr gene expression. Clearly, this complex contained DP-1. Although DP-1 possesses a DNA binding domain, it binds DNA only weakly in the absence of an E2F partner. It is therefore unlikely that this complex represents a DP-1 homodimer. Potential candidates as the E2F moiety of this complex include a form of E2F-1 not recognized by the antibodies to E2F-1 that were used, E2F-5 (a possibility which we did not test), or an as yet undescribed sixth E2F. Interestingly, a recent study using stimulated human T cells also identified an E2F DNA binding activity that was not affected by antibodies specific for E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, or E2F-4 (60Moberg K.

As for complex E, the DNA binding activity of the unidentified E2F was absent in early G1, increased in late G1, peaked during S phase, and declined thereafter. Until this species of E2F is identified, its relationship to dhfr gene expression will be difficult to establish.Studies in a variety of cells types have shown that E2F-1 mRNA levels increase at the G1/S phase boundary and peak during early S phase (reviewed in Ref. 61Slansky J.E.

We previously showed (Kuang, B., and Rubenstein, P. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem 272, 1237-1247) that a mutant yeast actin (V266G/L267G) with markedly decreased hydrophobicity in this loop conferred severe cold sensitivity to its polymerization. Here we further tested the mutational effect on the conformation and function of G-actin. This GG mutation caused no significant changes in overall secondary structure or in the microenvironment around actin's tryptophan residues, nor did it alter the dissociation constant of G-actin for ATP. However, it lowers the intrinsic ATPase activity and the melting temperature for Mg-GG actin from 51 to 33°C and transforms the conformation of subdomain 2 and the central cleft of G-actin into an F-monomer-like structure. The results suggest that the hydrophobic plug may not only play a role in actin filament stabilization but also may be important for controlling the stability of G-actin and for promoting the conformational change of the monomer needed for addition to a growing actin filament.

Actin is a flexible molecule with its four subdomains interconnected through its bound nucleotide and metal ion (1Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). Allosteric interactions have been documented in the small domain between the bound nucleotide, the tightly bound metal ion, the DNase I loop (subdomain 2), and the C terminus (2Strzelecka-Golaszewska H.

The subdomain coupling in the actin monomer suggests that a local structural perturbation could be transmitted to a distal part of the molecule through its bound ligand, resulting in an alteration of actin function. Normal mode analysis of the structure of G-actin 1The abbreviations used are: G- and F-actinglobular and filamentous actinIAEDANSN-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamineWTwild-typeϵ-ATP1, N6-ethenoadenosine-5′-triphosphateTmapparent melting temperature. also suggests that theoretically the four subdomains of actin can move independently or collectively (6Tirion M.M. ben-Avraham D. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 5-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This dynamic feature of actin structure would be important not only for actin filament dynamics (7Egelman E.H. Orlova A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but also for the transformation of the G-actin monomer to the F-actin monomer during actin polymerization. globular and filamentous actin N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine wild-type 1, N6-ethenoadenosine-5′-triphosphate apparent melting temperature. Monomer activation by added salts is the first step in actin polymerization in vitro (8Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process may involve the binding of metal ions at medium and low affinity sites of actin, presumably changing the conformation of G-actin to one that is similar to the monomer as it exists in the actin helix. Such a change would allow monomers to form nuclei or add to the ends of actin filaments more easily. The first evidence for such a conformational change was the observation that the binding of Mg2+ to the high affinity site caused a slow fluorescence change in IAEDANS-labeled actin (9Frieden C. Lieberman D. Gilbert H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8991-8993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies using limited proteolysis (2Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or a fluorescent probe attached to Gln41 (5Kim E. Motoki M. Seguro K. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2024-2032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) demonstrated that subdomain 2 of G-actin adopted an “F-monomer-like” structure following the substitution of Mg2+ for the tightly bound Ca2+. The results described above are consistent with the difference between the atomic structure of G-actin and the conformation of the F-actin monomer in an atomic model of F-actin proposed by Holmes and co-workers (10Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In this model, subdomain 2, especially the DNase I loop in F-actin, folds inward in comparison with G-actin. The central cleft of the F-actin monomer also narrows. These structural differences may lead to the decreased protease susceptibility of Mg-G-actin in comparison with that of Ca-G-actin (2Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another major difference between the atomic structure of G-actin and the Holmes atomic model of the F-actin monomer is the conformation of the hydrophobic loop between subdomains 3 and 4. In rabbit skeletal muscle G-actin, this loop (262-274) rests against the main body of subdomain 4 with the hydrophobic residues Phe266, Ile267, and Met269 near residue Tyr188 (1Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). In the F-actin atomic model (10Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), this loop is predicted to undergo a conformational change during polymerization to form a hydrophobic plug (Phe266-Ile267-Gly268-Met269) that extends perpendicular to the filament axis and inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by two neighboring monomers in the opposing strand (Fig. 1, A and B). The hydrophobic plug-pocket interaction thus would become a major cross-strand contact and result in filament stabilization (11Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). If this hypothesized plug-pocket interaction is generally correct, the detachment of the loop from the main body of actin should be facilitated when actin monomers are activated for polymerization. If allosteric effects play a role in actin monomer activation during polymerization, the detachment of the loop from the surface of actin might result in conformational changes in other parts of the molecule, resulting in a monomer which is more polymerization competent. Alternatively, Schutt et al. (12Schutt E.C. Rozycki M.D. Myslik J.C. Lindberg U. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) argue that the hydrophobic loop (262-274) is held tightly against the main body of the molecule in the profilin:β-actin ribbon structure and is unlikely to undergo a conformational change like that proposed by Holmes since such a change would result in denaturation of the protein. Our results with mutations in the hydrophobic plug in yeast actin, which show that the hydrophobicity of the plug is important for filament formation and stabilization, are generally consistent with the proposed hydrophobic plug-pocket cross-strand interaction (13Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presumed conformational change in the monomer that accompanies movement of the loop, however, another aspect of the hypothesis, has received little attention. In this work, we took advantage of a mutant yeast actin containing a plug with markedly decreased hydrophobicity to study the effect of the conformation of the loop on other parts of the actin molecule and the structural coupling between the large and small domains of actin. In yeast actin, the hydrophobic plug is comprised of Val266-Leu267-Gly268-Leu269. For studying the postulated hydrophobic plug-pocket interaction in actin filament stability, we previously made a yeast actin double mutant V266G/L267G (GG) in which the hydrophobic side chains of the first two residues of the plug were eliminated (14Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have shown that the GG mutation did not grossly change the conformation of actin but prevented its polymerization unless near stoichiometric amounts of WT actin or actin filament stabilizing agents such as beryllium fluoride and phalloidin were present. However, it is not clear what effect the GG mutation would have on the conformation of G-actin. The elimination of most of the hydrophobicity of the plug should make the loop more easily detachable from the main body of actin, because the decreased hydrophobicity of the plug and the increased flexibility of the Gly residues would result in a lower energy barrier for making the hydrophobic plug totally accessible to solvent. The “parked” position of the loop in G-actin appears to restrict the movement of subdomains 3 and 4 relative to one another, and the adenine ring of the bound nucleotide is located near this domain interface. A structural perturbation of this loop might alter the conformation of the central cleft and/or other structural elements in G-actin through the bound adenine nucleotide. This change could then result in a conformation resembling the F-actin monomer thus promoting polymerization, providing there are allosteric interactions between the large and the small domains of G-actin. Alternatively, the perturbation caused by the GG mutation might destabilize the actin molecule and result in a local or more extensive denaturation of G-actin thereby preventing polymerization (12Schutt E.C. Rozycki M.D. Myslik J.C. Lindberg U. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we report the results of experiments designed to differentiate between these alternatives. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from the Amersham Corp. Phalloidin, 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (ϵ-ATP), α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, subtilisin, ATPase (w/luciferase) assay mix, and the ATP disodium salt were purchased from Sigma. The bicinchoninic acid assay reagent was purchased from Pierce. AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. Purification of actins was done as described previously using a DNase I affinity chromatography-based protocol (14Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ca-G-actin was stored at 4°C in Ca-G-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol). Mg-G-actin was obtained by converting actin from the Ca-G form into the Mg-G form as described by Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al (2Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The buffer conditions for Mg-actin are 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. F-actin was prepared by adding 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl to 5 μM G-actin in the presence of equimolar phalloidin at room temperature for 2 h. The digestion experiments were carried out according to Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (2Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). G-actin or F-actin (5 μM) was incubated with trypsin (5 μg/ml), subtilisin (1 μg/ml), or α-chymotrypsin (22.5 μg/ml) at 23°C for the desired time. The digestion with trypsin was stopped with 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and digestion with the other two proteases was stopped with 1 mM protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were then separated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Nucleotide exchange experiments were done as described by Crosbie et al. (4Crosbie R.H. Miller C. Cheung P. Goodnight T. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1954-1967Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). G-actin was preequilibrated with ϵ-ATP and the excess nucleotide removed with a Penefsky column (15Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This G-actin (3 μM) was mixed with 0.5 mM ATP, and the decay of fluorescence was monitored in a SLM4800 fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 340 and 410 nm, respectively. Nucleotide exchanges were derived by fitting the data to a single exponential expression using a nonlinear least squares program (16Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The intrinsic ATPase activity of G-actin was measured as described by Chen et al. (13Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ca- or Mg-G actin, preequilibrated with [γ-32P]ATP at 4°C, was raised to the desired temperature, and aliquots of the reaction solution were taken at 20-min intervals. The amount of inorganic phosphate released was determined by the procedure of Spudich (17Spudich J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6013-6020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The melting temperatures of G-actin were determined by CD according to Chen et al. (18Chen X. Peng J. Pedram M. Swenson C.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ellipticity of a G-actin solution (1.4 μM or 0.7 μM) was monitored at 222 nm using an AVIV 62 DS instrument. Data were fitted to a two-state model with a single transition between the native and denatured form of the protein (19Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 20Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) using a nonlinear least squares program (16Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Since the denaturation of actin is irreversible, only a pseudo-melting temperature was derived. The secondary structures of 6 μM WT or GG actin solutions were monitored by far UV CD spectroscopy between 200 and 260 nm. The buffer conditions were the same as that of G-buffer except that the concentration of Tris-HCl was 2 mM instead of 10 mM. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of WT or GG actin were recorded with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 290 and 335 nm, respectively. The apparent association constants for the G-actin-ATP complex were determined according to Chen et al. (18Chen X. Peng J. Pedram M. Swenson C.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using a procedure based on the determination of bound and free nucleotide with firefly luciferase. Subdomain 2 (DNase I loop) of G-actin is a rather mobile structure, and the conformation of subdomain 2 and its structural transitions are important for actin function (7Egelman E.H. Orlova A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in subdomain 2 can be probed by limited proteolysis with trypsin, subtilisin, and α-chymotrypsin (21Mornet D. Ue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3680-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Konno K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Trypsin cleaves subdomain 2 of Ca-G-actin at Arg62-Gly63 and Lys68-Tyr69, yielding 33-kDa C-terminal fragments. Subtilisin cleaves subdomain 2 of Ca-G-actin at Met47-Gly48 and yields a 35-kDa fragment. α-Chymotrypsin cleaves subdomain 2 of Ca-G-actin at Met44-Val45 and Leu67-Lys68, producing 35- and 33-kDa fragments. These muscle actin digestion sites are conserved in yeast actin, and the protease susceptibility of subdomain 2 of yeast actin is similar to that of rabbit skeletal muscle actin (18Chen X. Peng J. Pedram M. Swenson C.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the GG mutation on the conformation of subdomain 2 of G-actin, we carried out limited proteolysis of GG and WT actins. For both WT actin and GG actin, Mg-G-actin is less susceptible than Ca-G-actin, and F-actin is less susceptible than G-actin to protease digestion (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with previous results (18Chen X. Peng J. Pedram M. Swenson C.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the susceptibility of GG actin is different from that of WT actin. Although controlled digestion of G-WT and G-GG actin by trypsin, subtilisin, and α-chymotrypsin yielded the same digestion pattern, the proteolytic fragments of Ca2+- or Mg2+-GG actin were always less abundant than those of its WT counterpart. These results indicate that the digestion sites of these proteases on subdomain 2 of GG actin are more protected than those of WT actin. The conformational change associated with Ca-G-GG actin mimics that caused by substituting the tightly bound Ca2+ of WT actin with Mg2+, which protects subdomain 2 of Mg-actin from digestion. The results suggest that the GG mutation may induce G-actin to change its conformation to a more F-monomer like structure. GG actin cannot polymerize by itself in vitro but can polymerize in the presence of filament stabilizing agents (14Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To evaluate how the GG mutation would affect the topology of F-actin, we tested the protease susceptibility of phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments. Fig. 2, A and B, shows that subdomain 2 of phalloidin-stabilized F-GG actin appeared to be more susceptible to protease digestion by subtilisin and α-chymotrypsin but not trypsin. These results suggest that the GG mutation alters the conformation of subdomain 2 in phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments by allowing subdomain 2 to be more accessible to protease digestion. The decreased protease susceptibility of subdomain 2 in GG versus WT G-actin results from a conformational change due to intramolecular communication between the mutated hydrophobic plug and subdomain 2 via the nucleotide bridge. This proposition suggests that the conformation of the central cleft may be altered, too. Because the protease digestion sites are close to the top of the central cleft, the central cleft may be tighter in GG actin than in WT actin. We thus examined the ATP exchange rates of GG and WT actins. The ϵ-ATP exchange rates for both Ca- and Mg-GG actins are greatly reduced compared with those of WT actins (Fig. 3A). The observed first-order off-rate of ϵ-ATP for Ca-GG actin (1.4 ± 0.5 × 10−2 s−1) is between 2 to 3 times slower than that of Ca-WT actin (3.8 ± 0.6 × 10−2 s−1). The nucleotide exchange rate of muscle G-actin is affected by the tightly bound divalent cation with Mg-actin, having a higher nucleotide dissociation rate than Ca-actin (23Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the first-order off-rates of ϵ-ATP of yeast Mg-actin are 3 times faster than those of Ca-actin for both GG and WT actin, and the exchange rate for Mg-GG (4.1 ± 0.8 × 10−2 s−1) actin is still about one-third that of Mg-WT actin (1.3 ± 0.2 × 10−2 s−1) (Fig. 3B). The results indicate that the conformation of the central cleft of GG actin differs from that of WT actin, and this difference may reflect a closure of this central cleft, a result consistent with our protease studies. If the slower nucleotide exchange rate of GG actin is due to a closure of the central cleft, the rate of association of the nucleotide might also be affected. However, it is difficult to obtain directly the rate of association (kon), especially because actin quickly and irreversibly denatures in the absence of nucleotide (24Oosawa F. Kasai M. Timasheff S.N. Fasman G.D. Subunits in Biological Systems. Dekker, New York1971: 261-322Google Scholar). The association rate, however, can be estimated by kon = K·koff, where K is the nucleotide association constant, and koff is the dissociation rate. We thus measured the association constants for Ca-actin and Mg-actin, and the results are listed in Table I. The association constants of Ca-GG actin at 0 and 23°C and the association constant of Mg-GG actin at 0°C are very similar to those of WT actins and on the order of 107M−1. Statistical analysis of the data with analysis of variance showed that the small difference in the association constants between WT and GG actin is insignificant. Due to the significant intrinsic ATPase activity for Mg-actin at 23°C, the method is not suitable for measuring the association constant of Mg-actin at room temperature. The results indicate that the GG mutation does not change the ATP binding affinity of Ca-GG actin. This observation is consistent with the Holmes F-actin model, which predicts that there is no significant change in the nucleotide and Ca2+ binding site between the G-actin and F-actin monomers (10Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar).Table I.Equilibrium binding constants (×107 M−1) of ATP to WT and GG actinsTemperatureCa2+-WTCA2+-GGMg2+-WTMg2+-GG°C×107M−101.8 ± 0.41.2 ± 0.32.3 ± 0.71.3 ± 0.4232.5 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.5NDaND, not determined.NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The similar ATP binding affinity and the 3-fold slower ATP exchange rate of GG actin suggest that the nucleotide association rate for GG actin is also slower than that for WT actin. These results are consistent with a conformational change in the central cleft of GG actin as proposed earlier. Furthermore, the similar nucleotide binding affinities for GG actin and WT actin indicate that the polymerization defect of GG actin and the conformational changes caused by the GG mutation do not result from a decreased affinity of GG actin for its tightly bound ligands or as a result of a denaturation of the lower region of the interdomain cleft. The conformational change of the central cleft of actin caused by the GG mutation may affect the ability of G-actin to hydrolyze its bound ATP. Exchange of magnesium for calcium in the central cleft of G-actin apparently causes a conformational change in the cleft that accelerates actin's intrinsic ATPase activity (25Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activities of Ca-WT (0.5 mmol·mol−1·min−1) and that of Ca-GG actin (0.4 mmol·mol−1·min−1) are very low and almost the same (Fig. 4A). However, Mg-G-WT (5.0 mmol·mol−1·min−1) actin hydrolyzes ATP about 10 times faster than Mg-G-GG actin (0.5 mmol·mol−1·min−1) at 17°C (Fig. 4B). Because the apparent melting temperature of monomeric Mg-GG actin is 33°C (next section), we measured the intrinsic ATPase activity of Mg-actin at room temperature (data not shown) and 17°C. All show similar differences in the rate of phosphate hydrolysis between WT and GG actins, indicating that the low ATPase activity of GG-actin is not due to denaturation of Mg-GG actin. The lower ATPase activity of GG-actin seems inconsistent with the proposal that this mutation confers an F-monomer-like state on the protein. However, as discussed more fully later, the ATPase activity of the monomer may depend on its ability to form transient oligomers, which the mutation may inhibit. Although the GG mutation causes small conformational changes in actin's subdomain 2 and central cleft, structural coupling may not be limited to these parts of the actin molecule. We therefore examined the thermal stability of GG actin by circular dichroism, although the thermal unfolding of G-actin is irreversible. The molar ellipticity at 222 nm, which reflects the content of α-helical structure in G-actin, was monitored as a function of temperature. The mid-point of the thermal transition curve is defined as the apparent melting temperature for the protein (Tm). The GG mutation produces a thermally labile actin molecule (Fig. 5), lowering the melting temperature for Ca-WT actin from 57 to 45°C. Even more strikingly, the GG mutation lowered the melting temperature of Mg-GG actin to 33°C compared with 51°C for Mg-WT actin. Thus, elimination of a major portion of the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic plug causes thermal instability for the actin molecule. The effect is in the same direction caused by substitution of the tightly bound Ca2+ with Mg2+ but is much larger. Interestingly, the apparent melting temperature for Mg-GG actin is only 33°C, while GG cells still survive at 37°C (14Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although the growth of GG cells is more compromised than that of WT cells at this temperature. GG-actin's inability to polymerize by itself and its low melting temperature suggest that the GG mutation may partially denature the actin even at ambient or lower temperatures. We thus compared the secondary structures of WT and GG actin at 23 and 4°C by measuring their far UV CD spectra. There is a subtle difference between the CD spectra of Ca2+-WT and Ca2+-GG actin, but the CD spectra of Mg2+-WT and GG actin are identical (Fig. 6). The similar shapes of the spectra suggest that there is no significant change in the secondary structure of the mutant GG-actin. We also measured the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Mg2+-WT (not shown) and Ca2+-WT and GG-actins The emission spectra (Fig. 7) of WT and GG actin are again identical, and the emission maxima of WT and GG actin are the same at 325 nm whether at 23°C or 4°C. Thus, the GG mutation did not alter the tertiary structure around the G-actin tryptophan residues. Our results suggest that this mutation does not significantly disorder the local structure of actin, consistent with the similar ATP binding affinities of WT and GG G-actin.Fig. 7Intrinsic fluorescence spectra of Ca2+-WT and GG actin at 23°C (A) or 4°C (B). The excitation and emission wavelength is 290 and 335 nm, respectively. The emission maxima are around 325 nm for either WT or GG actin. ⋄, WT actin; □, GG actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interactions between structural elements in an actin monomer may play a role in generating tension when the thin filament interacts with the thick filament during muscle contraction (7Egelman E.H. Orlova A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Such interactions may be equally important in the conversion of G-actin to the F-monomer form prior to its incorporation in the growing filament. To understand these functional relationships, it is necessary to define these interactions within the actin molecule. Our studies indicate that the hydrophobic loop between subdomain 3 and 4 may influence the conformation of subdomain 2 of GG actin via the nucleotide bridge. The elimination of the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic plug caused a closure of the central cleft, a rotation of subdomain 2 that protected the digestion sites of trypsin, subtilisin, α-chymotrypsin, and slowed the ATP exchange rate. The mutation also produced a more labile actin molecule as shown by its lower thermostability, although the mutation seems to affect the secondary structure of the actin molecule minimally at ambient or lower temperatures. These results demonstrate for the first time that there is structural coupling between the large domain, the nucleotide-binding cleft, and the small domain of actin. The results are particularly interesting because they concern the hypothetical role of the hydrophobic plug in actin filament formation. The Holmes F-actin model (10Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar) proposes that the hydrophobic loop swings out from a parked conformation on subdomain 4 to form a major contact between two helical strands. If elements of the model are correct, the conformational change would be promoted by monomer activation through the binding of Mg2+ at the high affinity site and/or the binding of divalent and monovalent cations at the medium affinity sites. Divalent-cation-dependent conformational changes have been implicated as the structural basis for the different properties of Mg-actin compared with Ca-actin, such as the faster nucleation rate of Mg-actin. In terms of the Holmes model, the hydrophobic loop may detach from the main body of actin more easily in Mg-actin than in Ca-actin. Molecular dynamics simulations (26Wriggers W. Schulten K. Biophys J. 1996; 68: 34aGoogle Scholar) suggest that there are two populations of Mg-actin, one like the Ca-G-actin crystal structure (1Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar) and another like the conformation of the F-monomer with the hydrophobic loop extending into solvent. Their work suggests that structural coupling may exist between the hydrophobic loop and the central cleft. Elimination of most of the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic plug might promote detachment of the loop from the surface of subdomain 4. Such a conformational change would spread its effects to other parts of the molecule and produce a Ca-GG actin with a more “Mg-WT actin-like” or “F-monomer-like” conformation. The change in protease susceptibility of subdomain 2 caused by the GG mutation resembles the change caused by substitution of Mg2+ for tightly bound Ca2+ in WT actin. This change may result from the “inward” folding of subdomain 2 (2Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which has been proposed in the refined F-actin model (10Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This movement may bring the tops of the central cleft closer to each other, which in turn might impose steric hindrance on the exchange of bound nucleotide with free nucleotides in the medium. As shown earlier, the nucleotide exchange rates of Ca- or Mg-WT actin are in fact three times faster than those of the corresponding GG actin. While the GG mutation led to a less protease-susceptible G-actin conformation, it actually increased the protease susceptibility of phalloidin-stabilized F-actin. The DNase I loop (38-52) may form part of the hydrophobic pocket needed for cross-strand stabilization in the F-actin model (11Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). A decreased hydrophobic interaction between plug and pocket due to the GG mutation may allow the DNase I loop to swing away from the filament axis more easily in the phalloidin-stabilized F-actin helix, as suggested by its greater susceptibility to digestion by subtilisin and α-chymotrypsin, whose digestion sites are mainly in the DNase I loop. Thus, the conformational changes of subdomain 2 caused by the GG mutation in G-actin and F-actin, when compared with WT actin, are consistent with the predictions of Holmes' F-actin model. The low ATPase activity of GG actin seems to contradict the prediction that GG-actin assumes a more Mg-actin or F-monomer-like conformation. The ATPase activity that occurs following actin polymerization is much higher than that of the intrinsic ATPase of the monomer, presumably because the F-monomer conformation stabilized by the filament greatly facilitates the hydrolysis reaction. Mg-actin assumes a F-monomer-like conformation so that it has higher ATPase activity than Ca-actin. However, there are oligomers in Mg-G-actin solutions even at subcritical concentrations, although no filaments are detectable (27Newman J. Estes J.E. Selden L. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1538-1544Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Mozo-Villarias A. Ware B.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1544-1548Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the higher ATPase activity of Mg-G-actin may result from transient oligomer formation from Mg-G-actin rather than from a more active monomer. Although monomeric GG actin may assume a Mg-G-actin like conformation, it may not be able to form oligomers, which are stable enough to catalyze its ATPase activity, because of its weakened cross-strand interaction. The intrinsic ATPase activity of GG actin would thus remain very low even when bound with Mg2+. The presumed F-monomer-like conformation of GG actin is also consistent with a study (29Heintz D. Faulstich H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that showed that disulfide bridge formation between Cys374 and Cys10 produced an unpolymerizable actin with an F-monomer-like conformation. This actin has a slower ATP exchange rate and a lower intrinsic ATPase activity similar to that shown here for GG actin. The GG mutation lowers the melting temperature of G-actin the way the substitution of tightly bound Ca2+ with Mg2+ does, but to a much greater degree. The drastic decrease of the apparent melting temperatures of Ca- and Mg-GG actin compared with those of WT actin suggests that the parked conformation of the hydrophobic loop on the surface of subdomain 4 greatly stabilizes the structure of G-actin possibly by immobilizing subdomain 4 and the subdomain 3/4 interface. The loop is at the intersection of subdomains 3 and 4 near the residues that constitute the binding site for the adenine ring of the nucleotide. The detachment of the loop may loosen the structure of G-actin by weakening the nucleotide bridge and also allowing the top of subdomain 4 to move closer to that of subdomain 2. Such a change may make it easier for G-actin to transform into a F-monomer conformation. These results suggest that the loop containing the hydrophobic plug may be involved not only in filament stabilization but also in conformational changes in the actin monomer through the nucleotide bridge. The actin-bound nucleotide joins the two domains of the protein and, therefore, confers structural stability on the monomer. Previous work from our laboratory (18Chen X. Peng J. Pedram M. Swenson C.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) found that an ATP phosphate binding loop (residues 13-15) is important for actin's function and stability. The S14A mutation in this loop not only resulted in a decreased affinity of the protein for ATP, but also greatly destabilized the actin monomer, lowering its Tm in the Mg2+-form from 52 to 40°C. These results coupled with reexamination of the G-actin atomic structure led to the suggestion that the hydroxyl group of Ser14 not only interacts with the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide but also may form a contact with the amide nitrogen of Gly74 in a length of polypeptide leading to the top of subdomain 2. The interaction involving residue Ser14 may thus play a role in stabilization of the actin monomer. Thus, actin-bound ATP may not only stabilize the actin monomer but also may mediate the allosteric interactions between different structural elements necessary for polymerization, especially between actin's large and small domains. The effect of the GG mutation on the overall stability of G-actin is quite specific. Except for the L267D mutation (13Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), other mutations made in this plug did not affect actin's melting temperatures (data not shown). Actin mutations V266F, V266G, L267G, L269K, and L269D, which caused no appreciable defects in actin polymerization (14Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), did not lower the melting temperatures of the proteins. The V266D mutation which caused a somewhat slower rate of actin polymerization and a slightly lower critical concentration at 4°C in comparison with wild-type actin did not affect its melting temperature either. However, the L267D mutation which produced a marked cold-sensitive polymerization defect in vitro also caused a 15°C decrease in its melting temperature. The progressive effects of the mutations on the stability of G-actin are consistent with the predictions of Holmes' model and also suggest that the hydrophobicity of the plug is important not only for filament stabilization but also for monomer stability. The lowered thermostability of GG actin is also consistent with Schutt's argument concerning the role of the hydrophobic loop between subdomain 3 and 4. However, the far UV CD results and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra indicate at most a minimal local structural perturbation is caused by the GG mutation at 23 or 4°C. The results also suggest that at these temperatures, detachment of the subdomain 3/4 loop from the main body does not affect monomer integrity, more in agreement with Holmes' model. The observation further supports our previous suggestion that the severe cold-sensitive polymerization defect of GG actin is not due to monomer denaturation but rather due to decreased monomer-monomer contact in the filament (14Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), since the presence of GG actin can stimulate the polymerization rate of WT actin even though GG actin cannot incorporate into actin filaments at 4°C. Yeast cells carrying only GG-actin survive at 37°C despite the fact that Mg-GG actin denatures at 33°C and cannot form filaments at lower temperatures unless stabilized by reagents such as beryllium fluoride or phalloidin (14Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Karpova et al (30Karpova T.S. Tatchell K. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated that there is only a small pool of unpolymerized actin in yeast and the rest exists in a form stainable with fluorescent phalloidin. These results suggest that, in GG cells, actin-binding proteins promote the polymerization of the mutant actin, thereby stabilizing it sufficiently against denaturation so that it is compatible with yeast viability. Thus, based on our studies, the subdomain 3/4 loop containing the hydrophobic plug at its tip may actually serve two important additional roles besides stabilizing the filament via the proposed plug-pocket interaction. First, in the parked position, the loop imposes rigidity on the monomer, which helps stabilize it against denaturation. Second, detachment of the loop away from the parked position would lead to a conformational change via the nucleotide bridge allowing the monomer to form the intersubunit contacts needed for its insertion into the growing filament. The stability lost by this detachment would then be more than compensated for by the locking of the monomer into the filament. We thank Gregory DeKoster for his help in data fitting and analysis. We also thank Linda Rubenstein for performing the analysis of variance analysis on the nucleotide binding constants."

Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) during exocytosis. They are a critical part of a complex machinery of intracellular protein transport (5Rothman J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar) and the synaptic vesicle cycle (7SÜdhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In addition to a short N-terminal intravesicular region and single transmembrane domain, Syts have two copies of highly conserved repeats, known as the C2A and C2B domains, which are homologous to the C2 regulatory region of protein kinase C (8Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. SÜdhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In particular, the C2B domain appears to play several roles. First, the C2B domain of mouse Syt II shows specific binding to high polyphosphate inositols (IPns) (9Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a feature that is not shared by the highly homologous C2A domain nor with the C2 domains of other proteins such as rabphilin. Moreover, the C2B domain is necessary but not sufficient for IPn binding. Although Syt II and IV show high affinity binding of IP4 and IP6, the Syt III-C2B domain shows negligible binding, despite a high sequence identity with the Syt II-C2B domain, including the 32-residue region examined by mutational analysis (10Fukuda M.

Inhibition of C2B function in the squid giant axon disrupts synaptic vesicle release and recycling (11Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10708-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly, Caenorhabditis elegans mutants lacking Syt or simply the C2B domain cannot recycle synaptic vesicles (12Jorgensen E.M. Hartweig E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and the presence of Syt I in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients (13Davidsson P. Jahn R. Bergquist J. Ekman R. Blennow K. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1996; 27: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) may provide clues to the disruption of synaptic function in humans. The C2B domain acts as a high affinity receptor for clathrin assembly protein AP-2 (14Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ appears to mediate Syt dimerization via the C2B domain (15Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J.

Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curiously, the rank order of IPns binding for native Syt II was Ins(1,3,4,5,6)-P5 > (1,3,4,5)-P4 > Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)-P6 > Ins(1,4,5)-P3, whereas for the GST-Syt II-C2B domain the order was IP6 > IP5 > IP4 > IP3. Deletion mutants allowed mapping of the IPn binding site to the central region of the mouse Syt II-C2B domain, specifically residues 315-346 (IHLMQNGKRLKKKKTTVKKKTLNPYFNESFSF) (9Fukuda M. Aruga J.

The P-2-tethered [3H]BZDC-IP6 prepared in this work was employed to establish the location of the IP6 binding site in the C2B region of the synaptotagmins and to confirm the ligand specificity of this domain by an independent method. In the process, the site specificity and ligand selectivity found fully validates the use of the photoaffinity labeling approach in the search for and active-site mapping of additional PIPn- and IPn-binding proteins.Six GST-Syt C2 domain-containing fusion proteins were examined in this study, using four photoaffinity probes corresponding to modifications of IP3, IP4, and IP6. The most important findings are summarized as follows. First, we observed extremely high selectivity and ligand specificity of labeling of the C2B-containing proteins in crude extracts. No other proteins were significantly labeled with the high specific activity [3H]BZDC-IPn derivatives even when the target proteins represented less than 2% of the total protein. The only exception was a hitherto unknown 45-kDa E. coli protein that showed high selectivity and specificity for binding of IP4. This observation may provide the basis for purification of this protein and the determination of its role in the biochemistry of this common bacterium. For all proteins and ligands, labeling followed an expected time course, with a maximum efficiency at 45 min.Second, labeling was highly dependent on the choice of ligand. Although P-2-linked [3H]BZDC-IP6 gave the strongest labeling of C2B-containing constructs, P-1-linked [3H]BZDC-IP4, [3H]BZDC-IP3, and [3H]BZDC-IP6 showed modest, weak, and no labeling, respectively. The failure of the P-1-tethered IP6 to label C2B domains was unexpected but an important “negative control.” It is important to recognize that the aminopropyl-tethered photophore adds significant “unnatural” lipophilicity to the soluble IPn recognition elements as well as masking one of the phosphates. The importance of the number and the positions of phosphates and the position of the linker were critical factors determining the photolabeling efficiency, not simply nonselective hydrophobic interactions of the photophore with the protein.Nonetheless, the observation that purified but not crude C2B domains could be weakly labeled by [3H]BZDC-IP3 emphasizes two important points. When only a single protein is present in a photoaffinity labeling experiment, even relatively low affinity sites may become covalently modified. The ligand may poorly associate with the target, but in the absence of alternative sites for occupancy, the irreversible nature of the photoaffinity labeling experiment allows labeled protein to accumulate.The photoaffinity probe may also mimic a different ligand. In BZDC-IP3, the presence of the P-1-O-(3-aminopropyl) linker bearing the hydrophobic tritiated 4-benzoyldihydrocinnamide photophore allows the photoaffinity ligand to resemble a 2-desacyl phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate, PIP2. For example, profilin, a PIP2-binding cytosolic protein important in interactions of the actin cytoskeleton with membrane phospholipids (36Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) has been labeled with [3H]BZDC-IP3, but displacement of labeling requires PIP2, not IP3 (17Prestwich G.D. Dormán G. Elliott J.T. Marecak D.F. Chaudhary A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; Google Scholar). The PH domain of the phospholipase C δ1 isoform can also be labeled efficiently3 with [ 3E. Tall, G. Dormán, P. Garcia, S. Shah, J. Chen, A. A. Profit, Q.-M. Gu, A. Chaudhary, G. D. Prestwich, and M. J. Rebecchi, submitted for publication.H]BZDC-IP3. Indeed, the C2B domain of Syt I has been recently implicated in binding of PIP2 at high calcium concentrations (37Schiavo G. Gu Q.-M. Prestwich G.D. SÖllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13327-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), providing further explanation for the affinity of the photoaffinity probes for the Syt II-C2B domains employed in this study.Similarly the [3H]BZDC-IP4 probe effectively mimics PIP3. This observation in fact enabled the isolation and purification of centaurin-α, a novel multi-domain protein with both homology regions, suggesting its role in communication of membrane lipid changes to the cytoskeleton (21Hammonds-Odie L.P. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Blader I.J. Turck C.W. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18859-18868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Very recently, the N-terminal region of the α subunit of AP-2 was found to have high affinity for PIP3 (38Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a finding foreshadowed by the highly selective and efficient photoaffinity labeling of AP-2 by [3H]BZDC-IP4 (31Theibert A.B. Estevez V.A. Mourey R.J. Marecek J.F. Barrow R.K. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9071-9079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Voglmaier S.M. Keen J.H. Murphy J.

Profit, J. M. Rabinovich, B. Mehrotra, G. D. Prestwich, and E. M. Lafer, unpublished observations. [3H]BZDC-IP4 showed efficient labeling of assembly protein AP-3, already documented to have high affinity for the higher IPns IP4, IP5, IP6, and IP7 (39Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which inhibited assembly of the clathrin coat. Interestingly, PIP3 has now been shown to be more effective than the soluble IPns or other PIPns in inhibiting AP-3-mediated clathrin coat assembly. 5W. Hao, Z. Tan, K. Prasad, K. K. Reddy, J. Chen, G. D. Prestwich, J. R. Falck, S. B. Shears, and E. M. Lafer (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, in press. Finally, the labeling of purified Syt II-C2B domains by [3H]BZDC-IP4 can be understood in terms of the affinity of Syt C2 domains for PIP3 at low calcium concentrations (37Schiavo G. Gu Q.-M. Prestwich G.D. SÖllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13327-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).The relative importance of the phosphate groups in binding to the C2B domains was examined in an independent set of NMR studies (40Clark B.A. Biological Applications of NMR: Structure Determination and Relaxation Studies.Ph. D. Thesis, State University of New York at Stony Brook, NY. 1995; Google Scholar). The relative rate enhancements, which depend on increases in motional correlation time, were determined for clearly resolved phosphorus and proton signals of the photoaffinity ligand in the presence and the absence of GST-Syt II-C2B. Thus, 1H and 31P NMR of 10 mM BZDC-IP4 were first determined at 298 K for 20 mM sodium acetate buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 5.5; next, 0.04 molar equivalent of purified GST-Syt II-C2B (0.4 mM) was added to the solution, and the chemical shifts and relaxation times were remeasured. The signals exhibiting the largest rate enhancements included P-5, H-5, and H-6, whereas the P-1 and side chain aminopropyl relaxation rates were essentially unaffected by the binding to the C2B domain. Thus, the 4,5,6 region of the inositol ring is intimately involved in the binding to C2B, whereas the aminopropyl tether retains motional freedom even in the bound state (40Clark B.A. Biological Applications of NMR: Structure Determination and Relaxation Studies.Ph. D. Thesis, State University of New York at Stony Brook, NY. 1995; Google Scholar).Third, labeling was well correlated with reported relative IPn binding affinity as determined by equilibrium methods using displacement of [3H]IP4 with unlabeled IPns (9Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, using [3H]BZDC-IP6 as the probe, displacement of 50% of the labeling required about a 150-fold molar excess of IP6, whereas little or no displacement was observed with IP4 or IP3 at six times this concentration of displacer. When [3H]BZDC-IP4 labeling was examined in detail (data not shown), IP6 was again the most effective competing ligand.Fourth, labeling was correlated with binding affinities of C2B domains for the functionally diverse Syt II and Syt III constructs. Consistent with the [3H]IP4 binding affinities (10Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the GST-Syt III-C2B domain was not covalently labeled upon irradiation with [3H]BZDC-IP6. Moreover, purified GST fusion proteins in which [3H]IP4 binding had been partially restored also recovered the ability to be photoaffinity labeled. Thus, the C-terminal truncated GST-Syt III-C2B(δC) showed partial unmasking of the IPn binding domain.Fifth, labeling by P-2-linked [3H]BZDC-IP6 correlated with the known affinities of the two different C2 domains, which show different calcium ion-dependent properties (41Sugita S. Hata Y. SÜdhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The C2A domain acts as a calcium sensor (3Mikoshiba K. Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10703-10707Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) during endocytosis, and three-dimensional structures have been described (42Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 43Shao X.G. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) for this critical domain. The phospholipid selectivities of several Syts have been described in detail, and the Syt IV C2A domain also appears to function as a calcium sensor (27Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Consistent with the absence of high affinity [3H]IP4 binding to C2A (10Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the GST-Syt II-C2A domain was not labeled by [3H]BZDC-IP6. Preliminary observations suggest Ca2+-dependent labeling of this domain with [3H]BZDC-IP3, consistent with binding to other anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine. In contrast, the C2B domain has been implicated in binding to IPns (9Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PIPns (38Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), AP-2 (14Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and other elements of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery (44Schiavo G. Gmachi M.J.S. Steinbeck G. SÖllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1995; 378: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The efficient labeling of the GST Syt II-C2B domain (and GST-Syt II-C2A+C2B domain) with [3H]BZDC-IP6 is consistent with the different affinities of these two protein kinase C2 homology domains.Sixth, a synthetic 32-residue peptide corresponding to the base-rich central region of the C2B domain, identified by mutational and truncation/deletion methods as crucial to high affinity [3H]IP4 binding (9Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), also showed high affinity for the [3H]BZDC-IP6 photoaffinity probe. Indeed, when an equimolar ratio of 32-mer to GST-Syt II-C2B was labeled with a stoichiometric amount of this photoaffinity label, the full-length C2B domain and 32-mer were equally labeled. Increasing amounts of peptide were able to completely sequester the photoprobe from the C2B domain. This observation is highly significant in that it represents the smallest minidomain known to demonstrate selective, high affinity binding to IP6 or its analogues. Surprisingly, this peptide failed to exhibit secondary structure, other than random coil, in aqueous buffers at two pH values in the presence and the absence of IP6. It is conceivable, in view of the dimerization of Syts via their C2B domains (15Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), that the peptide is only able to adopt an IP6-binding conformation in the presence of a preorganized IP6-C2B complex. However, the 32-mer peptide could be labeled successfully with [3H]BZDC-IP6 even in the absence of the GST Syt II-C2B protein (data not shown), and this labeling can be reduced by addition of IP6 as a competitor. This suggests that BZDC-IP6 may induce a structure in the otherwise random coil polypeptide. The labeling was maximal with [3H]BZDC-IP6 relative to the [3H]BZDC-IP3 and IP4 photoprobes, supporting the higher affinity of the 32-mer peptide for IP6.A related C2B domain has been identified in a novel IP4-binding protein from rat brain and both human and porcine platelets (45Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); this protein also possesses GTPase-activating activity not found in other IP4-binding proteins. This protein has high specificity for IP4, with 1000-fold lower affinity for IP6. The central IPn binding sequence would have missing or moved basic residues found in the IP6 binding region of C2B with a central region of EAKKTKVKKK (human) as opposed to KKKKTTVKKK (mouse). A preliminary report suggested that a 25-mer peptide that includes this recognition site could bind IP4 with high affinity via a “basket-like” structure, allowing the lysines or arginines to interact with the phosphates of the IP4 (46Irvine R. Cullen P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The data described herein constitute the experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis.Synaptotagmin is essential for several aspects of synaptic vesicle dynamics. In particular, strong biological evidence now supports a critical role for the C2B domain in recycling of synaptic vesicles. This evidence is based on the accumulation of synaptic vesicles in C. elegans mutants lacking the C2B domain of their Syt (12Jorgensen E.M. Hartweig E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and from the inhibition of synaptic vesicle recycling in squid (Loglio pealei) giant synapse preterminals when injected with antibodies to the this C2B domain (11Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10708-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The high inositol polyphosphates (IPns, n = 4, 5, or 6) can block synaptic neurotransmitter release and may regulate the fusion step preceding exocytosis (11Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10708-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The emergence of PIP3 as a preferred ligand for inhibition of clathrin coating mediated by AP-2 (38Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and AP-35 may suggest that the IPns (n = 4, 5, or 6) may not be the actual physiological ligands involved. An important research area would now be studies directed at determining the nature and flux of PIPn and IPn ligands actually involved in the endo- and exocytotic events in vivoConclusionFour photoaffinity analogues of IP3, IP4, and IP6 have been employed to document the selectivity and specificity of different inositol polyphosphates toward the C2 domains of two Syts. We made five key observations. First, labeling of the C2B-containing proteins in crude extracts showed extremely high selectivity and ligand specificity. Second, labeling was highly dependent on ligand, with [3H]BZDC-IP6 showing the optimal labeling of C2B domains. Third, labeling was well correlated with reported relative IPn binding affinities as determined by equilibrium methods using displacement of [3H]IP4 with unlabeled IPns. This validates photolabeling as a methodology for identification of novel proteins that bind IPns. Fourth, labeling was correlated with [3H]IP4 binding affinities of C2B domains for the functionally diverse Syt II and Syt III constructs and for the C2A versus C2B domains of Syt II. Fifth, a 32-residue base-rich peptide located in the central region of the C2B domain exhibited high affinity binding to the photoaffinity label when employed in competition with the full-length C2B domain. This observation opens the door to use of peptides in physiological experiments to modulate IPn-receptor binding in a wide variety of systems. Future studies on active site mapping and structure determination of domain-IPn complexes will also be realizable goals given these new data.

Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) during exocytosis. They are a critical part of a complex machinery of intracellular protein transport (5Rothman J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar) and the synaptic vesicle cycle (7SÜdhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In addition to a short N-terminal intravesicular region and single transmembrane domain, Syts have two copies of highly conserved repeats, known as the C2A and C2B domains, which are homologous to the C2 regulatory region of protein kinase C (8Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. SÜdhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In particular, the C2B domain appears to play several roles. First, the C2B domain of mouse Syt II shows specific binding to high polyphosphate inositols (IPns) (9Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a feature that is not shared by the highly homologous C2A domain nor with the C2 domains of other proteins such as rabphilin. Moreover, the C2B domain is necessary but not sufficient for IPn binding. Although Syt II and IV show high affinity binding of IP4 and IP6, the Syt III-C2B domain shows negligible binding, despite a high sequence identity with the Syt II-C2B domain, including the 32-residue region examined by mutational analysis (10Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Inhibition of C2B function in the squid giant axon disrupts synaptic vesicle release and recycling (11Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10708-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly, Caenorhabditis elegans mutants lacking Syt or simply the C2B domain cannot recycle synaptic vesicles (12Jorgensen E.M. Hartweig E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and the presence of Syt I in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients (13Davidsson P. Jahn R. Bergquist J. Ekman R. Blennow K. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1996; 27: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) may provide clues to the disruption of synaptic function in humans. The C2B domain acts as a high affinity receptor for clathrin assembly protein AP-2 (14Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ appears to mediate Syt dimerization via the C2B domain (15Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).Synaptotagmin II isolated from mouse cerebellum shows high affinity binding to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 with a KD of 30 μM (16Niinobe M. Yamaguchi Y. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and 117 nM for the GST-Syt II-C2B construct (9Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curiously, the rank order of IPns binding for native Syt II was Ins(1,3,4,5,6)-P5 > (1,3,4,5)-P4 > Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)-P6 > Ins(1,4,5)-P3, whereas for the GST-Syt II-C2B domain the order was IP6 > IP5 > IP4 > IP3. Deletion mutants allowed mapping of the IPn binding site to the central region of the mouse Syt II-C2B domain, specifically residues 315-346 (IHLMQNGKRLKKKKTTVKKKTLNPYFNESFSF) (9Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to obtain direct evidence for the binding site of IPns in the C2B domain, to examine the InsPn selectivity of the domains, to explore the Ca2+ dependence of binding, to determine the role of the central 315-346 peptide, and to evaluate the reason for the failure of Syt III-C2B domain to bind IPns, we undertook a series of photoaffinity labeling experiments using four tritium-labeled, benzophenone-containing derivatives of IP3, IP4, and IP6 (17Prestwich G.D.

To identify other role(s) of the ELC in myosin function, we have used an alanine scanning mutagenesis approach to convert charged residues in loops I, II, III, and helix G of the Dictyostelium ELC into uncharged alanines. Dictyostelium was used as a host system to study the phenotypic and biochemical consequences associated with the mutations. The ELC carrying loop mutations bound with normal stoichiometry to the myosin heavy chain when expressed in ELC-minus cells. When expressed in wild type cells these mutants competed efficiently with the endogenous ELC for binding, suggesting that the affinity of their interaction with the heavy chain is comparable to that of wild type. However, despite apparently normal association of ELC the cells still exhibited a reduced efficiency to undergo cytokinesis in suspension. Myosin purified from these cells exhibited 4-5-fold reduction in actin-activated ATPase activity and a decrease in motor function as assessed by an in vitro motility assay. These results suggest that the ELC contributes to myosin's enzymatic activity in addition to providing structural support for the α-helical neck region of myosin heavy chain.

These results suggest that the ELC contributes to myosin's enzymatic activity in addition to providing structural support for the α-helical neck region of myosin heavy chain. Myosin is a mechanochemical enzyme that converts the energy of ATP hydrolysis into diverse actin-based cellular movements such as muscle contraction and cytokinesis (1Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 379-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 2Korn E.D. Hammer J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Conventional myosin is composed of two heavy chains (∼200 kDa) and two pairs of light chains (16-20 kDa), the regulatory light chain (RLC) 1The abbreviations used are: RLCregulatory light chainELCessential light chainMHCmyosin heavy chainPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminDAPI4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole-2HClPCRpolymerase chain reaction. and the essential light chain (ELC). Observed under electron microscopy, conventional myosin consists of two globular heads joined to a long rod-like tail. The globular heads contain the nucleotide binding sites and actin binding regions and are sufficient to generate movement (3Toyoshima Y. Kron S. McNally E. Niebling K. Toyoshima C. Spudich J. Nature. 1987; 328: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 4Hynes T. Block S. White B. Spudich J. Cell. 1987; 48: 953-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One copy of each of the light chains associates with myosin head near the head-rod junction, also known as myosin neck (5Winkelmann D.A. Lowey S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 595-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Katoh T. Lowey S. J.

One striking feature of the recently reported crystal structures of myosin is the neck domain, where the light chains arranged in tandem with the ELC more proximal to the head wrap around a 10-nm long, hydrophobic α-helix that extends from the COOH terminus of the myosin head (7Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 8Xie X. Harrison D. Schlichting I. Sweet R. Kalabokis V. Szent-Gyorgyi A. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). An apparent function of light chains is the stabilization of this α-helix. Consistent with this structural analysis, studies have shown that myosins from which the RLCs are removed display collapsed heads (9Flicker P.F. Wallimann T. Vibert P. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 723-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and tend to form head-to-head aggregates (10Pastra-Landis S.C. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14811-14816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16485-16492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Trybus K.

Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), presumably mediated by the exposed hydrophobic neck region. Myosin aggregates also form in vivo when the RLC is eliminated through a targeted gene disruption (14Chen P. Ostrow B. Tafuri S. Chisholm R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1933-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although no abnormal aggregation is observed in ELC-deficient Dictyostelium cells, the loss of RLC during myosin purification suggests that the RLC-MHC interaction has a reduced affinity in the absence of ELC (15Pollenz R. Chen T.-L.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Chen T.-L.L. Kowalczyk P.A. Ho G. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3207-3218PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to protecting the α-helix the light chains are postulated to provide rigidity to the neck which is hypothesized to function as a “lever arm” for generating an effective power stroke (7Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). This lever arm concept is supported by the fact that weakening of the lever arm by removal of one or both light chains causes 60-90% reduction in the velocity with which myosin translocates actin filament in vitro without significantly altering the actin-activated ATPase (13Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Shortening the lever arm 50% by deleting the RLC binding site produces myosin that moves actin at one-half the wild type velocity in the in vitro motility assays without a corresponding drop in the actin-activated ATPase (17Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutant myosin bearing light chain binding domains of varying lengths translocate actin filaments in in vitro assays at rates directly proportional to the length of the postulated lever arm (18Uyeda T. Abramson P. Spudich J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Although the contribution of the RLC to myosin's enzymatic activity has been well studied (19Tan J. Ravid S. Spudich J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), the role of ELC in this respect is less understood. Early experiments showed that skeletal muscle myosin stripped of the ELC does not appear to affect the actin-activated ATPase (20Wagner P.D. Giniger E. Nature. 1981; 292: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Sivaramakrishnan M. Burke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1102-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, generation of ELC-deficient Dictyostelium cell lines by molecular genetic techniques has demonstrated the functional importance of the non-muscle ELC in vivo (15Pollenz R. Chen T.-L.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Chen T.-L.L. Kowalczyk P.A. Ho G. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3207-3218PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of myosin isolated from these ELC-deficient cells does not exhibit significant actin-activated ATPase activity. These data suggest that the ELC is required for actin-activated ATPase activity, but the interpretation is complicated by the apparently decreased stability of the myosin in the absence of the ELC and by a possible effect of ELC on RLC-MHC association (15Pollenz R. Chen T.-L.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Chen T.-L.L. Kowalczyk P.A. Ho G. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3207-3218PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to distinguish other possible role(s) of ELC from its structural function, we set out to screen for mutants that were able to stabilize the myosin neck but failed to exhibit normal myosin function. The clustered charged-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis technique was employed, for it has proven to be an efficient method to survey functional surfaces of a protein (22Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 23Bennett W.F. Paoni N.F. Keyt B.A. Botstein D. Jones A.J.S. Presta L. Wurm F.M. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5191-5201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8923-8931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale for the method is that clusters of charged amino acid residues (i.e. two or more charged residues present in a stretch of five) are likely to occupy exposed positions, and substitution of these residues with alanines is structurally conservative at any residues that are not buried deep in the hydrophobic core and hence unlikely to disrupt the overall conformation of the molecule. The ELC belongs to calmodulin and troponin C gene family and is composed of four helix-loop-helix motifs (26Kretsinger R. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 119-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Of the 14 charged clusters identified in the Dictyostelium ELC sequence, three fall in loop structures, and the others are in helices. To obtain the mutants that are able to stabilize the myosin neck, the surface residues of ELC which do not participate in the binding to the heavy chain were targeted for mutagenesis. The structure of myosin S1 (7Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar) and scallop regulatory domain (8Xie X. Harrison D. Schlichting I. Sweet R. Kalabokis V. Szent-Gyorgyi A. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) shows the loops of the ELC to be solvent exposed. Thus the three charged clusters in loops (I, II, III) of the ELC were targeted for mutagenesis. In addition, a charged cluster in the G helix which is adjacent to the fourth loop was mutagenized. When expressed in Dictyostelium ELC-minus cells, the ELC carrying mutations in loops I, II, III bind to the heavy chain with normal stoichiometry. However, myosin carrying the ELC mutants exhibited decreased actin-activated ATPase activity and decreased motor function as assessed by an in vitro motility assay. Cells expressing the mutants exhibited reduced efficiency in performing cytokinesis in suspension. These results provide biochemical and biological evidence that the ELC is important for normal enzymatic activity in addition to providing a structural support for the α-helix of the myosin neck. A full-length Dictyostelium ELC cDNA (Ref. 27Chisholm R.L. Rushforth A.M. Pollenz R.S. Kuczmarski E.R. Tafuri S.R. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27977-27981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The pairs of primers (5′, 3′) used to introduce mutations include (all sequences are shown 5′ to 3′; mutated sequences are underlined): L1, TTAATGGTAAGGTCTCAGTTG and ATTAAAGATACTGAAACAT; L2, TTTATCAATACATTAAAGAG and AAAAGCATTAATTTCAGTCT; L3, GGCCATGGTACCATTCA and CCGAGGGCTTTGAATGCAT; L4, CCGCTGTTTTATTTAAGGAAATCTC and AACAGCGGTTGATAAGTAA. The primer used to introduce the epitope tag (underlined) to the carboxyl terminus of the L1, L2, and L3 cDNAs is 5′-CCGGATCCTTAGAAACCGCCTAATGGAT-3′ with a BamHI site and 2 extra bases included at the 5′ end for cloning purposes. All polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of random polymerase chain reaction-induced mutations; they were subsequently cloned into the integrating expression vector pBORP (30Ostrow B. Chen P. Chisholm R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) at the BamHI site. Expression constructs were introduced into Dictyostelium AX3 cells or ELC-minus cells by electroporation (31Howard P. Ahern K. Firtel R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2613-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and grown in HL-5 medium containing 10 μg/ml G418 and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Dictyostelium whole cell lysates were prepared as descried by Pollenz et al. (15Pollenz R. Chen T.-L.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Myosin extracted from cytoskeletons was prepared according to Giffard et al. (32Giffard R.G. Spudich J.A. Spudich A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were collected, washed in wash buffer (100 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM N-p-tosyl-arginine-methyl ester, 20 mM benzamidine), and lysed in wash buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The Triton-insoluble pellet (cytoskeletons) was collected and resuspended in wash buffer containing 200 mM KCl and 2 mM ATP. Following centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was recovered, and one-fifth of it was used for analysis. Protein samples were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with myosin polyclonal antiserum NU48. Antibody binding was detected using the Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent (Du Pont NEN). For quantification of stoichiometry of myosin subunits, Western blots of myosin extracts from approximately 2 × 106 cells were scanned using a laser densitometer (LKB). Wild type (JH10) and mutant myosins were purified according to the method described by Uyeda and Spudich (17Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and Ruppel et al. (33Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except cells expressing mutants were seeded from 40 confluent 24-cm plastic dishes into suspension (10 liters) and grown for approximately 40 h before harvesting for purification. Purified myosin was treated with a recombinant Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase (a gift of Drs. J. Smith and J. A. Spudich, Stanford University) as described by Uyeda and Spudich (17Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Myosin activity was assayed within 2 days of purification. Stoichiometry of myosin subunits was also determined by separating the heavy and light chains on 5-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and staining the protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gels were scanned using a Bio-Rad densitometer and the Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Actin-activated ATPase was assayed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM ATP, varying concentrations of actin (0-10 μM), and 50 μg/ml myosin. Ca2+-activated ATPase was assayed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 1 mM ATP, and 50 μg/ml myosin. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, quenched with acid, and the liberated Pi was quantified following organic extraction (34Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4691-4697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The number of myosin active heads was measured using a protocol suggested by Dr. J. R. Sellers (National Institutes of Health). 5 μg of purified myosin (containing 20 pmol of heads) was incubated with 40 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP in 100 μl of actin-ATPase assay buffer (no actin) as above. Following a 20-s incubation at room temperature, 1 mM unlabeled ATP was added to chase the hydrolysis of the labeled ATP. The liberated Pi was extracted after 10 min by the organic partition method as above. In vitro motility assays were performed as described previously (3Toyoshima Y. Kron S. McNally E. Niebling K. Toyoshima C. Spudich J. Nature. 1987; 328: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 36Umemoto S. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Myosin was diluted to 200 μg/ml in buffer AB (25 mM imidazole, pH 7.4, 25 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol), applied to a flow cell coated with nitrocellulose, and blocked with AB containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA (AB/BSA). To remove myosin heads that bound actin in a rigor fashion, a solution of phalloidin-labeled actin was perfused followed by 1 mM ATP in AB/BSA. After washing with AB/BSA to remove the excess nonfluorescent actin, a solution of rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin in AB/BSA was introduced. Active movement was initiated at room temperature by introducing AB/BSA containing 1 mM ATP and oxygen scavenger enzymes. DAPI staining was performed as described previously (15Pollenz R. Chen T.-L.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Charged residues in loops I, II, III, and helix G of Dictyostelium ELC were mutated by the polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis approach. Three or four charged amino acid residues in each mutant were replaced with alanines (Fig. 1). The approximate locations of these charged residues are illustrated on the three-dimensional structure of chicken skeletal muscle myosin S1 head (Fig. 1). When expressed in Dictyostelium ELC-minus cells using the expression vector pBORP (30Ostrow B. Chen P. Chisholm R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the mutant ELCs accumulated to levels similar to the endogenous ELC in wild type cells (Fig. 2A). All mutants bound to the heavy chain as indicated by their ability to copartition with the MHC in ATP-extracted cytoskeletal preparations (Fig. 2A). Based on densitometric analysis of Western blots of these preparations, as well as direct staining of purified protein with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2B), the loop mutants L1, L2, and L3 associated with the heavy chain with 1:1 molar ratio, whereas the helix mutant L4 bound at 0.2 mol/mol heavy chain (Table I).Fig. 2Expression and association of the ELC charge mutants in ELC-minus cells. Panel A, cell lysates of 5 × 105 cells from respective transformants (left) and myosins extracted from Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons of the corresponding transformants (right) were subjected to Western blot analysis. The blots were probed with a myosin polyclonal antibody NU48. wt, wild type.

Open table in a new tab To assess the binding affinity of mutants L1, L2, and L3, they were tagged at the carboxyl terminus by the addition of five amino acid residues (EQKLI) of a myc epitope, which does not affect the ELC-MHC association or myosin function (29Ho G. Chen T.-L.L. Chisholm R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27977-27981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The tagged mutants were expressed in wild type cells using the pBORP vector. A Western blot of the respective cell lysates shows the expression of the mutants that have a larger size than the endogenous ELC (Fig. 3A). Analysis of supernatants from ATP-extracted cytoskeletons indicates that the endogenous and the tagged ELCs copartitioned (Fig. 3B), indicating that both species associated with the MHC. The relative expression levels of the tagged versus endogenous ELCs were 1:1 in cell lysates, and similar ratios were obtained from purified myosin, suggesting that the mutant ELCs have an affinity for the heavy chain similar to that of wild type. Myosin was purified from both wild type and ELC mutant cell lines by a rapid purification method developed by Uyeda and Spudich (17Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and Ruppel et al. (33Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method involves three rounds of salt-dependent assembly and disassembly of myosin filaments. Although we could not purify myosin from ELC-minus cells by this method, myosins carrying the ELC charge mutations were recovered as efficiently as wild type, indicating that they possessed assembly and disassembly properties typical of wild type myosin. The normal 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the three myosin subunits was maintained after purification (Fig. 2B). When assayed for actin-activated ATPase, myosins with L1, L2, and L3 ELCs exhibited a 4-5-fold reduction in the activity compared with wild type (Table II). In contrast, the high salt Ca2+-ATPase, a property that assesses the integrity of the active site, was within the normal range for all three mutants (Table II), suggesting that each of the mutant myosins was capable of nucleotide hydrolysis. Because the actin-activated ATPase was greatly reduced in mutants L1, L2, and L3, it was important to know whether this was due to a significantly increased number of inactive molecules in the mutant myosin preparations. A crude assay was employed to determine the relative number of active heads in each myosin preparation. This assay was performed by incubating myosin with labeled ATP at 1:2 molar concentrations for a time duration short enough to allow each head the chance to hydrolyze a single labeled ATP. The amount of radioactive phosphate liberated therefore provides a crude assessment of the relative number of active heads. As shown in Table II, myosin preparation containing ELC mutants L1, L2, and L3 showed 81, 66, and 118% of the number of active heads of wild type preparations. Thus it is unlikely that the reduced actin-activated ATPase is due to a decreased stability of the mutant myosins but rather is the result of a decreased turnover rate of the enzyme.Table II.Biochemical properties of myosin containing ELC charge mutantsActin-ATPasea,Values were obtained before kinase treatment.bThe actin-ATPase of myosin was measured in the presence of 10 μM actin.

Open table in a new tab Like other non-muscle myosins, the actin-activated ATPase of Dictyostelium myosin is regulated by RLC phosphorylation (39Griffith L.M. Downs S.M. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Myosin purified by the rapid method has a low level of the phosphorylated RLC (33Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When these myosins were treated with a recombinant myosin light chain kinase (40Tan J.L. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16044-16049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the actin-activated ATPase activity of wild type was increased to 163 nmol/min/mg, representing an approximately 3-fold enhancement (Table II and Fig. 4). The activity of the mutants also increased 3-4-fold after phosphorylation (Table I), but the Vmax was reduced greatly relative to wild type (Fig. 4). The kinase treatment resulted in uniformly high levels of RLC phosphorylation in both wild type and mutant myosins (data not shown). Analysis of the Km for actin on kinase-treated myosins yielded similar values between the mutants and wild type (Table II), suggesting that the reduced actin-activated ATPase activity is not due to a decreased affinity for actin. When examined for low salt Mg2+-ATPase, the wild type and mutant myosins exhibited similar basal activities of 6-8 nmol/mg/min. There is a good correlation between the actin-activated ATPase activity and the motor function of myosin as assayed by in vitro motility assays (1Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 379-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). But uncoupling of the two events has been observed in several recent studies (13Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2041464393,"c-Myb is the founder member of a class of transcription factors with tryptophan-rich repeats responsible for DNA binding. Activated oncogenic forms of Myb are encoded by the avian retroviruses, avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and E26. AMV v-Myb encodes a truncated protein with 11 point mutations relative to c-Myb. The mutations in the DNA binding domain (DBD) were reported to impose distinct phenotypes of differentiation on transformed myeloid cells (Introna, M., Golay, J., Frampton, J., Nakano, T., Ness, S. A., and Graf, T. (1990) Cell 63, 1287-1297). The molecular mechanism operating has remained elusive since no change in sequence specificity has been found. We introduced AMV-specific point mutations in the minimal DBD of chicken c-Myb and studied their effect on structure and function of the purified protein. Fluorescence emission spectra and fluorescence quenching experiments showed that the AMV-specific point mutations had a significant effect on the conformation of the DBD, giving rise to a more compact structure, a change that was accompanied by a reduced sensitivity toward cysteine-specific alkylation and oxidation. The DNA binding properties were also altered by the AMV-specific point mutations, leading to protein-DNA complexes with highly reduced stability. This reduction in stability was, however, more severe with certain subtypes of binding sequences than with others. This differential behavior was also observed in an in vivo model system where DBD-VP16 fusions were coexpressed with various reporters. These findings imply that different subsets of Myb-responsive promoters may react differentially toward the AMV-specific mutations, a phenomenon that could contribute to the altered patterns of gene expression induced by the AMV v-Myb relative to wild type c-Myb. c-Myb is the founder member of a class of transcription factors with tryptophan-rich repeats responsible for DNA binding.

These findings imply that different subsets of Myb-responsive promoters may react differentially toward the AMV-specific mutations, a phenomenon that could contribute to the altered patterns of gene expression induced by the AMV v-Myb relative to wild type c-Myb. The expression of the c-myb proto-oncogene is restricted to a limited range of differentiating cell types (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Introna M. Luchetti M. Castellano M. Arsura M. Golay J.

Myb's function is particularly important in early stages of hematopoiesis, where it plays a crucial but poorly defined role in maintaining the proliferative state of immature cells (reviewed in Refs. 3Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2235-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and 4Graf T. Curr. Opion. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

Corbella P. Kioussis D. Marvel J. Weston K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 770-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms producing these phenotypes are poorly understood, in particular when it comes to Myb-regulated target genes with a role in proliferation and differentiation. Candidate target genes have recently been reviewed (2Thompson M.A. Ramsay R.G. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The c-myb gene encodes a 75-kDa sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor with at least three functional domains (2Thompson M.A. Ramsay R.G. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain (DBD) 1The abbreviations used are: DBDDNA binding domainAMVavian myeloblastosis virusMREMyb recognition elementMRE(mim)MRE-mim-1 probewtwild typeNEMN-ethylmaleimide. located near the amino terminus is a highly conserved tryptophan-rich region composed of three imperfect repeats (R1, R2, and R3), each related to the helix-turn-helix motif (11Frampton J.

R3 is a fully folded domain mainly responsible for the sequence-specific recognition of the AAC core in the binding site (13Ogata K. Hojo H. Aimoto S. Nakai T. Nakamura H. Sarai A. Ishii S.

R2 is more flexible and seems to undergo a conformational change upon binding to DNA, possibly to allow the protein to adapt to a range of flanking sequences (15Jamin N. Gabrielsen O.S. Gilles N.

J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). R2 also contains a highly oxidizable cysteine implicated in redox control (16Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). An NMR-derived structure of a mouse R2R3-DNA complex was recently reported (14Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The role attributed to R1 has been a stabilization of the complex through electrostatic interactions (19Dini P.W. Lipsick J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7334-7348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Ording E. Kvåvik W. Bostad A. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J.

A. 1993; 90: 9320-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An acidic transactivation domain is found centrally located in the protein, and a large carboxyl-terminal region appears to have a negative effect on Myb's transactivation and DNA binding functions. A recent report suggested that several subdomains may cooperate to form a functional transactivation domain, implying that the precise borders of this domain remain to be elucidated (22Chen R.H. Fields S. Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1771-1779PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding domain avian myeloblastosis virus Myb recognition element MRE-mim-1 probe wild type N-ethylmaleimide. Distinct mechanisms of oncogenic activation seem to operate in the two isolated avian v-myb-containing retroviruses E26 and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) (reviewed in Refs. 1Introna M. Luchetti M. Castellano M. Arsura M. Golay J. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 113-124PubMed Google Scholar, 4Graf T. Curr. Opion. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, and 5Shen-Ong G.L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 39-52PubMed Google Scholar). Both contain truncated v-myb oncogenes. E26 encodes an amino- and carboxyl-terminally truncated Myb protein that is fused to the v-Ets oncoprotein, while AMV encodes a truncated Myb protein that displays a number of specific amino acid substitutions relative to c-Myb. E26 is able to transform multipotent hematopoietic cells and causes erythroblastosis and a low level of concomitant myeloblastosis in chickens, while AMV transforms myelomonocytic cells and causes acute monoblastic leukemia. The specific point mutations found in AMV v-Myb contribute to the establishment of the specific differentiation phenotype of AMV-transformed cells, probably by affecting sets of differentiation-specific genes. From experiments with hybrid viruses, the critical difference between the E26 and AMV viruses that causes the two distinct transformation phenotypes were mapped to the R2 repeat of the DNA binding domain (23Introna M. Golay J. Frampton J. Nakano T. Ness S.A. Graf T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1287-1297Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The AMV-specific point mutations also contribute to the oncogenic potential of the virus. Dini et al. (24Dini P.W. Eltman J.T. Lipsick J.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that AMV v-myb caused a 10-fold higher frequency of leukemic transformation of primary hematopoietic cells in culture than did a similarly truncated c-myb without the mutations. Mutations in both the DNA binding and the transactivation domains seemed to cooperate in attaining a high transformation frequency (24Dini P.W. Eltman J.T. Lipsick J.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precisely how the AMV-specific point mutations causes such prominent phenotypic effects is poorly understood. Since the DBD of Myb is involved, the most obvious hypothesis would be to expect an altered DNA binding specificity leading to activation of a distinct set of genes. However, binding-site amplification experiments in vitro have not revealed significant differences in sequence recognition between c-Myb and v-Myb (25Weston K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis suggested by some investigators has been that the mutations modify interactions between Myb and other regulatory proteins (see Thompson and Ramsay (2Thompson M.A. Ramsay R.G. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). Indirect support for this hypothesis was the finding that all three amino acid replacements are exposed on the surface of the DNA binding domain as judged from its structure (14Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, so far no direct evidence for this assumption has been reported, and no interacting proteins have been identified. In the present work we have exploited the possibility of significant effects intrinsic to R2. We show that the AMV-specific mutations alter the conformation of the flexible R2-domain and that this change is accompanied by altered DNA binding properties, altered redox sensitivity, and altered transactivation in a model yeast effector-reporter system. We also demonstrate that the quantitative alterations in DNA binding is more severe with some recognition sequences than with others, suggesting that the altered DNA binding properties act differentially and could thus affect subsets of genes differently. The minimal DNA binding domain of the chicken c-Myb protein, R2R3, and two mutant derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli using the T7 system (26Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar), and proteins were purified as described previously (12Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Site-directed in vitro mutagenesis was performed as described elsewhere (12Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Plasmids from positive clones, identified by DNA sequencing, were used directly to transform the E. coli BL21(DE3)LysS strain. The three AMV-specific mutations introduced in R2 were I91N, L106H, and V117D as illustrated in Fig. 1A The R2R3[AMVHD] protein harbored the L106H and V117D mutations, while the R2R3[AMVNHD] protein harbored all three alterations. Mutations were verified by amino acid sequencing of the purified proteins through 32 steps. Automated Edman degradation was performed on a 477A protein sequencer with an on-line 120A phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). DNA binding was monitored by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (28Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), with the modifications described in Gabrielsen et al. (12Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The basic duplex oligonucleotide probe used (Scheme 1) was based on the Myb recognition element (MRE) in the upstream region (site A) of the mim-1 gene (29Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Derived variants with different configurations of Gs in positions 5 and 6 of the MRE consensus sequence were also used (Scheme 2) (30Ording E. Bergholtz S. Brendeford E. Jamin N. Gabrielsen O.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1043-1051PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled duplex oligonucleotides were obtained by end-labeling of a small complementary oligonucleotide “MRE primer” (5′-GGCGCTAAA-3′) using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. After annealing and fill-in, all probes got identical specific activities and therefore directly comparable intensities in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Labeled duplex oligos were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) and azodicarboxylic acid bis(dimethylamide) (both from Sigma, the latter abbreviated as “diamide”) were made fresh from powder dissolved in water. H2O2 was freshly diluted in water from a stock solution (30%, Aldrich). NEM alkylation reactions were stopped by addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 10 mM. H2O2 oxidations were terminated by addition of 0.5 μl of 1 mg/ml catalase. Chymotrypsin solutions were made fresh from powder dissolved in TE-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Purified Myb proteins were diluted in TGEβ100-buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and incubated with protease for 15 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS loading buffer. The samples were heated at 95°C for 2 min and loaded onto a 10-20% gradient polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Fluorescence experiments were performed essentially as described previously (16Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer and a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectroscopy cell of 120 μl were used for the fluorescence experiments. The exitation wavelength was 295 nm, and exitation slit 15 nm. Emission spectra were recorded between 310 and 400 nm with an emission slit of 5 nm, and a scanning speed of 500 nm/min. Each recording was made as an average of three accumulated scans. Samples were prepared from purified proteins in TEβ buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) at a concentration of 2 μM. Fluorescence values were corrected with respect to background fluorescence and the inner filter effect of acrylamide. For denaturation, proteins were incubated with 6 M guanidinium chloride for 15 min at room temperature before recording. The reporter plasmids used are described elsewhere (30Ording E. Bergholtz S. Brendeford E. Jamin N. Gabrielsen O.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1043-1051PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Myb-R2R3[wt] and R2R3[AMVNHD] effector plasmids were derived from the centromeric plasmid pDBD11 (32Bonner J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a yeast centromeric plasmid designed to express DNA binding domains fused to the strong transcriptional activator from the herpes simplex virus VP16 gene under the control of the yeast GAL1 promoter. The insert encoding the R2R3 domains were generated by polymerase chain reaction by which also proper restriction cleavage sites (HindIII and BglII) were generated. A one-step transformation procedure (33Chen D.C. Yang B.C. Kuo T.T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) was used to transform the yeast strain 12S16 (ura3, leu2, arg3) (34Punyammalee B. Crabeel M. Delannoy C. Perbal B. Glansdorff N. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 11-19PubMed Google Scholar) with the different plasmid constructs. Transactivation obtained with R2R3[wt]-VP16 and R2R3[AMVNHD]-VP16 fusion proteins induced by galactose was measured as β-galactosidase units assayed with o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate (35Miller J.H. Experimental and Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). To assess whether the three AMV-specific point mutations in R2 had any effect on the structure of the minimal DNA binding domain of Myb (R2R3), we first studied purified DBDs by fluorescence spectroscopy taking advantage of the high content of tryptophans in these domains conferring intrinsic fluorescent properties to the proteins. Three subdomains were expressed in E. coli and purified, the chicken wild type R2R3 protein (designated R2R3[wt]) and two mutated R2R3-harboring mutations found in R2 of the AMV v-Myb protein. The protein designated R2R3[AMVNHD] harbored all three AMV-specific mutations in R2 (I91N, L106H, and V117D), while R2R3[AMVHD] harbored only the two latter (L106H and V117D). Fig. 1 shows the locations of the introduced mutations relative to secondary structure elements of R2R3 (Fig. 1A) and relative to its three-dimensional structure (Fig. 1B). First we compared the fluorescence emission spectra of the two subdomains in three states, guanidinium chloride-denatured, native, or DNA-bound form, using the spectrum of denatured protein for normalization (Fig. 2). As described previously (16Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the emission maximum of R2R3[wt] was shifted toward a shorter wavelength (340-344 nm) compared to that of the denatured protein (356 nm) due to the folding of the polypeptide. The folding was also accompanied by a large reduction in quantum yield. Addition of DNA lead to a further slight shift in emission maximum (337-339 nm) and also to a further reduction in quantum yield. We have previously presented evidence that a DNA-induced conformational change in R2 contributes significantly to the decreased fluorescence of DNA-bound R2R3[wt] (16Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A comparison of R2R3[wt], R2R3[AMVNHD], and R2R3 [AMVHD] revealed one clear distinction. While little difference was seen between the three proteins in DNA-bound form, R2R3[wt] and the two R2R3[AMV] proteins differed significantly in their free native state. Both R2R3[AMVNHD] and R2R3[AMVHD] gave lower quantum yields than R2R3[wt] (Fig. 2). No difference was observed between the double and triple mutant. The emission spectra of native R2R3[AMVNHD] and R2R3[AMVHD] were closer to the spectrum of the DNA-bound state than the emission spectrum of native R2R3[wt]. This suggested that the AMV-like DNA binding domain might have a more compact structure than its wild type homologue, and that the DNA-induced conformational change in R2R3[AMV] could be more modest than in R2R3[wt]. To obtain more direct evidence for this hypothesis, we performed fluorescence quenching experiments to monitor if the AMV-specific mutations induced any alteration in the average exposure of tryptophans in the R2R3-protein. As seen from the Stern-Volmer plot in Fig. 3, both R2R3[AMVNHD] and R2R3[AMVHD] were quenched significantly less by the neutral quencher acrylamide than R2R3[wt], supporting our hypothesis of a more compact structure in the mutants relative to the wild type protein. After binding to DNA, all three forms showed a similar tryptophan exposure, indicating more similar conformations in the DNA-bound state. Since a purified R3 domain was found to be less quenched than R2R3[wt] (results not shown), the tryptophans in R3 must be less exposed to solvent than the average of all six tryptophans in R2R3[wt]. Hence, the three tryptophans in wild type R2 must be significantly more exposed to solvent than their R3 homologues in order for R2 to make a major contribution to the increased slope of the Stern-Volmer plot of R2R3[wt]. This exposure is then reduced upon some critical mutations in R2, both the AMV-specific mutations studied here and the previously reported C130V mutation (designated C43V in Myrset et al (16Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)). The L106H and V117D mutations made the major contributions to this conformational effect, since no significant differences were detected between the two proteins that differed with respect to the I91N mutation. For this reason, in some experiments below only R2R3[wt] and R2R3[AMVHD] are compared. If the difference in conformation between R2R3[AMVHD] and R2R3[wt] were sufficiently large, the two proteins might be expected to display differences in their proteolytic sensitivity. The two purified proteins were therefore subjected to limited proteolysis by chymotrypsin. This protease was chosen since none of the amino acid replacements in R2R3[AMVHD] should affect the specificity of the enzyme. The band pattern of proteolytic products revealed distinct differences between R2R3[AMVHD] and R2R3[wt] as indicated by arrows in Fig. 4. Both the total number and the positions of specific bands differed. This result strongly suggests that the AMV-specific point mutations in R2 indeed have a specific effect on the conformation of the DNA binding domain. We also asked whether this conformational effect was specific to the AMV mutations or whether the conformation of the wild type protein was particularly sensitive to mutations in R2, such that any mutations in this domain would have a high probability of changing the conformation of R2. We analyzed a total of 15 different point mutations distributed over the entire R2 domain by running emission spectra on purified recombinant proteins and by analyzing their DNA binding activity using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). In the analysis, we found only two classes of mutations. The first class displayed unaltered DNA binding and no change in emission spectra, while the second displayed severely reduced DNA binding accompanied by a significant red shift in λmax as well as increased quantum yield in the emission spectra, suggesting a more open conformation and a defect in attaining the native active state. In no case did we observe spectra resembling the AMV emission spectra with significantly reduced quantum yield relative to the wild type protein. These results suggest that the AMV-derived mutations have a rather specific effect on the structure of the minimal DNA binding domain of Myb. To assess if the altered conformational state in the R2R3[AMV] proteins had any effects on their DNA binding properties, we performed a series of comparative quantitative DNA binding experiments with R2R3[AMVNHD], R2R3[AMVHD] and R2R3[wt] using a sequence derived from the strong A site upstream the mim-1 gene as a binding probe (29Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). A direct analysis of DNA binding using electrophoretic mobility shift assay did not reveal striking differences between the three proteins (Fig. 5A), consistent with previous findings that the same consensus recognition sequence holds for both c-Myb and AMV v-Myb (25Weston K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, a clear difference was observed when the stability of the three protein-DNA complexes were compared. Under the specific conditions used to compare the decays of the complexes, the R2R3[wt]-DNA complex dissociated slowly and a substantial fraction resisted 20 min of competition with excess unlabeled DNA. In contrast, both the R2R3[AMV]-DNA complexes dissociated much more rapidly. After 5 min of competition less remained of the two R2R3[AMV]-DNA complexes than of the R2R3[wt]-DNA complex after 20 min (Fig. 5B). These data indicated that the conformational change induced by the AMV-specific mutations in R2 leads to a considerably reduced stability of the protein DNA complex. To determine the specific to nonspecific binding constant ratios (Ks/Kn) (28Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), specific DNA complexes were titrated with increasing amounts of poly(dI-dC). As seen in Fig. 5C, the R2R3[AMVHD]-DNA complex was titrated at lower concentrations of poly(dI-dC) than the wild type protein. From the data shown a Ks/Kn ratio of 6 × 103 was calculated for the R2R3[AMVHD] protein compared to 6 × 104 for the wild type protein. Assuming that the nonspecific DNA affinity is not affected, the AMV-specific mutations in R2 causes a 10-fold reduction in the specific DNA binding constant. Previous in vitro studies of preferred binding sequences found no evidence for any alteration of sequence specificity as a result of the AMV-specific mutations (25Weston K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that strong MRE sequences with different configurations of guanine bases in the binding site for R2 gave remarkably different levels of transactivation in vivo at low expression levels of c-Myb (30Ording E. Bergholtz S. Brendeford E. Jamin N. Gabrielsen O.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1043-1051PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, corresponding differences between the binding sites variants could be seen only in analyses of protein-DNA complex stabilities. Since this phenomenon is related to the sequence of the half-site recognized by R2, we asked whether the AMV-specific point mutations in R2 had any influence on the relative complex stabilities when bound to different MRE variants. Using three different MRE variants (TAAC, TAAC, TAAC) as binding probes, the stabilities of the complexes formed with R2R3[AMVHD] and R2R3[wt] were compared after competition with an excess of un"

Because of a large number of potential phosphorylation sites, a detailed analysis of normal or abnormal phosphorylation patterns is rather difficult. Therefore, the contribution of individual phosphorylation sites to tau function or dysfunction has largely remained obscure. Phosphorylation-sensitive antibodies appear to be convenient tools to assess the phosphorylation state of tau. Phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro sites are abundant in many cytoskeletal proteins and are very antigenic. Therefore, most antibodies are sensitive to these phosphorylation sites. This has directed much attention to the role of proline-directed tau phosphorylation, although other phosphorylations are clearly also important (7Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Some widely used monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) seem to probe the phosphorylation state of one or at most two Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro sites, inviting the possibility that immunoassays could yield detailed (even quantitative) information about the phosphorylation state of ex vivo tau isolates. The experimental support for such mAb properties stems from site-directed mutagenesis experiments; conversion of single Ser or Thr residues into Ala led to dramatic alterations in immunoreactivity, either before or after phosphorylation in vitro Monoclonal antibodies believed to indicate the phosphorylation state of individual sites are PHF-1, Tau-1, and AT8 (8Biernat J.

Ingram V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). There are several potential complications in such mutagenesis analyses. Conclusions are based on the immunochemical behavior of wild type versus mutant protein in very similar phosphorylation states, i.e. either completely unphosphorylated or fully phosphorylated with any of the available kinases. This may reveal that phosphorylation at a single site is necessary for the immunochemical change, although it may not be sufficient. Different results might be obtained if the phosphorylation states of wild type and mutant were very dissimilar (e.g. seemingly contradictory results regarding the cognate phosphorylation sites of SMI31, depending on the tau kinase used in Refs. 11Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Steiner B. Schröter C. Gustke N. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5383-5388Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar and 12Roder H.M. Eden P.A. Ingram V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another concern is that any mutation of the tau protein might alter the properties of distant domains in an allosteric manner. In that case any change in immunochemical properties could not be ascribed to the phosphorylation site that was mutagenized. To complement existing studies of the relationship between tau phosphorylation and recognition by antibodies we used a correlative approach. The longest recombinant human tau isoform htau40 was phosphorylated to increasing levels with activated forms of ERK2. 32P-Labeled tau populations in various states of phosphorylation were analyzed by quantitative two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. The results from this more direct technique were compared with conclusions derived from generally accepted interpretations of immunochemical data. PK40erk2 was used in this study because forms of ERK2 phosphorylate tau in vitro to the highest stoichiometric level reported to date (14-16 mol of PO4/mol of tau (13Roder H.M. Ingram V.M. J.

This provides an example to investigate the complex interactions of multiple phosphorylations. The longest human 441-amino acid tau isoform was expressed from the htau40 cDNA (gift of Dr. Goedert) in Escherichia coli and purified by heat treatment and Mono S fast protein liquid chromatography as described before (15Roder H.M. Hoffman F.J. Schröder W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PK40erk2 was purified from bovine brain according to previously published procedures and modifications (13Roder H.M. Ingram V.M. J.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 3 μg of recombinant htau40 protein was incubated for 4 h at 37°C with increasing amounts of PK40erk2 ranging from 0.002 to 0.2 μg in 30 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mM Mg2+, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM ATP containing 25 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP. For preparative purposes, 15 μg of htau40 was phosphorylated with 0.2 μg of PK40erk2 under identical conditions. Reactions were terminated with 20 μl of 50 mM EDTA or, in preparation for SDS-PAGE, by boiling with 20 μl of sample buffer. For determination of phosphorylation stoichiometry, samples stopped with EDTA were applied to GF/C glass filters wetted with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 2% sodium pyrophosphate. After extensive washing with trichloroacetic acid and sodium pyrophosphate, 32P incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Aliquots of incubation mixtures stopped with sample buffer were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE (Novex) for Coomassie Blue R-250 staining or Western blotting. Gels were slightly overrun to provide for better separation of mobility isoforms of tau. Tau proteins were excised from the gel and prepared for tryptic digests as described below. For Western blotting, sample aliquots corresponding to 0.1-0.5 μg of tau were transferred overnight at 4°C, 30-50 mA onto nitrocellulose (16Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline, Triton X-100, pH 7.2 (dilution buffer) and incubated for 2-4 h with mAbs Tau-1, 1:5,000; PHF-1, 1:100; and SMI31, 33, and 34 at 1:1,000 each in 5% dry milk/dilution buffer. Blots were stained with alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (1:3,000) with a nitro blue tetrazolium staining kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Tau protein bands excised from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE were washed twice in 0.5 ml of 10% methanol and once each in 0.5 ml of water and 50 mM NH4HCO3. Gel slices were minced with a forceps and incubated overnight at 37°C with 10 μg of bovine trypsin (Sigma, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) in 100 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3. The supernatant was removed, and gel slices were extracted twice for several hours with 200 μl each of 50 mM NH4HCO3. Extraction yield of 32P-peptides was monitored by Cerenkov counting of gel slices and was generally >95%. Combined slice extracts were concentrated by lyophilization to about 100 μl, and 5 μg of fresh trypsin was added for a repeated digest over 6 h. Digests were evaporated to dryness and lyophilized three times with each 200 μl of water. Residues were taken up in 50 μl of peptide electrophoresis buffer (formic acid/acetic acid/water 22:78:900) and evaporated again. Peptides were dissolved in 2 μl of peptide electrophoresis buffer and applied to a 20 × 20-cm cellulose plate (Merck). Peptide maps were developed as described (17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The first dimension was peptide electrophoresis buffer at 1,000 V for 50 min. The second dimension was isobutyric acid/n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/acetic acid/water 1,250:38:96:58:558 (thin layer chromatography buffer) overnight. After drying, plates were scanned in an Ambis radioscanner system for quantitative analysis. Spots of interest were scraped from the plates, extracted twice with 200 μl of peptide electrophoresis buffer, and concentrated to dryness. Residues were treated with 6 N HCl for 90 min at 110°C. After repeated lyophilization with water and with 50 μl of PAA buffer (acetic acid/pyridine/water 50:5:945 (17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar)) samples were taken up in PAA buffer, and aliquots containing comparable amounts of radioactivity (cpm) were loaded on a 20 × 20-cm cellulose plate together with a mix of the three unlabeled phosphoamino acids. Electrophoresis in PAA buffer was at 1,000 V for 50 min. Plates were scanned, and in some cases quantified, in a PhosphorImager (Fujix, BAS 1000). After recovery from the two-dimensional plates, equivalent peptides (as shown in Fig. 2) were pooled for analysis. In duplicate experiments, peptides were recovered from a preparative two-dimensional map (15 μg of tau). Each peptide was redissolved in 50 μl of 10% acetic acid, loaded onto a Hewlett-Packard miniature biphasic column, and washed with 2% trifluoroacetic acid. Sequencing was performed on a Hewlett-Packard G1005A protein sequencer using methods (version 3.0) and reagents of the manufacturer. 32P-Labeled peptides were covalently coupled to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that had been derivatized with arylamine groups (Sequelon-AA; Millipore) in the presence of carbodiimide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were then washed sequentially with 400 μl of water, 1:1 (v/v) methanol/water, methanol, and water again. Sequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer with modified cycles to extract the unconverted anilinothiazolinone amino acid derivatives with neat trifluoroacetic acid followed by 1:1 (v/v) ethyl acetate:n-butylchloride containing 0.01% phosphoric acid. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. After incubation with increasing amounts of the ERK2 form PK40 (13Roder H.M. Ingram V.M. J.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) recombinant tau protein showed a spectrum of changes of conformation (as indicated by gel mobility shifts) and of immunochemical properties. Species with reduced gel mobility became apparent at an average stoichiometry of about 2 mol of PO4/mol of tau, whereas species with maximal mobility shift appeared only at a phosphorylation stoichiometry of ≥ 7 (Fig. 1). All tau species exhibited maximal gel mobility shift at a stoichiometry of 11. Tau was probed with mAbs for epitopes that are eliminated by phosphorylation (Tau-1, SMI33) or induced by phosphorylation (PHF-1, SMI31, SMI34). Phosphopeptide and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that the reactivity of these mAbs with tau is regulated by one or at most two phosphorylation sites: Ser199 and Ser202 for Tau-1 (8Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Schröter C. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Steiner B. Berling B. Meyer H. Mercken M. Vandermeeren A. Goedert M. Mandelkow E.

Ingram V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). The SMI mAbs were raised against neurofilaments but cross-react with tau because of the shared sequence motif Lys-Ser-Pro (18Lee V.M.-Y. Otvos L. Carden M.J. Hollosi M. Dietzschold B. Lazzarini R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1998-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Assuming that the above epitope assignments were correct, the correlation of the gel mobility state of tau with its immunochemical reactivity in Fig. 1 would suggest the following.•Tau species with intermediate gel mobility are already fully phosphorylated at Ser199/Ser202 and Ser235 but not at Ser396 or Ser404 since they barely with any mAb.•Ser235 (SMI33) and Ser199/Ser202 (Tau-1) are only fully phosphorylated at phosphorylation stoichiometries of ≥4 and ≥7, respectively.•Ser396 (or Ser404) phosphorylation is only realized in tau species with the lowest PHF-tau-like gel mobility (PHF-1, SMI31). However, PHF-1 and SMI31 do not show equivalent behavior. The strikingly discrete behavior of SMI31 would indicate the absence of Ser396 phosphorylation below a phosphorylation stoichiometry of 11, whereas PHF-1 indicates phosphorylation of this site already at 7 mol of PO4/mol of tau. To test the validity of these conclusions derived from immunochemical analysis, 32P-labeled mobility isoforms of tau as resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) were separately subjected to tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. The major peptides and their phosphorylation sites were identified. As indicated in Fig. 1, tau species of lowest, intermediate, and highest gel mobility were analyzed. Of particular interest were phosphorylation states where two mobility isoforms coexisted (Fig. 1, 2a/2b, 5a/5b). 32P-Labeled peptides isolated from two-dimensional peptide maps were identified by Edman sequencing. Assignment of phosphorylation sites (Table I) was by a combination of the following criteria.Table I.Assignment of identities and phosphorylation sites for 32P-labeled peptides separated by two-dimensional peptide mapping of htau40 protein phosphorylated by PK40erk2Peptide no.NH2-terminal peptide sequenceaAssignment of underlined residues is tentative; amino acids in parentheses indicate unusually low recovery, presumably due to contaminating sequences.IC0bInitial coupling yield extrapolated back to cycle 0.Phosphoamino acidsPhosphorylation site(s)cUnderlined residues indicate that assignment is based on inference from a combination of the following criteria: relative migration properties, phosphoamino acid analysis, ERK2 consensus sites, abnormal tryptic cleavage.pmol1231TPK—P2.5SerSer2352195—Y—P——P—<1Ser, Thror3adPeptides tend to colocalize on two-dimensional peptide maps.210R—LP(T)PTR8Ser, ThrThr212, Thr217,3bdPeptides tend to colocalize on two-dimensional peptide maps.396SPVVSD—P3Ser4044175——1ThrThr181545ESPL10Thr, (Ser)ePhosphoserine signals are from unidentified contaminant peptides (not reproducibly observed with peptide 5).6210SR(T)PSLPTPPR10Thr7151IA(T)PR11ThrThr1538195SGYS(S)PG—PG—PGSR4SerePhosphoserine signals are from unidentified contaminant peptides (not reproducibly observed with peptide 5)., Thr, Ser202, Thr2059171IPAK—PPA—K1.5Ser, ThrThr17510adPeptides tend to colocalize on two-dimensional peptide maps.171IPAK—PPAPK—PPGE4ThrThr175, Thr18110bdPeptides tend to colocalize on two-dimensional peptide maps.386TDHGAEIVYK—PVVSGDT-PR8.5SerSer396, Ser4041168S—PTAEDV22ThrThr69a Assignment of underlined residues is tentative; amino acids in parentheses indicate unusually low recovery, presumably due to contaminating sequences.b Initial coupling yield extrapolated back to cycle 0.c Underlined residues indicate that assignment is based on inference from a combination of the following criteria: relative migration properties, phosphoamino acid analysis, ERK2 consensus sites, abnormal tryptic cleavage.d Peptides tend to colocalize on two-dimensional peptide maps.e Phosphoserine signals are from unidentified contaminant peptides (not reproducibly observed with peptide 5). Open table in a new tab In some cases criterion 1 did not suggest phosphorylation clearly, possibly due to contamination; however, phosphorylation at the site in question was accepted when all other criteria combined strongly suggested phosphorylation. Superficial examination of the two-dimensional map of high mobility tau species (Fig. 2, panel 2a) showed that most phosphopeptides were already present at some level. Only peptide 10b (Ser396/Ser404 phosphorylation, Table I) was restricted to tau species with at least a partial gel mobility shift (Fig. 2, panel 5a). However, no single phosphorylation site fulfilled all criteria to be solely responsible for any level of gel mobility alteration: (i) exclusive presence in a lower mobility isoform, and (ii) stoichiometric presence in reference to the most prominent peptide 1 (Ser235 phosphorylation). Peptide 1 clearly contained the most preferred site of tau phosphorylation by PK40erk2. According to criteria 1-3, 6, and 7 (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5), Ser235 was assigned as the phosphorylation site. At an average stoichiometry of 2 PO4/mol of tau, Ser235 (Fig. 1) was already phosphorylated maximally (Fig. 6), and it also remained the most highly phosphorylated site of tau up to a stoichiometry of 12. Because of this fortuitous property, peptide 1 served as an internal reference to assess accurately the level of phosphorylation of all other sites. Comparison of immunochemical properties of tau species with their phosphopeptide maps showed that Ser235 phosphorylation (see Fig. 6) and elimination of SMI33 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1) were not correlated. SMI33 reactivity was still strong when Ser235 was already phosphorylated maximally. Elimination of this epitope clearly required phosphorylation at other sites.Fig. 4Amino acid yields from Edman sequencing of phosphorylated tau peptides. 32P-Labeled tryptic peptides 1-11 eluted from two-dimensional maps were directly subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing. Data of peptides with relatively low recovery (peptides 2, 4, and 5) and many tentative assignments are not shown (see Table I). Ser or Thr residues in parentheses indicate that these amino acids are probably either not or only partially derived from the sequence presented, e.g. in peptide 8 the Ser signal in cycle 5 is believed to be derived from a contamination, as Ser was also elevated in cycles 6, 9, 15, and 17, and other evidence supports phosphorylation of Ser199. Rarely, trypsin fragments were a source of contamination, e.g. in peptide 3 a Thr signal in critical cycle 8 was contributed by a trypsin fragment as well as by peptide 3b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Radiosequencing of spots 1 and 3. 32P-Labeled peptides in spots 1 (left panel) and 3 were eluted from two-dimensional maps and directly subjected to Edman degradation. Radioactivity of eluates from each cycle was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. Cycle 0 is a wash cycle. According to indirect criteria, peptide 3a (the minor constituent compared with peptide 3b) should have yielded a signal in cycles 3 and 8. Since the signal at cycle 3 is only 2-fold over background, the expected signal at cycle 8 may have escaped detection because of declining Edman degradation yields.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Relative stoichiometry of tau phosphorylation at specific sites as a function of exposure to increasing amounts of PK40erk2 (amount defined as activity, see Fig. 1).

Because of low recovery, sequence information was sparse, but criteria 1-3 suggested phosphorylation at Ser199 or Ser202, and Thr205, the sites relevant for mAb Tau-1. This assignment was supported further by relationships with triphosphorylated peptide 8, which contained the same phosphorylation sites: a product-precursor relationship evident in some experiments, and the diagonal migration shift (17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) relative to the peptide 8 (criteria 4 and 5). Densitometric analysis of peptides 2 and 8 in Fig. 6 showed that phosphorylation at Ser199 and Ser202 did not reach the theoretical level in reference to Ser235 phosphorylation; maximally only about 40% of the tau species became phosphorylated on both Ser199 and Ser202 and another 25% at either Ser199 or Ser202. Nevertheless, the Tau-1 epitope was abolished completely (Fig. 1), suggesting the involvement of other phosphorylation sites. Peptides 3b and 10b were relevant for the epitopes of PHF-1, SMI 31, and SMI 34. Although 3b colocalized with unrelated peptide 3a (see below), criteria 1-3, 6, and 7 identified it clearly as the Ser404 monophosphorylated peptide cleaved between Lys395 and unphosphorylated Ser396. It is prominent already at low stoichiometry of phosphorylation, in contrast to the exclusively Thr-phosphorylated peptide 3a (Fig. 3). Peptide 10b is the Ser396/Ser404-diphosphorylated homolog of peptide 3b according to criteria 1-3 and 7 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Ser404 phosphorylation is apparently required as a prerequisite for Ser396 phosphorylation (criterion 5), since Ser396 monophosphorylated peptides were not recovered. Criterion 4 is not applicable, since the migration relationship between peptides 3b and 10b is atypical due to trypsin resistance induced by Ser396 phosphorylation. Ser396/Ser404 diphosphorylation occurred only at relatively high tau phosphorylation stoichiometries associated with partial gel mobility shift (Fig. 2). However, it was not coincident with induction of PHF-1, SMI 31, or SMI 34 immunoreactivity which required full gel mobility retardation (Fig. 1). The SMI mAbs required even higher phosphorylation levels of low mobility tau than PHF-1. Phosphorylation of Thr50 (peptide 5), Thr69 (peptide 11), and Thr153 (peptide 7) was deduced from criteria 1-3, except for peptide 5, where sequencing through the inferred site Thr50 was not achieved. Lack of phosphorylation of the ESP motif in peptide 5 is consistent with previous data on ERK consensus sites (20Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thr212 phosphorylation in peptide 3a was identified according to criteria 1-3, 6, and 7. However, assignment of Thr217 phosphorylation in peptide 3a rests on criterion 4 (migration relationship to the homologous peptide 6), since contamination of the sequence data by the more abundant peptide 3b and a trypsin-derived peptide interfered with the interpretation of Edman cycle 8 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). In the homologous peptide 6 Thr212 phosphorylation was suggested by criteria 1-5 and 7 in spite of a weak Thr signal in the relevant Edman cycle (Fig. 4). Thr217 was clearly not phosphorylated since it was recovered in the Edman sequence. Finally, permutations of phosphorylation patterns involving the motif KT175PPAPKT181P complicated the assignment of peptides 4, 9, and 10a. Criterion 7 but not criterion 4 was important for the analysis of the phosphorylation state of this motif, since tryptic cleavage was altered by phosphorylation on each site. Peptide 4, tentatively identified by criteria 1-3 and 7 (Table I), occurred only at low levels of tau phosphorylation (≤3 mol of PO4/mol of tau) and is derived from tau species phosphorylated only at KT181P. At higher levels of tau phosphorylation this peptide was eliminated (Fig. 2; criterion 5) in favor of the Thr175/Thr181-diphosphorylated peptide 10a (criteria 1-3 and 7). Peptide 9 persisted up to the highest levels of phosphorylation (Fig. 2) and represented tau phosphorylation only at KT175P, but not KT181P, by criteria 1-3 and 7. Phosphorylation-dependent monoclonal antibodies are frequently used to assess the phosphorylation state of specific sites of tau from cell cultures or brain. We tested whether immunochemical analysis of tau with several established Ser/Thr-Pro phosphorylation-dependent mAbs reliably reflects the phosphorylation state of specific sites in a background of multiple phosphorylations. For the first time a correlational analysis was used taking advantage of the ability of ERK2 to phosphorylate a higher number of Ser/Thr-Pro sites than any other single tau kinase examined so far. An overview of the findings is provided in Table II.Table II.Summary of relationships between mAb phosphoepitopes and specific phosphorylation sitesPhosphorylation site(s)Stoichiometric phosphorylationPreferenceRelevance for change of mAb reactionmAbNecessarySufficientSer235Yes++++−SMI33Ser199,202/No/++−−Tau-1Thr205no++Ser396/No/Least+−PHF-1Ser404no++−SMI31aWhen PK40 is used as the tau kinase, mutation of Ser396 to Ala alone is sufficient to eliminate SMI31 reactivity (12).

Open table in a new tab Phosphorylation of recombinant tau by the ERK2 form PK40 was not a sequential process, although some sites were preferred. Rather, many sites were phosphorylated concomitantly. Although this does not necessarily predict a similar lack of specificity in biological systems, it fits well into the notion of enormous heterogeneity of tau phosphoisoforms (21Butler M. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and partial phosphorylation of virtually all Ser/Thr-Pro sites in rat fetal tau to varying degrees. 2H. M. Roder and F. J. Hoffman, manuscript in preparation. In spite of this general trend, the motif KS235P was clearly preferred. This site is believed to be recognized in its unphosphorylated state by the neurofilament mAb SMI33 (11Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Steiner B. Schröter C. Gustke N. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5383-5388Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Roder H.M. Eden P.A. Ingram V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In our correlational study, however, complete phosphorylation of Ser235 did not suffice to eliminate the SMI33 epitope. Thus, an unphosphorylated KS235P motif is not necessary for mAb binding, and its phosphorylation may be necessary but not sufficient for epitope elimination. Ser199/Ser202 in conjunction with Thr205, a site previously implied in Tau-1 and AT8 recognition (10Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Cohen P. Vanmechelen E. Vandermeeren M. Cras P. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 22Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Binder L. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Lee G. Neuron. 1988; 1: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), was the second preferred phosphorylation motif of PK40erk2. Nevertheless, both Ser199 and Ser202 remained partially unphosphorylated in some otherwise highly phosphorylated tau species, although the Tau-1 epitope was abolished. Thus, phosphorylation at Ser199/Ser202 is not strictly required for epitope elimination, in contrast to earlier suggestions based on site-directed mutagenesis studies (8Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Schröter C. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Steiner B. Berling B. Meyer H. Mercken M. Vandermeeren A. Goedert M. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1593-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The complex relationship between the Tau-1 epitope and phosphorylation has also been indicated by a study with multiple tau phosphopeptides (23Szendrei G.I. Lee V.M.-Y. Otvos L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The two examples of mAbs with epitopes eliminated by phosphorylation (Tau-1, SMI33) suggest that interpretations of immunochemical data with this kind of antibody are particularly problematic. Conclusions about the phosphorylation state of specific sites could even be qualitatively incorrect. The failure of SMI33 to report reliably the phosphorylation state of the KS235P motif is particularly compelling; this motif is likely to be directly involved in the binding of mAb SMI33 since it is the only shared sequence motif between tau and neurofilaments, the original antigen of the SMI series of mAbs. Monoclonal antibodies SMI31/34 and PHF-1 represent cases where the epitope is induced by phosphorylation. Previous work based on site-directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide studies had defined one or two specific phosphorylation sites as sole determinants of the epitopes (9Otvos L. Feiner L. Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Goedert M. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 11Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Steiner B. Schröter C. Gustke N. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5383-5388Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Roder H.M. Eden P.A. Ingram V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, in this study phosphorylation at those specific sites could be identified in tau species not recognized by these mAbs. The discrepancy was more pronounced with the SMI mAbs than with PHF-1. Hence, phosphorylation at these specific sites may at best be necessary but is not sufficient for epitope formation. However, immunostaining by this type of mAb (epitope induced by phosphorylation) may yield at least qualitatively correct information, since epitope formation has only been observed in conjunction with phosphorylation at the determinant sites. On the other hand, the absence of immunostaining is uninterpretable. Furthermore, a linear relationship between epitope formation and phosphorylation of specific sites should not be assumed. A new phosphorylation-dependent mAb, AP422, has recently been described to report the phosphorylation state of the DS422P motif in tau (24Hasegawa M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Lee V.M.-Y. Ihara Y. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not cdk5 or GSK-3, could induce recombinant tau immunoreactivity with this mAb in vitro However, Ser422 is preceded by an acidic residue and is therefore not necessarily a favored phosphorylation site for ERK2 (20Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our study neither ES46P nor DS422P phosphorylated peptides were recovered, although PK40 was able to induce the AP422 epitope strongly. Thus Ser422 is either only a minor site for ERK2, or phosphorylation at this site occurs only at stoichiometric ratios beyond 12. The precise nature of the relationship between the actual phosphorylation state of tau and the phosphorylation-dependent presentation of epitopes is of importance for the analysis of normal and pathological tau phosphorylation states ex vivo Immunochemical profiles are often used to evaluate potential biological model systems for PHF-tau-like phosphorylation (e.g. the similar immunochemical properties of tau proteins from fetal brains and AD brains has led to the suggestion that similar neuronal phosphorylation environments exist in these two situations). More direct analyses of tau phosphorylation states are often cumbersome and fraught with technical difficulties, depending on the source of the protein. The present study suggests that the relationship between tau phosphorylation and immunochemical properties is sufficiently complex to place some limits on the use of tau as a reporter protein for physiological phosphorylation environments. An additional restriction arises from evidence that phosphorylation at sites other than Ser/Thr-Pro either modulates proline-directed phosphorylation or alters the phosphorylation/epitope relationship (25Blanchard B.J. devi Raghunandan R. Roder H.M. Ingram V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Singh T.J. Haque N. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Singh T.J. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 154: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PHF-like electrophoretic mobility alterations are also not completely unambiguous; tau species with most Ser/Thr-Pro sites only partially phosphorylated can display full retardation in electrophoretic mobility. Consequently, many alternative phosphorylation patterns must exist which translate into maximally reduced electrophoretic mobility. In summary, the analysis of tau as a reporter protein for AD-like phosphorylation events is valuable in providing exclusion criteria for model systems, if carried out carefully. A more detailed understanding of normal and pathological neuronal phosphorylation homeostasis will require a comparative analysis of various cell biological circumstances that fulfill the PHF-tau criteria but also match other criteria, such as biological context or regulatory features of kinases/phosphatases in adult central nervous system neurons.
