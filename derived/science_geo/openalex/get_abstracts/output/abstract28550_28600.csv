https://openalex.org/W2007625577,"We have isolated a cDNA clone, PU.1, that codes for a new tissue-specific DNA binding protein. Analysis of the binding site by methylation interference and DNAase 1 protection revealed that the PU.1 protein recognized a purine-rich sequence, 5'-GAGGAA-3' (PU box). The PU.1 protein was shown to be a transcriptional activator that is expressed in macrophages and B cells. cDNA constructions used to generate proteins lacking portions of either the amino- or carboxy-terminal ends of the PU.1 protein placed the DNA binding domain in the highly basic carboxy-terminal domain of the protein. The amino acid sequence in the binding domain of PU.1 has considerable identity with proteins belonging to the ets oncogene family."
https://openalex.org/W2071534681,"Characteristics of brefeldin A (BFA)-induced redistribution of Golgi proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its relationship to an ER retrieval pathway were investigated. Retrograde movement of Golgi proteins into the ER occurred via long, tubulovesicular processes extending out of the Golgi along microtubules. Microtubule-disrupting agents (i.e., nocodazole), energy poisons, and reduced temperatures inhibited this pathway. In BFA-treated cells Golgi proteins appeared to cycle between the ER and an intermediate compartment marked by a 53 kd protein. Addition of nocodazole disrupted this dynamic cycle by preferentially inhibiting retrograde movement, causing Golgi proteins to accumulate in the intermediate compartment. In the absence of BFA, such an ER cycling pathway appeared to be followed normally by the 53 kd protein but not by Golgi proteins, as revealed by temperature shift experiments. We propose that BFA induces the interaction of the Golgi with an intermediate ""recycling"" compartment that utilizes a microtubule-dependent pathway into the ER."

https://openalex.org/W2009655340,"Results from a longitudinal experiment to curb drug use during junior high indicate that education programs based on a social-influence model can prevent or reduce young adolescents' use of cigarettes and marijuana. This multi-site experiment involved the entire seventh-grade cohort of 30 junior high schools drawn from eight urban, suburban, and rural communities in California and Oregon. Implemented between 1984 and 1986, the curriculum's impact was assessed at 3-, 12-, and 15-month follow-ups. The program, which had positive results for both low- and high-risk students, was equally successful in schools with high and low minority enrollment. However, the program did not help previously confirmed smokers and its effects on adolescent drinking were short-lived."
https://openalex.org/W1525431558,"Using the N18-RE-105 neuroblastoma X retina cell line, we previously described Ca2(+)-dependent quisqualate-type glutamate toxicity caused by the inhibition of high-affinity cystine uptake, leading to glutathione depletion and accumulation of cellular oxidants. We now demonstrate that primary cultures of rat cortical neurons (E17; 24-72 h in culture), but not glia, also degenerate when exposed to culture medium with reduced cystine or containing competitive inhibitors of cystine uptake, including glutamate. At this developmental stage, neurotoxicity did not occur as a consequence of continuous exposure to glutamate receptor subtype agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate, or 2(RS)-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate. However, those that inhibited neuronal cystine uptake--quisqualate, glutamate, homocysteate, beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid, and ibotenate--were neurotoxic. Toxicity related to quisqualate did not correlate with the development of quisqualate-stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover. The toxic potencies of glutamate, quisqualate, and homocysteate were inversely proportional to the concentration of cystine in the medium, suggesting that they competitively inhibit cystine uptake. Autoradiographic analysis of the cellular localization of L-[35S]cystine uptake indicated that embryonic neurons have a high-affinity transport system that is sensitive to quisqualate, whereas non-neuronal cells in the same cultures have a low-affinity system that is insensitive to quisqualate but potently blocked by D-aspartate and glutamate. Exposure to glutamate or homocysteate resulted in a time-dependent depletion of the cellular antioxidant glutathione. The centrally acting antioxidant idebenone and alpha-tocopherol completely blocked the neurotoxicity resulting from glutamate exposure. We propose that competitive inhibition of cystine transport and reduction of extracellular cystine levels result in neuronal cell death due to accumulation of cellular oxidants."
https://openalex.org/W1551702901,"Mammalian cells contain two large proteolytic complexes, the 650-kDa proteasome (or multicatalytic protease) and the 1500-kDa (26 S) Ubiquitin-conjugate-degrading enzyme. Since the proteasome is also required for the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, we tested whether it may be a component of the larger complex. The proteasome normally is soluble in 38% ammonium sulfate. However, after preincubation of reticulocyte extracts with ATP, several proteasome activities appeared in the 38% ammonium sulfate pellet, including the ability to degrade hydrophobic peptides and 14C-casein. Also, following preincubation with ATP, the precipitable fraction could degrade 125I-lysozyme-ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates. The activities were not present after incubation without ATP or with a nonmetabolizable ATP analog. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis indicated the ATP-dependent appearance of a new band which degraded proteasome substrates, and reacted with an anti-proteasome monoclonal antibody on Western blot. This new band appeared larger than the proteasome and migrated similarly to the larger Ub-conjugate-degrading complex. The formation of the larger complex required factor(s) present in the 38% ammonium sulfate pellet and either the 40-80% fraction or the purified proteasome from reticulocytes or muscle. After complex formation, hydrolysis of Ub-protein conjugates and also the non-ubiquitinated substrate, casein, was stimulated severalfold by ATP, but non-metabolizable ATP analogs had little or no effect. Thus, the proteasome corresponds to component CF-3 of Ganoth et al. (Ganoth, D., Leshinisky, E., Eytan, E., and Hershkov, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 263 12412-12419) and undergoes an energy-dependent association with other factors to form the 1500-kDa, ATP-requiring proteolytic complex."
https://openalex.org/W1973663419,"Morphological dynamics and membrane transport within the living Golgi apparatus of astrocytes labeled with NBD-ceramide were imaged using both electronically enhanced fluorescence video and laser confocal microscopy. In time-lapse recordings, continuous tubulovesicular processes are observed to emerge from trans-Golgi elements and extend along microtubules at average rates of 0.4 microns/s. In addition, discrete fluorescent particles are observed to emerge from the trans-Golgi and subsequently migrate along microtubules at comparable velocities. Frequently, tubulovesicular processes form stable connections that interlink adjacent trans-Golgi elements into an extensive reticulum. Laser photobleaching-recovery experiments reveal that tubulovesicular processes can provide direct pathways for the diffusion of membrane lipids between joined trans-Golgi elements. These results suggest that microtubule-based transport and membrane fusion can operate to interconnect certain cisternal membranes of adjacent Golgi elements within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1512201595,"Using localized mutagenesis of whole cells, we have isolated a temperature-sensitive UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase mutant of Escherichia coli that loses all detectable acyltransferase activity and quickly dies after a shift from 30 to 42 degrees C. Acyltransferase activity and temperature resistance are restored by transforming the mutant with a hybrid plasmid containing the E. coli gene for UDP-GlcNAc acyltransferase (lpxA). In addition, a new assay has been developed for quantitating the amount of lipid A (the active component of endotoxin) in E. coli and related Gram-negative strains. Cells are labeled with 32Pi and extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8, v/v) to remove glycerophospholipids. The residue is then hydrolyzed with 0.2 M HCl to liberate the monophosphoryl lipid A degradation products (Qureshi, N., Cotter, R. J. and Takayama, K. (1986) J. Microbiol. Methods 5, 65-77), each of which bears a single phosphate residue at position 4'. The amount of lipid A is normalized to the total amount of labeled glycerophospholipid present in the cells. The steady state ratio of lipid A to glycerophospholipid in wild-type cells is approximately 0.12. The lipid A content of the acyltransferase mutant is reduced 2-3-fold, and the rate of lipid A synthesis is reduced 10-fold when compared to wild-type after 60 min at 42 degrees C. These results provide physiological evidence that UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase is the major committed step for lipid A biosynthesis in E. coli and that lipid A is an essential molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2008585820,"The tat-responsive region (TAR) of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) exhibits a trans-inhibitory effect on translation in vitro by activating the interferon-induced 68-kilodalton protein kinase (p68 kinase). Productive infection by HIV-1 was shown to result in a significant decrease in the amount of cellular p68 kinase. The steady-state amount of p68 kinase was also reduced in interferon-treated HeLa cell lines stably expressing tat, as compared to the amount of the kinase in interferon-treated control HeLa cells. Thus, the potential translational inhibitory effects of the TAR RNA region mediated by activation of p68 kinase may be downregulated by tat during productive HIV-1 infection."

Three open reading frames were assigned to three polypeptides which were expressed from this determinant in Escherichia coli under the control of a phage T7 transcription promoter. When the roles of the polypeptides and open reading frames were analyzed with deletion derivatives of the 2.6-kilobase fragment, the membrane-bound ChrA (401 amino acids) and ChrB (196 amino acids) polypeptides were essential for inducible chromate resistance and reduced accumulation of chromate, while the third open reading frame was not needed."
https://openalex.org/W1531387663,"The Bcl-2 oncogenic protein was synthesized in vitro and shown to post-translationally integrate asymmetrically into microsomal membranes with no requirement for an amino-terminal signal sequence. Instead, a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of Bcl-2 served as an insertion sequence essential for membrane assembly since a Bcl-2 mutant lacking this domain completely lost its ability to associate with microsomal membranes. The data demonstrate that Bcl-2 is tightly associated with the lipid bilayer with the nature of an integral membrane protein. The membrane orientation of Bcl-2 was determined using a protease protection assay, which showed that it is predominantly localized to the cytoplasmic face of membranes. A similar type of membrane processing has been shown for cytochrome b5 and also suggested for the viral oncogenic protein polyoma middle-T antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1496756258,"Transcription factor IIF (TFIIF), a protein factor required for transcription of class II genes, has been purified to near homogeneity. TFIIF is a heterodimer of 30- and 78-kDa polypeptides. Both the 30- and 78-kDa polypeptides were necessary to reconstitute TFIIF activity. TFIIF activity eluted from a gel filtration column with an apparent molecular mass of 220 kDa, suggesting that the native factor exists as a dimer of the heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W1999098901,"It has recently been reported that a precursor of p21ras (pro-p21ras) becomes modified by a metabolite of mevalonic acid prior to conversion to mature p21ras. We have examined the effect of blocking isoprenoid biosynthesis on this process. Fluoromevalonate, which inhibits the conversion of pyrophosphomevalonate to isopentenyl pyrophosphate, blocks the incorporation of radioactive mevalonate into pro-p21ras, demonstrating the mevalonate must be converted to an isoprenoid prior to such incorporation. Starvation of CHO-K1 cells for mevalonic acid by treatment with mevinolin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, or mevalonate deprivation in a mevalonate auxotroph defective in HMG-CoA synthase activity results in the accumulation of pro-p21ras. The precursor, accumulated due to either of these treatments, is converted through an intermediate form to the mature p21ras by incubation of cells with mevalonate. Incubation of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol, the pleiotropic transcriptional down-regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis does not, however, result in the accumulation of pro-p21ras. This result indicates that in contrast to the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells, important regulatory control other than at the level of HMG-CoA reductase is involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis required for protein isoprenylation."

https://openalex.org/W2268036223,"A number of inherited lysosomal diseases are known to result from missorting of lysosomal proteins. Considerable attention has been directed toward an understanding of this sorting pathway, and it has become apparent that different mechanisms are used for the sorting of lysosomal membrane and soluble proteins. Protein sorting to the yeast vacuole/lysosome provides a simple model system to study this process. We have mapped the first sorting signal in a vacuolar membrane protein, repressible alkaline phosphatase, and have shown it to be both necessary and sufficient for vacuolar delivery of this enzyme. The sorting information is confined to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail region of this type II integral membrane protein. The location of this sorting signal provides an explanation for some of the differences observed between membrane and soluble vacuolar protein sorting."
https://openalex.org/W1523527367,"The class III gene transcription factor termed TFIIIC has been extensively purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three polypeptides of 138, 131, and 95 kDa consistently copurified with TFIIIC transcription factor activity. These polypeptides were present in approximately equimolar quantities in all TFIIIC preparations. To determine which, if any, of these polypeptides were involved in TFIIIC activity, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against each of these three polypeptides purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot analyses showed that each of the three antiserum preparations reacted uniquely with the respective polypeptide to which they had been elicited. This lack of cross-reactivity by any of the antiserum preparations suggested that these three polypeptides represented distinct unrelated gene products. Each of the three specific antiserum preparations decreased the mobility of TFIIIC-tDNA complexes in a DNA mobility shift assay. More importantly, all three antiserum preparations directly inhibited the transcription factor activity of TFIIIC. In addition, all three antiserum preparations depleted a solution of TFIIIC transcription factor activity. These results indicated that each of these three polypeptides of Mr = 138,000, 131,000, and 95,000 was a distinct and necessary component of yeast TFIIIC. Immunoblot analyses of immunoaffinity-purified TFIIIC fractions indicated that each of the three antiserum preparations alone could deplete the solution of all three polypeptides. These results suggested that these three polypeptides were tightly associated with one another in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1558589233,"Sodium butyrate arrests the growth of actively proliferating Swiss 3T3 cells. A previous report from our laboratory describes the pattern of expression of a representative group of growth-associated genes following treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with sodium butyrate. The results of this study suggest that sodium butyrate-induced growth arrest involves events which lead to adipocyte differentiation (Toscani, A., Soprano, D.R., and Soprano, K.J. (1988) Oncogene Res. 3, 233-238). However, while sodium butyrate by itself could apparently initiate adipogenesis, it alone was not sufficient to maintain this differentiation state. We now wish to further characterize the role of sodium butyrate in adipocyte differentiation. Subconfluent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with sodium butyrate in combination with other agents known to induce Swiss 3T3 cell adipogenesis (e.g. 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone) and then analyzed at various times thereafter for: (a) the presence of high concentrations of intracellular lipid as detected by microscopic examination of treated cells following staining with lipid-specific dyes and (b) the expression of four genes known to be modulated during the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes (actin, adipsin, lipoprotein lipase, and adipocyte P2). Our results show that sodium butyrate in combination with either insulin or dexamethasone can fully differentiate Swiss 3T3 cells into adipocytes, at least as determined by accumulation of high levels of intracellular lipid. Moreover, the sodium butyrate-mediated process of differentiation can occur in subconfluent, actively proliferating cells. Thus, these experiments describe a new, previously unidentified activity of sodium butyrate and also suggest that this model system may be a useful one to study the relationship between growth arrest and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1486403021,"The photoaffinity compound 8-azido-dATP was used as a probe for the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate-binding site of the large fragment of DNA polymerase I. Azido-dATP specifically modified a saturable binding site within the Klenow fragment, and each of the four natural deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate substrates competed with labeling at this site in proportion to its binding constant, as previously defined by equilibrium dialysis. Analysis of tryptic peptides after azido-dATP modification revealed five major cross-linking products, which apparently arose from five distinct photoadducts formed near Tyr-766."
https://openalex.org/W1680825392,"Using a T7 expression system, large amounts of the human placental c-erbA protein (h-TR beta 1) were expressed. From 1 liter of Escherichia coli culture, approximately 50-100 micrograms of purified h-TR beta 1 were obtained. Analysis of the binding data indicated that the purified h-TR beta 1 binds to 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) with a Ka = 2.8 x 10(9) M-1. It binds to 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyropropionic acid, 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyroacetic acid, D-T3, L-thyroxine (T4), and 3',5',3-triiodo-L-thyronine with 475, 120, 39, 7, and 0.1%, respectively, of the activity of L-T3. This order of binding activity to T3 analogs is similar to that reported for the T3 nuclear receptor identified in tissues or cultured cells. Furthermore, the purified h-TR beta 1 binds to the T3 response element of the rat growth hormone gene. Thus, the purified h-TR beta 1 is active. To identify the hormone binding domain, the purified h-TR beta 1 was affinity labeled with underivatized [3',5'-125I]T4. A partial digestion by trypsin yielded a 125I-labeled 25-kDa fragment which was identified to be the domain Phe240-Asp456 by amino acid sequencing. Thus, the purified h-TR beta 1 appears suitable for other structural and functional studies."

https://openalex.org/W1515509274,"The distance between the phospholipid surface and the active site of membrane-bound meizothrombin, a derivative of prothrombin, was determined directly using fluorescence energy transfer. The active site of prothrombin was exposed after a single cleavage by Echis carinatus protease in the presence of [5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonyl]glutamylglycylarginyl+ ++ (DEGR) chloromethyl ketone to yield DEGR-meizothrombin and thereby minimize secondary proteolysis. When DEGR-meizothrombin was titrated with 80% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylserine vesicles containing octadecylrhodamine, singlet-singlet energy transfer was observed between the donor dyes in the active sites of the membrane-bound proteins and the acceptor dyes at the outer surface of the phospholipid bilayer. This energy transfer required both Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine. Assuming k2 = 2/3, the dependence of the efficiency of energy transfer upon the acceptor density showed that the distance of closest approach between the active site probe and the bilayer surface was 71 +/- 2 A. In the presence of factor Va, the distance was 67 +/- 3 A. These direct measurements show that the active site of meizothrombin is located far above the membrane surface. Also, association of factor Va with meizothrombin on the phospholipid surface appears to cause a slight movement of the meizothrombin protease domain toward the membrane surface. The environment of the dansyl dye covalently attached to the active site of meizothrombin was particularly sensitive to the presence of calcium: addition of Ca2+ ions to metal-free DEGR-meizothrombin reduced the dansyl fluorescence lifetime from 11.7 to 9.0 ns and the dansyl emission intensity by 24%. Hence, the conformation of the active site changed when Ca2+ ions bound to meizothrombin. Since the intensity change was half-maximal at 0.2 mM and was also elicited by the binding of Mg2+ ions, this spectral change correlates with the calcium-dependent conformational change previously observed in fragment 1. We conclude, therefore, that the binding of Ca2+ ions to meizothrombin and, by extension, perhaps to prothrombin, elicits a conformational change that extends beyond the fragment 1 domains into the distant (cf. above) active site or protease domain. The association of factor Va with membrane-bound DEGR-meizothrombin increased both the dansyl emission intensity (by 7%) and polarization. This intensity change and the factor-Va dependent change in energy transfer indicate that the cofactor of the prothrombinase complex functions to modulate the conformation and orientation of both the substrate and the enzyme of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1579710281,"We have used in vitro mutagenesis to synthesize in Escherichia coli a recombinant rabbit skeletal troponin-C (designated as TnC57) in which Cys-98 was replaced with leucine, and Ala-57 in the C-helix of the N-terminal domain was replaced with cysteine. TnC57 labeled with the bifunctional photocross-linker benzophenone-4-maleimide could be photocross-linked with troponin-I in both the binary complex with troponin-I and in the ternary complex with troponin-I and troponin-T. The fluorescence lifetime of TnC57 labeled with the probe N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine decreased from 13.2 +/- 0.1 to 11.8 +/- 0.1 ns when Ca2+ bound to the low affinity triggering sites. Complexation with either troponin-I or both troponin-I and troponin-T resulted in significant increases in this lifetime both in the absence and the presence of Ca2+. In either the binary or the ternary complex, this lifetime increased from 15.5 to 18.0 ns upon Ca2+ binding to the low affinity sites. Complementary acrylamide-quenching studies yielded results that are consistent with the fluorescence lifetime results. Our results show that the C-helix of troponin-C interacts with troponin-I, in confirmation of recent zero-length cross-linking results (Leszyk, J., Grabarek, Z., Gergely, J., and Collins, J.H. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 299-304). Moreover, they are in support of a model (Herzberg, O., Moult, J., and James, M.N.G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2638-2644) in which the binding of Ca2+ to the triggering sites in the N-terminal domain of troponin-C results in the movement of the B- and C-helices away from the central helix, thereby exposing a putative hydrophobic binding site for troponin-I."
https://openalex.org/W1661683749,"A cDNA clone encoding the entire open reading frame of mouse entactin was constructed. This cDNA was inserted into Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus and expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda, Sf9, insect cells. The recombinant entactin was produced in large quantities under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. Amino terminus sequence analysis indicated that the signal peptide in the preprotein was correctly cleaved. Polyclonal antibodies prepared against either the naturally occurring or recombinant entactin cross-reacted with both molecules in the native and denatured states. The recombinant molecule promoted cell attachment and exhibited a calcium- and temperature-dependent self-aggregation. These properties reflect those of the naturally occurring mouse molecule. Although entactin is an extracellular matrix component that is normally exocytosed, the vast majority of the molecules were localized inside the cell by immunoelectron microscopy where the molecules formed insoluble aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1547348613,"Based upon the deduced amino acid sequence of a cDNA (cDNA-H4) that had been proposed to encode the peptide core of an eosinophil and a HL-60 cell secretory granule proteoglycan, a 16-amino acid peptide was synthesized. This peptide was then used to elicit rabbit antibodies for study of the translation and post-translational modification of this gene product in hematopoietic cells. When HL-60 cells were radiolabeled for 2 min with [35S]methionine, a protein that migrated in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel with a Mr of 20,000 was immunoprecipitated with the IgG fraction of the anti-peptide serum. Kinetic experiments revealed that within 10 min this radiolabeled precursor protein was converted in HL-60 cells into an Mr approximately 150,000 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan intermediate. After a 20-min to 1-h chase, this [35S]methionine- or [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycan intermediate lost its antigenicity, presumably due to proteolysis of its N terminus. A human genomic library was probed under conditions of high stringency with cDNA-H4 to isolate genomic clones that contain the gene that encodes this proteoglycan peptide core. This gene spans approximately 15 kilobases and consists of three exons. The first exon encodes the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA transcript, as well as the entire 27-amino acid signal peptide of the translated molecule. The second exon encodes a 49-amino acid region of the peptide core, predicted to be the N terminus of the molecule after its proteolytic processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The third exon encodes the remainder of the molecule, including its glycosaminoglycan attachment, serine-glycine repeat region. As assessed by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis, the transcription-initiation site in HL-60 cells for this gene resides 53 base pairs upstream from the translation-initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W1543180486,"The relationship between growth- and sterol-related regulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene expression was examined in human skin fibroblasts. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and high density lipoprotein (HDL3) each produced increased cellular LDL protein and mRNA levels. However, HDL, when added with PDGF or insulin produced no additional effect. Coincubations with 25-hydroxycholesterol markedly attenuated fibroblast LDL receptor protein and mRNA response to growth activation. Acute transfection experiments using sterol-responsive elements of the LDL receptor gene indicated that these elements are also responsive to growth activation with PDGF. These data indicate that alteration of cellular sterol balance or metabolism leading to release of end product repression contributes to growth-related stimulation of LDL receptor gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1490489925,"A fluorescence-based method using the cell sorter has been devised to separate rat lung fibroblasts into subpopulations. Type I or type III collagen antiserum was used as the primary antibody to react with parent rat lung fibroblasts. This was followed by a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. Specificity of the primary collagen antibody was determined using a monoclonal beta-actin antibody and purified IgG as the primary antibodies. The fluorescent shift of parent rat lung fibroblasts was optimized for the amount of primary collagen antibody and secondary fluorescein-conjugated antibody. An increase in slot blot intensity was observed for pro-alpha 1(I), pro-alpha 2(I), and pro-alpha 1(III) mRNAs with increasing amounts of cellular RNA. When precipitating with type I collagen antibodies, the total cellular steady-state levels of type I procollagen mRNAs were increased in the high intensity cells as compared with the low intensity cells. Alternately, when the type III collagen antibodies were used to precipitate the rat lung fibroblasts, the low intensity cells had increased type I procollagen mRNAs while the high intensity cells had increased type III procollagen mRNA. The subpopulations of rat lung fibroblasts after isolation using the fluorescent cell sorter were readily propagated for at least four passages."
https://openalex.org/W1597303777,"125I-Labeled N-bromoacetyl derivatives of L-thyroxine and L-triiodothyronine were used as alkylating affinity labels to identify rat liver and kidney microsomal membrane proteins which specifically bind thyroid hormones. Affinity label incorporation was analyzed by ethanol precipitation and individual affinity labeled proteins were identified by autoradiography after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Six to eight membrane proteins ranging in size from 17 to 84 kDa were affinity labeled by both bromoacetyl-L-thyroxine (BrAcT4) and bromoacetyl-L-triiodothyronine (BrAcT3). Affinity labeling was time- and temperature-dependent, and both reduced dithiols and detergents increased affinity labeling, predominantly in a 27-kDa protein(s). Up to 80% of the affinity label was associated with a 27-kDa protein (p27) under optimal conditions. Affinity labeling of p27 by 0.4 nM BrAc[125I]L-T4 was blocked by 0.1 microM of the alkylating ligands BrAcT4, BrAcT3, or 100 microM iodoacetate, by 10 microM concentrations of the non-alkylating, reversible ligands N-acetyl-L-thyroxine, 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine, 3,5-diiodosalicylate, and EMD 21388, a T4-antagonistic flavonoid. Neither 10 microM L-T4, nor 10 microM N-acetyltriiodothyronine or 10 microM L-triiodothyronine blocked affinity labeling of p27 or other affinity labeled bands. Affinity labeling of a 17-kDa band was partially inhibited by excess of the alkylating ligands BrAcT4, BrAcT3, and iodoacetate, but labeling of other minor bands was not blocked by excess of the competitors. BrAc[125I]T4 yielded higher affinity label incorporation than BrAc[125I]T3, although similar banding patterns were observed, except that BrAcT3 affinity labeled more intensely a 58,000-Da band in liver and a 53,000-55,000-Da band in kidney. The pattern of other affinity labeled proteins with p27 as the predominant band was similar in liver and kidney. Peptide mapping of affinity labeled p27 and p55 bands by chemical cleavage and protease fragmentation revealed no common bands excluding that p27 is a degradation product of p55. These data indicate that N-bromoacetyl derivatives of T4 and T3 affinity label a limited but similar constellation of membrane proteins with BrAcT4 incorporation greater than that of BrAcT3. One membrane protein (p27) of low abundance (2-5 pmol/mg microsomal protein) with a reactive sulfhydryl group is selectively labeled under conditions identical to those used to measure thyroid hormone 5'-deiodination. Only p27 showed differential affinity labeling in the presence of noncovalently bound inhibitors or substrates on 5'-deiodinase suggesting that p27 is likely to be a component of type I 5'-deiodinase in rat liver and kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1516828376,"A phage T4 genetic cluster that encodes DNA polymerase, several other DNA replication proteins, transcriptional factors, and the translation repressor RegA has been shown to be controlled by overlapping modes of transcription which initiate at several promoters. The promoters were mapped by using a combination of assays including Northern blotting, S1-mapping, RNA sequencing, and analysis of products of radioactive labeling of 5' ends on T4-induced RNA in vitro via the reaction catalyzed by eukaryotic guanylyl transferase (RNA capping assay). The most proximal in the cluster are two promoters that do not require any phage-induced factors for activation, i.e. they are T4 early promoters. Initiation at these promoters yields several RNA species having overlapping 5'-terminal sequences, the largest of which is estimated to be about 15,000 nucleotides long and to include all the cistrons of the cluster. A third early promoter maps inside the protein encoding segment of one of the cistrons (T4 gene 47), while at least five additional promoters map in intercistronic regions and are T4 middle promoters, i.e. they require the T4-induced DNA-binding transcription factor MotA. Transcriptional readthrough at a termination site within the T4 gene 45-44 intercistronic region is required for synthesis of gp44 and gp62, two essential T4 DNA-polymerase (gp43) accessory proteins. In contrast, transcription of T4 gene 43 is serviced by readthrough across a termination site in the regA-43 intercistronic region as well as by a MotA-dependent promoter that maps downstream of the termination site, and the region contains a site for processing by a T4-induced enzyme that also cleaves elsewhere in the polycistronic mRNA from the cluster (i.e. in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the gene 45.2 mRNA). The termination events in the gene 45-44 and regA-43 intercistronic regions both occur downstream of RNA stem-loop structures containing the sequence 5'CUUCGG3' in the loop segments. Transcription termination in the 78-base-pair regA-43 intercistronic region occurs about 60 nucleotides away from the gp43 initiator AUG, transcription initiation occurs at 38-40 nucleotides upstream from the AUG, and T4-dependent RNA processing occurs at several sites (including a GGAG sequence) between the transcription termination and initiation sites. Thus, all gp43-encoding mRNAs contain the translational operator (residues -40 to -1 relative to the AUG) for autogenous repression by this DNA polymerase (Andrake et al., 1988).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1519521212,"Murine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) is a Mr 28,000 secreted glycoprotein. The nucleotide sequence has been determined previously, and evidence for a multiplicity of TIMP transcripts presented. The longest TIMP transcript contains a small open reading frame (ORF) which is upstream of and overlaps the TIMP ORF, whereas the shorter inducible transcripts lack the AUG start codon of the upstream putative ORF. Serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts selectively enhances the abundance of the shorter transcripts (Edwards, D. R., Waterhouse, P., Holman, M. L., and Denhardt, D. T. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 8863-8878). Here we have used an in vitro transcription/translation system to determine the effect of the upstream region on the efficiency of TIMP translation. TIMP transcripts either containing or lacking a segment including the AUG of the 5' ORF were generated by SP6 polymerase, and equal amounts of these transcripts were translated in reticulocyte lysates. TIMP synthesized in vitro was immunoprecipitable by an antiserum raised against a recombinant TIMP protein. TIMP was translated 3-fold more efficiently from the 5'-truncated transcript, consistent with the possibility that induction of shorter, more efficiently translated, TIMP transcripts are an important means of amplifying TIMP expression in response to serum."
https://openalex.org/W1494139091,"Renin is produced from an inactive precursor, prorenin, through proteolytic cleavage at paired basic amino acid residues. In this study, an enzyme which specifically cleaves mouse Ren 2 prorenin at the paired basic residues has been purified from mouse submandibular gland by CM-Toyopearl chromatography, antipain-Sepharose chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. This enzyme, named prorenin converting enzyme, consists of two polypeptide chains of 17 and 10 kDa. The enzyme has an isoelectric point of 9.5-9.8, and its pH optimum is between 7.5 and 8.5. It specifically cleaves the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of the Arg at the Lys-Arg pair of mouse Ren 2 prorenin to yield mature renin but does not cleave mouse Ren 1 and human prorenins. Studies on the effects of inhibitors indicate that this enzyme is a serine protease that differs from the enzymes processing other prohormones at paired basic amino acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W1544596892,"The effect of temperature on the rate constants of hydrolysis of various substrates by penicillopepsin is dependent on the length of the substrate. For the series Ac-(Ala)m-Lys-Nph-(Ala)n-amide (where Ac- is acetyl- and Nph- is p-nitrophenylalanyl-), where m and n = 0-2, substrates lacking both P'2 and P3 residues give linear Arrhenius plots with an energy of activation of about 55 kJ.mol-1. The Arrhenius plots of substrates in which an alanine residue occupies P'2 show a sharp break at an average transition temperature of 10.5 degrees C. The activation energies are approximately 90 kJ.mol-1 below and approximately 54 kJ.mol-1 above the transition temperature, respectively. For substrates in which P3 is occupied, the average transition temperature is 14.2 degrees C. In this case, the activation energies are 66 kJ.mol-1 below and from 26 to 39 kJ.mol-1 above the transition point. The most probable explanation of these phenomena is that substrate interaction at subsites S3 and/or S'2 of the enzyme induces a temperature-dependent conformational change. Physical evidence for this comes from the observation that the temperature dependence of a CD absorption band at 242 nm of a penicillopepsin-pepstatin complex shows a sharp break that corresponds to those observed in the Arrhenius plots of substrates with alanine at P'2 and P3, whereas the same CD band in the free enzyme is linearly dependent on temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1635784730,"The complete amino acid sequence of bovine osteoinductive factor (OIF) was determined by automated Edman degradation of S-pyridylethylated bovine OIF and selected fragments. Cleavage with endoproteinase Lys-C, endoproteinase Glu-C, or endoproteinase Asp-N established all fragments in an unambiguous sequence. Bovine OIF contains 105 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 12,055. It is a single chain polypeptide containing two intramolecularly linked cysteines at residues 62 and 95. Two asparagine-linked glycosylation sites at positions 52 and 65 were found by comparing sequence data and peptide profiles of native and deglycosylated OIF fragments. The amino acid sequence of OIF has no homology to other reported proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1574903109,"We studied human dermal fibroblasts transfected with a human c-sis cDNA (coding for the platelet-derived growth factor B-chain). Dermal fibroblasts overexpressing c-sis exhibited a stellate morphology with focus formation, enhanced colony formation in methylcellulose-containing growth medium, and increased levels of soluble and extracellular matrix-associated fibronectin. Gene expression of fibronectin was enhanced 10-fold in c-sis-overexpressing fibroblasts relative to controls. Pro-alpha 1 (I) collagen mRNA was not increased in these same c-sis-overexpressing fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor beta 1 treatment of c-sis-transfected cells caused a modest increase (77%) in fibronectin mRNA levels with no increase in soluble fibronectin production after 24 h. In contrast, transforming growth factor beta 1 caused at least a 10-fold increase in fibronectin mRNA and a 2-fold increase in soluble fibronectin from medium conditioned by control fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor beta 1 increased pro-alpha 1 (I) collagen mRNA approximately 3-fold in both control and c-sis-transfected fibroblasts. These studies reveal that a primary biological function of the platelet-derived growth factor B-chain is upregulation of fibronectin gene expression and extracellular matrix formation. The anchorage-independent phenotype of c-sis-overexpressing cells was blocked by the cell adhesion sequence of fibronectin, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser. Our results demonstrate that interaction of cells with extracellular adhesion receptors is necessary for proliferation in semisolid medium even when cells are overproducing growth factors known to act via autocrine stimulation."

Although lipoxygenase pathways are well documented in terrestrial plants, this lipoxygenase product has never been isolated from the plant kingdom. Herein, we report the first isolation of this lipoxygenase product, hepoxilin B3, from two plants, the tropical red marine algae Platysiphonia miniata (C. Agardh) Borgesen and Cottoniella filamentosa Borgesen. Furthermore, through application of two-dimensional NMR methodology to the structural description of this algal natural product, we demonstrate the tremendous power of this technique in this chemical class."
https://openalex.org/W1524935646,"Acetyldithio-CoA has been shown to be a competent nucleophilic substrate but not an electrophilic substrate for the Claisen condensation catalyzed by thiolase, which normally dimerizes acetyl (Ac)-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA. Acting as the nucleophile, the kcat/Km for dithioacetyl-CoA is comparable to that of Ac-CoA, the normal substrate. With acetoacetyl-pantetheine acetylating the thiolase to provide the electrophile, the kcat and kcat/Km for the Claisen condensation are 2.1 s-1 and 8.3 X 10(4) M-1 s-1, respectively. The product of the reaction is 3-ketobutyryldithio-CoA. The 3-ketobutyryldithio-CoA has a spectrally determined pKa of 6.55 and the enolate has a lambda max of 357 nm, epsilon 357 = 21,000 cm-1 M-1. Product analysis indicates that acetyldithio-CoA does not serve as the electrophilic partner in the enzymic condensation. This failure is attributed to the inability demonstrated in this study of acetyldithio-CoA to thioacetylate the active site Cys89 of the Zoogloea ramigera thiolase. 1H NMR studies in D2O indicate that thiolase catalyzes the exchange of the alpha-hydrogens, without Cys89 being acetylated, with a rate of 0.63 +/- 0.25 s-1. In the presence of a large excess of acetoacetyl-pantetheine, present to acetylate Cys89 and prevent the thiolytic back reaction, solvent exchange of the alpha-hydrogens can still be detected by observing the isotope-shifted 13C NMR spectrum of [2-13C]acetyldithio-CoA. The exchange of the acetyldithio-CoA alpha-hydrogens with solvent promoted by the acetylated enzyme, must proceed at a rate comparable to that of the condensation reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1499894587,"The gene for the ribosomal L12 protein from the archaebacterium Methanococcus vannielii was cloned into the expression vector pKK223-3. The protein was overexpressed and remained stable in Escherichia coli XL1 cells. Purification yielded a protein with the same amino acid composition and sequence as in Methanococcus but it was acetylated at the N terminus as in the case with the homologous protein of E. coli. The in vivo incorporation of the overexpressed protein into the E. coli ribosomes was not observed. The overexpressed M. vannielii protein MvaL12e was incorporated into halobacterial ribosomes, thereby displacing the corresponding halobacterial L12 protein. Intact 70 S ribosomes were reconstituted from halobacterial 50 S subunits carrying the MvaL12e protein. These ribosomes were as active as native halobacterial ribosomes in a poly(U) assay. On the other hand, our attempts to incorporate L12 proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus and E. coli into halobacterial ribosomes were not successful. These results support the conclusion which is based on primary sequence and predicted secondary structure comparisons that there exist two distinct L12 protein families, namely the eubacterial L12 protein family and the eukaryotic/archaebacterial L12 protein family."
